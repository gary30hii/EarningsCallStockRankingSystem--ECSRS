And on March 23, Bob Holycross will speak about clean technology at JP Morgan\u2019s Global ESG conference. Lastly, we continue to target late spring for our Capital Markets Day and we\u2019ll provide more details on that later. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Jim Farley. Jim?\nJim Farley : Thank you, Lynn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Last year was like no other, with COVID dramatically and often tragically affecting all of us. But tough times can bring out the best in people. And boy, was that true at Ford? I\u2019m really proud of how our people mobilized with speed and resolve to respond to this crisis. We harnessed our capabilities and we developed a lot of new ones. Our team members put others above themselves in both returning to work, but also to make life-saving equipment. And I\u2019d like to share just a few highlights of our pandemic response, including our new Finish Strong initiative to help limit the spread of the virus and save as many lives as possible until this pandemic is under control. To-date, Ford has manufactured 55 million medical-grade masks. And by mid-year, we will have donated 100 million masks. In partnership with UAW, we\u2019ve also produced 20 million face shields, 50,000 patient ventilators, more than 32,000 powered respirators in collaboration with 3M and 1.4 million washable isolation gowns. More to the point of today\u2019s call, we relied on the same grit and resourcefulness to deliver a very strong year financially under difficult circumstances. We improved our execution, while putting in place a specific and compelling plan, backed by some important early actions that are transforming Ford into a far stronger company, a company that competes and wins on behalf of our customers and other stakeholders in this exciting new landscape, which will be defined by electrification and connected customer experiences. After safely and smoothly restarting our manufacturing production in May, following last year\u2019s shutdown, we sharply rebounded in the second half of the year as we rebuilt our inventories to meet strong pent-up demand. In fact, we more than doubled our second half adjusted EBIT from the year before, yielding a 7.3% adjusted EBIT margin. In the fourth quarter, we successfully launched three incredibly important vehicles that exemplify our new Ford and our direction. Our first all-electric Mustang Mach-E, which we and more importantly others believe is the first credible mass-marketed competitor to Tesla; and the F-150, the 2021 F-150, America\u2019s favorite vehicle, it\u2019s now connected, you can sleep in it, you can work in it, it\u2019s incredibly capable and it is such a fantastic product; and the Bronco Sport, the first member of our reimagined legendary Bronco brand, which has generated as much excitement as anything to come out of Detroit in my career. Now, as we recap last year\u2019s results and discuss expectations for this year and beyond, I want to underscore that everything we do is in service of our plan. Simply put, we\u2019re seeing real improvements in our core automotive business and we are laser-focused on further progress this year. Now, this includes growing the company, generating consistently strong free cash flow for our core automotive business as well as Ford Credit. We will allocate that capital to its best and highest uses for creating sustained value. To achieve that, we are competing like a challenger now, earning customers and must-have products and services and rewarding customer experiences. We\u2019re moving with urgency to deliver leading quality, reducing our costs and restructuring underperforming businesses. We will start to grow again, but most importantly in the right areas, allocating more capital, resources and talent to take advantage of our strength in pickups, commercial vehicles and utilities, being a leader in the electric vehicle revolution around the world, where we have strength, but also where we have scale, expanding our leading commercial vehicle business with a suite of software services that earns loyalty and generates reoccurring revenue, and incubating, then scaling, then integrating new businesses, some of them enabled by Argo AI\u2019s world-class self-driving system. Today, I\u2019ll touch on a few of our plan highlights, with emphasis on capital allocation, electrification and connectivity. Back in 2017, vehicle lines had accounted for just 60% of our Company\u2019s revenue, generated a 150% of our EBIT and most of the vehicles generating that EBIT earned a multiple of the cost of capital. This imbalance was simply not sustainable and we immediately began reshaping and rebalancing our business. We allocated capital to our strengths. We jettisoned underperforming assets. We created a more focused portfolio, and built the financial flexibility to unleash significant untapped value at Ford. We\u2019ve already made a tremendous progress. Through last year, we\u2019ve invested $7.1 billion in EBIT and $1.6 billion in cash in our global redesign, reshaping our portfolio, our geographic footprint and our industry footprint. In the first phase of our redesign in Europe, for example, we prioritized profitable growth in commercial vehicles, where Ford is the number one vehicle brand in the region, but also a smaller, more targeted portfolio of passenger cars in the strongest segments, and exciting imports like Mustang and Edge that built our brand and make a solid return. We shrunk our manufacturing footprint in Europe, we reduced regional headcount by 20%, we lowered our annual structural cost by $1.1 billion through last year. And in the fourth quarter, Europe delivered its strongest quarterly profit in more than four years, achieving an EBIT margin of 5.8%. Let\u2019s turn to South America. We\u2019ve lost more than $4.5 billion over the last decade in South America, not acceptable. In 2020, we exited our non-core heavy truck business in the region. We discontinued Focus and Fiesta. And we further reduced headcount, in fact, by more than 40% through the end of last year. And with these actions, last year we posted the smallest loss in South America since 2013. And then in early January, we went further as Ford Brazil announced it would end production and close three facilities. That decision will de-risk our business by concentrating it on a more profitable asset-light model on our industry-leading Ranger pickup trucks, our Transit commercial vehicles and key imports. We remain committed to serving our customers in Brazil and South America, but now with the portfolio of exciting, connected and increasingly electrified SUVs, pickups, including this amazing new Ranger, and commercial vehicles sourced from Argentina and Uruguay and other markets. Now, we didn\u2019t take these actions lightly, and Ford is working with all of our stakeholders in Brazil to mitigate the impacts of these decisions. At the same time, we know they were right and necessary and we are optimistic about our new business model for South America. Now before John walks through the last year\u2019s results and how we see 2021, I want to update you on Ford\u2019s connectivity and electrification plans. 2021 is a strategic inflection point for Ford. We have hundreds of thousands of fully networked vehicles now in the field. And now, we\u2019re seeing the evolving institutional capability inside Ford to leverage that data streaming off those vehicles and also use our over-the-air updates to improve quality and revolutionize the Ford customer experience. And importantly, that means commercial vehicles too and customers. We have more than 100,000 subscribers to our telematics and commercial vehicle software business, we call Ford Commercial Services, and we are just starting. Ford\u2019s development and delivery of connected vehicles will be enhanced by a new six-year partnership with Google that we announced earlier this week. The two companies are establishing a collaborative group that we call Team Upshift to not only unlock personal consumer experiences, but to create and make the most of data-driven opportunities in our industrial system. The partnership will greatly enhance the Ford team\u2019s ability to innovate and deliver a consistent world-class consumer experience and as well provide Ford with a powerful technology and tools to modernize our manufacturing, our supply chain management and speed of our implementation of the data-driven business models and innovation across our whole company. Now, as I said a few minutes ago and many times before, Ford will be a leader in electric vehicle revolution around the world. We will do this in areas where we have strength and great scale. It\u2019s early in the transition, but the trend is clear. We watched one out of 10 vehicles sold in Europe in December be pure electric. EV sales in China continue to grow and the reality is the customers, including in the US, are increasingly giving E-mobility greater consideration. We have no intention to cede ground to others in vehicle segments, where Ford is the established leader. We are rapidly building on our electric vehicle plans and building out our manufacturing and our R&D capabilities. We\u2019re also increasing financial flexibility, so we can accelerate and flex to keep pace with the evolving EV needs of our customers. Now, the Mustang Mach-E, our first dedicated BEV platform, which last month was named North America Utility of the Year embodies how we lead in electric vehicles. It\u2019s on sale now, it has stunning design, is fully connected and ready for the over-the-air updates with a tremendous technology experience. It\u2019s delivering high-quality exceptional performance at a price in the mid-30s. It\u2019s a fantastic vehicle, which also happens to be a full battery electric, and there are many more dedicated BEVs like this one that are coming. As you know, Ford is a global leader in commercial vehicles and we\u2019re on the leading edge of the electric revolution there too. We are the first company to announce plans for an all-electric van and an all-electric pickup truck. With the E-Transit coming later this year, it has three different lengths, three different heights, we have a van, a strip chassis and a cutaway and there\u2019s more coming on E-Transit. And then we\u2019re going to launch the BEV F-150 in the middle part of next year. In a recent study by Cox Automotive, we -- they showed that the all-electric F-150 was the highest consideration rate and is the most appealing among major EV pickups that are coming to the market. Our successful Ford Transit franchise is a critical pillar of our electrification plan. We understand the needs of these customers, we\u2019re going to offer a wide variety of configurations dimension and we are developing not just the vehicles, but a whole suite of connected vehicles to serve them -- connected services. For instance, we know from our leadership position that the average daily route driven in a transit is 74 miles, and they do not overbuy batteries. We\u2019ve validated that with over 30 million miles of telemetry data from our Ford customers. Now with that data, we can forecast and optimize the battery life and provide over-the-air alerts, so when the vehicle needs service before anything fails for a 100% uptime, we can do that. That van stays on the road, working, where it belongs. Those are just two of dozens of examples of how we\u2019re employing and using data to help our commercial customers be safe and more efficient and to make more money, while at the same time creating an incredibly competitive advantage for Ford. The value proposition for our customers extends to customizing vehicles\u2019 interiors, digital experiences, E-service networks to maximize uptime and lower their operating cost. These are very sticky annuity-like capabilities that remove pain-points and create opportunities for our customers. No commercial vehicle provider is better positioned than Ford to innovate and introduce services like these at scale. We are accelerating our plans right now, breaking constraints, increasing battery capacity, improving our costs and getting more battery electrics into our cycle plan. We are now planned to invest at least $22 billion in electrification in the next few years through 2025. And that\u2019s just electrification. When you include the spending on our autonomous driving, our total commitment is at least $29 billion. The majority of our investment in electrification supports a widening portfolio of BEVs on platforms from both Ford and alliance partners. This electrification number does not even include the potential, of course, for vertical integration of battery production whether alone or in a JV. As the size of our ICE manufacturing footprint decreases, the scope of our dedicated global BEV manufacturing capacity is now growing. So far, we\u2019re busy and we have included a whole new facility in Dearborn at the Rouge to make the electric F-150, we\u2019re building the Kansas City facility for the E-Transit, Oakville, Canada for several battery electric SUVs and in China and Cuautitlan, Mexico for the Mach-E and there\u2019s a lot more to come. Our team is busy. Thanks for your time and attention. And as you can hear, I\u2019m very excited about our future. John will now talk about our results in more detail and outlook for the year. Over to you, John.\nJohn Lawler : Thanks, Jim. So, when you analyze our fourth quarter results, or even our second half performance last year, it\u2019s important to key in on the durable changes we\u2019ve made to our underlying earnings power, including in automotive business increasingly positioned to sustainably generate strong free cash flow. Right now, our year-end liquidity of nearly $47 billion provides the financial flexibility to opportunistically invest and grow and even accelerate investments if we choose to in key areas like electrification, in connected services and in our 8% company-adjusted EBIT margin, the target that we\u2019re aiming for, we believe we can generate healthy annual free cash flow to fuel our growth. When we initially set our 8% target, the secular forces accelerating today were still in their infancy. EV penetration at scale was years out, connectivity and digital services were still nascent, and autonomous vehicles, well, they were still largely in labs. So, you fast forward to 2021 and the landscape is vastly different and so are the calls on our capital. Our goal remains to hit the 8% margin and, in doing so, to reallocate profit and capital from a far healthier core business to exciting growth opportunities that will unlock long-term value. Let\u2019s take a look at the fourth quarter performance. In automotive, both wholesales and revenue declined by 9%, while a lower industry influenced both of these metrics, so did the planned changeover in North America to launch our all-new 2021 F-150. Our initial estimate was for a decline of 100,000 units, and we came in right on that number. Fourth quarter revenue benefited from broad-based gains in net pricing and product and series mix, especially in North America and Europe. Let\u2019s take a look at our individual regions in a bit more detail, starting with North America. The North America business offset some of its decline in top line metrics with continued growth and an increase in mix of commercial vehicles. Together, volume and revenue of Transit and Super Duty vehicles were up 14% and 24%, respectively. With the launch of the new F-150 now complete, we\u2019re building every vehicle we can. EBIT was $1.1 billion, up 53% with a margin of 4.9%. This growth was driven by excellent yield management and the non-reoccurrence of the UAW contract cost of fourth quarter of last year, all of which was partially offset by the lower F-150 volume I mentioned. In South America, wholesales and revenue declined 15% and 10%, respectively, reflecting industry softness and Ford share losses as we refocused our portfolio on strengths in Ranger pickups, Transit van and key imports. On a full year basis, Ranger gained 1.8 points of share to 15.6%. Revenue performance in South America was better than wholesale as we took aggressive price actions to offset inflation and currency pressures. As Jim mentioned in 2020, we exited our non-core heavy truck business in the region, discontinued the Focus and Fiesta and further reduced headcount in total by more than 40% through the end of 2020. These actions and other actions that we\u2019ve been taking contributed to the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in regional EBIT, and we posted the smallest loss in South America since 2013. With our recent announcement to exit manufacturing in Brazil, we have fundamentally de-risked this portion of our business and delivered another significant milestone in our global redesign. Shifting to Europe. Europe wholesales and revenues were both negatively affected by lower industry volumes. However, Ford\u2019s revenue in the region was up modestly aided by higher net pricing and improved mix. Our commercial business in Europe strengthened its number one position to a 14.3% share, which is a gain of 70 basis points. Ford has the broadest network of commercial vehicle dealers in Europe, including close to 800 dedicated transit centers. And during the quarter, the commercial, passenger and import vehicle businesses were all profitable. And the reduced manufacturing footprint that Jim had referenced along with the $1 billion decline in structural costs over the last two years allowed Europe to deliver its strongest quarterly profit in four years, with an EBIT of $400 million and achieving an EBIT margin of 5.8%. Now, turning to China. China delivered a 27% increase in wholesales. Retail sales grew 30%, outpacing the overall industry sales growth of 12%. Ford\u2019s share in China grew by 40 basis points to 2.4% with a 12 point increase in the mix of utilities to 36%. The mix of commercial vehicles reached 45% in the quarter supported by strength in light trucks, pickups and other vehicles. Importantly, our dealer network return on sales remains positive. Now while it\u2019s still a modest EBIT loss, this was China\u2019s third consecutive quarter of year-over-year profit improvement aided by an enhanced mix of vehicles, including locally-built Lincoln products. The China-specific Lincoln models accounted for 76% of the brand\u2019s in-country retail sales, that\u2019s up from just 2% last year. Wholesales and revenue results for the international market group varied, but its retail sales increase of 1.8% countered an industry decline of 3%. IMG continues to capitalize on its strengths in Ranger pickups and Everest SUVs, and Ranger was the best-selling 4\u00d74 pickup in Australia. And just this week, we announced a $1 billion investment to modernize and upgrade our Ranger pickup plant in South Africa, an important low-cost export hub that supplies 100 markets, including Europe. This paves the way to significantly expand production for the next-generation Ranger starting in 2022 and profitably grow this important business for us. Excluding the impact of India, IMG was profitable in the quarter led by Australia and Vietnam. In December, Ford and Mahindra jointly decided not to complete a previously announced joint venture. This outcome was driven by the fundamental changes in global economic and business conditions caused in part by the global pandemic. While we continue our independent operations in India, we are actively evaluating alternatives and reassessing capital allocation for India. Turning to mobility. We now plan to invest at least $7 billion in autonomous vehicles through 2025, including the $2 billion we spent through 2020. Our plans include standing up our commercial AV business by 2022 to move both people and goods, and we also believe that Argo AI\u2019s self-driving system remains on a shortlist of leaders in the autonomous technology. With improving unit economics, we continue to grow our Spin scooter network, which has become more relevant in a COVID world as people explore alternative modes of transportation. In fact, indicative of the strength of our city relationships, Spin won the overwhelming majority of all scooter permits it applied for in the US in the municipalities last year. Now let\u2019s turn to Ford Credit. Ford Credit delivered another strong quarter, with EBIT up almost $300 million to $900 million, a record fourth quarter. Improved auction values drove the performance and we continue to experience strong credit performance with a low loss to receivables ratio. All told, we delivered $1.7 billion in adjusted EBIT in the quarter, up $1.2 billion with an adjusted EBIT margin of 4.8%, which was up 3.6 points. Considering how the first half of 2020 unfolded, I\u2019m incredibly proud of how the Ford team came together to finish the year with such strength, setting a firm foundation for this year. Let\u2019s turn to 2021. The global semiconductor shortage situation is fluid and we\u2019re evaluating and updating the potential effects on our business in real-time. We want to be transparent and also prudent. Therefore, we think it\u2019s premature to size what the ultimate impact will be on our full year results. That said, we ended 2020 having achieved positive lasting change in the underlying trajectory of our earnings power, including the ability of our automotive business to generate consistent levels of strong free cash flow over time. For 2021, we were on a course to earn between $8 billion and $9 billion in adjusted EBIT, including a $900 million non-cash gain on our investment in Rivian. That scenario anticipated continued EBIT improvement in each of our regional businesses, except for South America, which we expect to be flat through their transition this year. We anticipate mobility to be flat and Ford Credit EBT to improve. We also expect to generate between $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion in adjusted free cash flow. However, the global semiconductor shortage is creating uncertainty across multiple industries and will influence our operating results this year. The situation is changing constantly, so it\u2019s premature to size what the shortage will mean for our full year results. However, right now, our current estimates from suppliers support a scenario, where we could lose 10% to 20% of our planned first quarter production. If that scenario is extended through the first half, this could adversely impact our full year adjusted EBIT by between $1 billion and $2.5 billion, net of reasonable cost recoveries and some production makeup in the second half of the year. So, we should expect full year cash and EBIT effects to be about equal with quarterly cash implications more volatile given the mechanics of the company\u2019s working capital. So, our team is working with our suppliers around the clock to optimize the constrained supply, minimize the profit impact, while also prioritizing customer orders, new vehicle launches and compliance with our CO2 emissions regulations. For example, similar to other actions we\u2019ve already taken, we are adjusting shifts next week at our Dearborn Truck Plant and Kansas City Assembly Plant. These actions are contemplated in the 10% to 20% scenario for the first quarter volume that I just mentioned. We will provide you with an update on the semiconductor issue when we report our first quarter \u201821 -- 2021 financial results, and that\u2019s on April 28. So, before we open the call for Q&A, I will end where Jim began. It cannot be overstated, 2020 was a year like no other, no other in our life times. The Ford team responded exceptionally both personally and professionally. We\u2019re exceedingly proud of all of our colleagues around the world. We made tough, strategically sound decisions in 2020 that have created durable beneficial changes to our underlying earnings power, including an automotive business that is increasingly positioned to sustainably generate strong free cash flows. And that financial flexibility will allow us to make the right investments for long-term profitable growth and value creation.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is going to come from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.\nRyan Brinkman : It looks like even after adjusting for the Rivian gain, you're guiding to 2021 profits well above consensus, presumably helped by the volume, pricing and mix benefits of a number of highly anticipated new products, including the new F-150, the Bronco, Bronco Sport and Mustang Mach-E. I know you have a lot of confidence in these vehicles. But are there any objective measures that you can share with investors as to why they should also be confident in the profit contribution of these models? So I know it's early days. But do you have any anecdotes about how quickly the vehicles are turning on dealer lots? How the pricing has been trending for the new F-150, what the earlier customer reaction has been to the Mach-E? Or you're doing a lot of test drives? And I realize the Bronco still has yet to even launch. So maybe there are fewer metrics there. But maybe you could tell us a bit more about the waitlist, for example, whether it continues to grow or how trim levels or options have been tracking relative to expectation or what the general community response has been?\nJim Farley : Thanks for your question. Just really quick on the F-150, some of the metrics -- objective metrics, we see that give us encouragement is, obviously, we're starting the year at a day supply level that we haven't seen for a long time. That's one thing. So a lot of opportunity to build wholesale and dealer inventory into the year. We're starting the year with 53 days supply. The mix of high series, which is always a big indicator of demand for the vehicle, is about 20 points higher than we normally see in the outgoing model. So, Lariat plus mix is extremely strong. You also look at the super duty demand. Super duty was up 14%. It had a great improved vehicle, but I think the F-150 improvement is even bigger. And even during the sell-down and the start-up of the new truck, that demand is -- we're turning vehicles in 6 days, the F-150. If you turn to the Mach-E, really good demand so far. We have about 70% of the customers are new to Ford. So we have new to Ford being they haven't owned a Ford for 15 years. The cross-shop vehicles are Porsche Boxster, Porsche 911, Mercedes E Class. We're also seeing in the reservations as we turn them into orders. High all-wheel drive mix more than we thought. The extended battery is much more popular than we expected. And don't forget, we have 127,000 federal tax credits that are each worth $7,500 each, and that is a big advantage on the pricing side. So really strong demand, early orders for Mach-E.  On Bronco, obviously, the Bronco Sport is turning, I think, in like 6 days. We sold every one we wholesaled to dealers in the fourth quarter. I think we sold over 5,000. It's just like the F-Series turning incredibly fast, Ryan. And I would say the Bronco, we're now just shy of 200,000 reservations, and we're now starting -- in a little bit, we'll turn those into orders. The encouraging thing about Bronco is just the interest. Not only do we have a lot of orders and confident in reservation, but the mix is stronger than we thought. It's encouraging to see the 2-door B3 a third but the Ford orders, very, very strong mix. And the demand is at the dealership levels or even our reservation system are really, really strong. And I think we could pass some Bronco Sport in January. I think we passed 8,000 units. So I mean -- and that's a brand-new model to our lineup. So that gives you a picture for the demand side. And maybe, John, any comments about the rest of performance?\nJohn Lawler : Yes. I'd just say, Ryan, that when you look at it, Jim went through the portfolio transformation, but the global redesign is really starting to take hold in de-risking the business. We're starting to see some strength in China. The localization of key project -- of products there, Lincoln, for sure, improving our cost structure there by localizing. We're leveraging capacity at the JVs to build Lincolns and commercial vehicles. Our partnering to share investments and improve scale, you saw that with the South Africa announcement we had building the Ranger and a VW pickup now in that facility. So I think we're starting to see strength across all the areas we've been talking about. But we're also focusing on the basics of the business, right? We've renewed our focus on our quality improvement. We're leveraging all of our connected vehicles to identify issues faster, improve our warranty expense, improve our ownership experiences. We're also leaning into electrification now, as Jim said, with Mach-E being on the road, the E-Transit coming, the F-150 BEV next year. And we're really transforming the team as well. We're bringing in new talent. We're organizing ourselves to grow our core businesses and expand that through connectivity and digital services. And so when you look at all of that across the business and you start to see some of the strength take hold, it gives us confidence in the year, and it allows us to move forward with the confidence we're projecting. So I think there's a lot of good things going on here.\nOperator: And our next question is going to come from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America.\nJohn Murphy : I just wanted to ask a question, Jim, just around the transition to EVs and maybe using F-150 as an example, to maybe talk around. I mean, when do you think sort of the tipping point is for the consumers, where they see enough EVs on the road that your ICE vehicles become somewhat obsolete and [depresses rigids] [ph]. And how do you kind of work through that transition? And specifically also around the F-150, I mean, can you position this as a performance enhancement, particularly around torque for trucks that you can actually get paid a tremendous amount of money for kind of like you did with EcoBoost, I mean you can joke on an EcoBoost, it wasn't really fuel economy that people love, it was a low end torque, right? I mean -- so I mean, just what's the tipping point where you kind of get hit a little bit on your rigids, on your outgoing ICE vehicles? How do you manage that transition? And how do you think about your position in EVs?\nJim Farley : Thank you for your question. It's stunning how fast the industry is changing. I watch the market really carefully in Europe and 10% in December. Pure battery electric is amazing. Our time is now at Ford. We're not talking about aspirations. We committed to California and Paris Accord and carbon neutrality a long time ago when it wasn't easy, and I'm very proud of that. This year, as you mentioned, we're launching Mach-Es in the market now. We think it's a real competitor to Tesla and their stronghold part of their price market. The F-150 electric is a lot of inbound interest from our loyal customers. We sold 780,000 F-150s last year. We are going to find, and we are finding, within that, a duty cycle that matches electric for some of those customers. It's such a large scale. In Transit Electric, the inbounds on that vehicle are really high. This is our turf. And we're not just going to have 1 delivery vehicle. We're going to have 3 lengths, 2-wheel bases, 3 roof heights, a cut through, a cabin chassis and a van and we're not done. So we are the leader in the Transit business. We have the body builder connections. 100% of our transits get updated. And we know every one of those of updaters. So -- and we are getting more inbound for that. So how do we manage the move? I think it's a really good question. I don't know if any of us have the answer. The costs are coming down quickly. But for me and the team, the move to electric is not about batteries and motors. It's about digital vehicle and a new customer experience. And that is universal, whether it's F-150, ICE or a battery electric, that digital experience that we're talking about, we have 130,000 commercial solution customers now. We have 9 million Ford Pass customers, that is universal. So that's goodness that we'll get back in all of our business. We just have to be very flexible, which we have those large commercial vehicle manufacturing facilities that are very flexible. And we'll invest in both. And we'll flex with the customers. So I think we're ready. This is our year. We're going to have great offers. And I think it's really on us. The real proof point to me is not going to be how many we sell in the first year. It will be how much better the vehicle is a year or 2 after we launch it with the same customer.\nOperator: And our next question is going to come from the line of Rod Lache with Wolf Research.\nRod Lache : So $22 billion is a pretty huge commitment to EVs. I was hoping you can talk about the level of volumes you're aspiring towards. It sounds kind of like a similar commitment to another company that's targeting about 1 million units. Can you talk about your Ford's cost competitiveness and the trajectory of costs for EVs? Do you agree with these expectations of cost per kilowatt hour declining to the $55 to $80 range in 5 years? And then lastly, in the context of what you said earlier, Jim, about allocating capital towards businesses that have strong returns. Do you think that by 2025, you can achieve similar profitability and returns in EVs that you achieve in ICE?\nJohn Lawler : Hi, Rod. Well, clearly, we need to see improvements in cost structure, similar to what you've been talking about in that 55 to 80 kilowatt hour for the pack. And that's going to happen over time, and we definitely are pushing in that direction. And that's going to be required. We're going to see the ICE and the BEV converge as they transition. And yes, we do see them being profitable. In fact, Mustang is profitable today, the Mach-E. So it's going to transition over time. We're deeply focused on driving that cost structure down on our BEV vehicles. We're leaning into our strengths where we see some synergies and taking advantage of that. So it's definitely a focus we have. From a standpoint of the $22 billion commitment to EV, as Jim said, as we lean into our strengths, we're focused on BEV. We're focused on expanding that growth. We're focused on the digital experience and the customer experience with those vehicles. And as that transition takes hold, over time, we're going after the larger segments, right? These are segments that we lead in. There's a strong customer base. And with that, as Jim said, there's duty cycles. There's specific needs for these customers with these vehicles. And we're going to continue to work with them to give them the solutions they need from a battery electric standpoint. But at this point, we're not going to guide on a number of volume and by when at this point.\nJim Farley : And Rod, I think just a compliment, John, expect us to be a lot more specific in spring as we move on. It's just -- this is not the right venue to go over specifics. But please rest assured, we are really excited to share all the specifics of our BEV plan. We just want to give you an idea of how we're allocating the capital.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.\nJoseph Spak : Just one question. You mentioned a couple of times the landscape is quite different now than when you first laid out that timeline for 8% EBIT margins. And now you're significantly stepping up investment, which is objectively a good thing. So I know you're still targeting that level. But is the timeline shifting?\nJohn Lawler : Yes. What I can say is that we are continuously putting pressure on ourselves to pull that timeline ahead as quickly as possible. And so it is shifting. We're focused on it. We're focused on improving the business as quickly as we can and continuing to invest in our growth areas. We see a stepped-up improvement in 2021. You saw that in the guidance and outside of the chip issue. And we're going to continue to work that. And as we do move closer to that 8%, we achieve those targets, we're generating good healthy free cash flows that we're going to invest in the business. So yes, we are putting tremendous pressure on the team to move that forward and achieve that as quickly as we can.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Dan Levy with Credit Suisse.\nDan Levy : Jim, I'd like to ask a question on partnership because if we think about the tenure of Jim Hackett, it seems like one of the core focus is really on building out partnerships, and I think we saw with VW, Mahindra, Zotye [plug-in]. But when we look at how things have played out in recent months, I know we've seen you terminate plans with Mahindra and Zotye. It seems like vehicle with Rivian has sort of been deemphasized. But on the flip side, we also see you forming this partnership with Google. So all in, wondering how you expect to use partnership as you're setting your agenda? And specifically, I'd be curious for that view as it relates to EV?\nJim Farley : Thank you so much for your question. This is a fundamental approach that we all committed to and continue to be committed to. We love what RJ is doing at Rivian. It's a strategic investment. It's not a transactional investment for this or that. And so we'll keep you updated. But that's a very fundamental bet and it looks like the market is liking what he's doing, too, which is good for Ford. The partnership with Google is very fundamental. It goes far beyond -- we want our team working on things that will differentiate us. Google has got a great platform for navigation and content delivery, and we can co-create on top of that. And their -- the system is great, but we're going to use Amazon Voice, and we're going to work hard with Apple on CarPlay. And we're going to have a great relationship with Microsoft on commercial vehicles, which we will tell you about some other day. But our partnerships in the technology area, including the Chinese partner -- technology firms, is just going to get deeper and deeper and deeper. And as far as our relationships, our partnerships, they will change with electrification. And you should expect more work in that regard. Anyways, I don't think you're going to have to wait too long to hear more about that actually. So it's a fundamental approach. The technology partners are becoming more and more important for us to deliver that digital experience, but also to build the capability inside the company for large-scale AI/ML deployment to our industrial system, the customer experience, using that data off the vehicles for quality improvement. And we don't have all the answers. And these companies can really help us, and we can help them. I hope that makes sense to you.\nOperator: Our next question is going to come from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank.\nEmmanuel Rosner : So one follow-up question on the increased spending in -- towards electrification. I understand you're not prepared to give specifics, But directionally speaking, I'm curious if you can give us color on what you were trying to achieve with it? I guess, how will this be spent? And what is the goal here? Are you developing a dedicated, flexible architecture for all your electric vehicles? Are you accelerating the rollout of electric vehicles? I guess, I'm just curious how this will be used? And a point of clarification on this as well. So your slide into -- and your presentation implies that you will focus on the areas that where you lead all these pickups, your sales from commercial vehicle seem to have some sort of commercial angle to it. Will your electrification strategy be mostly aimed at commercial customers? Or will you have also high-volume passenger vehicles?\nJim Farley : So thank you for your question. The answer is absolutely. This accelerated spending on products and industrializing those products. And we recognize in the guidance for explaining that, that there's more spending to come on our battery vertical integration decisions. We just don't have anything announced today. We have -- I'm not going to get into it, but we have 2 battery electric dedicated platforms. They will include high-volume passenger cars. But as we've always said, we're going to invest in the segments where we're the strongest. And you can imagine what those nameplates are and what those segments are. And we will have a great lineup of commercial battery electric vehicles. And as well, importantly for me, is the investment in the digital experiences and the physical services to make that work. We've learned over all these years that Ford\u2019s strength in commercial is far beyond the product. In fact, the product is often regulated to be defined as it is. Our strength is our distribution network. Our ability to keep vehicles on the road. Our upfitters, our bailment policies, and all of those strengths will come to bear as we electrify those lineup. And we have more ambitions, as you can see with the FCS software business. That business is growing very fast. It's a telematics and commercial services business. And that's a good example of the kind of investments we're making beyond the four-walls of the product. So as we electrify, we're not just going to bring more products, we're going to get more digital and we're going to get into physical services and digital services as well. But they'll be in the nameplates in the segments that we have a great reputation. As John said, we have a good owner base.\nOperator: And our next question is going to come from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Jonas : Jim, so first off, I just have to say the Mach-E kicks ass. I've rolled up -- and Lynn can tell you, she shamed me. I rolled up in my Y, I spent a half hour in the saying, I got back in the Y and I have to admit I have some regrets. I miss it. This thing is going to sell superfast, so bravo to the team. My question is on cell supply. What's your latest thinking on making your own cells or JVing with someone or pure outsourcing? And I ask this, Jim, because as you can understand, many of us on this call, right, can see a situation where we have a potentially dramatic misalignment between -- basically where demand massively exceeds supply of cells, and this really could threaten the commercial targets of an OEM\u2019s EV volumes unless you get this sorted out. Please tell me we don't have to wait until late spring for that. But let me know where your head is.\nJim Farley : All right. Appreciate the feedback on the product. And to me, the real test for our fitness on Mach-E will be, as I said, how that product performs, its range, its capability, its quality, a year or 2 from now for that same customer. \nAdam Jonas : It's got a lot of character. It was a ride. And I wasn't even driving the GT. It was a lot of fun.\nJim Farley : Oh, that's the key. I was just going to say where do you see the GT. Look, our first inning -- if this is a 9-inning ball game, our first inning, I think we played it about right, which is to buy the best technology at the lowest price out there during what you could argue in this first inning was an excess supply batteries. But now the game is changing. And the next step is going to be a much more aggressive electrification plan and the subsequent impact on our battery strategy, and we cannot afford to be in the situation we are with semiconductors right now, which is a good metaphor for what you're bringing up. So you can expect from Ford, follow-on this battery electric commitment, more news on our vertical integration plans. And there are options. We could do it ourselves. We can go to a JV and as well out there, not too far away, it's a solid-state technology moving very quickly. There's a lot of bets to be made. This company -- this team is in the midst of making those. And we'll let you know as soon as we can. But we get it. We want to lock it up. We want to make sure it's not a constraint. And we also want to pick the right technologies and the right partners at the time and have the flexibility as well as the technology changes, like solid state. I don't know -- we can't give you a date right now, whether that will be the spring or tomorrow. But please understand, we totally get the issue and the opportunity.\nOperator: Our last question for the day will come from the line of Philippe Houchois with Jefferies.\nPhilippe Houchois : I've got 2 questions, 1 for Jim and 1 for John. Jim, on this alliance with our relationship with Google is interesting, and we had Renault do a similar arrangement 2 weeks ago in Europe. If I stepped back a few years ago, I remember Google being seen as the enemy and the company that carmakers had to stay away from the -- avoid seeing Google getting to the car. What has changed? Is it just simply that you looked at the cost of developing software and you feel like it's too complicate too costly and then Google is a better solution to bring that connectivity to your customers? Or has the willingness to find commercial arrangements with Google improve in terms of revenue sharing, for example, that made working with Google maybe less threatening than it might have been a few years ago? And then for John, I was just wondering, if -- you're the first OEM to give us some guidance on the impact of semiconductor shortage on earnings, and thank you for that. I'm just trying to understand, you guide for the impact -- what the impact could be in the first half. Let's assume things normalize from the third quarter. How much of that negative impact in the first half would you be able to make up in the second half? Or should we think there's a net loss that we should take into account into our earnings forecast based on what you've given in terms of guidance?\nJim Farley : So to be really direct about your question, probably 3 things really changed our mind -- or not changed our mind but got us to where we were. First of all, it's not an exclusive relationship. So we want CarPlay to work great in all of the vehicles. We want Amazon Voice products to work great in our vehicles. But the Google, 3 things really changed to answer your question or evolved. The first one was, we just -- the money we were spending to keep competitive on a generic experience in the vehicle versus what they could offer in a stable, robust platform, the economics just work better. And we could take our team and instead of doing generic capabilities, we could put them on really differentiation. And we found that in Mach-E. If you use the Mach-E, we call it the Menlo systems, we really started to understand that if we had a stable digital platform inside the vehicle, we could really out co-create and create better, deeper experiences for a Bronco customer or Mach-E or a commercial customer. So basically, it was their commitment to build and to dedicate resources to a really good digital ecosystem in the vehicle. The second one is that we really started to feel a lot more comfortable with our customers' data and how that would be protected. And that's really important. Ford is a very trusted brand. All the data will be held and managed by Ford, Google won't have access to the Ford customer data in the cloud. The third thing was their cloud. We're trying to move our enterprise and a lot of our compute into the cloud very quickly for cost and capability. And we think their cloud is really competitive, but so is Amazon\u2019s, those Microsoft\u2019s. But we also saw that they were willing to make a commitment on AI and ML, I mean we are already using AI and ML throughout our company, but we need to really accelerate that. And they have real resources, and we're willing to make the commitment. So those are kind of the things that really swayed us. I hope that makes sense. But it's not necessarily exclusive. And we really are excited about the subscription business and the digital experience that could come off of this and all the other bets we're making with the technology companies. John?\nJohn Lawler : Yes. Thanks. So the scenario we laid out is based on the discussions we've been having with the supply base over the last couple of weeks, and it's very fluid. And we know that it's an industry impact. And what we see is that we could lose between 10% and 20% of the planned first half production. And so when you take that on an annual basis, the impact of that full year could be between $1 billion and $2.5 billion. And like we do, and we did -- like we do and like we did with COVID, we've assumed in there some reasonable cost recoveries and our ability to recover some of the production in the second half. And so the net impact on the year would be between $1 billion and $2.5 billion, depending on where this falls out, relative to the production disruption in the first half. And that's why we tried to frame it up to give a scenario around what it could be because it's very fluid right now. And as we get through this quarter, in April, we'll be able to share more details. We think we'll have a lot more understanding of exactly how this is going to fall out.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we would like to thank you for dialing in for today's Ford Motor Company Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call. We appreciate your participation and ask that you please disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jim Farley",
            "content": "Thank you, Lynn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Last year was like no other, with COVID dramatically and often tragically affecting all of us. But tough times can bring out the best in people. And boy, was that true at Ford? I'm really proud of how our people mobilized with speed and resolve to respond to this crisis. We harnessed our capabilities and we developed a lot of new ones. Our team members put others above themselves in both returning to work, but also to make life-saving equipment. And I'd like to share just a few highlights of our pandemic response, including our new Finish Strong initiative to help limit the spread of the virus and save as many lives as possible until this pandemic is under control. To-date, Ford has manufactured 55 million medical-grade masks. And by mid-year, we will have donated 100 million masks. In partnership with UAW, we've also produced 20 million face shields, 50,000 patient ventilators, more than 32,000 powered respirators in collaboration with 3M and 1.4 million washable isolation gowns. More to the point of today's call, we relied on the same grit and resourcefulness to deliver a very strong year financially under difficult circumstances. We improved our execution, while putting in place a specific and compelling plan, backed by some important early actions that are transforming Ford into a far stronger company, a company that competes and wins on behalf of our customers and other stakeholders in this exciting new landscape, which will be defined by electrification and connected customer experiences. After safely and smoothly restarting our manufacturing production in May, following last year's shutdown, we sharply rebounded in the second half of the year as we rebuilt our inventories to meet strong pent-up demand. In fact, we more than doubled our second half adjusted EBIT from the year before, yielding a 7.3% adjusted EBIT margin. In the fourth quarter, we successfully launched three incredibly important vehicles that exemplify our new Ford and our direction. Our first all-electric Mustang Mach-E, which we and more importantly others believe is the first credible mass-marketed competitor to Tesla; and the F-150, the 2021 F-150, America's favorite vehicle, it's now connected, you can sleep in it, you can work in it, it's incredibly capable and it is such a fantastic product; and the Bronco Sport, the first member of our reimagined legendary Bronco brand, which has generated as much excitement as anything to come out of Detroit in my career. Now, as we recap last year's results and discuss expectations for this year and beyond, I want to underscore that everything we do is in service of our plan. Simply put, we're seeing real improvements in our core automotive business and we are laser-focused on further progress this year. Now, this includes growing the company, generating consistently strong free cash flow for our core automotive business as well as Ford Credit. We will allocate that capital to its best and highest uses for creating sustained value. To achieve that, we are competing like a challenger now, earning customers and must-have products and services and rewarding customer experiences. We're moving with urgency to deliver leading quality, reducing our costs and restructuring underperforming businesses. We will start to grow again, but most importantly in the right areas, allocating more capital, resources and talent to take advantage of our strength in pickups, commercial vehicles and utilities, being a leader in the electric vehicle revolution around the world, where we have strength, but also where we have scale, expanding our leading commercial vehicle business with a suite of software services that earns loyalty and generates reoccurring revenue, and incubating, then scaling, then integrating new businesses, some of them enabled by Argo AI's world-class self-driving system. Today, I'll touch on a few of our plan highlights, with emphasis on capital allocation, electrification and connectivity. Back in 2017, vehicle lines had accounted for just 60% of our Company's revenue, generated a 150% of our EBIT and most of the vehicles generating that EBIT earned a multiple of the cost of capital. This imbalance was simply not sustainable and we immediately began reshaping and rebalancing our business. We allocated capital to our strengths. We jettisoned underperforming assets. We created a more focused portfolio, and built the financial flexibility to unleash significant untapped value at Ford. We've already made a tremendous progress. Through last year, we've invested $7.1 billion in EBIT and $1.6 billion in cash in our global redesign, reshaping our portfolio, our geographic footprint and our industry footprint. In the first phase of our redesign in Europe, for example, we prioritized profitable growth in commercial vehicles, where Ford is the number one vehicle brand in the region, but also a smaller, more targeted portfolio of passenger cars in the strongest segments, and exciting imports like Mustang and Edge that built our brand and make a solid return. We shrunk our manufacturing footprint in Europe, we reduced regional headcount by 20%, we lowered our annual structural cost by $1.1 billion through last year. And in the fourth quarter, Europe delivered its strongest quarterly profit in more than four years, achieving an EBIT margin of 5.8%. Let's turn to South America. We've lost more than $4.5 billion over the last decade in South America, not acceptable. In 2020, we exited our non-core heavy truck business in the region. We discontinued Focus and Fiesta. And we further reduced headcount, in fact, by more than 40% through the end of last year. And with these actions, last year we posted the smallest loss in South America since 2013. And then in early January, we went further as Ford Brazil announced it would end production and close three facilities. That decision will de-risk our business by concentrating it on a more profitable asset-light model on our industry-leading Ranger pickup trucks, our Transit commercial vehicles and key imports. We remain committed to serving our customers in Brazil and South America, but now with the portfolio of exciting, connected and increasingly electrified SUVs, pickups, including this amazing new Ranger, and commercial vehicles sourced from Argentina and Uruguay and other markets. Now, we didn't take these actions lightly, and Ford is working with all of our stakeholders in Brazil to mitigate the impacts of these decisions. At the same time, we know they were right and necessary and we are optimistic about our new business model for South America. Now before John walks through the last year's results and how we see 2021, I want to update you on Ford's connectivity and electrification plans. 2021 is a strategic inflection point for Ford. We have hundreds of thousands of fully networked vehicles now in the field. And now, we're seeing the evolving institutional capability inside Ford to leverage that data streaming off those vehicles and also use our over-the-air updates to improve quality and revolutionize the Ford customer experience. And importantly, that means commercial vehicles too and customers. We have more than 100,000 subscribers to our telematics and commercial vehicle software business, we call Ford Commercial Services, and we are just starting. Ford's development and delivery of connected vehicles will be enhanced by a new six-year partnership with Google that we announced earlier this week. The two companies are establishing a collaborative group that we call Team Upshift to not only unlock personal consumer experiences, but to create and make the most of data-driven opportunities in our industrial system. The partnership will greatly enhance the Ford team's ability to innovate and deliver a consistent world-class consumer experience and as well provide Ford with a powerful technology and tools to modernize our manufacturing, our supply chain management and speed of our implementation of the data-driven business models and innovation across our whole company. Now, as I said a few minutes ago and many times before, Ford will be a leader in electric vehicle revolution around the world. We will do this in areas where we have strength and great scale. It's early in the transition, but the trend is clear. We watched one out of 10 vehicles sold in Europe in December be pure electric. EV sales in China continue to grow and the reality is the customers, including in the US, are increasingly giving E-mobility greater consideration. We have no intention to cede ground to others in vehicle segments, where Ford is the established leader. We are rapidly building on our electric vehicle plans and building out our manufacturing and our R&D capabilities. We're also increasing financial flexibility, so we can accelerate and flex to keep pace with the evolving EV needs of our customers. Now, the Mustang Mach-E, our first dedicated BEV platform, which last month was named North America Utility of the Year embodies how we lead in electric vehicles. It's on sale now, it has stunning design, is fully connected and ready for the over-the-air updates with a tremendous technology experience. It's delivering high-quality exceptional performance at a price in the mid-30s. It's a fantastic vehicle, which also happens to be a full battery electric, and there are many more dedicated BEVs like this one that are coming. As you know, Ford is a global leader in commercial vehicles and we're on the leading edge of the electric revolution there too. We are the first company to announce plans for an all-electric van and an all-electric pickup truck. With the E-Transit coming later this year, it has three different lengths, three different heights, we have a van, a strip chassis and a cutaway and there's more coming on E-Transit. And then we're going to launch the BEV F-150 in the middle part of next year. In a recent study by Cox Automotive, we -- they showed that the all-electric F-150 was the highest consideration rate and is the most appealing among major EV pickups that are coming to the market. Our successful Ford Transit franchise is a critical pillar of our electrification plan. We understand the needs of these customers, we're going to offer a wide variety of configurations dimension and we are developing not just the vehicles, but a whole suite of connected vehicles to serve them -- connected services. For instance, we know from our leadership position that the average daily route driven in a transit is 74 miles, and they do not overbuy batteries. We've validated that with over 30 million miles of telemetry data from our Ford customers. Now with that data, we can forecast and optimize the battery life and provide over-the-air alerts, so when the vehicle needs service before anything fails for a 100% uptime, we can do that. That van stays on the road, working, where it belongs. Those are just two of dozens of examples of how we're employing and using data to help our commercial customers be safe and more efficient and to make more money, while at the same time creating an incredibly competitive advantage for Ford. The value proposition for our customers extends to customizing vehicles' interiors, digital experiences, E-service networks to maximize uptime and lower their operating cost. These are very sticky annuity-like capabilities that remove pain-points and create opportunities for our customers. No commercial vehicle provider is better positioned than Ford to innovate and introduce services like these at scale. We are accelerating our plans right now, breaking constraints, increasing battery capacity, improving our costs and getting more battery electrics into our cycle plan. We are now planned to invest at least $22 billion in electrification in the next few years through 2025. And that's just electrification. When you include the spending on our autonomous driving, our total commitment is at least $29 billion. The majority of our investment in electrification supports a widening portfolio of BEVs on platforms from both Ford and alliance partners. This electrification number does not even include the potential, of course, for vertical integration of battery production whether alone or in a JV. As the size of our ICE manufacturing footprint decreases, the scope of our dedicated global BEV manufacturing capacity is now growing. So far, we're busy and we have included a whole new facility in Dearborn at the Rouge to make the electric F-150, we're building the Kansas City facility for the E-Transit, Oakville, Canada for several battery electric SUVs and in China and Cuautitlan, Mexico for the Mach-E and there's a lot more to come. Our team is busy. Thanks for your time and attention. And as you can hear, I'm very excited about our future. John will now talk about our results in more detail and outlook for the year. Over to you, John. Thanks for your question. Just really quick on the F-150, some of the metrics -- objective metrics, we see that give us encouragement is, obviously, we're starting the year at a day supply level that we haven't seen for a long time. That's one thing. So a lot of opportunity to build wholesale and dealer inventory into the year. We're starting the year with 53 days supply. The mix of high series, which is always a big indicator of demand for the vehicle, is about 20 points higher than we normally see in the outgoing model. So, Lariat plus mix is extremely strong. You also look at the super duty demand. Super duty was up 14%. It had a great improved vehicle, but I think the F-150 improvement is even bigger. And even during the sell-down and the start-up of the new truck, that demand is -- we're turning vehicles in 6 days, the F-150. If you turn to the Mach-E, really good demand so far. We have about 70% of the customers are new to Ford. So we have new to Ford being they haven't owned a Ford for 15 years. The cross-shop vehicles are Porsche Boxster, Porsche 911, Mercedes E Class. We're also seeing in the reservations as we turn them into orders. High all-wheel drive mix more than we thought. The extended battery is much more popular than we expected. And don't forget, we have 127,000 federal tax credits that are each worth $7,500 each, and that is a big advantage on the pricing side. So really strong demand, early orders for Mach-E.  On Bronco, obviously, the Bronco Sport is turning, I think, in like 6 days. We sold every one we wholesaled to dealers in the fourth quarter. I think we sold over 5,000. It's just like the F-Series turning incredibly fast, Ryan. And I would say the Bronco, we're now just shy of 200,000 reservations, and we're now starting -- in a little bit, we'll turn those into orders. The encouraging thing about Bronco is just the interest. Not only do we have a lot of orders and confident in reservation, but the mix is stronger than we thought. It's encouraging to see the 2-door B3 a third but the Ford orders, very, very strong mix. And the demand is at the dealership levels or even our reservation system are really, really strong. And I think we could pass some Bronco Sport in January. I think we passed 8,000 units. So I mean -- and that's a brand-new model to our lineup. So that gives you a picture for the demand side. And maybe, John, any comments about the rest of performance? Thank you for your question. It's stunning how fast the industry is changing. I watch the market really carefully in Europe and 10% in December. Pure battery electric is amazing. Our time is now at Ford. We're not talking about aspirations. We committed to California and Paris Accord and carbon neutrality a long time ago when it wasn't easy, and I'm very proud of that. This year, as you mentioned, we're launching Mach-Es in the market now. We think it's a real competitor to Tesla and their stronghold part of their price market. The F-150 electric is a lot of inbound interest from our loyal customers. We sold 780,000 F-150s last year. We are going to find, and we are finding, within that, a duty cycle that matches electric for some of those customers. It's such a large scale. In Transit Electric, the inbounds on that vehicle are really high. This is our turf. And we're not just going to have 1 delivery vehicle. We're going to have 3 lengths, 2-wheel bases, 3 roof heights, a cut through, a cabin chassis and a van and we're not done. So we are the leader in the Transit business. We have the body builder connections. 100% of our transits get updated. And we know every one of those of updaters. So -- and we are getting more inbound for that. So how do we manage the move? I think it's a really good question. I don't know if any of us have the answer. The costs are coming down quickly. But for me and the team, the move to electric is not about batteries and motors. It's about digital vehicle and a new customer experience. And that is universal, whether it's F-150, ICE or a battery electric, that digital experience that we're talking about, we have 130,000 commercial solution customers now. We have 9 million Ford Pass customers, that is universal. So that's goodness that we'll get back in all of our business. We just have to be very flexible, which we have those large commercial vehicle manufacturing facilities that are very flexible. And we'll invest in both. And we'll flex with the customers. So I think we're ready. This is our year. We're going to have great offers. And I think it's really on us. The real proof point to me is not going to be how many we sell in the first year. It will be how much better the vehicle is a year or 2 after we launch it with the same customer. And Rod, I think just a compliment, John, expect us to be a lot more specific in spring as we move on. It's just -- this is not the right venue to go over specifics. But please rest assured, we are really excited to share all the specifics of our BEV plan. We just want to give you an idea of how we're allocating the capital. Thank you so much for your question. This is a fundamental approach that we all committed to and continue to be committed to. We love what RJ is doing at Rivian. It's a strategic investment. It's not a transactional investment for this or that. And so we'll keep you updated. But that's a very fundamental bet and it looks like the market is liking what he's doing, too, which is good for Ford. The partnership with Google is very fundamental. It goes far beyond -- we want our team working on things that will differentiate us. Google has got a great platform for navigation and content delivery, and we can co-create on top of that. And their -- the system is great, but we're going to use Amazon Voice, and we're going to work hard with Apple on CarPlay. And we're going to have a great relationship with Microsoft on commercial vehicles, which we will tell you about some other day. But our partnerships in the technology area, including the Chinese partner -- technology firms, is just going to get deeper and deeper and deeper. And as far as our relationships, our partnerships, they will change with electrification. And you should expect more work in that regard. Anyways, I don't think you're going to have to wait too long to hear more about that actually. So it's a fundamental approach. The technology partners are becoming more and more important for us to deliver that digital experience, but also to build the capability inside the company for large-scale AI/ML deployment to our industrial system, the customer experience, using that data off the vehicles for quality improvement. And we don't have all the answers. And these companies can really help us, and we can help them. I hope that makes sense to you. So thank you for your question. The answer is absolutely. This accelerated spending on products and industrializing those products. And we recognize in the guidance for explaining that, that there's more spending to come on our battery vertical integration decisions. We just don't have anything announced today. We have -- I'm not going to get into it, but we have 2 battery electric dedicated platforms. They will include high-volume passenger cars. But as we've always said, we're going to invest in the segments where we're the strongest. And you can imagine what those nameplates are and what those segments are. And we will have a great lineup of commercial battery electric vehicles. And as well, importantly for me, is the investment in the digital experiences and the physical services to make that work. We've learned over all these years that Ford's strength in commercial is far beyond the product. In fact, the product is often regulated to be defined as it is. Our strength is our distribution network. Our ability to keep vehicles on the road. Our upfitters, our bailment policies, and all of those strengths will come to bear as we electrify those lineup. And we have more ambitions, as you can see with the FCS software business. That business is growing very fast. It's a telematics and commercial services business. And that's a good example of the kind of investments we're making beyond the four-walls of the product. So as we electrify, we're not just going to bring more products, we're going to get more digital and we're going to get into physical services and digital services as well. But they'll be in the nameplates in the segments that we have a great reputation. As John said, we have a good owner base. All right. Appreciate the feedback on the product. And to me, the real test for our fitness on Mach-E will be, as I said, how that product performs, its range, its capability, its quality, a year or 2 from now for that same customer. Oh, that's the key. I was just going to say where do you see the GT. Look, our first inning -- if this is a 9-inning ball game, our first inning, I think we played it about right, which is to buy the best technology at the lowest price out there during what you could argue in this first inning was an excess supply batteries. But now the game is changing. And the next step is going to be a much more aggressive electrification plan and the subsequent impact on our battery strategy, and we cannot afford to be in the situation we are with semiconductors right now, which is a good metaphor for what you're bringing up. So you can expect from Ford, follow-on this battery electric commitment, more news on our vertical integration plans. And there are options. We could do it ourselves. We can go to a JV and as well out there, not too far away, it's a solid-state technology moving very quickly. There's a lot of bets to be made. This company -- this team is in the midst of making those. And we'll let you know as soon as we can. But we get it. We want to lock it up. We want to make sure it's not a constraint. And we also want to pick the right technologies and the right partners at the time and have the flexibility as well as the technology changes, like solid state. I don't know -- we can't give you a date right now, whether that will be the spring or tomorrow. But please understand, we totally get the issue and the opportunity. So to be really direct about your question, probably 3 things really changed our mind -- or not changed our mind but got us to where we were. First of all, it's not an exclusive relationship. So we want CarPlay to work great in all of the vehicles. We want Amazon Voice products to work great in our vehicles. But the Google, 3 things really changed to answer your question or evolved. The first one was, we just -- the money we were spending to keep competitive on a generic experience in the vehicle versus what they could offer in a stable, robust platform, the economics just work better. And we could take our team and instead of doing generic capabilities, we could put them on really differentiation. And we found that in Mach-E. If you use the Mach-E, we call it the Menlo systems, we really started to understand that if we had a stable digital platform inside the vehicle, we could really out co-create and create better, deeper experiences for a Bronco customer or Mach-E or a commercial customer. So basically, it was their commitment to build and to dedicate resources to a really good digital ecosystem in the vehicle. The second one is that we really started to feel a lot more comfortable with our customers' data and how that would be protected. And that's really important. Ford is a very trusted brand. All the data will be held and managed by Ford, Google won't have access to the Ford customer data in the cloud. The third thing was their cloud. We're trying to move our enterprise and a lot of our compute into the cloud very quickly for cost and capability. And we think their cloud is really competitive, but so is Amazon's, those Microsoft's. But we also saw that they were willing to make a commitment on AI and ML, I mean we are already using AI and ML throughout our company, but we need to really accelerate that. And they have real resources, and we're willing to make the commitment. So those are kind of the things that really swayed us. I hope that makes sense. But it's not necessarily exclusive. And we really are excited about the subscription business and the digital experience that could come off of this and all the other bets we're making with the technology companies. John?"

            "content": "Thanks, Jim. So, when you analyze our fourth quarter results, or even our second half performance last year, it's important to key in on the durable changes we've made to our underlying earnings power, including in automotive business increasingly positioned to sustainably generate strong free cash flow. Right now, our year-end liquidity of nearly $47 billion provides the financial flexibility to opportunistically invest and grow and even accelerate investments if we choose to in key areas like electrification, in connected services and in our 8% company-adjusted EBIT margin, the target that we're aiming for, we believe we can generate healthy annual free cash flow to fuel our growth. When we initially set our 8% target, the secular forces accelerating today were still in their infancy. EV penetration at scale was years out, connectivity and digital services were still nascent, and autonomous vehicles, well, they were still largely in labs. So, you fast forward to 2021 and the landscape is vastly different and so are the calls on our capital. Our goal remains to hit the 8% margin and, in doing so, to reallocate profit and capital from a far healthier core business to exciting growth opportunities that will unlock long-term value. Let's take a look at the fourth quarter performance. In automotive, both wholesales and revenue declined by 9%, while a lower industry influenced both of these metrics, so did the planned changeover in North America to launch our all-new 2021 F-150. Our initial estimate was for a decline of 100,000 units, and we came in right on that number. Fourth quarter revenue benefited from broad-based gains in net pricing and product and series mix, especially in North America and Europe. Let's take a look at our individual regions in a bit more detail, starting with North America. The North America business offset some of its decline in top line metrics with continued growth and an increase in mix of commercial vehicles. Together, volume and revenue of Transit and Super Duty vehicles were up 14% and 24%, respectively. With the launch of the new F-150 now complete, we're building every vehicle we can. EBIT was $1.1 billion, up 53% with a margin of 4.9%. This growth was driven by excellent yield management and the non-reoccurrence of the UAW contract cost of fourth quarter of last year, all of which was partially offset by the lower F-150 volume I mentioned. In South America, wholesales and revenue declined 15% and 10%, respectively, reflecting industry softness and Ford share losses as we refocused our portfolio on strengths in Ranger pickups, Transit van and key imports. On a full year basis, Ranger gained 1.8 points of share to 15.6%. Revenue performance in South America was better than wholesale as we took aggressive price actions to offset inflation and currency pressures. As Jim mentioned in 2020, we exited our non-core heavy truck business in the region, discontinued the Focus and Fiesta and further reduced headcount in total by more than 40% through the end of 2020. These actions and other actions that we've been taking contributed to the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in regional EBIT, and we posted the smallest loss in South America since 2013. With our recent announcement to exit manufacturing in Brazil, we have fundamentally de-risked this portion of our business and delivered another significant milestone in our global redesign. Shifting to Europe. Europe wholesales and revenues were both negatively affected by lower industry volumes. However, Ford's revenue in the region was up modestly aided by higher net pricing and improved mix. Our commercial business in Europe strengthened its number one position to a 14.3% share, which is a gain of 70 basis points. Ford has the broadest network of commercial vehicle dealers in Europe, including close to 800 dedicated transit centers. And during the quarter, the commercial, passenger and import vehicle businesses were all profitable. And the reduced manufacturing footprint that Jim had referenced along with the $1 billion decline in structural costs over the last two years allowed Europe to deliver its strongest quarterly profit in four years, with an EBIT of $400 million and achieving an EBIT margin of 5.8%. Now, turning to China. China delivered a 27% increase in wholesales. Retail sales grew 30%, outpacing the overall industry sales growth of 12%. Ford's share in China grew by 40 basis points to 2.4% with a 12 point increase in the mix of utilities to 36%. The mix of commercial vehicles reached 45% in the quarter supported by strength in light trucks, pickups and other vehicles. Importantly, our dealer network return on sales remains positive. Now while it's still a modest EBIT loss, this was China's third consecutive quarter of year-over-year profit improvement aided by an enhanced mix of vehicles, including locally-built Lincoln products. The China-specific Lincoln models accounted for 76% of the brand's in-country retail sales, that's up from just 2% last year. Wholesales and revenue results for the international market group varied, but its retail sales increase of 1.8% countered an industry decline of 3%. IMG continues to capitalize on its strengths in Ranger pickups and Everest SUVs, and Ranger was the best-selling 4\u00d74 pickup in Australia. And just this week, we announced a $1 billion investment to modernize and upgrade our Ranger pickup plant in South Africa, an important low-cost export hub that supplies 100 markets, including Europe. This paves the way to significantly expand production for the next-generation Ranger starting in 2022 and profitably grow this important business for us. Excluding the impact of India, IMG was profitable in the quarter led by Australia and Vietnam. In December, Ford and Mahindra jointly decided not to complete a previously announced joint venture. This outcome was driven by the fundamental changes in global economic and business conditions caused in part by the global pandemic. While we continue our independent operations in India, we are actively evaluating alternatives and reassessing capital allocation for India. Turning to mobility. We now plan to invest at least $7 billion in autonomous vehicles through 2025, including the $2 billion we spent through 2020. Our plans include standing up our commercial AV business by 2022 to move both people and goods, and we also believe that Argo AI's self-driving system remains on a shortlist of leaders in the autonomous technology. With improving unit economics, we continue to grow our Spin scooter network, which has become more relevant in a COVID world as people explore alternative modes of transportation. In fact, indicative of the strength of our city relationships, Spin won the overwhelming majority of all scooter permits it applied for in the US in the municipalities last year. Now let's turn to Ford Credit. Ford Credit delivered another strong quarter, with EBIT up almost $300 million to $900 million, a record fourth quarter. Improved auction values drove the performance and we continue to experience strong credit performance with a low loss to receivables ratio. All told, we delivered $1.7 billion in adjusted EBIT in the quarter, up $1.2 billion with an adjusted EBIT margin of 4.8%, which was up 3.6 points. Considering how the first half of 2020 unfolded, I'm incredibly proud of how the Ford team came together to finish the year with such strength, setting a firm foundation for this year. Let's turn to 2021. The global semiconductor shortage situation is fluid and we're evaluating and updating the potential effects on our business in real-time. We want to be transparent and also prudent. Therefore, we think it's premature to size what the ultimate impact will be on our full year results. That said, we ended 2020 having achieved positive lasting change in the underlying trajectory of our earnings power, including the ability of our automotive business to generate consistent levels of strong free cash flow over time. For 2021, we were on a course to earn between $8 billion and $9 billion in adjusted EBIT, including a $900 million non-cash gain on our investment in Rivian. That scenario anticipated continued EBIT improvement in each of our regional businesses, except for South America, which we expect to be flat through their transition this year. We anticipate mobility to be flat and Ford Credit EBT to improve. We also expect to generate between $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion in adjusted free cash flow. However, the global semiconductor shortage is creating uncertainty across multiple industries and will influence our operating results this year. The situation is changing constantly, so it's premature to size what the shortage will mean for our full year results. However, right now, our current estimates from suppliers support a scenario, where we could lose 10% to 20% of our planned first quarter production. If that scenario is extended through the first half, this could adversely impact our full year adjusted EBIT by between $1 billion and $2.5 billion, net of reasonable cost recoveries and some production makeup in the second half of the year. So, we should expect full year cash and EBIT effects to be about equal with quarterly cash implications more volatile given the mechanics of the company's working capital. So, our team is working with our suppliers around the clock to optimize the constrained supply, minimize the profit impact, while also prioritizing customer orders, new vehicle launches and compliance with our CO2 emissions regulations. For example, similar to other actions we've already taken, we are adjusting shifts next week at our Dearborn Truck Plant and Kansas City Assembly Plant. These actions are contemplated in the 10% to 20% scenario for the first quarter volume that I just mentioned. We will provide you with an update on the semiconductor issue when we report our first quarter \u201821 -- 2021 financial results, and that's on April 28. So, before we open the call for Q&A, I will end where Jim began. It cannot be overstated, 2020 was a year like no other, no other in our life times. The Ford team responded exceptionally both personally and professionally. We're exceedingly proud of all of our colleagues around the world. We made tough, strategically sound decisions in 2020 that have created durable beneficial changes to our underlying earnings power, including an automotive business that is increasingly positioned to sustainably generate strong free cash flows. And that financial flexibility will allow us to make the right investments for long-term profitable growth and value creation. Yes. I'd just say, Ryan, that when you look at it, Jim went through the portfolio transformation, but the global redesign is really starting to take hold in de-risking the business. We're starting to see some strength in China. The localization of key project -- of products there, Lincoln, for sure, improving our cost structure there by localizing. We're leveraging capacity at the JVs to build Lincolns and commercial vehicles. Our partnering to share investments and improve scale, you saw that with the South Africa announcement we had building the Ranger and a VW pickup now in that facility. So I think we're starting to see strength across all the areas we've been talking about. But we're also focusing on the basics of the business, right? We've renewed our focus on our quality improvement. We're leveraging all of our connected vehicles to identify issues faster, improve our warranty expense, improve our ownership experiences. We're also leaning into electrification now, as Jim said, with Mach-E being on the road, the E-Transit coming, the F-150 BEV next year. And we're really transforming the team as well. We're bringing in new talent. We're organizing ourselves to grow our core businesses and expand that through connectivity and digital services. And so when you look at all of that across the business and you start to see some of the strength take hold, it gives us confidence in the year, and it allows us to move forward with the confidence we're projecting. So I think there's a lot of good things going on here. Hi, Rod. Well, clearly, we need to see improvements in cost structure, similar to what you've been talking about in that 55 to 80 kilowatt hour for the pack. And that's going to happen over time, and we definitely are pushing in that direction. And that's going to be required. We're going to see the ICE and the BEV converge as they transition. And yes, we do see them being profitable. In fact, Mustang is profitable today, the Mach-E. So it's going to transition over time. We're deeply focused on driving that cost structure down on our BEV vehicles. We're leaning into our strengths where we see some synergies and taking advantage of that. So it's definitely a focus we have. From a standpoint of the $22 billion commitment to EV, as Jim said, as we lean into our strengths, we're focused on BEV. We're focused on expanding that growth. We're focused on the digital experience and the customer experience with those vehicles. And as that transition takes hold, over time, we're going after the larger segments, right? These are segments that we lead in. There's a strong customer base. And with that, as Jim said, there's duty cycles. There's specific needs for these customers with these vehicles. And we're going to continue to work with them to give them the solutions they need from a battery electric standpoint. But at this point, we're not going to guide on a number of volume and by when at this point. Yes. What I can say is that we are continuously putting pressure on ourselves to pull that timeline ahead as quickly as possible. And so it is shifting. We're focused on it. We're focused on improving the business as quickly as we can and continuing to invest in our growth areas. We see a stepped-up improvement in 2021. You saw that in the guidance and outside of the chip issue. And we're going to continue to work that. And as we do move closer to that 8%, we achieve those targets, we're generating good healthy free cash flows that we're going to invest in the business. So yes, we are putting tremendous pressure on the team to move that forward and achieve that as quickly as we can. Yes. Thanks. So the scenario we laid out is based on the discussions we've been having with the supply base over the last couple of weeks, and it's very fluid. And we know that it's an industry impact. And what we see is that we could lose between 10% and 20% of the planned first half production. And so when you take that on an annual basis, the impact of that full year could be between $1 billion and $2.5 billion. And like we do, and we did -- like we do and like we did with COVID, we've assumed in there some reasonable cost recoveries and our ability to recover some of the production in the second half. And so the net impact on the year would be between $1 billion and $2.5 billion, depending on where this falls out, relative to the production disruption in the first half. And that's why we tried to frame it up to give a scenario around what it could be because it's very fluid right now. And as we get through this quarter, in April, we'll be able to share more details. We think we'll have a lot more understanding of exactly how this is going to fall out."

Now, I'll turn the call over to Jim Farley, Jim?\nJim Farley: Thanks Lynn and hi everyone. First let me say how humbled I am and what a privilege it is to be the CEO of Ford. My family has been with Ford since 1916 when my grandfather started at Highland Park here in Michigan and in that moment our family story really started to change for the better and countless people over have similar stories about Ford. We're a family company. From the leadership a Bill Ford all the way to the members on our factory floor. I'm extremely motivated to help build a vibrant and growing Ford that will have a positive effect for generations to come, benefiting all of our stakeholders. Now we've assembled a very talented leadership team to get this done. A combination of strong, lifetime and long time Ford people who truly know our business, but we also have new colleagues. We had very different experiences and knowhow and talents to the company to execute our plan and we plan to continue to add to this bench with key capabilities in marketing, technology and many other areas. Over the past several months, I've spoken to many of you and I believe the plan we now have and have developed and are now executing on aligns well with many of your expectations. We're committed to creating Ford that grows profitably and generate sustainable free cash flow, led by our automotive business and we're going to allocate capital to the best and highest usage to drive sustainable value creation. Now that plan which was introduced to the Ford team and many stakeholders on October 1 is very straightforward. Among other things, number one we will compete like challenger, earning each customer with great products, but as well services with rewarding ownership experiences. Number two, we're moving with urgency to turn around our automotive operations, improve our quality, reduce our cost and accelerate the restructuring of underperforming businesses. And third, we're going to grow again, but in the right areas allocating more capital, more resources, more talent to our very strongest businesses and vehicle franchises. Incubating, scaling and integrating new businesses, some of them enabled by new technology like Argo, self-driving system and expanding our leading commercial vehicle business with great margins, but now with a suite of software services that drive loyalty and generate reoccurring annuity-like revenue streams and being a leader in electric vehicle revolution around the world, where we have strengthen and scale. So now speaking about EVs, to start with, we're developing all new electric versions of the F-150 into transit, the two most important, highest volume commercial vehicles are in our industry. These leading vehicles really drive the commercial vehicle business at Fort and we're electrifying them. We own work at Fort in these electric vehicles will be true work vehicles, extremely capable and with unique digital services in over their capabilities to improve the productivity and uptime of our important commercial customers. The electric transit by the way will be revealed next month and you heard about it here first for all of our global markets. We believe the addressable market for our fully electric commercial van and pick up, the two largest addressable profit pools in commercial are going to be massive and we're going straight at this opportunity. Together, we think the accessible price points of these vehicles, the productivity, the capability, the cost of ownership will be very compelling for some of our customers and frankly, Ford is not only in front of developing the electric transit in F 150, we also have an unmatched dealer base to provide that anywhere service or great uptime for our customers with a great customer base, with deep know-how on their usage and expertise in the commercial vehicle business such as the largest updater community there is, period. Also in the coming weeks we will deliver the first Mustang Mach-E to customers in the US and Europe. The reservations have been very strong for this vehicle and soon after it will go on sale even in China. Now 30 years of being in this wonderful business, I've never been so pumped up about one of our -- one of the retail vehicles. I recently had a chance to put a 1,000 miles on a Maki and that Mustang and that engineering team have pride -- had vehicle out of my hands. They just elevated experience the way it drives, the connected technology in the cabin, the ingenious cloud enabled services, it's all in the heart of the market from a price point. Such a large addressable market the two row crossover business and we have a real advantage especially in US with the EV tax credit. Now you're going to see our strategy of electrifying our leading commercial vehicles and our iconic high-volume products expand very quickly at Ford. It's also important to note there we're building out our electric vehicle manufacturing footprint around the world and we now have four plants in North America alone, including an all-new carbon neutral factory going up at the Rouge plant as we speak a few miles from here. We're also recently finalized an agreement with the Canadian Auto Workers Union, Unifor, that paves the way for future electric SUVs to be built by our team and for Canada. Now as we execute our plan, my commitment to each of you is transparency, including purposeful, measurable key performance indicators. So you can objectively track our progress. We plan to provide you with more details about our plan including financial targets in the spring. With that let me briefly touch on the robust third quarter and what we have on tap for the fourth quarter. When you look at our results, they reflect a benefit of our decision two years ago to allocate capital to our strongest franchises, namely pickups, a whole range of utilities across the world, commercial vehicles and iconic passenger vehicles. Additionally, we saw higher-than-expected demand for our new vehicles in the quarter. At a time when inventories are really low following the virus-related first-half factory shutdowns. Now that contributed to a very favorable pricing environment and mix. Together these factors plus the strong performance from the Ford -- the strongest performance from For Credit in 15 years led to a total company adjusted EBIT margin of 9.7%, that's 490 basis points higher than last year. As an outcome of all this, we generated $6.3 billion in adjusted free cash flow. Throughout 2020, even during the industrywide shutdown of COVID and as we prioritize the safety of our team, we've been disciplined in preparing for high-quality fourth-quarter launch, first of the 2021 F 150 to live in, you work in it, you can sleep in it. The Bronco Sport, the first of many Broncos to come and my favorite, the all new all electric Mustang Maki. In fact we use an unanticipated downtime to continue to validate the preparations for these important launch vehicles and in the case of the F 150, a methodical sell down and the changeover for our current model. While I'm proud of our team, I'm delighted to say that we're in good shape in important areas of readiness for these launches. Software, the hardware engineering is done, supplier manufacturing readiness looks great, in fact right now, are all new F 150s are rolling off the line in Dearborn as we speak and production will soon start at Kansas City and we're starting to build the Mustang Maki and the Bronco Sport actually early this week. Before I turn over to John, I want to thank each of you for joining us today. Despite the strong numbers in the third quarter, we know we haven't fixed the issues that held us back in our automotive business. They include warranty cost, which remain unacceptably high. I plan to be transparent and focused on both customer and shareholder value, proving out this business and are plan quarter after quarter, year after year. And now John let's take everyone to details.\nJohn Lawler: Thanks Jim. First let me say what an honor it is to be the CFO of this great company and you know I really can't remember a time when we've had this much opportunity to transform and grow our business and so it's incredibly exciting and delivering on that potential that's an important responsibility all of us have to our customers and to our stakeholders. Now to be clear, our transformation and growth plan is predicated on delivering an 8% or better adjusted company EBIT margin and consistently generating free cash flow, so we can invest in accretive, high return products and services and so my initial priorities to help drive this are one, help our team fix or dispose of underperforming parts of our business so we can allocate capital to its best and highest use and two, further strengthen our balance sheet. We will make the tough decisions to improve our financial flexibility and ensure that we have the resources to build and grow our business. Now let me summarize the third quarter. As Jim mentioned, we had a strong quarter delivering a 9.7% company adjusted EBIT margin. Now that margin was driven largely by higher-than-expected vehicle demand, positive net pricing and favorable mix as inventories were limited because of the virus-related shutdowns in the first half of the year. North America and China benefited from growth in both wholesales and revenue, while Europe, South America and our international's market group were still affected by COVID-related industry declines. In addition, our performance continues to benefit from our portfolio of refresh as we reallocate capital to our franchise strengths. Ford Credit also contributed, turning in its strongest performance since 2005, generating $1.1 billion in earnings before taxes with help from strong auction values. Now before I talk about the rest of our business, let me put our record $6.3 billion of adjusted free cash flow in perspective. Not only does it reflect the strength of our EBIT in the quarter, but as we indicated last quarter, working capital recovered sharply as we rebuild production to full capacity after a shutdown, largely driven by supplier payables. In the third quarter, the payable build was completed and this was worth about $4 billion. The strong cash flow in the quarter gave us the confidence and the ability to make a second payment on our corporate revolver, which we did on September 24. So now we have fully repaid the entire $15 billion facility and we ended the third quarter with strong a balance sheet including nearly $30 billion in cash and more than $45 billion of liquidity, which puts us in vital -- which provides us with the vital financial flexibility we need. Looking at North America, despite the difficult backdrop of COVID, the Ford team executed well operationally. We optimize incentives for lower dealer stock levels, we maximize production and skillfully manage supply chains to meet stronger-than-expected customer demand. The region delivered an EBIT margin of 12.5% as it benefited from top line growth of 8% EBIT improved by $1.2 billion supported by $900 million in net pricing and $400 million in favorable volume and mix. The improvement in volume and mix reflects the effectiveness of our team and focusing on Ford's franchise strengths. A few examples include S-series. S-series gained 1.7 points to a share of more than 35% in the US. Our mix of trucks and vans increased one point to 57%. Our mix -- our utility mix increased three points to 35% with a very strong showing from Explorer and the mix of cars declined four points to just under 8%. Now in total, North America share increased one point to 13.6%. In Europe, EBIT declined $300 billion in the quarter and that was driven by lower volume and about $400 million in costs related to our Kuga PHEV battery supplier issue. Those expenses included pulling cost that are required to comply with the EUs and new CO2 emissions standards this year. Now we said earlier that we anticipated meeting those new standards based on our product roadmap and the Kuga PHEV was a big part of that expectation. So we're working closely with our supplier to remediate the situation and minimize any inconveniences to our customers. We plan to notify our customers in the coming days on how and when we will repair their vehicles and had it not been for the Kuga issue, Europe would've been profitable for the third quarter. Now since Europe began its sweeping redesign of the regional business in 2018, the European team successfully rationalized the manufacturing footprint, shifted resources to our leading position in commercial vehicles and dramatically lowered structural cost. This year the Europe team is on track to deliver $1 billion of annual structural cost reductions. Now relative to mix, our commercial vehicle mix share increased by 50 basis points to 15.1% for the quarter and SUVs accounted for more than 30% of our vehicle mix in Europe nearly 9 points higher than a year ago. Turning to China, wholesale shipments in China were up 22% and that's the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth that reflects strong sales of SUVs and commercial vehicles. Our mix of SUVs increased 13 percentage points to 36% and that was driven by locally built Ford Explorer, Escape and Lincoln Aviator and Corsair with Lincoln delivering its best ever quarterly sales in China and as planned, over 65% of Lincoln vehicles are now produced locally following the introduction of the Corsair and the Aviator in the first half of 2020. Commercial vehicle sale mix increased, 5% five percentage points to 45% and that reflects strong JMC sale, up 38% versus prior year and that reflects the continued strong demand for light trucks, vans and pickups. So overall, the team delivered a third consecutive quarter of year-over-year share gains and marked the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in EBIT, the best performance in three years. In South America, [audio gap] mitigating the ongoing pressure from inflation, currency and the industry structural challenges. And in IMG, IMG delivered a profit despite COVID-related industry declines in wholesale, which adversely affected the revenue. S-series gained share and our share with the Ranger pickup in Australia increased 6 points to 27%. Profitability in IMG also benefited from the work the team has done to lower structural cost. And finally, Ford Mobility, which is building fourth-generation autonomous test vehicles with the latest self driving technology, generated its first AV-related revenue from a fleet operations pilot in Austin, Texas, and at the same time, we are strategically expanding our spin scooter business in the US, the UK and Germany in generating strong revenue growth. Now before taking your questions, I'll make a few comments about the fourth quarter, which assumes no meaningful change to the current economic environment, continued steady improvement in the stability of the global automotive supply base and no further significant COVID-related disruptions to production or disruptions since the third quarter. Our guidance for adjusted company EBIT for the fourth quarter is between a loss of $500 million and breakeven. Now we recognize this is a big change both sequentially and year-over-year so I want to step through the key sequential drivers. First, we expect a reduction in wholesale of about 100,000 units associated with the F 150 changeover. Now this volume affect is a result of our measured production ramp-up plan to ensure that every vehicle we wholesale is gate released with the highest possible quality for our customers. Now to put this in context, the approximate 100,000 unit impact in the fourth quarter will far outweigh the effect of our UAW ratification bonus in Q4 of last year, which was worth about $600 million. Second, we also expect higher structural and other costs from the manufacturing launch activities for the Mustang Maki and the Bronco Sport as well as advertising launch activities for the new products, including the all-new bronco brand and higher material and other costs and we expect EBT from Ford Credit to be lower sequentially driven by strong but lower auction values and lower disposal at auction. With this fourth-quarter guidance, we now expect full year adjusted company EBIT to be profitable for the year. Other elements of our guidance for the year are unchanged with the exception of capital expenditures. We now expect a lower level for this year down between $1.2 billion and $1.7 billion versus $7.6 billion in 2019 and that reflects continued efficiencies. Before we move to Q&A I want to leave you with my key takeaways from the quarter. We had better execution, choosing word of play and our restructuring is paying off. These things intersected very nicely with the stronger-than-expected demand, we know there's more to fix and we're carrying on a clear plan to do that as Jim mentioned and our balance sheet is solid with nearly $30 billion of cash and over $45 billion of liquidity. Now operator, let's open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] And our first question will come from the line of John Murphy, Bank of America.\nJohn Murphy: Thanks for all the info and congrats Jim for leading the call here. Interesting stuff early days. Just a first question as you look at the strength in the third quarter, obviously there is great execution and some strategy around volume, mix and price that was held by good industry dynamics. I was just curious if you think about those three key factors once we get through the change of the F 150 in the fourth quarter and might bleed into your first quarter of next year, how much you think will reverse and as you look at what you're producing at the moment and your focus shifted next to a richer mix, how much of this stuff can be -- how much have been benefit of factors can be maintained going into 2021 or maybe just even on a run rate basis getting into 21 that would be great.\nJim Farley: So went when you look at that and we look at the business this year really get into the core of the run rate a bit difficult as you can expect given going down in the first half and then coming back up and the launches we have for the quarter and so from a cost standpoint, we're going to continue to focus as we said on making sure that we can really leading into what we need to do to improve the business, improve the underperforming parts of the business and when it comes to the mix and the top line, we saw some strength there. We have winded our back due to the strong supply -- strong demand with the short supply. So seeing that going forward, we've been seeing our mix improve into our strengths of trucks, SUVs and our atomic nameplates and we continue to expect to push that, but as far as a run rate and what we see into 2021, we're not ready to talk about that at this point and we'll come back and will have more to say on that early 2021, we'll give you a read on the business then.\nJohn Murphy: Maybe to follow-up on that, how much of that you think is somewhat transitory for market factors, can you argue right now that the industry volume is pretty -- is relatively strong relative to the peers, but is not really in absolute terms quite and quite that amazing. So it seems like there is an underlying demand for stronger mix than we all may have thought since 12, 18, 24 months ago. So as you're going after this mix with this improved product, is there something that you see in the market just specifically even in the third quarter because it's really heavy stuff that you're running into real positive.\nJim Farley: Yeah it is a positive, we see strength there. The question is, there was an imbalance in supply and demand and that gave us some of a tailwind, but we also are seeing over time as we've over the last two years made the concerted effort to shift into our strengths of commercial vehicles and trucks and you see that in Europe and you see that here. I see that around the world. So we do see strength there as far as how far that extends and what that looks like we're not ready to common now, but we do see strength there.\nJohn Murphy: Okay. And maybe just one last question on lease deferrals, how many recent did you defer in the second quarter that came back in the third quarter or might come back in the coming quarters and sort of envision when you see auction values I should say being very strong. How long do you expect that to continue because it just seems like there's a lot of positive news on these lease deferrals as well as what's going in these vehicle market that's helping out now just Ford Motor credit but the core new vehicle businesses as well.\nMarion Harris: Hey John, so this is Marion Harris. We did a bunch of payment extensions for loans and leases, but if you're referring to lease deferrals for lease ins where our unit comes back to auction, we didn't really do many of those and we had a pretty big inventory of used vehicles going into the third quarter and as we sold those units into an improving market, that's really what was the real benefit for Ford Credit. If you were talking about payment extensions though, of the we extended about 11% of our retail loan and lease portfolio and of that about 99% of those have already made a payment and we're back to pre-pandemic levels of extensions.\nJohn Murphy: Okay. So as far as what you're selling into the auctions right now, it's normal run rate of these returns flow into record auctions and no ebbs or flows or pulls by you.\nJim Farley: That's correct. We're back in normal inventory.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research.\nRod Lache: Congratulations on the performance in the quarter. I hope it is the sign of things to come. I had three questions for you; number one, Jim you\u2019ve talked about 10% margin target for North America for some time and now you\u2019ve shown that you can get there obviously Q4 this one phase will be a bit challenging, but could you talk a little bit about what you're thinking about as the timeline for getting to that kind of a target more sustainably. Secondly, I notice that the warranty cost moderated a bit, at least the cost inflation moderated. Is that a sign that things are finally peeking and then lastly, the drumbeat of activity in notification obviously is something everyone's hearing and companies are laying out some pretty aggressive targets for cost reduction volumes. The Maki looks great, but it's still a relatively low volume product. Can you just talk a little bit about what your thinking is and how your thinking has evolved on what kind of volume you're anticipating or how aggressively you intend to move into electrification on some of those commercial products?\nJim Farley: On North America, I think it's really important for us to be clear. Turnaround on automotive operations in North America needs to absolutely be at 10% plus. As you can see from the pricing and the mix, I think Ford is the strongest brand in the US industry mainstream brand on pricing and mix. Our issue in North America is cost and growth. On cost, it's really isolated to material cost, which is tied to that higher pricing of course and warranty. Our warranty in the last few years coverages is up $1 billion to $2 billion depending on the year and that is not okay. So although it moderated in the quarter and we have taken a lot of actions on craftsmanship, long-term durability, we have a much bigger ambition to improve the quality of our vehicles. We have taken a lot of countermeasures, they will take time, I'm happy to go into those if you'd like, but I would say our North America 10% is really a cost journey for us because on the gross side, we have a whole new Bronco lineup coming our brand new S-series coming. These are fantastic opportunities for us on the top line for the next many years to come. So our journey to get to 10% is a cost. On electrification, I want to cover that one next because it's very important. There's been a lot written about the electrification of our industry and Ford's bet is different. We're betting on a full lineup of commercial electrified vehicles. We're building a plant at the Rouge. We've been the number one nameplate in US industry. We sell over a 1 million S-series. We have an enormous customer base who are looking to reduce the cost and so I'm not going to get into forecasting the volumes, but we really see in this first inning of electrification and it'll be a long game that plays out over many years that we have tremendous volume opportunity. We are not going after the $100,000 plus market. These are affordable vehicles. They're in the price point in the US, the Maki, the $20,000, $45,000 and $70,000 two real crossovers, huge addressable market here in Western Europe and in commercial, we're not planning a very exclusive small 1% of the addressable US industry. We're talking about these vehicles being 10% plus of the revenue pool in North America at their price. So they look great financially for us. But I guess, we aren\u2019t looking at electrification for the propulsion. We think the real change here is the connectivity and to run a business based on the data. So the upgraded electrical architectures in the Maki and the F 150 electric to me is the most important because it allows us to reduce our costs inside the company and give customers totally different experience and your middle question.\nRod Lache: Yeah the warranty costs, is this a sign that you're starting to get your arms around that and it's going to start that there is visibility on when that's going to start coming back down.\nJim Farley: We have more work to do, that's all I'll say. We are not satisfied with the quality of run rate and may be coming down but that's not what we're targeting. We're targeting a fully competitive level of warranty spend on coverages and that's got lots of zeros next to it. To do that, Rod there's a couple things the team has decided to double down on. For suppliers who ship us van parts, we're to have punitive financial. If there are bad shippers for multiple times, we put more resources in our plants for supplier quality. We have a lot more resources dedicated and a ton of transparency on quality issues that are open for more than 30 days in the company. That's a key metric that we drive our management team to. So those are the kind of changes we made and I wouldn't say this quarter is anything that we're proud of.\nRod Lache: And just to clarify Jim, you didn't really provide a timeline on getting to sustainable 10% or better margin. You said that you've got visibility on the revenue side and you still have work to do on the cost side. So is there a line of sight for you one on that? It seems like the product side and the revenue side for North America looks pretty powerful as you look out to next year.\nJim Farley: Yes.\nRod Lache: Okay. We'll follow-up offline thanks.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Emmanuel Rosner, Deutsche Bank.\nEmmanuel Rosner: Jim and John first congratulations on your new roles and Jim every encouraged by your commitment transparency and measurable improvements. So I guess in that spirit, when we look at I guess at your performance in the quarter, besides for the stronger demand pricing mix which you commented on, are you able to point us to measurable areas of underlying improvement that you\u2019ve seen whether it is on these material freight. You spoke a little bit about warranty on the structural side, anything that's really bearing some fruit that you're excited about or should we think about it more as a opportunity for the future.\nJim Farley: When you look at that -- when you look at that cost performance for the quarter, you really look at what we talked about with Europe is all the restructuring they've done, the headcount that they've taken out, they're now approaching and they will approach this year that billion dollars of structural cost reductions. And so we saw that flow through that's coming through and that's going to continue to come through. What the team has done in South America in restructuring the business down there, getting out of low profitable vehicles, selling the Bernardo plant and all the actions they've taken on their structure and headcount, that's going to continue to flow through and then we saw good performance out of international markets group this quarter. They were profitable and a lot of that -- most of that was driven on the back of structural cost reductions. As far as what we saw here in North America, I think with the strength that we had in demand, the short supply, we saw one of our key focuses.\nEmmanuel Rosner: So I guess to get a little bit of color on what needs to be done on the warranty side and quality side, what is being done or can be done. I don't need a quantification, but just in terms of what does it require to get the material and freight, you show that's down, it looks like this is probably one of the two largest markets on the cost side here?\nJim Farley: So thanks, thanks for your question. On the material cost side, it's kind of everywhere. A good example, we have a proximity, a key in your pocket to unlock the door and all four doors of the F150. When we look at the vehicle usage data, we found that people don\u2019t use the proximity sensor for the front two tours. We do not need a proximity sensor in the rear two doors. Our Jack on the F150 looks like it'll last about 50 years. That's not the case for our competitors. So it's everything from the way we package our features, the actual bill material and the team has been working through all these opportunities since February. We made progress but we need to make a lot more progress especially with the more expensive launch vehicles and I think the real enabler is going to be complexity reduction. We've been talking about complexity reduction as a company for quite some time as a key fitness for the leadership team, but we have a lot more work to do on complexity reduction and that will be a huge enabler for not only our manufacturing operations, but also our material cost.\nEmmanuel Rosner: And then finally, there was no specific guidance on free cash flow for the fourth quarter. I think in the last earnings call, there was that quarter financial be better than the EBIT in the fourth quarter worse than fourth quarter EBIT any sort of sense you can give us on this quarter's free cash flow and whether there will be some of timing on eCapital payback from the strength that we've seen in the fourth quarter.\nJohn Lawler: In the quarter we got payables back to what we would say is a normal run rate and so from a standpoint of the guidance on the cash flow for the quarter, for the fourth quarter it's going to frankly have said with EBIT it's going to be driven by EBIT. So we haven't given a specific number on that and at this point, I'm not sure we're going to do that today.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Jonas: Thanks everyone. Jim I've got a few questions for you. I think you mentioned the freight that EVs look great financially I think when you're looking out that they seem to line up well financially. Could you elaborate on that? My understanding is that EVs present a really great opportunity to decomplexify the vehicle, even allowing for the expensive battery cost. So things that you can remove from an EV and that way you can design a lot more efficiently relative to the spiderweb of complexity of the internal combustion mechanisms that and it's a great opportunity. Am I correct in that assumption and I just didn\u2019t know I wanted to hear if you could add some color to that hypothesis?\nJim Farley: I guess the three key messages for our electrification strategy, the companies were going after very large addressable markets and profit pools and were playing to our strengths, I'll come back to your question. The second is to turn battery electrics into a digital -- quite important for the company to transition as well. Related to the cost, initially several years ago when we made these investments and decisions, the cost of battery that the profitability the vehicle is really challenging, what we found since then, once we started to look at the real cost of CO2 of our internal combustion engine, when we started to look at in commercial terms offering bidirectional charging, bringing charging to the job site and electricity job site, we started to realize that there's a lot more revenue opportunity, a lot lower cost in marketing because of the connected services and of course the cost the way how the team looked at the cost of our battery, we used kind of a temporary overcapacity situation to get very competitive cost and also cherry pick the best chemistry out there. All that kind of team together with much more compelling financial picture for these first cycle products. I think that's what I was referring to when you look at all-in comparison to Ice [ph]. Also the revenue opportunity, we never really when we got into the commercial world of electrification, I think our eyes were very open and very informed by the aluminum investment in F150 that people are willing to pay in the case of light waiting, more than just light waiting fuel economy, it's a commercial vehicle for towing and payload. When you think about bringing energy to the job site or bidirectional charging for small medium sized businesses kind of a game changer for them in terms of for us to revenue. I hope that makes sense.\nAdam Jonas: Yeah it does and you seem to have for even before you became CEO, expressed a lot of enthusiasm toward the software services, the data opportunity for the company. I think you said you want to run that business based on the data. Can you be specific on what services get you most excited and when that could be material?\nJim Farley: Great question. So first of all it starts with the talent. We attracted Alex Purdy from Deere who went through the whole Deere journey moving to software and data. We attracted Gil who is now our data analytics lead, we've had the talent on board for enough time. We really understand the opportunity. I think the opportunity first came Adam with internal of the company. You can imagine with our warranties, the data codes off the vehicle instantaneously having AI models analyzing all those data codes, how exciting that is to our frontline engineers, how exciting it is to have that data be available to all of our engineers on actually the bill of material and its usefulness for a company that has very expensive billing material. But then it became very quick for us especially when we got outside of Dearborn and listen to the opportunity on services that over the air updates that are really relevant to the customer in case of commercial. They run their businesses off these vehicles. So dynamic routing, telematics, driver coaching to drive more economically the people that have our small fleets, they just love this because they haven't had that data before and we can see a day, not too distant future with a full line up of pure better electric commercials. We have a whole service business and that service business is charging, its small enterprise solutions, small medium-size businesses, it's repair a more affordable repair and upgrade of this physical vehicle and that's what we're busy doing. That's our double transformation; one is to transform a automotive operations, the other one is in a way to kind of disrupt ourselves\nOperator: And our next question is going to come from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JP Morgan.\nRyan Brinkman: Thanks for taking my question, which relates to the upcoming F150 launch. Can you remind us of the timing and the impact you expect both in terms of the profit or margin headwind from the lower production during the changeover as well as the benefit to sales mixer or pricing subsequent to the rollout of the new version and how should investors think about execution risk during the launch? Can you talk about your confidence level there and I know that will go according to plan and what steps that maybe you're taking to mitigate the risk?\nJim Farley: I'll answer the last question first on the product launch. We've spent a lot of time on these launches. It's very important as you understand and making sure we have all the design and engineering ready to go. We've made all the checkpoints and suppliers are ready, manufacturing is ready and we've started that production. We haven't discussed what we expect from a pricing standpoint or what we expect from margin standpoint of new truck and I don't think we want to talk about that today, but what we did talk about is the fact that we are taking a very pragmatic ramp-up plan to make sure that we deliver these with quality and that's leading us to have wholesales on a sequential basis down about 100,000 units and that's what's impacting the fourth quarter. But getting any deeper than that I am not sure we're going to get into that today as far as the pricing and the cost impact of the vehicle.\nJohn Lawler: And as far as the launch to complement John, we are so excited about this new F150 all-new powertrains that's towing best payload, it's the best 150 we very had and we do see the inside, it's incredible, the technology and customers are asking us for that. Look we've completed the design phase, the engineering phase, Howard and the team did a great job and we then finished the supplier readiness and manufacturing readiness. My whole leadership team and myself went to both plants personally to review the launches a couple times and we're now in high production starting the ramp-up curve at Dearborn and Kansas City. We expect to start soon. I think we don't know until we start getting up that ramp curve, what we're going to see but I'd say one of the things that will complement the Ford team how Linda [ph] cash the whole team was the way we use COVID. During the COVID shutdown, we didn't stop with the quality assessment of the launch and there was a lot of work done on the software specially. This is all new electrical architecture. There's a ton new software and we use that downtime to really prove out our capability and so we're a long way from declaring victory. It's a daily huge global team working on the F150 launch but we work through the launch so far. We've made a lot of progress as a team and now we're into mass production. So stay tuned.\nRyan Brinkman: And then lastly wanted to ask about the strong net pricing that you've been enjoying in Europe and South America. Can talk about how you think your net pricing is tracking relative to the industry in those regions and is the pricing strength more a function of the success of your company specific product launches or are there other more macro factors that play for example as auto makers work to offsetting lower FX in South America etcetera. Where are you in terms of your product life cycles in these regions and how should we expect pricing to track going forward?\nJohn Lawler: Yeah. So let's just impact that a little bit, if you look at Europe, we've had a strong shift into our SUVs as we talked about earlier and with that has come pricing power relative to the other vehicle life and we expect that to continue in Europe. Down in South America, the team has been aggressive and you're seeing products shift there that's driving some of the net pricing as well, the strength in pricing because we're getting out of low profit, lower end vehicles and we're being very focused on driving towards higher margin products like Ranger and some of the other strengths that we have in the region. So we're going to see that continue through. And then in Europe they're managing through revenue management looking at everything we're doing the same thing here in North America. It's a focus we have and a lot of it's being driven by our strong mix. We are seeing some pricing for product as new product coming out and that's flowing through as well. So we're very focused on driving the top line as best we can, but equally and more focused on the cost as Jim has talked about as we've talked about, that's one of our main focus is keep moving forward on the top line and really hone in and focusing on getting the cost right.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is going to come from the line of Mark Delaney, Goldman Sachs.\nMark Delaney: Jim and John, you spoke to having urgency in achieving your goals, in altercation that includes an electric F150 in transit as few of the several electrified models that Ford is planning to bring to market over the next two years. I was hoping to better understand if the company plans to go beyond its $11.5 billion investment target in electrification as is previously articulated and does Ford plan to increase in particular number of bad models compared to its prior expectation?\nJim Farley: I think the simple way to look at is, we're kind of in the first inning of this transition of the industry to battery electric future and we're deep into the planning for the second cycle of those products. Competitive reasons, we're not going to share the cycle plan with you, but you can imagine that we're getting more and more excited about electric future. Now we have some great ice products and we think that that market will still be robust, but we're making our bets on iconic retail vehicles and electric is deftly something that we're more and more excited about in our capitals following. We don't want to just be one of the many OEMs to transition to electric. We want to lead the electric change. That's why we're committed to Paris. That's why we're standing with California and that's our capital and we feel that the way we're doing it at Ford is the most important message, which is commercial and work. Those customers run their business on these vehicles. They're more attentive to cost of ownership, the vehicles of higher utilization and therefore the lower cost of ownership of operation is more important to them and they're especially interested in the data and so I think although we could talk about general investment levels, the key message from Ford is more the segments that we're investing in and that this is not a propulsion story. This is an investment in the digitization of our business.\nMark Delaney: Thanks and you commented that because of the total recall, you're going to have a CO2 compliance cost this year. Are you anticipating a similar level of cost in the fourth quarter as was realized in 3Q and then perhaps more importantly, can you discuss if you think this issue will be resolved and is there risk to any of your other hybrid or better products?\nJohn Lawler: So from a cost standpoint, I'll start with that. As I said earlier it's about $400 million for the quarter. We do expect some cost in the fourth quarter somewhere between $100 million to $200 million. So that's the impact we see as it is today and that does also -- that includes the impact of the pooling effort that we're going to have to undertake for our passenger vehicle in Europe.\nJim Farley: And the battery that is used in the Cougar PHEV is not -- so it's a supply [audio gap].\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays.\nBrian Johnson: Thank you and congratulations to the new Ford team. I want to drill down on the European CO2 compliance strategy both on the light vehicle side and the LCB side. So first on the LCD side, which of course as you identified to our different standards, is that on track and when can we expect an MEB derived LCV platform for Europe?\nJim Farley: First of all, we have a great plan for Europe. We were on track for our CO2 target this year until the Cougar PHEV situation came up with the supplier late in the year. As I mentioned today it's a bit new news maybe not as dramatic as a $100,000 retail off-road, but the electric transit is a really big deal for Ford Motor Company. We're number one in the US, we're number one in Western Europe and we think electrifying this products has been really key and that will be a key part of our CO2 compliance announcement. So we continue seeing more city restrictions. Many, many of our small medium-size business owners are now asking for all electric solution and we also think the quality of the product will be a benefit for our European customers as well. The Maki will be are sold in Europe next year in volume and so we have a great plan next year with the Maki and we have a number of hybrids coming out next year in Europe and mile hybrids could be specific but we really have a great lineup in Europe over 20 models, but the leadership team really excited about Europe is the commercial vehicle business and the electrification of our high-volume van.\nBrian Johnson: I would concur on that. So moving over to the light vehicle passenger car and CV market, it struck assuming as a split of the pandemic with many viewing plug-in hybrids as a transition and million plus unit global EV platforms is the way to go. A, what's your thinking on that strategy and B, as we go into '21, '22, can you flex between BEVs and plug-in hybrids or even move to a more consolidated BEV platform for Europe.\nJim Farley: I think the flexibility between battery electrics plug-ins is not very high. So we're really locked in as we should be. So I wouldn't -- this is not like vehicle mix or something like that. All the battery supplies are slightly different and also the lead time for changing battery capacity is a lot longer than most other major components in the vehicle. So I would think about those capacities in terms of flexibility very different than I would traditional ice power train.\nBrian Johnson: Okay. And finally can you disclose or can you disclose who the pulling agreement is with and will become a public record at some point in EU.\nJim Farley: We're not going to do that today, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Dan Levy with Credit Suisse.\nDan Levy: Jim wanted to start out on a strategic question, on how you plan to balance the near-term industrial recovery, it's been a long cycle longer term transition to EV. How many and how you view the interplay of those two? Is piece of EV development that's regardless of the pace in your near-term recovery or should we look at pace of EV development by the extent of near-term recovery, so if you outperforming on your near term, you can accelerate on EV advice per se recovery? What's the interplay and near-term recovery in your EV development?\nJim Farley: First of all for Ford, our plan is very simple, turnaround automotive operations, modernize the company and in a way disrupt ourselves, launch high-growth businesses like our CB services business or go to market customer facing EV business and so our calls on capital are much more complicated in just EV end vehicles. We have 15,000 software engineers at Ford right now and that will grow. So our calls on capital, our software, the credit company obviously, but increasingly it's these services businesses and we need talent, we need cash and capital to support them. It's all funded essentially by our core automotive operations and so the turnaround of automotive operations is not just a stakeholder journey. It's actually the lifeblood of our future because it funds everything and so how we look at it is getting out our automotive operations overseas to profit and then a solid sustainable return dealing with the issues of passenger cars in Europe and South America and India the three problem areas we've had in automotive and getting our North American operations 10% plus is an absolute minimum for the company to fund not just the electrification journey, but as well on move to services, data and software.\nDan Levy: So help me understand as far as you have these larger cost -- capital call and presumably you have probably and then also it's nice to have it in terms of your investment. Does the pace of recovery at all impact the way that you accelerate or decelerate spend on those?\nJim Farley: These are great questions. If you don't mind I don't -- I think it's best if we take a pass and we talk about this next spring. It is such a fundamental question you're asking. It is such an important question for Ford. I don't think the third-quarter earnings is the right venue. We need to take our time and go through this with you and all of the key stakeholders at Ford and I think you'll find it for all of us to be a lot wiser if we just take more time and we have specifics for you.\nDan Levy: And then just a follow-up on the comp factors of growth, your focus on top line growth I think it's also clear at the same time you're likely willing to further sacrifice some of what maybe we can call global quality of more the commoditized pass card volume. So question is and we've already some structural volume decline in North America related to pass card in Europe as well, but did you give us a sense of maybe how much more we might expect to see volume decline in the coming years related to more commoditized products? Or maybe said differently, which region do you think there is more way to go or moving more commoditized that type volume?\nJim Farley: Well thank you for your question. It's a very important one for us. After several years of making really tough choices, we now have the opportunity in North America to grow and I'll emphasize again that is something there I'd put in my speech and I think it's quite important for everyone to understand our ambition. As John mentioned, our share of SUV grew. Our mix of SUV grew, our car share is declining almost to below 10% now and our North America share increased one full point in the quarter and we have Bronco we've never had before. We have Maki that we've never had before and we're really excited about the profit potential for all those vehicles. So here we are on the eve of Ford Motor Company being able to execute well and grow in North America. When you look outside of North American, the growth that matters for us is commercial vehicles in Europe. The key growth metric for us in China we had an opportunity to grow again. We just localized the Explorer and the whole Lincoln line up. We haven't sold as many Lincolns that we did in September in 25 years and it's because of China. So we have a huge opportunity to grow China and we have an opportunity to grow to with export models coming from Mahindra and have to say we haven't talked a lot about this, but leak it out and that is we have some really exciting affordable products for North America that are going to help us grow profitably. So I think what you'll see is China and North America growth opportunities and the rest of the world we'll really focus on where we can win with Ranger, the commercial vehicles in Europe and you'll see us continue to grow these services businesses along the way. I hope if there is one message you'll get from Ford from this leadership team is that we're really trying to think everyone -- asking everyone to think about growth at Ford is more than volume growth. We want to growth our software business, our services business.\nOperator: And our last question for the day will come from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.\nJoseph Spak: Maybe just two quick ones since we touched on a lot. I realize you are not talking about free cash flow for the fourth quarter but the Ford Credit EBT year-to-date is $1.7 billion, distribution $1.1 and I think you committed in the past defending all that out. So should we expect a catch up in the fourth quarter?\nJim Farley: I'm not sure but I'm quite clear on the catch up is. I think that we've been distributing from Ford Credit on a regular basis throughout the year. So I wouldn't expect there to be anything out of the ordinary there. Marion?\nMarion Harris: Joe, the distributions from Ford Credit are going to reflect profit after tax, balance sheet size and leverage that it's going to be what's it going to be.\nJoseph Spak: And then just lastly John, I saw in the media I think made a comment about how it's too early to talk about the dividend reinstatement. I realize ultimately it's a board decision, but I'll this up I guess to Jim and John in each of your opinion should Ford give any dividend over the coming years given the transformation you're talking about and if so, what are really the parameters you're looking for, for reinstating that?\nJim Farley: Thanks for the question. I don't think this is the time to have that discussion. I think we need to have that framed up in our total capital strategy and calls on capital and where we're headed as a business and I think next spring would be the time to do that.\nOperator: Thank you. That will conclude today's Ford Motor Company third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. We do appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jim Farley",
            "content": "Thanks Lynn and hi everyone. First let me say how humbled I am and what a privilege it is to be the CEO of Ford. My family has been with Ford since 1916 when my grandfather started at Highland Park here in Michigan and in that moment our family story really started to change for the better and countless people over have similar stories about Ford. We're a family company. From the leadership a Bill Ford all the way to the members on our factory floor. I'm extremely motivated to help build a vibrant and growing Ford that will have a positive effect for generations to come, benefiting all of our stakeholders. Now we've assembled a very talented leadership team to get this done. A combination of strong, lifetime and long time Ford people who truly know our business, but we also have new colleagues. We had very different experiences and knowhow and talents to the company to execute our plan and we plan to continue to add to this bench with key capabilities in marketing, technology and many other areas. Over the past several months, I've spoken to many of you and I believe the plan we now have and have developed and are now executing on aligns well with many of your expectations. We're committed to creating Ford that grows profitably and generate sustainable free cash flow, led by our automotive business and we're going to allocate capital to the best and highest usage to drive sustainable value creation. Now that plan which was introduced to the Ford team and many stakeholders on October 1 is very straightforward. Among other things, number one we will compete like challenger, earning each customer with great products, but as well services with rewarding ownership experiences. Number two, we're moving with urgency to turn around our automotive operations, improve our quality, reduce our cost and accelerate the restructuring of underperforming businesses. And third, we're going to grow again, but in the right areas allocating more capital, more resources, more talent to our very strongest businesses and vehicle franchises. Incubating, scaling and integrating new businesses, some of them enabled by new technology like Argo, self-driving system and expanding our leading commercial vehicle business with great margins, but now with a suite of software services that drive loyalty and generate reoccurring annuity-like revenue streams and being a leader in electric vehicle revolution around the world, where we have strengthen and scale. So now speaking about EVs, to start with, we're developing all new electric versions of the F-150 into transit, the two most important, highest volume commercial vehicles are in our industry. These leading vehicles really drive the commercial vehicle business at Fort and we're electrifying them. We own work at Fort in these electric vehicles will be true work vehicles, extremely capable and with unique digital services in over their capabilities to improve the productivity and uptime of our important commercial customers. The electric transit by the way will be revealed next month and you heard about it here first for all of our global markets. We believe the addressable market for our fully electric commercial van and pick up, the two largest addressable profit pools in commercial are going to be massive and we're going straight at this opportunity. Together, we think the accessible price points of these vehicles, the productivity, the capability, the cost of ownership will be very compelling for some of our customers and frankly, Ford is not only in front of developing the electric transit in F 150, we also have an unmatched dealer base to provide that anywhere service or great uptime for our customers with a great customer base, with deep know-how on their usage and expertise in the commercial vehicle business such as the largest updater community there is, period. Also in the coming weeks we will deliver the first Mustang Mach-E to customers in the US and Europe. The reservations have been very strong for this vehicle and soon after it will go on sale even in China. Now 30 years of being in this wonderful business, I've never been so pumped up about one of our -- one of the retail vehicles. I recently had a chance to put a 1,000 miles on a Maki and that Mustang and that engineering team have pride -- had vehicle out of my hands. They just elevated experience the way it drives, the connected technology in the cabin, the ingenious cloud enabled services, it's all in the heart of the market from a price point. Such a large addressable market the two row crossover business and we have a real advantage especially in US with the EV tax credit. Now you're going to see our strategy of electrifying our leading commercial vehicles and our iconic high-volume products expand very quickly at Ford. It's also important to note there we're building out our electric vehicle manufacturing footprint around the world and we now have four plants in North America alone, including an all-new carbon neutral factory going up at the Rouge plant as we speak a few miles from here. We're also recently finalized an agreement with the Canadian Auto Workers Union, Unifor, that paves the way for future electric SUVs to be built by our team and for Canada. Now as we execute our plan, my commitment to each of you is transparency, including purposeful, measurable key performance indicators. So you can objectively track our progress. We plan to provide you with more details about our plan including financial targets in the spring. With that let me briefly touch on the robust third quarter and what we have on tap for the fourth quarter. When you look at our results, they reflect a benefit of our decision two years ago to allocate capital to our strongest franchises, namely pickups, a whole range of utilities across the world, commercial vehicles and iconic passenger vehicles. Additionally, we saw higher-than-expected demand for our new vehicles in the quarter. At a time when inventories are really low following the virus-related first-half factory shutdowns. Now that contributed to a very favorable pricing environment and mix. Together these factors plus the strong performance from the Ford -- the strongest performance from For Credit in 15 years led to a total company adjusted EBIT margin of 9.7%, that's 490 basis points higher than last year. As an outcome of all this, we generated $6.3 billion in adjusted free cash flow. Throughout 2020, even during the industrywide shutdown of COVID and as we prioritize the safety of our team, we've been disciplined in preparing for high-quality fourth-quarter launch, first of the 2021 F 150 to live in, you work in it, you can sleep in it. The Bronco Sport, the first of many Broncos to come and my favorite, the all new all electric Mustang Maki. In fact we use an unanticipated downtime to continue to validate the preparations for these important launch vehicles and in the case of the F 150, a methodical sell down and the changeover for our current model. While I'm proud of our team, I'm delighted to say that we're in good shape in important areas of readiness for these launches. Software, the hardware engineering is done, supplier manufacturing readiness looks great, in fact right now, are all new F 150s are rolling off the line in Dearborn as we speak and production will soon start at Kansas City and we're starting to build the Mustang Maki and the Bronco Sport actually early this week. Before I turn over to John, I want to thank each of you for joining us today. Despite the strong numbers in the third quarter, we know we haven't fixed the issues that held us back in our automotive business. They include warranty cost, which remain unacceptably high. I plan to be transparent and focused on both customer and shareholder value, proving out this business and are plan quarter after quarter, year after year. And now John let's take everyone to details. So went when you look at that and we look at the business this year really get into the core of the run rate a bit difficult as you can expect given going down in the first half and then coming back up and the launches we have for the quarter and so from a cost standpoint, we're going to continue to focus as we said on making sure that we can really leading into what we need to do to improve the business, improve the underperforming parts of the business and when it comes to the mix and the top line, we saw some strength there. We have winded our back due to the strong supply -- strong demand with the short supply. So seeing that going forward, we've been seeing our mix improve into our strengths of trucks, SUVs and our atomic nameplates and we continue to expect to push that, but as far as a run rate and what we see into 2021, we're not ready to talk about that at this point and we'll come back and will have more to say on that early 2021, we'll give you a read on the business then. Yeah it is a positive, we see strength there. The question is, there was an imbalance in supply and demand and that gave us some of a tailwind, but we also are seeing over time as we've over the last two years made the concerted effort to shift into our strengths of commercial vehicles and trucks and you see that in Europe and you see that here. I see that around the world. So we do see strength there as far as how far that extends and what that looks like we're not ready to common now, but we do see strength there. That's correct. We're back in normal inventory. On North America, I think it's really important for us to be clear. Turnaround on automotive operations in North America needs to absolutely be at 10% plus. As you can see from the pricing and the mix, I think Ford is the strongest brand in the US industry mainstream brand on pricing and mix. Our issue in North America is cost and growth. On cost, it's really isolated to material cost, which is tied to that higher pricing of course and warranty. Our warranty in the last few years coverages is up $1 billion to $2 billion depending on the year and that is not okay. So although it moderated in the quarter and we have taken a lot of actions on craftsmanship, long-term durability, we have a much bigger ambition to improve the quality of our vehicles. We have taken a lot of countermeasures, they will take time, I'm happy to go into those if you'd like, but I would say our North America 10% is really a cost journey for us because on the gross side, we have a whole new Bronco lineup coming our brand new S-series coming. These are fantastic opportunities for us on the top line for the next many years to come. So our journey to get to 10% is a cost. On electrification, I want to cover that one next because it's very important. There's been a lot written about the electrification of our industry and Ford's bet is different. We're betting on a full lineup of commercial electrified vehicles. We're building a plant at the Rouge. We've been the number one nameplate in US industry. We sell over a 1 million S-series. We have an enormous customer base who are looking to reduce the cost and so I'm not going to get into forecasting the volumes, but we really see in this first inning of electrification and it'll be a long game that plays out over many years that we have tremendous volume opportunity. We are not going after the $100,000 plus market. These are affordable vehicles. They're in the price point in the US, the Maki, the $20,000, $45,000 and $70,000 two real crossovers, huge addressable market here in Western Europe and in commercial, we're not planning a very exclusive small 1% of the addressable US industry. We're talking about these vehicles being 10% plus of the revenue pool in North America at their price. So they look great financially for us. But I guess, we aren't looking at electrification for the propulsion. We think the real change here is the connectivity and to run a business based on the data. So the upgraded electrical architectures in the Maki and the F 150 electric to me is the most important because it allows us to reduce our costs inside the company and give customers totally different experience and your middle question. We have more work to do, that's all I'll say. We are not satisfied with the quality of run rate and may be coming down but that's not what we're targeting. We're targeting a fully competitive level of warranty spend on coverages and that's got lots of zeros next to it. To do that, Rod there's a couple things the team has decided to double down on. For suppliers who ship us van parts, we're to have punitive financial. If there are bad shippers for multiple times, we put more resources in our plants for supplier quality. We have a lot more resources dedicated and a ton of transparency on quality issues that are open for more than 30 days in the company. That's a key metric that we drive our management team to. So those are the kind of changes we made and I wouldn't say this quarter is anything that we're proud of. Yes. When you look at that -- when you look at that cost performance for the quarter, you really look at what we talked about with Europe is all the restructuring they've done, the headcount that they've taken out, they're now approaching and they will approach this year that billion dollars of structural cost reductions. And so we saw that flow through that's coming through and that's going to continue to come through. What the team has done in South America in restructuring the business down there, getting out of low profitable vehicles, selling the Bernardo plant and all the actions they've taken on their structure and headcount, that's going to continue to flow through and then we saw good performance out of international markets group this quarter. They were profitable and a lot of that -- most of that was driven on the back of structural cost reductions. As far as what we saw here in North America, I think with the strength that we had in demand, the short supply, we saw one of our key focuses. So thanks, thanks for your question. On the material cost side, it's kind of everywhere. A good example, we have a proximity, a key in your pocket to unlock the door and all four doors of the F150. When we look at the vehicle usage data, we found that people don't use the proximity sensor for the front two tours. We do not need a proximity sensor in the rear two doors. Our Jack on the F150 looks like it'll last about 50 years. That's not the case for our competitors. So it's everything from the way we package our features, the actual bill material and the team has been working through all these opportunities since February. We made progress but we need to make a lot more progress especially with the more expensive launch vehicles and I think the real enabler is going to be complexity reduction. We've been talking about complexity reduction as a company for quite some time as a key fitness for the leadership team, but we have a lot more work to do on complexity reduction and that will be a huge enabler for not only our manufacturing operations, but also our material cost. I guess the three key messages for our electrification strategy, the companies were going after very large addressable markets and profit pools and were playing to our strengths, I'll come back to your question. The second is to turn battery electrics into a digital -- quite important for the company to transition as well. Related to the cost, initially several years ago when we made these investments and decisions, the cost of battery that the profitability the vehicle is really challenging, what we found since then, once we started to look at the real cost of CO2 of our internal combustion engine, when we started to look at in commercial terms offering bidirectional charging, bringing charging to the job site and electricity job site, we started to realize that there's a lot more revenue opportunity, a lot lower cost in marketing because of the connected services and of course the cost the way how the team looked at the cost of our battery, we used kind of a temporary overcapacity situation to get very competitive cost and also cherry pick the best chemistry out there. All that kind of team together with much more compelling financial picture for these first cycle products. I think that's what I was referring to when you look at all-in comparison to Ice [ph]. Also the revenue opportunity, we never really when we got into the commercial world of electrification, I think our eyes were very open and very informed by the aluminum investment in F150 that people are willing to pay in the case of light waiting, more than just light waiting fuel economy, it's a commercial vehicle for towing and payload. When you think about bringing energy to the job site or bidirectional charging for small medium sized businesses kind of a game changer for them in terms of for us to revenue. I hope that makes sense. Great question. So first of all it starts with the talent. We attracted Alex Purdy from Deere who went through the whole Deere journey moving to software and data. We attracted Gil who is now our data analytics lead, we've had the talent on board for enough time. We really understand the opportunity. I think the opportunity first came Adam with internal of the company. You can imagine with our warranties, the data codes off the vehicle instantaneously having AI models analyzing all those data codes, how exciting that is to our frontline engineers, how exciting it is to have that data be available to all of our engineers on actually the bill of material and its usefulness for a company that has very expensive billing material. But then it became very quick for us especially when we got outside of Dearborn and listen to the opportunity on services that over the air updates that are really relevant to the customer in case of commercial. They run their businesses off these vehicles. So dynamic routing, telematics, driver coaching to drive more economically the people that have our small fleets, they just love this because they haven't had that data before and we can see a day, not too distant future with a full line up of pure better electric commercials. We have a whole service business and that service business is charging, its small enterprise solutions, small medium-size businesses, it's repair a more affordable repair and upgrade of this physical vehicle and that's what we're busy doing. That's our double transformation; one is to transform a automotive operations, the other one is in a way to kind of disrupt ourselves I'll answer the last question first on the product launch. We've spent a lot of time on these launches. It's very important as you understand and making sure we have all the design and engineering ready to go. We've made all the checkpoints and suppliers are ready, manufacturing is ready and we've started that production. We haven't discussed what we expect from a pricing standpoint or what we expect from margin standpoint of new truck and I don't think we want to talk about that today, but what we did talk about is the fact that we are taking a very pragmatic ramp-up plan to make sure that we deliver these with quality and that's leading us to have wholesales on a sequential basis down about 100,000 units and that's what's impacting the fourth quarter. But getting any deeper than that I am not sure we're going to get into that today as far as the pricing and the cost impact of the vehicle. I think the simple way to look at is, we're kind of in the first inning of this transition of the industry to battery electric future and we're deep into the planning for the second cycle of those products. Competitive reasons, we're not going to share the cycle plan with you, but you can imagine that we're getting more and more excited about electric future. Now we have some great ice products and we think that that market will still be robust, but we're making our bets on iconic retail vehicles and electric is deftly something that we're more and more excited about in our capitals following. We don't want to just be one of the many OEMs to transition to electric. We want to lead the electric change. That's why we're committed to Paris. That's why we're standing with California and that's our capital and we feel that the way we're doing it at Ford is the most important message, which is commercial and work. Those customers run their business on these vehicles. They're more attentive to cost of ownership, the vehicles of higher utilization and therefore the lower cost of ownership of operation is more important to them and they're especially interested in the data and so I think although we could talk about general investment levels, the key message from Ford is more the segments that we're investing in and that this is not a propulsion story. This is an investment in the digitization of our business. And the battery that is used in the Cougar PHEV is not -- so it's a supply [audio gap]. First of all, we have a great plan for Europe. We were on track for our CO2 target this year until the Cougar PHEV situation came up with the supplier late in the year. As I mentioned today it's a bit new news maybe not as dramatic as a $100,000 retail off-road, but the electric transit is a really big deal for Ford Motor Company. We're number one in the US, we're number one in Western Europe and we think electrifying this products has been really key and that will be a key part of our CO2 compliance announcement. So we continue seeing more city restrictions. Many, many of our small medium-size business owners are now asking for all electric solution and we also think the quality of the product will be a benefit for our European customers as well. The Maki will be are sold in Europe next year in volume and so we have a great plan next year with the Maki and we have a number of hybrids coming out next year in Europe and mile hybrids could be specific but we really have a great lineup in Europe over 20 models, but the leadership team really excited about Europe is the commercial vehicle business and the electrification of our high-volume van. I think the flexibility between battery electrics plug-ins is not very high. So we're really locked in as we should be. So I wouldn't -- this is not like vehicle mix or something like that. All the battery supplies are slightly different and also the lead time for changing battery capacity is a lot longer than most other major components in the vehicle. So I would think about those capacities in terms of flexibility very different than I would traditional ice power train. We're not going to do that today, thanks. First of all for Ford, our plan is very simple, turnaround automotive operations, modernize the company and in a way disrupt ourselves, launch high-growth businesses like our CB services business or go to market customer facing EV business and so our calls on capital are much more complicated in just EV end vehicles. We have 15,000 software engineers at Ford right now and that will grow. So our calls on capital, our software, the credit company obviously, but increasingly it's these services businesses and we need talent, we need cash and capital to support them. It's all funded essentially by our core automotive operations and so the turnaround of automotive operations is not just a stakeholder journey. It's actually the lifeblood of our future because it funds everything and so how we look at it is getting out our automotive operations overseas to profit and then a solid sustainable return dealing with the issues of passenger cars in Europe and South America and India the three problem areas we've had in automotive and getting our North American operations 10% plus is an absolute minimum for the company to fund not just the electrification journey, but as well on move to services, data and software. These are great questions. If you don't mind I don't -- I think it's best if we take a pass and we talk about this next spring. It is such a fundamental question you're asking. It is such an important question for Ford. I don't think the third-quarter earnings is the right venue. We need to take our time and go through this with you and all of the key stakeholders at Ford and I think you'll find it for all of us to be a lot wiser if we just take more time and we have specifics for you.

As John mentioned, our share of SUV grew. Our mix of SUV grew, our car share is declining almost to below 10% now and our North America share increased one full point in the quarter and we have Bronco we've never had before. We have Maki that we've never had before and we're really excited about the profit potential for all those vehicles. So here we are on the eve of Ford Motor Company being able to execute well and grow in North America.

So I think what you'll see is China and North America growth opportunities and the rest of the world we'll really focus on where we can win with Ranger, the commercial vehicles in Europe and you'll see us continue to grow these services businesses along the way. I hope if there is one message you'll get from Ford from this leadership team is that we're really trying to think everyone -- asking everyone to think about growth at Ford is more than volume growth. We want to growth our software business, our services business. I'm not sure but I'm quite clear on the catch up is. I think that we've been distributing from Ford Credit on a regular basis throughout the year. So I wouldn't expect there to be anything out of the ordinary there. Marion? Thanks for the question. I don't think this is the time to have that discussion. I think we need to have that framed up in our total capital strategy and calls on capital and where we're headed as a business and I think next spring would be the time to do that."

            "content": "Hey John, so this is Marion Harris. We did a bunch of payment extensions for loans and leases, but if you're referring to lease deferrals for lease ins where our unit comes back to auction, we didn't really do many of those and we had a pretty big inventory of used vehicles going into the third quarter and as we sold those units into an improving market, that's really what was the real benefit for Ford Credit. If you were talking about payment extensions though, of the we extended about 11% of our retail loan and lease portfolio and of that about 99% of those have already made a payment and we're back to pre-pandemic levels of extensions. Joe, the distributions from Ford Credit are going to reflect profit after tax, balance sheet size and leverage that it's going to be what's it going to be."

            "content": "Thanks Jim. First let me say what an honor it is to be the CFO of this great company and you know I really can't remember a time when we've had this much opportunity to transform and grow our business and so it's incredibly exciting and delivering on that potential that's an important responsibility all of us have to our customers and to our stakeholders. Now to be clear, our transformation and growth plan is predicated on delivering an 8% or better adjusted company EBIT margin and consistently generating free cash flow, so we can invest in accretive, high return products and services and so my initial priorities to help drive this are one, help our team fix or dispose of underperforming parts of our business so we can allocate capital to its best and highest use and two, further strengthen our balance sheet. We will make the tough decisions to improve our financial flexibility and ensure that we have the resources to build and grow our business. Now let me summarize the third quarter. As Jim mentioned, we had a strong quarter delivering a 9.7% company adjusted EBIT margin. Now that margin was driven largely by higher-than-expected vehicle demand, positive net pricing and favorable mix as inventories were limited because of the virus-related shutdowns in the first half of the year. North America and China benefited from growth in both wholesales and revenue, while Europe, South America and our international's market group were still affected by COVID-related industry declines. In addition, our performance continues to benefit from our portfolio of refresh as we reallocate capital to our franchise strengths. Ford Credit also contributed, turning in its strongest performance since 2005, generating $1.1 billion in earnings before taxes with help from strong auction values. Now before I talk about the rest of our business, let me put our record $6.3 billion of adjusted free cash flow in perspective. Not only does it reflect the strength of our EBIT in the quarter, but as we indicated last quarter, working capital recovered sharply as we rebuild production to full capacity after a shutdown, largely driven by supplier payables. In the third quarter, the payable build was completed and this was worth about $4 billion. The strong cash flow in the quarter gave us the confidence and the ability to make a second payment on our corporate revolver, which we did on September 24. So now we have fully repaid the entire $15 billion facility and we ended the third quarter with strong a balance sheet including nearly $30 billion in cash and more than $45 billion of liquidity, which puts us in vital -- which provides us with the vital financial flexibility we need. Looking at North America, despite the difficult backdrop of COVID, the Ford team executed well operationally. We optimize incentives for lower dealer stock levels, we maximize production and skillfully manage supply chains to meet stronger-than-expected customer demand. The region delivered an EBIT margin of 12.5% as it benefited from top line growth of 8% EBIT improved by $1.2 billion supported by $900 million in net pricing and $400 million in favorable volume and mix. The improvement in volume and mix reflects the effectiveness of our team and focusing on Ford's franchise strengths. A few examples include S-series. S-series gained 1.7 points to a share of more than 35% in the US. Our mix of trucks and vans increased one point to 57%. Our mix -- our utility mix increased three points to 35% with a very strong showing from Explorer and the mix of cars declined four points to just under 8%. Now in total, North America share increased one point to 13.6%. In Europe, EBIT declined $300 billion in the quarter and that was driven by lower volume and about $400 million in costs related to our Kuga PHEV battery supplier issue. Those expenses included pulling cost that are required to comply with the EUs and new CO2 emissions standards this year. Now we said earlier that we anticipated meeting those new standards based on our product roadmap and the Kuga PHEV was a big part of that expectation. So we're working closely with our supplier to remediate the situation and minimize any inconveniences to our customers. We plan to notify our customers in the coming days on how and when we will repair their vehicles and had it not been for the Kuga issue, Europe would've been profitable for the third quarter. Now since Europe began its sweeping redesign of the regional business in 2018, the European team successfully rationalized the manufacturing footprint, shifted resources to our leading position in commercial vehicles and dramatically lowered structural cost. This year the Europe team is on track to deliver $1 billion of annual structural cost reductions. Now relative to mix, our commercial vehicle mix share increased by 50 basis points to 15.1% for the quarter and SUVs accounted for more than 30% of our vehicle mix in Europe nearly 9 points higher than a year ago. Turning to China, wholesale shipments in China were up 22% and that's the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth that reflects strong sales of SUVs and commercial vehicles. Our mix of SUVs increased 13 percentage points to 36% and that was driven by locally built Ford Explorer, Escape and Lincoln Aviator and Corsair with Lincoln delivering its best ever quarterly sales in China and as planned, over 65% of Lincoln vehicles are now produced locally following the introduction of the Corsair and the Aviator in the first half of 2020. Commercial vehicle sale mix increased, 5% five percentage points to 45% and that reflects strong JMC sale, up 38% versus prior year and that reflects the continued strong demand for light trucks, vans and pickups. So overall, the team delivered a third consecutive quarter of year-over-year share gains and marked the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in EBIT, the best performance in three years. In South America, [audio gap] mitigating the ongoing pressure from inflation, currency and the industry structural challenges. And in IMG, IMG delivered a profit despite COVID-related industry declines in wholesale, which adversely affected the revenue. S-series gained share and our share with the Ranger pickup in Australia increased 6 points to 27%. Profitability in IMG also benefited from the work the team has done to lower structural cost. And finally, Ford Mobility, which is building fourth-generation autonomous test vehicles with the latest self driving technology, generated its first AV-related revenue from a fleet operations pilot in Austin, Texas, and at the same time, we are strategically expanding our spin scooter business in the US, the UK and Germany in generating strong revenue growth. Now before taking your questions, I'll make a few comments about the fourth quarter, which assumes no meaningful change to the current economic environment, continued steady improvement in the stability of the global automotive supply base and no further significant COVID-related disruptions to production or disruptions since the third quarter. Our guidance for adjusted company EBIT for the fourth quarter is between a loss of $500 million and breakeven. Now we recognize this is a big change both sequentially and year-over-year so I want to step through the key sequential drivers. First, we expect a reduction in wholesale of about 100,000 units associated with the F 150 changeover. Now this volume affect is a result of our measured production ramp-up plan to ensure that every vehicle we wholesale is gate released with the highest possible quality for our customers. Now to put this in context, the approximate 100,000 unit impact in the fourth quarter will far outweigh the effect of our UAW ratification bonus in Q4 of last year, which was worth about $600 million. Second, we also expect higher structural and other costs from the manufacturing launch activities for the Mustang Maki and the Bronco Sport as well as advertising launch activities for the new products, including the all-new bronco brand and higher material and other costs and we expect EBT from Ford Credit to be lower sequentially driven by strong but lower auction values and lower disposal at auction. With this fourth-quarter guidance, we now expect full year adjusted company EBIT to be profitable for the year. Other elements of our guidance for the year are unchanged with the exception of capital expenditures. We now expect a lower level for this year down between $1.2 billion and $1.7 billion versus $7.6 billion in 2019 and that reflects continued efficiencies. Before we move to Q&A I want to leave you with my key takeaways from the quarter. We had better execution, choosing word of play and our restructuring is paying off. These things intersected very nicely with the stronger-than-expected demand, we know there's more to fix and we're carrying on a clear plan to do that as Jim mentioned and our balance sheet is solid with nearly $30 billion of cash and over $45 billion of liquidity. Now operator, let's open the line for questions. In the quarter we got payables back to what we would say is a normal run rate and so from a standpoint of the guidance on the cash flow for the quarter, for the fourth quarter it's going to frankly have said with EBIT it's going to be driven by EBIT. So we haven't given a specific number on that and at this point, I'm not sure we're going to do that today. And as far as the launch to complement John, we are so excited about this new F150 all-new powertrains that's towing best payload, it's the best 150 we very had and we do see the inside, it's incredible, the technology and customers are asking us for that. Look we've completed the design phase, the engineering phase, Howard and the team did a great job and we then finished the supplier readiness and manufacturing readiness. My whole leadership team and myself went to both plants personally to review the launches a couple times and we're now in high production starting the ramp-up curve at Dearborn and Kansas City. We expect to start soon. I think we don't know until we start getting up that ramp curve, what we're going to see but I'd say one of the things that will complement the Ford team how Linda [ph] cash the whole team was the way we use COVID. During the COVID shutdown, we didn't stop with the quality assessment of the launch and there was a lot of work done on the software specially. This is all new electrical architecture. There's a ton new software and we use that downtime to really prove out our capability and so we're a long way from declaring victory. It's a daily huge global team working on the F150 launch but we work through the launch so far. We've made a lot of progress as a team and now we're into mass production. So stay tuned. Yeah. So let's just impact that a little bit, if you look at Europe, we've had a strong shift into our SUVs as we talked about earlier and with that has come pricing power relative to the other vehicle life and we expect that to continue in Europe. Down in South America, the team has been aggressive and you're seeing products shift there that's driving some of the net pricing as well, the strength in pricing because we're getting out of low profit, lower end vehicles and we're being very focused on driving towards higher margin products like Ranger and some of the other strengths that we have in the region. So we're going to see that continue through. And then in Europe they're managing through revenue management looking at everything we're doing the same thing here in North America. It's a focus we have and a lot of it's being driven by our strong mix. We are seeing some pricing for product as new product coming out and that's flowing through as well. So we're very focused on driving the top line as best we can, but equally and more focused on the cost as Jim has talked about as we've talked about, that's one of our main focus is keep moving forward on the top line and really hone in and focusing on getting the cost right. So from a cost standpoint, I'll start with that. As I said earlier it's about $400 million for the quarter. We do expect some cost in the fourth quarter somewhere between $100 million to $200 million. So that's the impact we see as it is today and that does also -- that includes the impact of the pooling effort that we're going to have to undertake for our passenger vehicle in Europe."

At this time, I would like to welcome you to the Ford Motor Company Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Lynn Antipas Tyson, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Lynn?\nLynn Antipas Tyson: Thank you, Sedaris. Welcome everyone to Ford Motor Company\u2019s second quarter earnings call. Presenting today are Jim Hackett, our President and CEO; and Tim Stone, our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us today for Q&A are Jim Farley, Chief Operating Officer; and Marion Harris, CEO, Ford Credit. Jim Hackett will begin with some color on the quarter, and then, Tim, will talk about our results in more depth, and then we\u2019ll turn to -- to turn -- turn to Q&A. Our results discussed today include some non-GAAP references. These are reconciled to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures in the appendix of our earnings deck, which can be found along with the rest of our earnings materials at shareholder.ford.com. Today\u2019s discussion includes forward-looking statements about our expectations. Actual results may differ from those stated and the most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ are included on slide 23. In addition, unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year-over-year, company EBIT, EPS and operating cash flow are on an adjusted basis and product mix is on a volume weighted basis. A quick update on two upcoming IR events, first, on Monday, August 3rd, RBC will host a fireside chat with us. Tim Stone; Hau N Thai-Tang, our Chief Product Development and Purchasing Officer; and Gary Johnson, our Chief Manufacturing and Labor Affairs Officer will participate. And then on Wednesday, August 15th, Kumar Galhotra, President Americas and International Markets Group will participate in the Jefferies Industrial Conference. Now let me turn the call over to Jim Hackett.\nJim Hackett: Thanks, Lynn, and hello to everyone. In a moment I will share with you how absolutely proud I am of the way our team has performed during the COVID pandemic, which of course, has challenged every aspect of our business. But before I do, I don\u2019t want this moment to pass without giving some important perspective on where Ford Motor Company stands relative to racial justice. I\u2019ve been heartened, frankly, to see our industry, like, other industries step-up in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd. And of course, hand-in-hand with others, there\u2019s a deep outpouring of collective grief and frustration that moved us all very deeply. It was much more than a moment and time that will fade but rather, we must make it a turning point for our society. Ford is committed to leading from the front with action to enable social mobility and economic success in the African-American community, include -- including programs in which the company has invested for more than a century. The Ford Motor Company Fund in particular invests in a broad range of initiatives addressing social justice, racism, equality and economic opportunity, and we\u2019re looking forward to more opportunities to affect positive change. Now, in the past week since Mr. Floyd death, I have met nightly with a small team of people to think as deeply as possible about what has not worked in the past that we need to address in the future. We\u2019ve begun to map the experience of Black Lives of Ford and see areas where improvements and enhancement would go a long way to address many of the concerns that have been voiced. Ford is committed to leading from the front and taking action and the results will prove themselves over time. This is deeply a part of our culture and history in the Ford Motor Company Fund in particular, has invested over many decades at the ground level to address issues of social justice, racism, equality and economic opportunity, and we look forward to sharing much more of this in the future. Okay, so let me turn to the quarter, which I would summarize in two ways. First, strong execution in this challenging environment, and second, meaningful progress on our plan to create a vibrant Ford Motor Company with exciting products that people want and well-positioned to capitalize on the new technology and trends that are transforming our industry. I couldn\u2019t be prouder, as I said, of the optimism and the effectiveness our team demonstrated managing through and beyond the COVID crisis. From the start, I think, Ford has distinguished itself on three principles, protecting our team and doing our part to limit the spread of the virus, safeguarding the health of our business and stepping up the building supplying much needed personal protective and healthcare equipment. On all three accounts [ph] the team performed exceptionally well under difficult circumstances. This strong execution enabled us to deliver much better financial results than we expected just three months ago. For example, our team did a fantastic job safely restarting production and wholesale exceeded targets. Frankly, our focus on safety enabled our efficient restart as we followed our return to work playbook very, very closely. Our focused on safety also extended to our supply chain as we work directly with our suppliers and logistics providers to minimize the disruption. In addition, our team also worked hard on costs, including CapEx, which help reduce losses and cash burn in the quarter ad these factors are what led to our outperformance. Another highlight of the quarter is our profitable Commercial Vehicle business. It continues to gain share globally. And Ford Credit, it remains a pillar of strength for our customers and it\u2019s a competitive advantage. So we\u2019re all proud to tell you that the balance sheet remains extremely solid and positions us to weather further disruptions and headwinds. Tim will provide further details in a moment on the balance sheet. Importantly, this intense focus on manage -- managing through the crisis is not knocked us off our mission to author own destiny and shape the future of Ford. Since our last earnings call, we have revealed the all new 2021 F-150 and are on our new Bronco family of vehicles. These vehicles along with upcoming Mustang Mach-E represent Ford\u2019s modern product vision, highly desirable iconic vehicles packed with innovation and human-centered design features. And they\u2019re fully connected in ways to enhance quality and constantly improving ownership experience through fast over the air updates. Let me give you some color on the F-150. The all new version we showed in June was born from decades of deep focus on what customers want, a new human-centered design capabilities that helps us invent the unobvious features and capability customers will love and value. The new F-150 is packed with dozens of new innovative features and upgrades that we believe will make this the market leading truck for 43 years and that\u2019s an even stronger proposition for our customers. We\u2019re in great shape to launch the new one -- the new F-150 on time, and with high quality, which of course, requires now change over in our plants in Dearborn in Kansas City. An important sell down of the current model is also going well as demonstrated by great news in our market share. For example, in the U.S. while sales decline, we perform better than the industry due in part to the strength from our trucks that\u2019s being the F-150, Ranger and our SUVs exploring Lincoln Aviator and Corsair. The total share was up 20 basis points in the quarter to 14.5% and within that number our retail share was up 120 basis points to 13.3% as series gained 250 basis points of segment share to 33.3% Turning to the all new Bronco. The outpouring of enthusiasm from the public immediate after the reveal earlier this month, candidly speaks for itself. Reservations for Bronco, well, they surpassed even our most optimistic initial projections. Our entire team like the over 150,000 customers who reserve one are super excited about the Bronco. This family of vehicles has big upside potential in the growing off-road category and this is a category with a leading OEM. There\u2019s not been seriously challenged until now and we have proven credibility in this off-road space with Raptor in particular and we are the number one cross shop brand for jeep today. Initial customer demand for Bronco is so high that we are actively working to increase our annual production right now. I also want to give you a quick personal story on the status of the Mach-E, which will go on sale later this year and opportunity to drive an advanced prototype recently in Ann Arbor [ph]. The experience was just stunning from start to finish. When you sit in the driver\u2019s seat, everything is personalized. My profile automatically loaded into the Mach-E before I press the start button, seat position, screen colors, preferences, Apple CarPlay in ways were seamlessly integrated into the SYNC 4 system. I didn\u2019t set off on drive in whisper mode. Now the drive was astonishingly smooth and powerful. And I use the one pedal driving system, braking and battery regeneration were perfectly integrated. Then, I did switch on bridle mode. You can see me smiling and I can tell you the performance was pure Mustang. Sure foot [ph] is incredibly quick as I took curves. The experience was incredibly intuitive and the cluster tells you exactly what you need to know, if nothing extraneous. Yes, I left with a big smile on my face because I know our customers will soon enjoy this same experience. When I see these products come to life, I feel better and better about our decision to reallocate capital spending from sedans to trucks and commercial vehicles and SUVs, was controversial at the time, it\u2019s paying off. We have even more new products in the pipeline in areas where Ford is strong today and its whitespaces where we can earn stronger returns and grow share. Now these new products are critical to our target to reduce the age of our showroom in the U.S. by over 40% or more competitive 3.1 years by 2023. OEMs really with the highest replacement rate and younger showroom age have generally gained market share profitably. It\u2019s a good place to be in. By several third-party measurements, Ford brand reputation is improving as well and we believe we have much more potential for improvement as we launch these new exciting products. I just want to take a moment and touch on our plan for electric vehicles. We\u2019re about midway through our plan to invest more than $11.5 billion through 2022 and there\u2019ll be more after that with an increasing mix of spend on all-electric vehicles. For bringing the power of choice to our customers with hybrids, plug-in hybrids and pure electric, by the fourth quarter, we\u2019ll have 15 electrified nameplates available to customers around the world and nearly 10% of our wholesales will come from some Ford forms, excuse me, of electrification. We are deploying this technology across our lineup and price points to bring improved capability, fuel economy and emissions to as many people as possible just as we did with our EcoBoost technology a decade ago. Nameplates that will follow are all-electric are the territory in China are Escape and Kuga plug-in hybrids, which offer an estimated 100 mpg and the F-150 PowerBoost hybrid, I just ordered one of these, as well as our Mustang Mach-E BEV. These will be followed by an all-electric versions of our market leading F-150 and Transit vans. Electric vehicles are also a big part of Lincoln\u2019s future and you\u2019ll see this unfold in the months and years ahead. As you know, in June, we finalized our strategic alignment -- alliance with VW, which will accelerate execution of our commercial vehicle and electric vehicle strategy. This alliance also significantly strengthens Argo AI, which now combines unmatched expertise with the global reach of Ford and VW together. This positions Ford well as self-driving vehicles become a significant new source of revenue and profit in the years to come. Maybe journey will be a long one, but Ford is now well-positioned to run this race and compete like few others can. Finally, in a moment, Tim will provide an update on the progress of our global redesign. We are aggressively reshaping our business and restructuring underperforming operations around the world, rationalizing our product portfolio to play to our strengths and attacking costs. Obviously, Ford isn\u2019t immune to the effects of the pandemic, including the new vehicle market that has been waylaid by the pandemic. But we continue to manage through this crisis even as we continue to create a vibrant profitably growing company, one that we\u2019re confident, we\u2019ll win in an era of smart vehicles for a smart world. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Tim for more color on the quarter and our expectations for the remainder of the year. Tim?\nTim Stone: Great. Thanks, Jim. In addition to our operational execution this quarter, in the face of unprecedented industry headwinds, our results demonstrated progress as we fix areas of the business that have held us back in the past, including cost and launch execution. And acceleration in areas of strength like commercial vehicles and SUVs, as well as newer capabilities like connectivity, tangible progress in electrification and autonomous vehicles, both essential to our long-term growth. And lastly, the favorable impacts of our global redesign and a more focused portfolio of fresh products for customers. We also demonstrated discipline in the management of our balance sheet and continue to maintain strong liquidity to ensure financial flexibility in these uncertain times. We ended the quarter with over $39 billion in cash and liquidity, reflecting almost $10 billion of new debt in the quarter, including the $8 billion unsecured issuance we completed in April. In the second quarter, our working capital dynamics played out as we highlighted on our first quarter earnings call. As production resumed in mid-May, our payables and cash balance recovered sharply. The restoration and production payables will continue into the third quarter, as we reach near full production in late June. On July 27th, we repaid $7.7 billion of our outstanding $15.4 billion corporate revolvers. We also extended $4.8 billion of our lines of credit from April 22 to July 23. Our current liquidity of almost $40 billion is sufficient to maintain or exceed our target cash balance of $20 billion through the second half of this year, even if global demand declines, or if there\u2019s another wave of COVID-related plant closures. Looking at results in automotive, both wholesale and revenue are down due to the suspension in manufacturing. To give you some color on wholesales, earlier this year, pre-COVID, we had expected wholesale units to be about 800,000 higher than the 645,000 we reported in the quarter. Our decline in automotive EBIT was driven by the decline in volume. So this was partially offset by over a $1 billion improvement in both net pricing and cost. The cost improvement was a net of four primary areas, lower structural costs, due to suspended production and one-time cost actions like reduced marketing, both of which were partially offset by higher material costs for new products and regulatory compliance and higher warranty. We do expect warranty to be up for the year. Looking at our business units in more detail, North America was shut down for six weeks in the quarter, but like the other regions, manufacturing came up smoothly. In fact, North America was operating about -- at about 95% of pre-COVID production levels by the end of the quarter. In addition to the improvements in share, as Jim mentioned, the North America team was laser focused on minimizing the impacts of lower volume through the aggressive management of costs, including reducing facility costs, media spend and the elimination of all discretionary spending. The team also focused on yield management actions, which benefit both revenue and EBIT. In South America, our plants were mostly idled in the quarter. But as with North America, we brought production up efficiently. Market share declined largely driven by lower sales to rental companies and our global redesign actions last year to exit heavy trucks and unprofitable products, such as Fiesta and Focus. However, both Ranger and EcoSport did well, as Ranger the number two midsize pickup globally gained share. Relative to profitability, this was the third consecutive quarter of improving year-over-year results as we continue to hone our cost position, including lower headcount and improve mix. In Europe, all of our plants came up successfully by May 4th. Profitability was favorably impacted by the benefits of our global redesign, as well as our more focused approach on three customer segments, commercial vehicles, select passenger vehicles and imports. Relative to global redesign, we are on track to deliver by the end of this year roughly a $1 billion improvement in structural cost since the actions began during the third quarter of 2018. This includes a 10,000 positions in Western Europe, of which 7,500 reductions have been completed, a reduction of over 2,000 positions in Europe. The balance of the positions in Western Europe will be eliminated by the end of this year. We\u2019ve also reduced costs by reducing our manufacturing footprint by six facilities down to a total of 17. Or sharper focus on product strengths, allowed us to extend our leadership in commercial vehicles, as we reached 15.1% share in June, an increase of 220 basis points. We are on track this year to meet the new CO2 regulatory requirements for both passenger and commercial vehicles supported by our growing portfolio of electrified vehicles. For example, in the first half of this year, our new Puma MHEV reached 80% mix and Kuga PHEV and MHEV collectively reached 57% mix. Now on the horizon, about Transit, we are enjoying our Transit families ICE and hybrid powertrains. In China, the only region to post again the wholesales, wholesales were up double digits, as we\u2019ve benefited from the newly launched Escape and Lincoln Corsair and strong commercial vehicle sales. Corsair, our first locally produced Lincoln products contributed to a 12% increase in sales from Lincoln and the all new locally produced Aviator is launching now. China also posted its second consecutive quarter of share gain of 20 basis points to 2.5%, its highest market share since the third quarter 2018. Our strength in commercial vehicles was supported by a 34% increase in sales at JMC, our JV partner, which gained 40 basis points a share. As with other regions through cost discipline, China has done a great job mitigating the profit impact of COVID. China\u2019s focus on cash flow also delivered a step function change in working capital, driven by the benefits of localization, as well as CapEx efficiencies. In mobility, we continue to make investments to commercialize our Autonomous Vehicle business, including product development, engineering and testing. Our six test markets for Argo AI constitute what we believe is the largest active urban test footprint of any self driving vehicle developer. As Jim mentioned, in the quarter, we closed on our new partnership with VW and Argo AI. This generate -- generated a gain of $3.5 billion, which was recorded as a special item. Argo AI, which is the self-driving system portion of our AV business, is now deconsolidated. Despite the deconsolidation, we do expect our investments in AV reflected in our consolidated mobility results to continue at similar levels for the reasons I noted earlier. In mobility we also continue to invest to build out capabilities and connected services, including our FordPass and Ford Commercial Solutions platforms. In fact, we\u2019ve centralized our enterprise connectivity team to accelerate the delivery of human-centered connected experiences for our customers. We expect this sharper focus to also provide benefits to the enterprise to improve customer experience and quality. Ford Credit delivered a strong profitable quarter, demonstrating its uniquely compelling value for customers and competitive advantage. Our prudent actions in the first quarter ensured we were adequately reserved in light of the macro uncertainty created by COVID. Portfolio performance was strong, and delinquencies and charge-offs were record levels -- record low levels. Ford Credit provided extensions to about 11% of U.S. customers through May, an unprecedented move. Over 90% of these customers have resumed payments without delinquency and we are very pleased with the performance of this portfolio. Lease share remain below industry average and off lease auction performance was better than expected, up 3% sequentially and down 2% year-over-year. We began the quarter with close auctions, growing inventory and falling prices. However, May we saw a healthy recovery in auction volume and prices. At present, we forecast lower auction values for the full year of about 5% consistent with third-party estimates. Now let me turn to guidance. Guidance assumes no meaningful change with current economic environment, continues steady improvement in the stability of the global automotive supply base and no further significant COVID-related disruptions to production or distribution. In the third quarter, we expect to be profitable with adjusted EBIT of $0.5 billion to $1.5 billion, reflecting the economic impact of COVID, weaker global demand for new vehicles, parts and services, and lower profit from Ford Credit. Our recent practice has been to comment on the upcoming quarter only, because of the significant launch activity in the fourth quarter, we thought some early color would be helpful. We expect adjusted EBIT to be a loss in the fourth quarter, driven by the volume impact of new F-150 launch and lower ongoing industry volumes. Note that our major launches in North America have shifted to the fourth quarter in line with our COVID-related production disruption.  We anticipate the downtime changeover and ramp-up will reduce F-150 wholesale significantly in the quarter. This launch impact will more than offset the non-occurrence of the 2019 UAW contract bonuses in the fourth quarter, which is worth roughly $600 million. Our new Bronco Sport and Mustang Mach-E are also launching in the quarter. The limited level of wholesales will not have a material impact on our fourth quarter results. We also expect lower Ford Credit profits in the fourth quarter versus last year. All that said, we expect adjusted EBIT to be a loss for the full year. I\u2019m optimistic that we\u2019re well-positioned for what lies ahead and to deliver excellent products and services for our customers. With that, let me turn the call back to, Jim, for a few comments before we move to Q&A.\nJim Hackett: Thanks, Tim. Yeah. Just a few comments, I want to reinforce the following about the quarter and the second half of this year. In the face of unprecedented sector headwinds operationally, we maintained robust safety protocols and aggressively mitigated production losses, while effectively navigating a tenuous supply base, I mean, everything was in motion. We\u2019re keenly focused on cost and cash discipline. Jim Farley led an effort here that\u2019s just extraordinary. We are optimistic and ready for the production ramp-up of the F-150, the Mach-E as you\u2019ve heard, the Bronco Sport and Bronco, all with the spirit of high quality and extreme focus on doing a great job there. We continue important investments. We didn\u2019t stop spending on the future in commercial vehicles, AV, connectivity and electrification. We did continue to implement our global redesign and portfolio refresh and we have measurable results to show that this is going very well. And as you just heard from Tim, we did a great job of this. We have a discipline management of our balance sheet and an extremely strong liquidity position from all the actions we took earlier this year. This ensures our financial flexibility, particularly as we know in uncertain time. So, Operator, with that, let\u2019s move to Q&A, please.\nOperator: Okay. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from a line of John Murphy with Bank of America.\nJohn Murphy: Good evening, guys. Just a first question, Tim, as we look at sort of the guidance you\u2019d given us on the second quarter. You kind of blew it out of the water here. I mean, you\u2019re talking about a $5 billion plus EBIT loss, and you came in well better than that. I\u2019m just curious, what changed and what do you think the major factors are? And then also, I mean, if you think about price and cost, which seemed to be two big levers, how sticky could those benefits be going forward. So really just -- what change and how durable is the change?\nTim Stone: Great. Ultimately, the performance in the second quarter comes down to operational execution by the teams. And if you look at our return to work, which is not only safely, but production in our wholesales, vehicle sales came with that and inventory management, really strong performance by the teams. We were near full production by the end of the quarter and we -- greater cost reductions and cash reductions than we had anticipated initially as well. Again, base on the keen focus on cost and cash. There is also favorable pricing environment for products and mix. And Ford Credit auction values and credit losses overall portfolio performance was strong. So, I guess, at the end of the day a strong execution. And as it relate -- second part of your question again was -- as related to how much sales is going to prevail in the year?\nJohn Murphy: Well -- yeah. How sticky is that sort of that outperformance, because it does sound like a lot of it was micro, and as you said, just execution, I mean, do you think some of that was sort of transitory in response to sort of austerity measures or how sticky is this?\nTim Stone: I think the operational execution is something we pride ourselves on and expect to work really hard to make sure it\u2019s very sticky. We\u2019ve got a lot of work ahead of us for sure in the back half of the year with some really important launches in the fourth quarter and we continue to drive improvements in the fixed accelerate grow areas that we\u2019ve talked about. But as reflected in our guidance for profitability in the third quarter is, we\u2019re going to continue to operate in an operationally excellent manner.\nJohn Murphy: Okay. And then just a second question, I think, Jim Farley is on, when we look at the Bronco launch, a lot of hype around the truck, which is, at least from my opinion is well deserved, a lot of excitement there around the Sport as well this year. But it seems like there is -- this is sort of the start of something much more than even just those two vehicles when you talk about the Bronco family. So just trying to understand, will we be looking at something four years, five years, six years down the line, where there could be a portfolio of Bronco vehicles that mimics or mirrors sort of more what jeep has. I am just trying to understand what the potential is above and beyond what we know at the moment and it seems like there\u2019s a lot more on the horizon?\nJim Farley: Thanks, John. Hi. As Jim and Tim mentioned, the Bronco reception has been very positive. The reservation numbers are far beyond what we expected and these are two broad appeal nameplates in three body styles, so we don\u2019t have in our portfolio today. So we\u2019re not getting ahead of ourselves on Bronco. We have a lot of work to do to launch these products to do with world-class quality and don\u2019t forget our ambition is to launch over 200 accessories and really create a brand, the sub-brand within Ford like we have like F-Series. So we have a lot to do and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on. John, there is no shortage of great ideas for Bronco\u2019s Ford Motor Company. But we have a great foundation to start with these three names -- these three body styles. I would expect for, like, we\u2019ve always done, like, we\u2019ve learned from F-Series over the years, decades, that will rollout family or Bronco like we\u2019re doing in our own way, targeted to our own customers, where we see openings in the market for customers to be thrilled and we do see that opportunity in the market. So I wouldn\u2019t hold ourselves or benchmark ourselves against another OEM, our ideas is to play to win by going after specific customers that are underserved. Thanks.\nJohn Murphy: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner, Deutsche Bank.\nEmmanuel Rosner: Hi. Good evening, everybody.\nJim Hackett: Hi, there.\nEmmanuel Rosner: My first question is trying to understand a little bit better how to think about the rest of the year? When I look at your cost performance in the quarter, maybe on slide 11, so $1.1 billion overall net basis, but $1.8 billion qualify this structural anyway to dimension for us how much of those structural costs are more temporary actions in the quarter, when you had shutdown for an extended period of time versus something that we could assume could continue on year-over-year business going forward and then still about the rest of the year\u2019s outlook? Anyway for you to dimension for us the magnitude of the impacts on the F-150 change over either in terms of weeks of shutdown or units, anything that could be helpful to dimension?\nJim Hackett: So, Emmanuel, it\u2019s Jim Hackett, I think, I\u2019m going to send that to Tim.\nTim Stone: Yeah. Great. Thanks, Jim. So as it relates cost actions, we\u2019ve been taking -- we have been talking about for some time now is the focus on fitness and design of the business. And so we\u2019re going to continue to be passionately focused on making sure the right design for the business and with fitness as a priority. And so certainly, there are things that we appropriately undertook to preserve cash and reduce costs in response to the environment. But we\u2019re also looking at opportunities to learn from this and identify areas to further accelerate our fitness and redesign opportunities that are ahead. So that\u2019s really what I have to say and that -- otherwise essentially reflected in the guidance, we have the third and fourth quarters as we look out. And on the third -- go ahead.\nEmmanuel Rosner: Sorry. The second part was around the\u2026\nTim Stone: Yeah.\nEmmanuel Rosner: \u2026F-150 changeover?\nTim Stone: Yeah. On the F-150 side, we try to do is characterize it is more impactful than the UAW launch essentially, of 6 -- sorry, UAW contract bonuses of $600 million. So beyond that, there is not much more we can we can say. Certainly when you have America\u2019s best-selling vehicle for 38 years and gaining share of best series in the quarter, you can see the popularity of that vehicle claiming to our overall business. So the ramp down, ramp back up with a successful launch will have a big impact on the quarter which to our expect we never loss.\nEmmanuel Rosner: Okay. Thank you. And then I was hoping to get actually a little bit more from your latest thoughts from the global redesign plan and the opportunity to use this industry downturn potentially to accelerate this. I guess, in terms of the, I think, you mentioned during the prepared remarks that you expect $1 billion of benefits by the end of the year. I wanted to just first understand on what basis that is, is it for 2020 versus 2019 or is it since the beginning of the program and how to think about the opportunity to accelerate it, what are your latest thoughts there?\nTim Stone: As it relates to Europe comment, by the end of this year we expect to have roughly $1 billion improvement in structural cost actions since the beginning when was announced in Q3 \u201818 it\u2019s cumulative. That includes the reductions of positions I mentioned 10,000 positions in Western Europe, 7,500 of which have been completed already, as well as 2,000 positions in Russia, as well as the reduction of manufacturing footprint by six facilities on a total of 17. So, again, we\u2019re going to review our center in order to look at opportunities to make sure we\u2019re the right design for the business as we look out at the opportunities ahead of us and nothing incremental to announce at this moment. But to-date, we\u2019ve incurred $3.9 billion of EBIT charges and $1.4 billion of cash. So you with $7.1 billion to go, up to $7.1 billion to go and charges up to $5.6 billion in cash. The other thing you know, continue to execute on the result as well, so nothing new to announce at this time, but you\u2019re keenly focused on it.\nEmmanuel Rosner: Great. Thank you.\nJim Hackett: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Philippe Houchois with Jefferies.\nPhilippe Houchois: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you very much. I\u2019ve got a couple of questions. One is when I listened to you, Tim, about the Q4 guidance going back into loss because of launch costs, it seems like a lot of their assumptions, also a weaker Q4 and things like that -- it\u2019s not said that you\u2019re definitely going back into loss, a lot would depend potentially on the sock. I wonder if you can comment and give us some kind of no diamonds on the range of outcomes potentially. Another question was also to you, in terms of -- now you\u2019ve done quite an impressive work and terms of protecting cash and also starting to deleverage the capital structure. I couldn\u2019t help noticing your interest expense almost doubled in Q2. That\u2019s was a point of discussion with a lot investors that the interest expense is cut into earnings momentum. What are you doing, and how quickly can you actually get the interest expense under controls, so we can make sure we don\u2019t lose the operating definition to the currency leverage?\nJim Hackett: Great. So let me start with the interest expense. It has ticked up as we bolster a balance sheet and ensure we have not only strong cash position, strong liquidity position, and it suits us very well. And then, as we looked out, we feel comfortable with our cash position and confident so that such that we repaid and roughly half of the outstanding revolvers that we drew down earlier this week.  And we\u2019ll continue to look at opportunities to repay additional debt including revolvers over time as a business performed and -- I mean - anything announced at this time, but certainly we\u2019ll be looking at opportunities to reduce interest expense and delever the balance sheet in that way is where am I as the debt levels come down, of course we have the $40 billion liquidity, as you repeat a line of credit, so feel comfortable with our cash and liquidity position. The interest expense for the back half of the year, you can assume roughly $0.5 billion per quarter will be a reasonable expectation. And then your question on S.A.R, year-to-date S.A.R was about 13.4 million units in the first half and we see this improving throughout the year. And beyond that, I think we\u2019ll add more colors a year progresses. But we do see again an opportunity for it to improve as the year progresses.\nPhilippe Houchois: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research.\nRod Lache: Hi, everybody. I was hoping just to revisit that question about costs, that $1 billion of Europe savings is obviously a big number. But when I look at slide 11 on the bridge in Europe, when I look at costs, I see zero. And I\u2019m assuming that that\u2019s because your variable costs, mostly regulatory is offsetting your structural cost savings. So, just taking a higher level look the question about the $1.8 billion of structural costs and people are wondering whether that there is some significant proportion of that, that could be permanent, and some of that may be shifting from the first half the second half or coming back. Is there a risk here that your -- either the structural costs kind of get off go away, but the variable cost inflation that we see like material freight warranty that kind of space?\nTim Stone: Yeah. I guess what I want to say is that the team has been very focused on opportunities, not just during this time of COVID crisis, but before that to get more fit and improve our cost structure, you are seeing that 900 line results entering into the crisis. With the crisis, we\u2019ve had an opportunity to further reassess how we work and what opportunities we have in our cost structure to demonstrate to ourselves, we can take swift action, again, the teams around the world has done a great job in all areas. We are certainly mindful of what you\u2019re suggesting that these costs come back into the cost structure in ways that are unwelcome. But we\u2019re going to do everything we can to make sure that well, it shouldn\u2019t be volume related costs, but we\u2019re going to get more and more fit over time.\nRod Lache: Okay. And just a question on the launches that you\u2019re talking about, you talked about the disruption, but obviously, there is some pretty big benefits potentially next year. I was hoping you might just talk specifically about F-150 and what it would take to put that into the positive bucket that you need a significant amount of pricing to offset higher variable costs there. And on the Bronco, is it conceivable that you could produce 150,000 units a year there or is that just beyond the capability or the scope of what\u2019s possible?\nJim Hackett: So, Rob, it\u2019s Jim Hackett. I\u2019m going to ask Jim Farley, can you imagine the calls we\u2019ve gotten Rod about how many can you make so. He has been working on that day and night, so I\u2019ll give him that in just a second. But I want to make sure I\u2019m tracking with you on Europe in the sense that, you understand that structural costs effort ahead of the pandemic looks to be really precious, doesn\u2019t it and the absorption there without the volume is because of the effort that these guys have put forward. So I\u2019m not worried that as you just portrayed that there is a variable costs kind of avalanche that you know, smothers us, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen. Right now, we\u2019re not anticipating big inflation, for example. In fact, suppliers are all trying to get back up to levels of efficiency where we start to enjoy some savings. So I just want to add that color to the way I think about variable costs. I understand why you were looking at the forecast, but I just step back and think about that. But Jim, do you want to talk about the Bronco, great news and the challenge.\nJim Farley: Yeah. Thanks, Jim. Hi, Rod. So, maps, right down the street from our Dearborn headquarters is where we will make Bronco as in North America and then the Bronco\u2019s Ford down in Mexico. As far as the Bronco that we\u2019ve received over 100,000 reservations that operations to shift pattern, so we have some upside. We have a lot of work to do because these are reservations not orders yet. So we have a lot of work to verify that the mix is great enthusiasm and we still continue to get lots of reservations. So the team has multiple capacity studies, we do have some opportunity, it would commit to another shift which is a big deal for us. As you can imagine, but obviously the reception has been really positive and looks sustained now. On F-150, we\u2019re in the prototype build both in Kentucky and in Dearborn looks great. We\u2019re on plan with the supplier readiness, manufacturer readiness and all the software, obviously this is a big milestone for OTA and lifestyle for us. So it\u2019s important deliverable for the team. And we have a long way to go on the F-150 launch. But the team has made great progress. We\u2019re finding issues and addressing them immediately. So we\u2019re feeling like I would portrayed is on plan, and yes, there is upside for Bronco.\nRod Lache: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC.\nJoseph Spak: Thank you. Tim maybe asked about the second half guidance you know this way. If there wasn\u2019t a program delay, would you have basically issued the same guidance, just the cadence has been a little bit different?\nTim Stone: It\u2019s hard for me to re -- undo what\u2019s happened over the past few months. We\u2019ve had -- the delays were having are commensurate with what happened as a result of the production shutdown. And the teams throughout that timeframe did a great job getting us ready for launch. And so if you look at the back half of the year in aggregate, we\u2019re essentially guiding to less than $0.5 billion to $1.5 billion of profit. And certainly, there has been a shift to the fourth quarter as a result of those losses in the big impact on F-150 being in the fourth quarter.\nJoseph Spak: Okay. And maybe just on cash flow and the balance sheet, so you pay back part of the revolver if we pro forma that for the June, cash and debt levels you indicated. You are sort of back to the December net cash levels. But then you do have at least some losses right in the fourth quarter or there is more CapEx a little bit more redesign cash here and something more beyond this year. So, I don\u2019t -- I know you sort of usually talk about liquidity, not necessarily sort of net automotive cash or debt. But how do you see that sort of playing out. How do you see the balance sheets are playing out over the next couple of years, because there still are some calls on the cash I would see?\nTim Stone: Yeah. I mean, first, I want to emphasize for the third quarter, we expected cash flow to be higher than EBIT and the fourth quarter would be lower due to the timing of the working capital, social, the launches and the seasonal effects. As you look further out, from a liquidity standpoint, we have, of course, confidence in our ability to repay the debt that we have. We have net debt roughly equal to cash. And what we said was that even in scenarios where we have a COVID related plant closures again and/or demand declines that would have $20 billion or more in cash. So our certainly our base expectation is for more than that. And as we look out to the future, we\u2019re focused on optimizing our free cash flow driving toward our long-term margin opportunities and with that will come even greater cash and liquidity opportunities for us to consider none of the pain downloads and credit, of course, but through paying debt, receiving the dividend and to dilute sharer purchases as well.\nJoseph Spak: Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Jonas: Thanks very much. My first question is on EV batteries and it\u2019s kind of a question about make versus buy. So GM is making their own batteries with a joint venture in Ohio with LG. You\u2019re not going that route in terms of owning the physical plant capacity. What drives that thinking? And specifically there is a lot of options and this isn\u2019t the only one, but Elon Musk has offered to sell batteries or like EV powertrain skateboards to other OEMs. Would you consider doing that?\nJim Hackett: Hey, Adam. It\u2019s Jim. Thank you. It\u2019s a question that when maybe a year ago, we started to see lines starting to arrange around, make versus buy own versus source. So we had a deep discussion about this. I\u2019ve met with a number of the people that that are in the supply side of this and it was our estimation. In fact, our whole team went through a really deep dive on this six months ago that the supply chain has ramped up since EV his [ph] Gigafactory. And so there is plenty there that does not warrant us to migrate our capital into owning our own factory. There is no advantage in the ownership in terms of a cost or a sourcing as what Ford can draw on. So I just can confirm to you that it actually works. It works for us to go the path we are now. With that said, there is some challenges that are in that supply chain between themselves. There is some litigation that\u2019s going on. We\u2019re hopeful that, they get settled quickly. It really doesn\u2019t matter to us how it gets settled, but it may, it confuses some of the suppliers about their investments in some of their plants here in the United States, which is another way of saying the way the U.S. MCA would benefit as intended is to have these factories be built in the United States for supply of batteries and so we\u2019re well positioned believing that will happen.\nAdam Jonas: Thanks. Thanks, Jim. And then I got a follow-up for Jim Farley. Jim, if it -- and I\u2019m asking you specifically just because you\u2019re kind of still -- I\u2019ll still consider you new in your role, your new role. If you think three years out, how radically different is Ford motor company three years from now versus today. Can you kind of what are some of the big, big changes, not the subtle stuff, the major stuff that you want to highlight to folks on this call tonight? Thanks, Jim.\nJim Farley: Thanks Adam. Yeah. I would say -- I would characterize Ford\u2019s transformation as we know what we\u2019re really good at and we have tremendous opportunity to grow in those areas and commercial is a great example. It took us decades to build the commercial ecosystem we have today, exclusive distribution, bailment, upfitters, a deep relationship with customers, real deep know how in the company. As we look forward in the next three to five years, you can expect a Ford\u2019s commercial business to change a lot and part of that is cooperation of Volkswagen in places like Europe, but other parts of it will be the mobility transformation of commercial. So I would say Adam, you can expect Ford\u2019s transformation to be in the areas that we\u2019re already really good at, we have capability and that we\u2019re humbly approaching the business model and the ecosystem build out for those new growth opportunities with a fresh set of eyes. And just like we did decades ago when we built these businesses like commercial and it tremendous opportunity for value creation and for our customers especially. I think that gives you a good taste for how we see things as well as in much tighter geographic profile.\nAdam Jonas: Thanks, Jim. Appreciate that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Levy with Credit Suisse.\nDan Levy: Hi. Good evening, everyone. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to start with a question on Bronco here. And I know you don\u2019t disclose your exact variable profit per unit, but maybe if you could just give us a sense from the perspective of variable, profit per unit, how we should think of where Bronco potentially could stack up versus other vehicles in the four lineup? Obviously it\u2019s not going to be at the level of F-Series, I would think that\u2019s been the case. But I would venture to guess though, that it could be right up there, maybe above an explore or just the below and expedition or navigator. Just give us some sense of from a profit per unit standpoint, how we should be thinking about Bronco and the opportunity, because we know that your competitor in this area and doing quite well in that product.\nJim Hackett: Yeah. So my first reaction I\u2019m thinking, thank God we made the decision, right? Because you know what it replaced in the facility where we\u2019re making in some of the sedans we\u2019re making money. So you got to think of that with Adam\u2019s last question about the makeup of Ford and what\u2019s going out and what\u2019s coming in and product. And Jim, I\u2019ll let you talk about some of our targets there.\nJim Farley: Sure. Thanks Jim. Appreciate the question. The real breakthrough for us on Bronco was the localization of the Ranger that a very successful global Ranger here in North America. And we\u2019re already have very strong scale and performance with the Ranger in the U.S. The large Bronco and the C2 Bronco Sport are both based on existing platforms that we have executed many times. And so we\u2019re not going to go into specific profitability, but you can imagine compared to a Ranger, the kind of pricing that our Bronco Top Hat [ph] would get. And obviously we already have a great scale for the actual industrial part of the product. So -- and again the platform has been very well executed. It has global scale as the C2 for the Bronco Sport. And so we see these and the pricing premium, we care in the utility market, the off-road market it\u2019s pretty well known and I would say very robust in terms of we\u2019ve delivered it. It\u2019s not, it\u2019s not a maybe. So for our standpoint, as Jim said, we not only replaced the focus in the case of rough on and Ranger, but we\u2019re coming off of very high scale platforms, C2 and Ranger. And we know that these segments executed right the product our premium segments. So we\u2019re feeling really good about the margin.\nJim Hackett: And Jim, I just -- I want to sneak in, because you\u2019ve all seen our campaign about, we build more vehicles in America for -- by Americans in the whole industry. And this Bronco is, look, we\u2019re hiring people here in Southeast Michigan to build this product 2,000 to 3,000 additional people. So it\u2019s a -- I know I get teased about it because it came up in the discussion with the President, but I was just so proud to be able to explain that here we are in the middle of a pandemic with kind of challenges in the job market and Ford\u2019s going to be hiring people to build this product. So it\u2019s really a great news story.\nDan Levy: Thank you. That\u2019s really helpful color. If I could just squeeze one more in on Elon just a question EV budgeting, at least as you spent half of the 1$1.5 billion electrification commitment to a 22 and I believe that the starting point was 16. So it\u2019s all us clearly your spend is more backend loaded. But obviously 2022 is not an end goal, and you\u2019re going to be spending EV, as you\u2019re just starting on the journey then. So is it fair to assume that if I assume, okay, so you still had $3 billion to $4 billion, $ 3 plus billion a year that the spend will only accelerate after 2022. So how to think of the electrification spend?\nJim Hackett: Yeah. Jim, do you want to take that one? \nJim Farley: Sure. Again appreciate your question. Obviously of the $11 billion we\u2019re at the very tail end of Mach-E and our two commercial vehicles. And they\u2019re really key for us, the commercial vehicles, the Transit electric and the F-150 electric. We\u2019ve announced the MEB and the number of nameplates and so you can expect in \u201822 and beyond as we refresh our product line up once again globally, that electrification will be a key component and so the spend will continue to play out. That figure was given a few years ago. So as you said, \u201822 seems like right around the corner, but, we\u2019re not done. And with the $11 billion, we have some really exciting products coming out like the F-150 and the Transit, and with the growth of package delivery and a large commercial customer network for F-150 we\u2019re are seeing a ton of interest from customers on both of those, but we have lots of passenger cars to come as well. We\u2019re not going to be specific more than what we\u2019ve shared, but I think you\u2019ve characterized it fairly and accurately.\nDan Levy: Great. Thank you. That\u2019s helpful color.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JP Morgan.\nRyan Brinkman: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First on South America, I would have expected your losses there to grow considerably in 2Q given a 75% decline in revenue, but instead profitability improves slightly. Now it looks more of the help was coming from price and cost, but how would you rate the progress of the restructuring in that region? Are there more cost savings to come from action\u2019s already announced, but not fully implemented and do you think you\u2019re at the point now that if the volume returned that you would already be profitable or are there more restructuring actions needed to get there?\nJim Hackett: Well, I think, Jim mentioned this and Tim did is that South America, the journey there as compared to some of the other markets started. We phased out of unprofitable vehicles. We ended focused production and Pacheco exited heavy trucks business, discontinued Fiesta, ceased operations at San Paulo manufacturing based off the Sigma engine production. But Jim has been really working hard on the restructuring to serve a dealer network better in terms of our customers improving the availability for the remaining dealers. So I think this is a story that\u2019s still yet to be completed. But Jim, I want to let you answer why you think in the short-term we had this better than expected performance.\nJim Farley: Thanks, Jim. The second quarter marks, I think, the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvements, although, still losses. And it really reflects, as Jim said, the progress that we put in place many years ago to restructure South America. We have a lot of cost containment. We\u2019ve taken a lot of headcount out of the business as you would expect. And we\u2019ve also in the second quarter took a lot of pricing, which is consistent with the currency situation down there. But I think allowing the team got ahead of the downturn we saw in the market with COVID that\u2019s been a big beneficiary for us for a while. As Jim said, we\u2019re going to keep restructuring our businesses until they\u2019re sustainable. So still more work to do. South America looks pretty challenging, but the team is doing a great job. We have a slurry of new products few years ago and there was costs associated with that. So I think we have a really good still fresh lineup. We gained a lot of share in the second quarter. It was down about a point from last year, but that was a lot to do with the vehicles that we discontinued. So the vehicles we do have are very well accepted. I just would portray it as we are not -- we have more work to do as Jim said, but really big credit to the team and way down revenues to have a third consecutive improvement in our profit or losses.\nRyan Brinkman: That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And then just lastly, it seems like your market share in China is beginning to rebound of what would you primarily attribute the recovery to, was it the products, the relationship with Changan distribution strategy, localization of Lincoln, et cetera? And then are the pieces or future product programs in place to continue to grow that share, which I think had been like 4% at one point, is there a market share target that you have in mind that is materially higher than where you are now such that you could continue to grow your sales in that country even if the market sort of languishes for a while?\nJim Hackett: Well, I\u2019m excited to tell you that the plan is working there. COVID was -- it kind of helped focus us, but the commercial vehicles strength was supported by a 34% increase in sales at JMC, which gained 40 basis points of share. And the second -- it\u2019s the second consecutive quarter of share gain of 20 basis points, which is whether you\u2019re hinting about. We were talking about it in a way that this was the breakthrough that we were looking for. I think, Corsair is the -- comes in the middle of this. It is the first locally produced Lincoln product and it breaks all records that we\u2019ve had in one month for the sale of a product like that. It contributed to the 12% increase in sales for Lincoln and now the new Aviator is following on. My only regret is that the whole Board was going to be there in October just kind of review the progress that you\u2019re noting and we can\u2019t travel now because of COVID, but Jim Farley and Anning Chen, our President there had done a really good job of getting our arms around that market.\nRyan Brinkman: Thank you.\nJim Hackett: Okay.\nOperator: Your last question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi.\nItay Michaeli: Great. Thank you. Good evening, everyone. So just a couple of cash flow questions maybe for Tim. I think year-to-date, the working capital and timing differences has been a use of about almost $5 billion. I am curious if you can share roughly how much of that you think you might be able to recover in the second half of the year? And then secondly to that with the CapEx down from the original guidance, we expect that to be recovered next year, meaning CapEx will be higher than normal, as you kind of recoup some of the deferrals from this year,\nJim Hackett: Let me start with the last part first. Thanks for the question. We haven\u2019t completed our planning process for next year yet. We have said that for some time now that we\u2019re focused on fitness activities, which not only includes costs, but also CapEx to make sure that we\u2019re efficiently and effectively allocating capital. So we\u2019ll continue to focus on that, and you\u2019re seeing some of that reflected in the results on CapEx this year. So fitness, you also seen the ebb and flow of product programs, but we\u2019re pleased with the progress that we\u2019re making $1 million to $1.5 million down year-over-year, but again, nothing further to share at this stage on 2021. As far as working capital goes, bear in mind in the second quarter the working capital dynamics played out, we talked about production resumed, of course, during the shutdown period, we had payables who repaid and was production resumes as payables start getting no backup, but the restoration of payables continuing to the third quarter and that\u2019s one of the reasons we said that the third quarter cash will be better than EBIT in the fourth quarter cash with the shutdown seasonally and launches that are happening particularly F-150, this cash flow would be lower than EBIT. So I guess what you\u2019re seeing is not only the benefits from our fitness and our redesign and our underlying results improving in light of the COVID environment, but even underlying that, that\u2019ll continue to play out for the back half of this year and then into \u201821, as we\u2019re very keenly focused on all -- in all costs and cash opportunities. But as we\u2019ve talked about earlier, we\u2019re in a position now where we have a very strong cash position and liquidity position, and we\u2019re comfortable with outlook as we look ahead.\nItay Michaeli: Great. That\u2019s very helpful. And if I could sneak one more in, I\u2019m just curious, what are you seeing initially on the four promise campaign that you launched about a month ago. I am just curious if you\u2019re seeing a fair bit of traction there?\nJim Hackett: Jim?\nJim Farley: Yeah. I think, one of the really encouraging things for us leadership team, as Jim said, is we went out and promoted the reality that we\u2019re the highest employment in the U.S. of all the OEMs and, and also our volume in the U.S. and that plus new products is really, we\u2019ve seen a strengthening of our brand. The Promise campaign seems to do really well. We had a great second quarter in terms of share performance in the U.S. Retail, as Jim said, was way up full point, and part of that was mixed, but it\u2019s great to see that moment behind the brand. Third quarter looks not to be dramatically different. We\u2019ll continue to have good momentum, sales still lot to do. We have good supply situation and Ford in the 70-day range. And so the campaign seems to be doing really well, brands getting stronger, and we have product to sell.\nItay Michaeli: Great. That\u2019s all very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes the Ford Motor Company Second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Jim Farley",
            "content": "Thanks, John. Hi. As Jim and Tim mentioned, the Bronco reception has been very positive. The reservation numbers are far beyond what we expected and these are two broad appeal nameplates in three body styles, so we don't have in our portfolio today. So we're not getting ahead of ourselves on Bronco. We have a lot of work to do to launch these products to do with world-class quality and don't forget our ambition is to launch over 200 accessories and really create a brand, the sub-brand within Ford like we have like F-Series. So we have a lot to do and that's what we're focused on. John, there is no shortage of great ideas for Bronco's Ford Motor Company. But we have a great foundation to start with these three names -- these three body styles. I would expect for, like, we've always done, like, we've learned from F-Series over the years, decades, that will rollout family or Bronco like we're doing in our own way, targeted to our own customers, where we see openings in the market for customers to be thrilled and we do see that opportunity in the market. So I wouldn't hold ourselves or benchmark ourselves against another OEM, our ideas is to play to win by going after specific customers that are underserved. Thanks. Yeah. Thanks, Jim. Hi, Rod. So, maps, right down the street from our Dearborn headquarters is where we will make Bronco as in North America and then the Bronco's Ford down in Mexico. As far as the Bronco that we've received over 100,000 reservations that operations to shift pattern, so we have some upside. We have a lot of work to do because these are reservations not orders yet. So we have a lot of work to verify that the mix is great enthusiasm and we still continue to get lots of reservations. So the team has multiple capacity studies, we do have some opportunity, it would commit to another shift which is a big deal for us. As you can imagine, but obviously the reception has been really positive and looks sustained now. On F-150, we're in the prototype build both in Kentucky and in Dearborn looks great. We're on plan with the supplier readiness, manufacturer readiness and all the software, obviously this is a big milestone for OTA and lifestyle for us. So it's important deliverable for the team. And we have a long way to go on the F-150 launch. But the team has made great progress. We're finding issues and addressing them immediately. So we're feeling like I would portrayed is on plan, and yes, there is upside for Bronco. Thanks Adam. Yeah. I would say -- I would characterize Ford's transformation as we know what we're really good at and we have tremendous opportunity to grow in those areas and commercial is a great example. It took us decades to build the commercial ecosystem we have today, exclusive distribution, bailment, upfitters, a deep relationship with customers, real deep know how in the company. As we look forward in the next three to five years, you can expect a Ford's commercial business to change a lot and part of that is cooperation of Volkswagen in places like Europe, but other parts of it will be the mobility transformation of commercial. So I would say Adam, you can expect Ford's transformation to be in the areas that we're already really good at, we have capability and that we're humbly approaching the business model and the ecosystem build out for those new growth opportunities with a fresh set of eyes. And just like we did decades ago when we built these businesses like commercial and it tremendous opportunity for value creation and for our customers especially. I think that gives you a good taste for how we see things as well as in much tighter geographic profile. Sure. Thanks Jim. Appreciate the question. The real breakthrough for us on Bronco was the localization of the Ranger that a very successful global Ranger here in North America. And we're already have very strong scale and performance with the Ranger in the U.S. The large Bronco and the C2 Bronco Sport are both based on existing platforms that we have executed many times. And so we're not going to go into specific profitability, but you can imagine compared to a Ranger, the kind of pricing that our Bronco Top Hat [ph] would get. And obviously we already have a great scale for the actual industrial part of the product. So -- and again the platform has been very well executed. It has global scale as the C2 for the Bronco Sport. And so we see these and the pricing premium, we care in the utility market, the off-road market it's pretty well known and I would say very robust in terms of we've delivered it. It's not, it's not a maybe. So for our standpoint, as Jim said, we not only replaced the focus in the case of rough on and Ranger, but we're coming off of very high scale platforms, C2 and Ranger. And we know that these segments executed right the product our premium segments. So we're feeling really good about the margin. Sure. Again appreciate your question. Obviously of the $11 billion we're at the very tail end of Mach-E and our two commercial vehicles. And they're really key for us, the commercial vehicles, the Transit electric and the F-150 electric. We've announced the MEB and the number of nameplates and so you can expect in \u201822 and beyond as we refresh our product line up once again globally, that electrification will be a key component and so the spend will continue to play out. That figure was given a few years ago. So as you said, \u201822 seems like right around the corner, but, we're not done. And with the $11 billion, we have some really exciting products coming out like the F-150 and the Transit, and with the growth of package delivery and a large commercial customer network for F-150 we're are seeing a ton of interest from customers on both of those, but we have lots of passenger cars to come as well. We're not going to be specific more than what we've shared, but I think you've characterized it fairly and accurately. Thanks, Jim. The second quarter marks, I think, the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvements, although, still losses. And it really reflects, as Jim said, the progress that we put in place many years ago to restructure South America. We have a lot of cost containment. We've taken a lot of headcount out of the business as you would expect. And we've also in the second quarter took a lot of pricing, which is consistent with the currency situation down there. But I think allowing the team got ahead of the downturn we saw in the market with COVID that's been a big beneficiary for us for a while. As Jim said, we're going to keep restructuring our businesses until they're sustainable. So still more work to do. South America looks pretty challenging, but the team is doing a great job. We have a slurry of new products few years ago and there was costs associated with that. So I think we have a really good still fresh lineup. We gained a lot of share in the second quarter. It was down about a point from last year, but that was a lot to do with the vehicles that we discontinued. So the vehicles we do have are very well accepted. I just would portray it as we are not -- we have more work to do as Jim said, but really big credit to the team and way down revenues to have a third consecutive improvement in our profit or losses. Yeah. I think, one of the really encouraging things for us leadership team, as Jim said, is we went out and promoted the reality that we're the highest employment in the U.S. of all the OEMs and, and also our volume in the U.S. and that plus new products is really, we've seen a strengthening of our brand. The Promise campaign seems to do really well. We had a great second quarter in terms of share performance in the U.S. Retail, as Jim said, was way up full point, and part of that was mixed, but it's great to see that moment behind the brand. Third quarter looks not to be dramatically different. We'll continue to have good momentum, sales still lot to do. We have good supply situation and Ford in the 70-day range. And so the campaign seems to be doing really well, brands getting stronger, and we have product to sell."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Tim Stone",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Jim. In addition to our operational execution this quarter, in the face of unprecedented industry headwinds, our results demonstrated progress as we fix areas of the business that have held us back in the past, including cost and launch execution. And acceleration in areas of strength like commercial vehicles and SUVs, as well as newer capabilities like connectivity, tangible progress in electrification and autonomous vehicles, both essential to our long-term growth. And lastly, the favorable impacts of our global redesign and a more focused portfolio of fresh products for customers. We also demonstrated discipline in the management of our balance sheet and continue to maintain strong liquidity to ensure financial flexibility in these uncertain times. We ended the quarter with over $39 billion in cash and liquidity, reflecting almost $10 billion of new debt in the quarter, including the $8 billion unsecured issuance we completed in April. In the second quarter, our working capital dynamics played out as we highlighted on our first quarter earnings call. As production resumed in mid-May, our payables and cash balance recovered sharply. The restoration and production payables will continue into the third quarter, as we reach near full production in late June. On July 27th, we repaid $7.7 billion of our outstanding $15.4 billion corporate revolvers. We also extended $4.8 billion of our lines of credit from April 22 to July 23. Our current liquidity of almost $40 billion is sufficient to maintain or exceed our target cash balance of $20 billion through the second half of this year, even if global demand declines, or if there's another wave of COVID-related plant closures. Looking at results in automotive, both wholesale and revenue are down due to the suspension in manufacturing. To give you some color on wholesales, earlier this year, pre-COVID, we had expected wholesale units to be about 800,000 higher than the 645,000 we reported in the quarter. Our decline in automotive EBIT was driven by the decline in volume. So this was partially offset by over a $1 billion improvement in both net pricing and cost. The cost improvement was a net of four primary areas, lower structural costs, due to suspended production and one-time cost actions like reduced marketing, both of which were partially offset by higher material costs for new products and regulatory compliance and higher warranty. We do expect warranty to be up for the year. Looking at our business units in more detail, North America was shut down for six weeks in the quarter, but like the other regions, manufacturing came up smoothly. In fact, North America was operating about -- at about 95% of pre-COVID production levels by the end of the quarter. In addition to the improvements in share, as Jim mentioned, the North America team was laser focused on minimizing the impacts of lower volume through the aggressive management of costs, including reducing facility costs, media spend and the elimination of all discretionary spending. The team also focused on yield management actions, which benefit both revenue and EBIT. In South America, our plants were mostly idled in the quarter. But as with North America, we brought production up efficiently. Market share declined largely driven by lower sales to rental companies and our global redesign actions last year to exit heavy trucks and unprofitable products, such as Fiesta and Focus. However, both Ranger and EcoSport did well, as Ranger the number two midsize pickup globally gained share. Relative to profitability, this was the third consecutive quarter of improving year-over-year results as we continue to hone our cost position, including lower headcount and improve mix. In Europe, all of our plants came up successfully by May 4th. Profitability was favorably impacted by the benefits of our global redesign, as well as our more focused approach on three customer segments, commercial vehicles, select passenger vehicles and imports. Relative to global redesign, we are on track to deliver by the end of this year roughly a $1 billion improvement in structural cost since the actions began during the third quarter of 2018. This includes a 10,000 positions in Western Europe, of which 7,500 reductions have been completed, a reduction of over 2,000 positions in Europe. The balance of the positions in Western Europe will be eliminated by the end of this year. We've also reduced costs by reducing our manufacturing footprint by six facilities down to a total of 17. Or sharper focus on product strengths, allowed us to extend our leadership in commercial vehicles, as we reached 15.1% share in June, an increase of 220 basis points. We are on track this year to meet the new CO2 regulatory requirements for both passenger and commercial vehicles supported by our growing portfolio of electrified vehicles. For example, in the first half of this year, our new Puma MHEV reached 80% mix and Kuga PHEV and MHEV collectively reached 57% mix. Now on the horizon, about Transit, we are enjoying our Transit families ICE and hybrid powertrains. In China, the only region to post again the wholesales, wholesales were up double digits, as we've benefited from the newly launched Escape and Lincoln Corsair and strong commercial vehicle sales. Corsair, our first locally produced Lincoln products contributed to a 12% increase in sales from Lincoln and the all new locally produced Aviator is launching now. China also posted its second consecutive quarter of share gain of 20 basis points to 2.5%, its highest market share since the third quarter 2018. Our strength in commercial vehicles was supported by a 34% increase in sales at JMC, our JV partner, which gained 40 basis points a share. As with other regions through cost discipline, China has done a great job mitigating the profit impact of COVID. China's focus on cash flow also delivered a step function change in working capital, driven by the benefits of localization, as well as CapEx efficiencies. In mobility, we continue to make investments to commercialize our Autonomous Vehicle business, including product development, engineering and testing. Our six test markets for Argo AI constitute what we believe is the largest active urban test footprint of any self driving vehicle developer. As Jim mentioned, in the quarter, we closed on our new partnership with VW and Argo AI. This generate -- generated a gain of $3.5 billion, which was recorded as a special item. Argo AI, which is the self-driving system portion of our AV business, is now deconsolidated. Despite the deconsolidation, we do expect our investments in AV reflected in our consolidated mobility results to continue at similar levels for the reasons I noted earlier. In mobility we also continue to invest to build out capabilities and connected services, including our FordPass and Ford Commercial Solutions platforms. In fact, we've centralized our enterprise connectivity team to accelerate the delivery of human-centered connected experiences for our customers. We expect this sharper focus to also provide benefits to the enterprise to improve customer experience and quality. Ford Credit delivered a strong profitable quarter, demonstrating its uniquely compelling value for customers and competitive advantage. Our prudent actions in the first quarter ensured we were adequately reserved in light of the macro uncertainty created by COVID. Portfolio performance was strong, and delinquencies and charge-offs were record levels -- record low levels. Ford Credit provided extensions to about 11% of U.S. customers through May, an unprecedented move. Over 90% of these customers have resumed payments without delinquency and we are very pleased with the performance of this portfolio. Lease share remain below industry average and off lease auction performance was better than expected, up 3% sequentially and down 2% year-over-year. We began the quarter with close auctions, growing inventory and falling prices. However, May we saw a healthy recovery in auction volume and prices. At present, we forecast lower auction values for the full year of about 5% consistent with third-party estimates. Now let me turn to guidance. Guidance assumes no meaningful change with current economic environment, continues steady improvement in the stability of the global automotive supply base and no further significant COVID-related disruptions to production or distribution. In the third quarter, we expect to be profitable with adjusted EBIT of $0.5 billion to $1.5 billion, reflecting the economic impact of COVID, weaker global demand for new vehicles, parts and services, and lower profit from Ford Credit. Our recent practice has been to comment on the upcoming quarter only, because of the significant launch activity in the fourth quarter, we thought some early color would be helpful. We expect adjusted EBIT to be a loss in the fourth quarter, driven by the volume impact of new F-150 launch and lower ongoing industry volumes. Note that our major launches in North America have shifted to the fourth quarter in line with our COVID-related production disruption.  We anticipate the downtime changeover and ramp-up will reduce F-150 wholesale significantly in the quarter. This launch impact will more than offset the non-occurrence of the 2019 UAW contract bonuses in the fourth quarter, which is worth roughly $600 million. Our new Bronco Sport and Mustang Mach-E are also launching in the quarter. The limited level of wholesales will not have a material impact on our fourth quarter results. We also expect lower Ford Credit profits in the fourth quarter versus last year. All that said, we expect adjusted EBIT to be a loss for the full year. I'm optimistic that we're well-positioned for what lies ahead and to deliver excellent products and services for our customers. With that, let me turn the call back to, Jim, for a few comments before we move to Q&A. Great. Ultimately, the performance in the second quarter comes down to operational execution by the teams. And if you look at our return to work, which is not only safely, but production in our wholesales, vehicle sales came with that and inventory management, really strong performance by the teams. We were near full production by the end of the quarter and we -- greater cost reductions and cash reductions than we had anticipated initially as well. Again, base on the keen focus on cost and cash. There is also favorable pricing environment for products and mix. And Ford Credit auction values and credit losses overall portfolio performance was strong. So, I guess, at the end of the day a strong execution. And as it relate -- second part of your question again was -- as related to how much sales is going to prevail in the year? I think the operational execution is something we pride ourselves on and expect to work really hard to make sure it's very sticky. We've got a lot of work ahead of us for sure in the back half of the year with some really important launches in the fourth quarter and we continue to drive improvements in the fixed accelerate grow areas that we've talked about. But as reflected in our guidance for profitability in the third quarter is, we're going to continue to operate in an operationally excellent manner. Yeah. Great. Thanks, Jim. So as it relates cost actions, we've been taking -- we have been talking about for some time now is the focus on fitness and design of the business. And so we're going to continue to be passionately focused on making sure the right design for the business and with fitness as a priority. And so certainly, there are things that we appropriately undertook to preserve cash and reduce costs in response to the environment. But we're also looking at opportunities to learn from this and identify areas to further accelerate our fitness and redesign opportunities that are ahead. So that's really what I have to say and that -- otherwise essentially reflected in the guidance, we have the third and fourth quarters as we look out. And on the third -- go ahead. Yeah. Yeah. On the F-150 side, we try to do is characterize it is more impactful than the UAW launch essentially, of 6 -- sorry, UAW contract bonuses of $600 million. So beyond that, there is not much more we can we can say. Certainly when you have America's best-selling vehicle for 38 years and gaining share of best series in the quarter, you can see the popularity of that vehicle claiming to our overall business. So the ramp down, ramp back up with a successful launch will have a big impact on the quarter which to our expect we never loss. As it relates to Europe comment, by the end of this year we expect to have roughly $1 billion improvement in structural cost actions since the beginning when was announced in Q3 \u201818 it's cumulative. That includes the reductions of positions I mentioned 10,000 positions in Western Europe, 7,500 of which have been completed already, as well as 2,000 positions in Russia, as well as the reduction of manufacturing footprint by six facilities on a total of 17. So, again, we're going to review our center in order to look at opportunities to make sure we're the right design for the business as we look out at the opportunities ahead of us and nothing incremental to announce at this moment. But to-date, we've incurred $3.9 billion of EBIT charges and $1.4 billion of cash. So you with $7.1 billion to go, up to $7.1 billion to go and charges up to $5.6 billion in cash. The other thing you know, continue to execute on the result as well, so nothing new to announce at this time, but you're keenly focused on it. Yeah. I guess what I want to say is that the team has been very focused on opportunities, not just during this time of COVID crisis, but before that to get more fit and improve our cost structure, you are seeing that 900 line results entering into the crisis. With the crisis, we've had an opportunity to further reassess how we work and what opportunities we have in our cost structure to demonstrate to ourselves, we can take swift action, again, the teams around the world has done a great job in all areas. We are certainly mindful of what you're suggesting that these costs come back into the cost structure in ways that are unwelcome. But we're going to do everything we can to make sure that well, it shouldn't be volume related costs, but we're going to get more and more fit over time. It's hard for me to re -- undo what's happened over the past few months. We've had -- the delays were having are commensurate with what happened as a result of the production shutdown. And the teams throughout that timeframe did a great job getting us ready for launch. And so if you look at the back half of the year in aggregate, we're essentially guiding to less than $0.5 billion to $1.5 billion of profit. And certainly, there has been a shift to the fourth quarter as a result of those losses in the big impact on F-150 being in the fourth quarter. Yeah. I mean, first, I want to emphasize for the third quarter, we expected cash flow to be higher than EBIT and the fourth quarter would be lower due to the timing of the working capital, social, the launches and the seasonal effects. As you look further out, from a liquidity standpoint, we have, of course, confidence in our ability to repay the debt that we have. We have net debt roughly equal to cash. And what we said was that even in scenarios where we have a COVID related plant closures again and/or demand declines that would have $20 billion or more in cash. So our certainly our base expectation is for more than that. And as we look out to the future, we're focused on optimizing our free cash flow driving toward our long-term margin opportunities and with that will come even greater cash and liquidity opportunities for us to consider none of the pain downloads and credit, of course, but through paying debt, receiving the dividend and to dilute sharer purchases as well."

            "name": "Jim Hackett",
            "content": "Thanks, Lynn, and hello to everyone. In a moment I will share with you how absolutely proud I am of the way our team has performed during the COVID pandemic, which of course, has challenged every aspect of our business. But before I do, I don't want this moment to pass without giving some important perspective on where Ford Motor Company stands relative to racial justice. I've been heartened, frankly, to see our industry, like, other industries step-up in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd. And of course, hand-in-hand with others, there's a deep outpouring of collective grief and frustration that moved us all very deeply. It was much more than a moment and time that will fade but rather, we must make it a turning point for our society. Ford is committed to leading from the front with action to enable social mobility and economic success in the African-American community, include -- including programs in which the company has invested for more than a century. The Ford Motor Company Fund in particular invests in a broad range of initiatives addressing social justice, racism, equality and economic opportunity, and we're looking forward to more opportunities to affect positive change. Now, in the past week since Mr. Floyd death, I have met nightly with a small team of people to think as deeply as possible about what has not worked in the past that we need to address in the future. We've begun to map the experience of Black Lives of Ford and see areas where improvements and enhancement would go a long way to address many of the concerns that have been voiced. Ford is committed to leading from the front and taking action and the results will prove themselves over time. This is deeply a part of our culture and history in the Ford Motor Company Fund in particular, has invested over many decades at the ground level to address issues of social justice, racism, equality and economic opportunity, and we look forward to sharing much more of this in the future. Okay, so let me turn to the quarter, which I would summarize in two ways. First, strong execution in this challenging environment, and second, meaningful progress on our plan to create a vibrant Ford Motor Company with exciting products that people want and well-positioned to capitalize on the new technology and trends that are transforming our industry. I couldn't be prouder, as I said, of the optimism and the effectiveness our team demonstrated managing through and beyond the COVID crisis. From the start, I think, Ford has distinguished itself on three principles, protecting our team and doing our part to limit the spread of the virus, safeguarding the health of our business and stepping up the building supplying much needed personal protective and healthcare equipment. On all three accounts [ph] the team performed exceptionally well under difficult circumstances. This strong execution enabled us to deliver much better financial results than we expected just three months ago. For example, our team did a fantastic job safely restarting production and wholesale exceeded targets. Frankly, our focus on safety enabled our efficient restart as we followed our return to work playbook very, very closely. Our focused on safety also extended to our supply chain as we work directly with our suppliers and logistics providers to minimize the disruption. In addition, our team also worked hard on costs, including CapEx, which help reduce losses and cash burn in the quarter ad these factors are what led to our outperformance. Another highlight of the quarter is our profitable Commercial Vehicle business. It continues to gain share globally. And Ford Credit, it remains a pillar of strength for our customers and it's a competitive advantage. So we're all proud to tell you that the balance sheet remains extremely solid and positions us to weather further disruptions and headwinds. Tim will provide further details in a moment on the balance sheet. Importantly, this intense focus on manage -- managing through the crisis is not knocked us off our mission to author own destiny and shape the future of Ford. Since our last earnings call, we have revealed the all new 2021 F-150 and are on our new Bronco family of vehicles. These vehicles along with upcoming Mustang Mach-E represent Ford's modern product vision, highly desirable iconic vehicles packed with innovation and human-centered design features. And they're fully connected in ways to enhance quality and constantly improving ownership experience through fast over the air updates. Let me give you some color on the F-150. The all new version we showed in June was born from decades of deep focus on what customers want, a new human-centered design capabilities that helps us invent the unobvious features and capability customers will love and value. The new F-150 is packed with dozens of new innovative features and upgrades that we believe will make this the market leading truck for 43 years and that's an even stronger proposition for our customers. We're in great shape to launch the new one -- the new F-150 on time, and with high quality, which of course, requires now change over in our plants in Dearborn in Kansas City. An important sell down of the current model is also going well as demonstrated by great news in our market share. For example, in the U.S. while sales decline, we perform better than the industry due in part to the strength from our trucks that's being the F-150, Ranger and our SUVs exploring Lincoln Aviator and Corsair. The total share was up 20 basis points in the quarter to 14.5% and within that number our retail share was up 120 basis points to 13.3% as series gained 250 basis points of segment share to 33.3% Turning to the all new Bronco. The outpouring of enthusiasm from the public immediate after the reveal earlier this month, candidly speaks for itself. Reservations for Bronco, well, they surpassed even our most optimistic initial projections. Our entire team like the over 150,000 customers who reserve one are super excited about the Bronco. This family of vehicles has big upside potential in the growing off-road category and this is a category with a leading OEM. There's not been seriously challenged until now and we have proven credibility in this off-road space with Raptor in particular and we are the number one cross shop brand for jeep today. Initial customer demand for Bronco is so high that we are actively working to increase our annual production right now. I also want to give you a quick personal story on the status of the Mach-E, which will go on sale later this year and opportunity to drive an advanced prototype recently in Ann Arbor [ph]. The experience was just stunning from start to finish. When you sit in the driver's seat, everything is personalized. My profile automatically loaded into the Mach-E before I press the start button, seat position, screen colors, preferences, Apple CarPlay in ways were seamlessly integrated into the SYNC 4 system. I didn't set off on drive in whisper mode. Now the drive was astonishingly smooth and powerful. And I use the one pedal driving system, braking and battery regeneration were perfectly integrated. Then, I did switch on bridle mode. You can see me smiling and I can tell you the performance was pure Mustang. Sure foot [ph] is incredibly quick as I took curves. The experience was incredibly intuitive and the cluster tells you exactly what you need to know, if nothing extraneous. Yes, I left with a big smile on my face because I know our customers will soon enjoy this same experience. When I see these products come to life, I feel better and better about our decision to reallocate capital spending from sedans to trucks and commercial vehicles and SUVs, was controversial at the time, it's paying off. We have even more new products in the pipeline in areas where Ford is strong today and its whitespaces where we can earn stronger returns and grow share. Now these new products are critical to our target to reduce the age of our showroom in the U.S. by over 40% or more competitive 3.1 years by 2023. OEMs really with the highest replacement rate and younger showroom age have generally gained market share profitably. It's a good place to be in. By several third-party measurements, Ford brand reputation is improving as well and we believe we have much more potential for improvement as we launch these new exciting products. I just want to take a moment and touch on our plan for electric vehicles. We're about midway through our plan to invest more than $11.5 billion through 2022 and there'll be more after that with an increasing mix of spend on all-electric vehicles. For bringing the power of choice to our customers with hybrids, plug-in hybrids and pure electric, by the fourth quarter, we'll have 15 electrified nameplates available to customers around the world and nearly 10% of our wholesales will come from some Ford forms, excuse me, of electrification. We are deploying this technology across our lineup and price points to bring improved capability, fuel economy and emissions to as many people as possible just as we did with our EcoBoost technology a decade ago. Nameplates that will follow are all-electric are the territory in China are Escape and Kuga plug-in hybrids, which offer an estimated 100 mpg and the F-150 PowerBoost hybrid, I just ordered one of these, as well as our Mustang Mach-E BEV. These will be followed by an all-electric versions of our market leading F-150 and Transit vans. Electric vehicles are also a big part of Lincoln's future and you'll see this unfold in the months and years ahead. As you know, in June, we finalized our strategic alignment -- alliance with VW, which will accelerate execution of our commercial vehicle and electric vehicle strategy. This alliance also significantly strengthens Argo AI, which now combines unmatched expertise with the global reach of Ford and VW together. This positions Ford well as self-driving vehicles become a significant new source of revenue and profit in the years to come. Maybe journey will be a long one, but Ford is now well-positioned to run this race and compete like few others can. Finally, in a moment, Tim will provide an update on the progress of our global redesign. We are aggressively reshaping our business and restructuring underperforming operations around the world, rationalizing our product portfolio to play to our strengths and attacking costs. Obviously, Ford isn't immune to the effects of the pandemic, including the new vehicle market that has been waylaid by the pandemic. But we continue to manage through this crisis even as we continue to create a vibrant profitably growing company, one that we're confident, we'll win in an era of smart vehicles for a smart world. With that, I'll turn it over to Tim for more color on the quarter and our expectations for the remainder of the year. Tim? Thanks, Tim. Yeah. Just a few comments, I want to reinforce the following about the quarter and the second half of this year. In the face of unprecedented sector headwinds operationally, we maintained robust safety protocols and aggressively mitigated production losses, while effectively navigating a tenuous supply base, I mean, everything was in motion. We're keenly focused on cost and cash discipline. Jim Farley led an effort here that's just extraordinary. We are optimistic and ready for the production ramp-up of the F-150, the Mach-E as you've heard, the Bronco Sport and Bronco, all with the spirit of high quality and extreme focus on doing a great job there. We continue important investments. We didn't stop spending on the future in commercial vehicles, AV, connectivity and electrification. We did continue to implement our global redesign and portfolio refresh and we have measurable results to show that this is going very well. And as you just heard from Tim, we did a great job of this. We have a discipline management of our balance sheet and an extremely strong liquidity position from all the actions we took earlier this year. This ensures our financial flexibility, particularly as we know in uncertain time. So, Operator, with that, let's move to Q&A, please. Hi, there. So, Emmanuel, it's Jim Hackett, I think, I'm going to send that to Tim. Thank you. Great. So let me start with the interest expense. It has ticked up as we bolster a balance sheet and ensure we have not only strong cash position, strong liquidity position, and it suits us very well. And then, as we looked out, we feel comfortable with our cash position and confident so that such that we repaid and roughly half of the outstanding revolvers that we drew down earlier this week.  And we'll continue to look at opportunities to repay additional debt including revolvers over time as a business performed and -- I mean - anything announced at this time, but certainly we'll be looking at opportunities to reduce interest expense and delever the balance sheet in that way is where am I as the debt levels come down, of course we have the $40 billion liquidity, as you repeat a line of credit, so feel comfortable with our cash and liquidity position. The interest expense for the back half of the year, you can assume roughly $0.5 billion per quarter will be a reasonable expectation. And then your question on S.A.R, year-to-date S.A.R was about 13.4 million units in the first half and we see this improving throughout the year. And beyond that, I think we'll add more colors a year progresses. But we do see again an opportunity for it to improve as the year progresses. So, Rob, it's Jim Hackett. I'm going to ask Jim Farley, can you imagine the calls we've gotten Rod about how many can you make so. He has been working on that day and night, so I'll give him that in just a second. But I want to make sure I'm tracking with you on Europe in the sense that, you understand that structural costs effort ahead of the pandemic looks to be really precious, doesn't it and the absorption there without the volume is because of the effort that these guys have put forward. So I'm not worried that as you just portrayed that there is a variable costs kind of avalanche that you know, smothers us, I don't think that's going to happen. Right now, we're not anticipating big inflation, for example. In fact, suppliers are all trying to get back up to levels of efficiency where we start to enjoy some savings. So I just want to add that color to the way I think about variable costs. I understand why you were looking at the forecast, but I just step back and think about that. But Jim, do you want to talk about the Bronco, great news and the challenge. Hey, Adam. It's Jim. Thank you. It's a question that when maybe a year ago, we started to see lines starting to arrange around, make versus buy own versus source. So we had a deep discussion about this. I've met with a number of the people that that are in the supply side of this and it was our estimation. In fact, our whole team went through a really deep dive on this six months ago that the supply chain has ramped up since EV his [ph] Gigafactory. And so there is plenty there that does not warrant us to migrate our capital into owning our own factory. There is no advantage in the ownership in terms of a cost or a sourcing as what Ford can draw on. So I just can confirm to you that it actually works. It works for us to go the path we are now. With that said, there is some challenges that are in that supply chain between themselves. There is some litigation that's going on. We're hopeful that, they get settled quickly. It really doesn't matter to us how it gets settled, but it may, it confuses some of the suppliers about their investments in some of their plants here in the United States, which is another way of saying the way the U.S. MCA would benefit as intended is to have these factories be built in the United States for supply of batteries and so we're well positioned believing that will happen. Yeah. So my first reaction I'm thinking, thank God we made the decision, right? Because you know what it replaced in the facility where we're making in some of the sedans we're making money. So you got to think of that with Adam's last question about the makeup of Ford and what's going out and what's coming in and product. And Jim, I'll let you talk about some of our targets there. And Jim, I just -- I want to sneak in, because you've all seen our campaign about, we build more vehicles in America for -- by Americans in the whole industry. And this Bronco is, look, we're hiring people here in Southeast Michigan to build this product 2,000 to 3,000 additional people. So it's a -- I know I get teased about it because it came up in the discussion with the President, but I was just so proud to be able to explain that here we are in the middle of a pandemic with kind of challenges in the job market and Ford's going to be hiring people to build this product. So it's really a great news story. Yeah. Jim, do you want to take that one? Well, I think, Jim mentioned this and Tim did is that South America, the journey there as compared to some of the other markets started. We phased out of unprofitable vehicles. We ended focused production and Pacheco exited heavy trucks business, discontinued Fiesta, ceased operations at San Paulo manufacturing based off the Sigma engine production. But Jim has been really working hard on the restructuring to serve a dealer network better in terms of our customers improving the availability for the remaining dealers. So I think this is a story that's still yet to be completed. But Jim, I want to let you answer why you think in the short-term we had this better than expected performance. Well, I'm excited to tell you that the plan is working there. COVID was -- it kind of helped focus us, but the commercial vehicles strength was supported by a 34% increase in sales at JMC, which gained 40 basis points of share. And the second -- it's the second consecutive quarter of share gain of 20 basis points, which is whether you're hinting about. We were talking about it in a way that this was the breakthrough that we were looking for. I think, Corsair is the -- comes in the middle of this. It is the first locally produced Lincoln product and it breaks all records that we've had in one month for the sale of a product like that. It contributed to the 12% increase in sales for Lincoln and now the new Aviator is following on. My only regret is that the whole Board was going to be there in October just kind of review the progress that you're noting and we can't travel now because of COVID, but Jim Farley and Anning Chen, our President there had done a really good job of getting our arms around that market. Okay. Let me start with the last part first. Thanks for the question. We haven't completed our planning process for next year yet. We have said that for some time now that we're focused on fitness activities, which not only includes costs, but also CapEx to make sure that we're efficiently and effectively allocating capital. So we'll continue to focus on that, and you're seeing some of that reflected in the results on CapEx this year. So fitness, you also seen the ebb and flow of product programs, but we're pleased with the progress that we're making $1 million to $1.5 million down year-over-year, but again, nothing further to share at this stage on 2021. As far as working capital goes, bear in mind in the second quarter the working capital dynamics played out, we talked about production resumed, of course, during the shutdown period, we had payables who repaid and was production resumes as payables start getting no backup, but the restoration of payables continuing to the third quarter and that's one of the reasons we said that the third quarter cash will be better than EBIT in the fourth quarter cash with the shutdown seasonally and launches that are happening particularly F-150, this cash flow would be lower than EBIT. So I guess what you're seeing is not only the benefits from our fitness and our redesign and our underlying results improving in light of the COVID environment, but even underlying that, that'll continue to play out for the back half of this year and then into \u201821, as we're very keenly focused on all -- in all costs and cash opportunities. But as we've talked about earlier, we're in a position now where we have a very strong cash position and liquidity position, and we're comfortable with outlook as we look ahead. Jim?"

At this time, I would like to welcome you to the Ford Motor Company First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Lynn Antipas Tyson, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Lynn?\nLynn Tyson: Thank you, Holly. Welcome everyone to Ford Motor Company's [first] quarter earnings call. Consistent with social distancing, speakers today are connected from different location, so in advance I appreciate your patience in putting any latency as we answer questions. I also personally hope that you and all of your loved ones are safe. Presenting today are Jim Hackett, our President and CEO; Jim Farley, our Chief Operating Officer; and Tim Stone, our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us is Marion Harris, CEO of Ford Credit. Jim Hackett, will begin with a brief review of our results and how we are putting people first through this pandemic including our team members, customers and partners. Jim Farley, will cover the operational excellence required to execute solutions while ensuring Ford comes out of this even stronger. And Tim will talk about the prudent and proactive actions we are taking to enhance our cash position while preserving the financial flexibility to fund our redesign and growth initiatives including critical launches. Then we'll turn the call to Q&A and Jim will close with a few remarks. Our results discussed today include some non-GAAP references. These are reconciled to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures in the appendix of our earnings deck, which can be found along with the rest of our earnings materials at shareholder.ford.com. Today's discussion includes forward-looking statements about our expectations. Actual results may differ from those stated and the most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ are included on slide 23 of our deck. In addition, unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year-over-year, company EBIT, EPS and operating cash flow are on an adjusted basis and product mix is on a volume weighted basis. Now let me turn the call over to Jim Hackett.\nJim Hackett: Thanks Lynn, and hello everyone. And Lynn let me thank you for doing an incredible job in putting this virtual call together. In addition to Jim Farley, our Chief Operating Officer; and Tim Stone, our Chief Financial Officer, I'm proud to say that Rudy and Ozzie, my two big girls are joining me today in the call. Well, you know, the nature of times brings to mind the notion of paradox. And I like to think of the definition of a paradox as two truths that compete. Let me explain. The first truth is that safety is of the utmost concern in a pandemic; yours, your loved ones' and the people you work with. The communities you live in and amazingly all other humans you interact with, their safety guarantees your safety. The second truth, there is no future if we don't have an economic system that is always on. We didn't realize there was an off switch. We knew it might go into a recession more like a dimmer switch, but off. Well now as we bring these two truths together, they compete. Turning the economy back on challenges the question of whether it is safe enough. My goal today is to provide an update on where Ford stands and hopefully illustrate that Ford is doing a great job of managing this paradox and confirm that we have control of the business in a very difficult time. I am pleased to report to you that we have the foresight to move early, ahead of the shutdown. We kicked off our coronavirus response task force led by about 30 senior leaders from across the company. Independent of virus we call we had around the same time, reorganized our top team, enabled by a new Chief Operating officer position held by Jim Farley. Candidly, this now looks quite prescient as Jim in his new role, was able to quickly marshal our operating team to focus quickly on the most important actions. Minutes that led to hours made a huge difference in our responsiveness. We went from a 1,000 people who work remotely from home to more than 60,000. And we've had terrific productivity in the face of this unforeseen challenge, including our team in China which preceded the economic closure around the world. Jim, will talk more about that in a moment. Now, as we approach this challenge, we laid out three clear priorities underpinned by what we would say are Ford values. The first, undeniably, we have to protect the safety of our people, and do our part to limit the spread of the virus. Second, to leverage our knowledge and capability to deliver critical supplies to frontline workers and patients, while taking care of customers, dealers and communities in which we live. And three, skillfully manage our business through the crisis, safeguarding what we believe is a very bright future for Ford Motor Company. I have found it is true, that Ford people are at their best in tough times. It was true when Ford was building aircraft and arms that formed the arsenal of democracy in World War Two. And it was true just a short decade ago when we rallied to avoid bankruptcy, and a government bailout. And we emerged from the great recession a stronger company. I want to confirm it's certainly been true today. Let me take you through a bit more detail on those three priorities. As I said, the first priority was to protect our people, and do our part to limit the spread of this virus. So in mid-March, we were among the earliest company - the early companies to instruct the vast majority of our employees to work remotely. We also partnered with the UAW and other automakers to introduce new safety protections in our factories and warehouses, and then to shut down those facilities worldwide. In an illustration of the art of a global pandemic, these actions were taken even as we were cautiously restarting operations with our joint venture partners in China. Sadly though, in the face of this, Ford has not been immune from the ravages of the virus, we've lost 11 colleagues in the U.S. and the UK to this pandemic. Our second priority was to leverage our knowledge and capability to deliver critical supplies to frontline workers and patients. I couldn't have been more proud of our organization. The bottom line though, is when society needs you, we answer the call. In this case, we're doing that in many countries that Ford calls its own. Ford has always been a family business from the generations of leadership to the generations of the proud employees. And with that, we believe comes a special responsibility to take care of each other and this pandemic, of course is no different, in fact, it requires that in spades. We know this devastating crisis will come to an end. But in the meanwhile, we're doing everything we can to help. As we suspended a large portion of our work on designing and building great vehicles, we rally to begin producing vitally needed personal protection and medical equipment. Around the globe, our people, including the UAW partners, as I said, amaze me every day as they engineer and produce hundreds of ambulances and are up to 100,000 respirators for healthcare professionals with 3M. More than 8 million face shields so far. 50,000 patient ventilators with GE Healthcare. And about 1 million face masks, more like surgical masks every day. And up to now 100,000 washable isolation gowns per week with Joyson Safety Systems. Putting people first also means though taking care of our customers. We announced we find payments on new vehicles and a better online experience for customers. No contact vehicle delivery and service including disinfected products. And roadside and other services through the FordPass app. We also worked quickly to take care of our dealers with digital marketing, sales and service tools and advice on managing liquidity as you know, the government instituted a program that dealers could qualify for to enable them to keep their organizations intact, and taking care of our communities with millions of dollars in contributions of vehicles in cash. The third priority which will be the bulk of our call today was to skillfully manage our business through the crisis. One of the rallying cries rushed through all of this just as it was in '08 and '09, is not that - is that we must not only weather the crisis, we need to emerge from it ready to build a brighter future. So yes, as even though we took measures to preserve cash, we are moving forward on our creating tomorrow together plan, you're going to ask me about that. And we're totally committed to it. This is going to leverage fresh new portfolio of vehicles, a commitment to autonomy and electrification, along with connectivity, global partnerships that look precious as well that they started before this pandemic. And they're going to serve service in the future, including Rivian because we've gotten questions about that, and a better customer experience. In a moment, Jim Farley will provide more detail on the progress we're making in our underlying business during the crisis. I'm really proud of him and he's just worked around the clock frankly. And so to say it has been a 24/7 effort is not an exaggeration. At the same time, we're pulling every appropriate lever to protect our core business. Strengthen the balance sheet, Tim Stone, also working around the clock to make sure that the company lead in this initiative and bolster our cash to optimize our financial flexibility. I'm proud that we have that all in place before the first quarter was over. Part of skillfully managing through this crisis is having a well thought out protocol though, for back to work. And we did this for China. And I'm pleased that earlier today we announced we'll restart our European manufacturing production, with enhanced employee protection protocols in place. Is taking a phased approach starting on May 4. We will restart vehicle and the engine production at most of our sites in continental Europe. And there'll be a gradual ramp up over the next few months before full production is resumed globally. Well still, there's no denying the negative economic consequences of a pandemic. In the first quarter, our adjusted free cash flow was negative by $2.2 billion. Revenue amazingly was still $34 billion and we incurred of course an EBIT loss of around $0.6 billion. In fact, heading toward the middle of the quarter, listen to this, we were on track to meet or exceed our original guidance for adjusted EBIT in the quarter. Well, as I said earlier, be assured that everyone at Ford is squarely focused on both today, and in our future. We believe it remains bright. And it is a great source of motivation for us as we serve that future and of course, take care of all these immediate needs. Right now, I'd like to turn it over to Jim Farley. Jim?\nJim Farley: Thanks, Jim. Operational excellence especially in this crisis requires, obviously the dedication, but also collaboration, partnership and support from the entire enterprise, our suppliers, our dealers, employees, unions, our JV partners, and our execution. And its excellence demonstrated this early on in China as Jim said. I know we're going to come out of this a lot stronger. But we need to be agile, have a bias towards action and be very transparent with our employees, our customers and partners. Early on in China, we focused on business continuity. We mapped our suppliers for the liquidity in the supply chain. We created a unique logistics portal to track our supply chain. We secured air freight capacity to deliver critical safety equipment to our team in China importantly including our dealers. And we used the same air capacity to ensure of supply of critical parts to regions like North America outside of China. We then partnered closely with our dealers. We retract in-store traffic, inventory, the financial liquidity and health. And in the face of shuttering our dealerships, we turn together work together to drive demand and ensure quality service to our customers. We provided those customers with a more robust app to order vehicles online. In fact, in China today, over a third of our sales are now direct online. We increased doorstep delivery of sanitized vehicles with what we call zero touch. We currently expanded to schedule remote service and vehicle pickup for maintenance and make it easy for customers. And our joint venture partners were up and running as early as February 10. In fact, as Jim said, one of them JMC repurposed our two ton transit van to manufacture over 1500 Ford Transit ambulances in the first quarter. From the start, we focused on a return to work protocol for our Chinese business. And that involved governance like reworking manufacturing safety requirements and restructuring a lot of jobs inside our facilities to ensure we can protect distancing. This protocol is being extended to Europe, and will also be used when we restart our operations around the world. We call it our playbook. In addition to those accomplishments, our China team also quickly honed in our cost. In the face of significant demand disruption Ford China delivered year-over-year improvements in both contribution and structural costs. Actually, they got close to their initial EBIT targets for the quarter, offsetting all the COVID impacts. The actions we took in China became best practice for us. Part of our playbook as we tackle the virus globally protecting our people, and limiting the spread of the virus as Jim described. I've been in the industry 30 years, I've been in Ford 13. I've seen a lot of wonderful leadership, especially in '08 and '09, but I have never seen what's happened at Ford over the last weeks. Countless acts of leadership throughout every level of the organization, replicated and added to the success we\u2019ve realized in China. Power Ford, it is in our DNA. And we\u2019re proud to share it with that capabilities to many other people. The stark reality of a protracted global shut down of our sector and our vertical has forced a laser focus on cost and liquidity. And just as we did in China, we've ratcheted it down spending across the board, both fixed and variable. To ensure we come out of this stronger, we protected our cycle plan, our launches and our technology roadmaps including connectivity. We believe this pandemic could affect our customers live and work for many years to come with the zero touch now as an integral part of their lives going forward, perhaps spurring on even more interest in adoption of autonomy, especially goods delivery, and micro mobility. While effects of the virus may cause some shifts in timing, we are really excited about our forthcoming launch of the redesigned F-150. It is the anchor of our F series brand. It is America's Best Selling Vehicle for 43 years, and the launch will feature the first ever hybrid electric F-150. We're also revealing a new Bronco brand. We\u2019re going to continue our launch of 30 market specific Ford and Lincoln vehicles in China over the next three years 10 of which will be electric. We're going to offer electrified versions of the Lincoln Corsair, and the Ford Escape and Kuga, which is now in launch in China and in Europe. We're going to continue preparations for the much anticipated return of the legendary Ford Bronco next year. And shortly after I began my new role in February, I did a two day deep dive with the automotive leadership team, where we really grow. And how we were going to address the task and opportunities ahead. And from the start, I was not only impressed of the diversity of skills and knowledge of our team, but the look in their eye and desire and accountability to take on those opportunities and move the company forward. Together we came up as a simple frame. We have a few things to fix and accelerate, and we need a growth plan for the company. The recent challenges presented by the virus have just amplified our commitment to these three areas. There is no grace period for transforming Ford. Two weeks ago, we announced a reorganization that will allow us to better execute against those things that we need to fix and accelerate and to establish our growth initiatives. We empowered a talented and diverse group of leaders from inside but also from outside of Ford to drive transformation into high growth, high margin businesses. Among the changes, Kumar Galhotra, who has been President in North America will take on expanded role for South America and ING markets as well. Lisa Drake, a seasoned Executive in our industrial system, was named Chief Operating Officer for North America and remains Vice President of Global Purchasing. She will be laser focused on our launches, our cost and our industrial system in North America. Gil Gur Arie, who has distinguished career in the Israeli Military Intelligence Core has joined Ford as Chief Global Data Insights and Analytics. And Ted Cannis whose team developed the revolutionary Mustang Mach-E, and the F-150 battery electric was appointed General Manager Commercial Vehicles. Now these leadership changes were specifically aimed at sharpening our focus on product and launch execution, fully leveraging smart connected vehicles and big data to serve our customers and the company, to improve our quality and lower our costs and creating a dedicated commercial vehicle business in the US and Canada. I'm confident this new structure will facilitate a much faster enterprise decision making and further efficiencies. I want to assure you that the same commitment and excellence we displayed to overcome COVID-19 are what we are leveraging, as we bring Ford's manufacturing and salary population back online, and turn our attention towards launching those incredible new Ford's and our winning portfolio. Over to Tim.\nTim Stone: Thanks, Jim. It is just over a year since I came to Ford. The primary reason I joined was my belief that company has abundant opportunities to improve customer experience, enhance effectiveness, grow and create superior value for stakeholders. Being a part of this team, as we've tackled the crisis, has further strengthened my confidence in our team and in Ford's future. That's why throughout our comments on this call, even amid what we're doing to protect people from the virus and help stop its spread, our actions have been consistent with the priorities we've discussed with you for several quarters. First, improving customer experience and operational execution. Second, progressing our global redesign, making tough choices to lay the foundation for improvement in future automotive growth, free cash flow, profitability, and returns on capital. Third, enhancing fitness, through structural costs and capital efficiency and alliances that can drive durable scale benefits. Fourth, prioritizing meaningful opportunities for profitable long term growth in mobility. And fifth, employing continued discipline to drive strong results from Ford Credit. In the first quarter, lower industry volumes across all regions contributed to a 21% decline in wholesale and a 15% decrease in revenue. These results largely drove an adjusted EBIT loss of $0.6 billion and a negative $2.2 billion in adjusted free cash flow. Our results were constrained by the adverse impacts of the virus. We estimate the unfavorable impact to adjusted EBIT was at least $2 billion. In our automotive business, lower volume accounted for $177 million loss in EBIT as $346 million positive EBIT from North America was more than offset by losses in other markets. To be helpful and informed by your input, slide 10 of our deck includes additional color on the drivers of the year-over-year change in EBIT, putting warranty, which is higher by $0.5 billion, and structural costs, which is lower by $0.3 billion. Looking at the business in more detail provides some color on why, up until the middle of the quarter, we were on track to meet or exceed our initial EBIT guidance for the first quarter. Supported by improved product mix and the benefits of our global redesign. In North America, while top and bottom line metrics were negatively affected by the decline in units, both revenue and EBIT did benefit from better mix, especially F Series and Explorer. This improvement reflects our more disciplined approach to capital allocation, which is focused on investments around the globe on our franchise strengths. This includes our upcoming launches of our all new F-150 and three products that are new to the market, a small rugged off road utility, Mustang Mach-E, and Bronco. We will be able to update you on launch timing once we have a better understanding of our operational readiness as we bring our manufacturing back up. EBIT was also negatively affected year-over-year by increased warranty costs as we roll forward higher flow rates from the second half of last year. We also absorbed higher material costs for new models during the quarter. In South America, wholesales and revenue declined 13% and 21% respectively. In addition to the lower volume, revenue also influenced by weaker currencies, which are only partially offset by higher net pricing. Importantly, we narrowed our EBIT loss in the region to $0.1 billion, a 29% year-over-year improvement and our strongest performance since 2013. EBIT results do favorably reflect benefits from our global redesign, including exiting heavy truck production, discontinuing certain passenger vehicles and reducing headcount as we migrate to a lower cost asset light footprint. In Europe, wholesales and revenue were down 25% and 16% respectively. In addition to the virus, wholesales are also weighed down by the timing of our all new Kuga, which follows a normal launch curve. We\u2019re also absorbing the effects of our decision to discontinue low margin products. As we focus our portfolio on industry leading commercial vehicle, a more selective range of passenger vehicles and selected imports. All new vehicles this year include Kuga, Puma and Explorer SUVs which together will drive an increase in our mix of SUVs year-over-year. The decline in volume also reduced EBIT, which was down $4.2 billion year-over-year. As expected, the region absorbs higher material costs to support compliance with new CO2 regulations. The favorable shifts in our European product portfolio, which we expect to continue once we restart production, supported higher net pricing, and the benefits of global redesign actions continue to drive down structural costs. We're on track to complete the balance of our headcount reductions, by 10,000 at year end. China was at the forefront of the crisis. Our team did a great job mitigating the negative effects of the virus on our customers, other stakeholders and on our business results. Wholesales and revenue were down about 30%. New product launches, including Escape and Corsair and faster improvement in sales relative to the market contributed to a 10 basis point improvement in share to 2.2%. Explorer and Aviator are on track to launch this year and should be important additions to our China portfolio. Our China EBIT loss of $0.2 billion was down $0.1 billion year-over-year, as lower volume and adverse exchange are partially offset by improvement in structural cost. Losses on mobility continued to reflect strategic investments in future growth opportunities in mobility services and vehicle business model development for our autonomous vehicle platform. Ford Credit delivered EBT of $30 million in the quarter, down $771 million year-over-year. Portfolio performance is strong in the first quarter and delinquencies and charge offs remain at low levels. However, the results include COVID-19 related accruals of about $700 million, the most significant of which is for future credit losses, as well as lower auction values for off lease units awaiting sale at auction. Lease share remains below industry average and off lease auction values performed better than expected, up 1% year-over-year, and up 2% sequentially. At present most vehicle auctions in the U.S. are closed. Sales volume is very low, and prices are disrupting. As vehicle auctions reopen, we expect market prices to be disrupted for some period. And it is difficult to say how badly or for how many months. However, we do expect used vehicle markets to normalize over time. Managed receivables of $147 billion at quarter end were $9 billion lower year-over-year and $5 billion lower at year end. At the end of the first quarter, Ford Credit had $28 billion in liquidity, which remains above target. And Ford Credit has access to diverse funding sources to continue providing financing in the future. Ford Credit balance sheet is strong with ample liquidity. And importantly, its funding structure is self-liquidating. This means the Ford Credit generates liquidity, which reduces its funding requirements as balance sheet shrinks with lower automotive sales. Ford Credit is an important source of support for customers and dealers during this crisis. And Ford Credit remains an important strategic asset. Now let me turn to automotive liquidity and provide a little more color on some of the strategic actions we've taken since March, to provide additional flexibility during this challenging time. In March, we suspended our regular dividend, which equates to $2.4 billion per year. We also suspended our anti-dilutive share repurchase program, which was S0.2 billion last year. At the same time, we drew down over $15 billion under our corporate and supplemental credit facilities to bring cash on the balance sheet and provide greater certainty. Finally, last week, we completed an $8 billion opportunistic unsecured issuance to further improve our cash and liquidity profile, while most of our global operations remain shut down. As of April 24, our cash balance is strong at $35 billion. An amount we believe is sufficient to take us through at year end with no additional wholesale. Our plan though, as we announced today about Europe is to begin to phased restart in the second quarter as we plan to have wholesale much sooner than the end of the year. Relative to working capital, just like most other OEMs, there are two phases of cash outflow after a halt in production. For us, this began in late March. The first phase is more severe, is driven by about a 45 day run off in supplier payables. We have about $13 billion of production supplier payables after a late March production suspension, which will run off by early May. While this number can move around during the year, depending on scheduled plant shutdowns and other factors, it is a good approximation of that production payable number. The second phase is post runoff. After production payables have been extinguished. Once this happens, our cash outflow drops substantially, our ongoing payments, which are fairly consistent, include structural costs and warranty and vehicle incentive payments. Once production starts, there's an inherent cash flow leverage. Once you've been modest wholesale resume, our cash flow dynamics will improve, driven by the restoration of supplier payables if the large part immediate payment of vehicles upon wholesale. We're also thoroughly assessing and aggressively addressing our operations and looking for opportunities to preserve cash, lower operating costs, improve fitness, and drive our business to amplify our long-term potential. These include reductions of capital spending, deferring or eliminating non-essential expenditures across our business and deferring executive compensation. The incremental cash from these and other actions provide additional flexibility as we navigate this challenging environment. For example, this year we expect CapEx to be $6.3 billion to $6.8 billion down by about $0.5 billion compared with our February guidance and $0.8 billion to $1.3 billion lower than last year. Turning to our outlook, in mid-March, we withdrew our financial guidance for 2020. As a reminder, when we gave you our outlook in early February, we said it excluded impacts of COVID-19. Today, unfortunately, the economic environment remains too uncertain to provide updated guidance for the year. However, assuming in the second quarter, we restart production in a phased way. We believe we will see the largest impact from this crisis in the second quarter as industry volumes continue to be down significantly in every region year-over-year. As a result, we believe in just a second quarter EBIT will be a loss of more than $5 billion. The recovery actions we've taken and are working on are in the billions. But we know we will not be able to recover everything or make up all of the last volume. Lower industry volume will be our biggest headwind this year and any mix in net pressing benefit, we may realize from our global focus on franchise strengths, including exiting lower margin products fully impact of Explorer launched in 2019 and new launches such as F-150, slated for later this year, will be overshadowed by the negative impact of lower industry volume. Relative to structural costs, we expect favorability year-over-year was driven by actions to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 and our ongoing business actions. Before we turn over to QA, let me close with. We remain committed to a strong balance sheet, and doing what is right to preserve our future which is why we've been proactive in charting our course in maximizing liquidity during this uniquely uncertain time. Our recent actions provide flexibility to weather the present disruptions caused by COVID-19 and the confidence to continue to invest in growth opportunities. We have a strong bias reaction to improve our customer experience, operational execution and drive our financial performance, including free cash flow generation over time. I'm optimistic we will better position than ever on the other side of this to achieve our long term potential. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question is going to come from the line of John Murphy, Bank of America.\nJohn Murphy: Good evening, everybody. It is really great to hear from all of you. It is going to be tough to stick to one question, but I will. Typically, out of a very tough time like this, you get a very good recovery, these a lot of the lessons learned in the tough time result in sort of real efficiency and focus. I'm just curious, I mean, Jim, you were talking this and Tim, you're talking about this on the balance sheet side, just curious if you can really illustrate or explain any of those opportunities you're seeing here in the near turn, specifically and because of going through this rolling restart with China and in Europe and North America being you're seeing some of these opportunities ready? If you can give us more details around us so we can understand that because traditionally 1 to 3 years out your margins are significantly higher in some cases. In the past recession they were an all-time highs three years after that we hit the skids in '09? So just trying to understand what you're seeing right now what the opportunities are in China, Europe and ultimately in North America?\nJim Hackett: Thank you, John, Jim Hackett. I'm going to go for all the questioners our quarterback to call so that we don't have big lag here. And, John, just an observation that I agree with you. This is my third crisis in business. This one's a unique one. The other two were substantial. And I observe that there's cost that comes this added to income statement that comes from disruption. For example, we were shipping products, expediting product from China to get to the factories here, parts I should say, so that we didn't have any disruption. And as the virus spread like a water slick the stuff that we were air freighting was eventually going to get stopped in production. So, we had the cost of that and it is what Tim has talked about, that we've been working to offset those kinds of increased costs and there's a lot of examples of that. It is in the billions that we work to. Also confirming with you that in this time of focus, you start to think of things that matter to the company. I don't want you to think of them well, you should have stopped them anyways, these are things that there's no races going on. So, some of the investments that you would have because the virus has diminished participation and things, we don't have that cost so we have the savings there. And then having the focus that Jim Farley talked about, we find that we can actually improve our leverage. So, I want to confirm with you that, yes, we're thinking about this the same way. Now, you asked for some specifics and I'd like to turn it over to Jim, because I think China is a good example of where there was advantage as we came out of this. Jim.\nJim Farley: Thanks, Jim, and hi John. So, in China, we learned a lot, not only to start up the operations safely, we started in mid-February, we're now up to 90% of our salary workforce and all of our plants are up and running. Actually, GMC never shut down. It is the best quarter ever. But they get after cost really quickly, we're able to offset all the COVID impact in the first quarter and we learned a lot. We learned that the mix coming out is very different than the mix going in. And so our mix of product is quite different. It is very favorable. We went online for our sales as said about a third of our sales are now online in North America, it is north of 25%. That's an efficiency and improvement in our fitness. We did lower costs, we expect that to sum that to flow, obviously, in North America, very focused on the recovery items on material costs and warranty costs. Those are the kind of costs that flow into subsequent years. In fact, we're more than committed ever in that 10% EBIT margin in North America. And as Jim said, we're forecasting a lower SAAR. So that must mean obviously our costs are going down. We do have some great launches coming up, which will be a tailwind in North America. The other things we learned in China that we're exporting is to ship patterns as you come back are very important, so are getting the launch teams in the facilities to work launches because we're just in year-end in China launching Kuga and localizing some of our larger SUVs. Those are very important for profitability, very same exercise we're doing in North American in certain fourth quarter. And the last one is supplier readiness. What we learned in China was got to make sure your supply basis ready. So, we've surveyed almost 1500 suppliers in Western Europe and the US to make sure they're ready to come up and have the same playbook in terms of prioritization of safety. So, yes, I mean, the bottom line is, it is a very difficult time, but Ford team is at its best, and we're going after crop costs that will flow. Thanks back to your Jim.\nJim Hackett: Operator, we'll take the next question. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is going to come from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research.\nRod Lache: Thanks everybody. Good to hear from you. Just wanted to follow up on that question. So at this point, if we back out working capital looks like the business in the auto business is running at around a $1.3 billion burn in the quarter. And if you bring your CapEx down to the low 6s, maybe that could even converge on break even at something that looks like it corresponds with a $15 million SAAR. But you talked about coming out of it stronger. So, I was hoping maybe you could just tell us a little bit about some of the approaches that you're taking here. Are there any opportunities to accelerate restructuring, maybe in light of this crisis, and what do you think you might actually look like when we actually do recover to a $15 million SAAR?\nJim Hackett: Thank you, Rod. It is Jim Hackett. Let me start with saying to you that 26 years in a job like this, I never had a business plan that was called pandemic. And I mean that in all sincerity because we just never imagined the economy turning off. And the other two crises that I was in we had deep troughs of issues, but this was unique. Secondly, board has been really diligent at working on a number of fronts that I'm proud to tell you, as I look back at other companies, which I would admire in our industry, that some of you referenced. And I take the beginning point of when I guess they started and where they are now, I would say that are the effort to get all the new products in the portfolio are going to be extraordinarily beneficial to the company. You just got to remember we're going from one of the oldest product lines to the new. And in the course of this pandemic comes in and interrupts. And it is going to slide, the timing of that, but we've got a new F150. We've got a new small rugged off road SUV. We've got an all-new Bronco. We got the Mustang Mach-E. So, all the work before the pandemic is valued that we're going to enjoy. This is why we've believed - we thought last year was going to be the tunnel year and we had the problems in Chicago. We've totally fixed that. Explorer was doing really well. And now we were waiting for this new product. The second thing is we started on restructuring, particularly in Europe. Just want to comment again, I'm not being cynical, but that was 40 years of problems that we took on in a very short time. We actually sped up the commitment for restructuring. Bob Shanks and I had one plan. We turned up the vitality of it, we spent ahead. We actually borrowed money to match the returns we were going to get. It all worked out. We're not done there. I'll let Jim in a minute explain what's going on. We initiated a redesign, and I don't know whether that sunk in, but we took over 25% of the management out of the company in advance of what we didn't expect, which is a pandemic, although we thought a recession was in the offing. Many of you said, this is the longest expansion when we were getting ready for that. So, that's serving us well. And in fact, the way the team's working now with a recent management change I made it is moving much faster with much more clarity. So, I'm just want to confirm that the only thing that I would witness with you is I didn't expect China to be a problem in the last two and a half years the way it turned out to be. But I now feel that there was more problems there than just what Ford enjoyed. And now, the work we did earlier to start getting things turned around, we actually are feeling confident that China's actually the picture there is going to improve. Particularly with the emphasis that we put on to get the product right in that market it wasn't right, which is the gestation period for getting all that flipped around is not the thing that happens in the course of 90-days or 6 months. But that's not asking you to wait longer. It is just saying that, if you're impatient about all the stuff we've done, and why aren't we seeing the value I'm trying to portray to you they are synchronous, and they will yield that, but I didn't expect the pandemic. So, Jim Farley, let me just tie this back to you and let you add virtue in terms of the way you see the restructuring in Europe.\nJim Farley: Thanks, Jim. Hi, Rod. Very quickly. Just want to emphasize that the EU and South America restructuring are no regrets move. We reduced the headcount in Europe by 12,000 people teammates by the end of this year, we closed facilities. Bridgend still to come. We've cut costs, especially structural costs in South America. We have 40% less staff. We've gotten out of Fiesta and Focus. We got out of the heavy truck business and consolidated San Bernardo. So, those are no regrets move. But, the hangover COVID is obvious. And everything's on the table. Our team under owns the plan, it is they're still locked down and execute. In North America, we see a lot of opportunity and we want to make sure we have the capital to invest in North America. We do see a way to 10% EBIT in a lower industry even with the flow through of the cost actions we are taking plus as Jim said those great new products. And really for my team, they want to make sure that we have room for growth, especially in North America. And so that's why we're going to look at all the operations critically. Thanks. Over to you, Jim.\nJim Hackett: Yes, Rod. And just to confirm there's that one truth, right, don't waste a crisis. So, I want to confirm to you that the attitude in the spirit is if we can speed things up or we can now have what I would say more productive discussions with social plans or governments, of course, all that's on the table. And the kinds of things that we would be working on but nothing to announce today.\nRod Lache: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is going to come from the line of Emmanuel Rosner, Deutsche Bank.\nEmmanuel Rosner: Good evening, everybody.\nJim Hackett: Emmanuel, hi, confirming I can hear you. Thanks.\nEmmanuel Rosner: Okay, great. I was actually hoping to ask yet another follow up on the restructuring plan. So, I hear you loud and clear. No grace period to fix Ford. Don't waste the crisis. That's certainly not just the right attitude, obviously, very much needed, especially if the industry doesn't recover through previous levels anytime soon. At the same time, I'm a little bit struggling with, I guess the budget set for restructuring that you have for this year, which is - and it remains pretty minimal was actually tweaked down a little bit even versus the last update. And I view it somewhat as inconsistent. So why can't you do more? Why can't you spend more? You've raised recently another $8 billion. It feels like now would be the time to do faster action to accelerate the process. And it seems like it doesn't seem to be budgeted, how do I reconcile that?\nJim Hackett: Yes, well, I guess the, the confirmation I want to make is yes, your instincts are, that there can be more that can be done. We're talking about just - and draw a parallel to you in 14 days. We got a ventilator designed and built for the country. So, I know Ford can move really fast. And the pandemic, we sent everybody home on March 13th. So I don't know if you're asking in that time, you would have expected a plan that would, change the strategy of the company. And the way I think about the crisis is you got a priority first of stabilizing that you can operate and recover some of the costs that are just, flying out the door and that's where we did a really great job. In parallel, we've begun planning in discussions with the spirit of don't waste the crisis. And I just, confirm there's nothing to announce to you today, but would not be fair for you to walk away and say, Ford's not doing anything. I don't think that would be right. And I'd like to clear up what you just asked about the budget. So, I'm going to turn to Tim to make sure we're you're reading correctly, the way the cash flows are working, given that we had the roll off of the payables and what we have committed to restructuring, Tim?\nTim Stone: Thanks, Jim. Thanks, Emmanuel. So as it relates to the restructuring, the charges in the cash for 2020 that we commented on $0.7 billion to $1.2 billion are associated with the redesign actions that have been announced. And the cumulative of that would be $4.4 billion to $4.9 billion in charges, on the way up to $11 billion, as we've talked about, and the cash would be $1.8 billion to $2.3 billion cumulative on the way up to $7 billion overtime. To the extent that we are thoroughly assessing and aggressively addressing our operations looking at, identify as always opportunities to improve our fitness and redesign the business to amplify long term potential. That's why we give the longer term view of up to $11 billion EBIT and up to $7 billion cash. But specific amounts we are guiding to or related to actions we've announced thus far.\nEmmanuel Rosner: Understood. Thank you.\nJim Hackett: Holly, back to you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question for the day will come from the line of Joe Spak with RBC Capital Markets.\nJoe Spak: Thank you. Maybe just one quick one on Ford Credit. I understand you certainly took the write down of vehicles awaiting auction. I believe the way it works is you've got to also take the supplemental depreciation for the remaining term for the rest of the book. So, how should we think about that over the course the year? And are you still expecting Ford Credit to dividend anything back to the Motor Company this year?\nJim Hackett: Thank you. I'm going to hand that to Marion Harris, who's the President of Ford Credit, Marion.\nMarion Harris: Thanks, Jim. Hi, Joe. How are you? So, good observation. So, let me talk about what was in the quarter and what was not in the quarter and then talk about the forward quarter. So, in the quarter credit loss reserve changes for the retail loan book and for our commercial lending, as well as credit loss estimates on the lease book which actually flows through lease accounting, as well as a reduced valuation on those vehicles that were just off lease and awaiting sale at auction. You correctly pointed out that in the period was not included any changes and outlook on future auction values of the portfolio, those changes in auction values will flow through the future periods according to lease accounting, and we describe that\u2019s in great detail in some of our educational disclosures that we have on the topic. We\u2019re not going to disclose today. We\u2019re giving guidance on what we think that will be in the future. It is still too uncertain as Tim said. We don\u2019t know the depth that for how long the auction market will be disrupted, but we are very confident that the used vehicle market will return to normal. And then on dividends, the only thing I would say is their function of net income and balance sheet size and leverage and it'll be what it'll be. We're still continuing to target an eight to nine leverage. Back to you, Jim.\nJoe Spak: Thank you, Marion.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Jim Hackett for closing comments.\nJim Hackett: Yes, thank you. Thank you, callers. As I mentioned this represents the third meta-level crisis I've been involved with as a CEO. And yes, this one not only tragically has had a larger human toll, it also represents a first where for all intents and purposes, the economy was turned off. In the face of all these events, I've been able to pay witness to those who rise to be better and likely surprise you with their resourcefulness, selflessness and ultimately resilience. Companies too define themselves in the times of crisis. We hope that we've been able to talk to you why we think you are seeing Ford at its best as we protected our people and we did all we can to serve our fellow men and we believe we safeguarded the bright future of Ford Motor Company. We look forward to sharing more of our response and the ideas that you've asked about and impact as there will be lingering effects of the virus until it is totally contained. With that, we're all adjourned and thank you for joining us tonight.\nOperator: This concludes the Ford Motor Company first quarter earnings conference call.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jim Farley",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim. Operational excellence especially in this crisis requires, obviously the dedication, but also collaboration, partnership and support from the entire enterprise, our suppliers, our dealers, employees, unions, our JV partners, and our execution. And its excellence demonstrated this early on in China as Jim said. I know we're going to come out of this a lot stronger. But we need to be agile, have a bias towards action and be very transparent with our employees, our customers and partners. Early on in China, we focused on business continuity. We mapped our suppliers for the liquidity in the supply chain. We created a unique logistics portal to track our supply chain. We secured air freight capacity to deliver critical safety equipment to our team in China importantly including our dealers. And we used the same air capacity to ensure of supply of critical parts to regions like North America outside of China. We then partnered closely with our dealers. We retract in-store traffic, inventory, the financial liquidity and health. And in the face of shuttering our dealerships, we turn together work together to drive demand and ensure quality service to our customers. We provided those customers with a more robust app to order vehicles online. In fact, in China today, over a third of our sales are now direct online. We increased doorstep delivery of sanitized vehicles with what we call zero touch. We currently expanded to schedule remote service and vehicle pickup for maintenance and make it easy for customers. And our joint venture partners were up and running as early as February 10. In fact, as Jim said, one of them JMC repurposed our two ton transit van to manufacture over 1500 Ford Transit ambulances in the first quarter. From the start, we focused on a return to work protocol for our Chinese business. And that involved governance like reworking manufacturing safety requirements and restructuring a lot of jobs inside our facilities to ensure we can protect distancing. This protocol is being extended to Europe, and will also be used when we restart our operations around the world. We call it our playbook. In addition to those accomplishments, our China team also quickly honed in our cost. In the face of significant demand disruption Ford China delivered year-over-year improvements in both contribution and structural costs. Actually, they got close to their initial EBIT targets for the quarter, offsetting all the COVID impacts. The actions we took in China became best practice for us. Part of our playbook as we tackle the virus globally protecting our people, and limiting the spread of the virus as Jim described. I've been in the industry 30 years, I've been in Ford 13. I've seen a lot of wonderful leadership, especially in '08 and '09, but I have never seen what's happened at Ford over the last weeks. Countless acts of leadership throughout every level of the organization, replicated and added to the success we've realized in China. Power Ford, it is in our DNA. And we're proud to share it with that capabilities to many other people. The stark reality of a protracted global shut down of our sector and our vertical has forced a laser focus on cost and liquidity. And just as we did in China, we've ratcheted it down spending across the board, both fixed and variable. To ensure we come out of this stronger, we protected our cycle plan, our launches and our technology roadmaps including connectivity. We believe this pandemic could affect our customers live and work for many years to come with the zero touch now as an integral part of their lives going forward, perhaps spurring on even more interest in adoption of autonomy, especially goods delivery, and micro mobility. While effects of the virus may cause some shifts in timing, we are really excited about our forthcoming launch of the redesigned F-150. It is the anchor of our F series brand. It is America's Best Selling Vehicle for 43 years, and the launch will feature the first ever hybrid electric F-150. We're also revealing a new Bronco brand. We're going to continue our launch of 30 market specific Ford and Lincoln vehicles in China over the next three years 10 of which will be electric. We're going to offer electrified versions of the Lincoln Corsair, and the Ford Escape and Kuga, which is now in launch in China and in Europe. We're going to continue preparations for the much anticipated return of the legendary Ford Bronco next year. And shortly after I began my new role in February, I did a two day deep dive with the automotive leadership team, where we really grow. And how we were going to address the task and opportunities ahead. And from the start, I was not only impressed of the diversity of skills and knowledge of our team, but the look in their eye and desire and accountability to take on those opportunities and move the company forward. Together we came up as a simple frame. We have a few things to fix and accelerate, and we need a growth plan for the company. The recent challenges presented by the virus have just amplified our commitment to these three areas. There is no grace period for transforming Ford. Two weeks ago, we announced a reorganization that will allow us to better execute against those things that we need to fix and accelerate and to establish our growth initiatives. We empowered a talented and diverse group of leaders from inside but also from outside of Ford to drive transformation into high growth, high margin businesses. Among the changes, Kumar Galhotra, who has been President in North America will take on expanded role for South America and ING markets as well. Lisa Drake, a seasoned Executive in our industrial system, was named Chief Operating Officer for North America and remains Vice President of Global Purchasing. She will be laser focused on our launches, our cost and our industrial system in North America. Gil Gur Arie, who has distinguished career in the Israeli Military Intelligence Core has joined Ford as Chief Global Data Insights and Analytics. And Ted Cannis whose team developed the revolutionary Mustang Mach-E, and the F-150 battery electric was appointed General Manager Commercial Vehicles. Now these leadership changes were specifically aimed at sharpening our focus on product and launch execution, fully leveraging smart connected vehicles and big data to serve our customers and the company, to improve our quality and lower our costs and creating a dedicated commercial vehicle business in the US and Canada. I'm confident this new structure will facilitate a much faster enterprise decision making and further efficiencies. I want to assure you that the same commitment and excellence we displayed to overcome COVID-19 are what we are leveraging, as we bring Ford's manufacturing and salary population back online, and turn our attention towards launching those incredible new Ford's and our winning portfolio. Over to Tim. Thanks, Jim, and hi John. So, in China, we learned a lot, not only to start up the operations safely, we started in mid-February, we're now up to 90% of our salary workforce and all of our plants are up and running. Actually, GMC never shut down. It is the best quarter ever. But they get after cost really quickly, we're able to offset all the COVID impact in the first quarter and we learned a lot. We learned that the mix coming out is very different than the mix going in. And so our mix of product is quite different. It is very favorable. We went online for our sales as said about a third of our sales are now online in North America, it is north of 25%. That's an efficiency and improvement in our fitness. We did lower costs, we expect that to sum that to flow, obviously, in North America, very focused on the recovery items on material costs and warranty costs. Those are the kind of costs that flow into subsequent years. In fact, we're more than committed ever in that 10% EBIT margin in North America. And as Jim said, we're forecasting a lower SAAR. So that must mean obviously our costs are going down. We do have some great launches coming up, which will be a tailwind in North America. The other things we learned in China that we're exporting is to ship patterns as you come back are very important, so are getting the launch teams in the facilities to work launches because we're just in year-end in China launching Kuga and localizing some of our larger SUVs. Those are very important for profitability, very same exercise we're doing in North American in certain fourth quarter. And the last one is supplier readiness. What we learned in China was got to make sure your supply basis ready. So, we've surveyed almost 1500 suppliers in Western Europe and the US to make sure they're ready to come up and have the same playbook in terms of prioritization of safety. So, yes, I mean, the bottom line is, it is a very difficult time, but Ford team is at its best, and we're going after crop costs that will flow. Thanks back to your Jim. Thanks, Jim. Hi, Rod. Very quickly. Just want to emphasize that the EU and South America restructuring are no regrets move. We reduced the headcount in Europe by 12,000 people teammates by the end of this year, we closed facilities. Bridgend still to come. We've cut costs, especially structural costs in South America. We have 40% less staff. We've gotten out of Fiesta and Focus. We got out of the heavy truck business and consolidated San Bernardo. So, those are no regrets move. But, the hangover COVID is obvious. And everything's on the table. Our team under owns the plan, it is they're still locked down and execute. In North America, we see a lot of opportunity and we want to make sure we have the capital to invest in North America. We do see a way to 10% EBIT in a lower industry even with the flow through of the cost actions we are taking plus as Jim said those great new products. And really for my team, they want to make sure that we have room for growth, especially in North America. And so that's why we're going to look at all the operations critically. Thanks. Over to you, Jim."

            "content": "Thanks, Jim. It is just over a year since I came to Ford. The primary reason I joined was my belief that company has abundant opportunities to improve customer experience, enhance effectiveness, grow and create superior value for stakeholders. Being a part of this team, as we've tackled the crisis, has further strengthened my confidence in our team and in Ford's future. That's why throughout our comments on this call, even amid what we're doing to protect people from the virus and help stop its spread, our actions have been consistent with the priorities we've discussed with you for several quarters. First, improving customer experience and operational execution. Second, progressing our global redesign, making tough choices to lay the foundation for improvement in future automotive growth, free cash flow, profitability, and returns on capital. Third, enhancing fitness, through structural costs and capital efficiency and alliances that can drive durable scale benefits. Fourth, prioritizing meaningful opportunities for profitable long term growth in mobility. And fifth, employing continued discipline to drive strong results from Ford Credit. In the first quarter, lower industry volumes across all regions contributed to a 21% decline in wholesale and a 15% decrease in revenue. These results largely drove an adjusted EBIT loss of $0.6 billion and a negative $2.2 billion in adjusted free cash flow. Our results were constrained by the adverse impacts of the virus. We estimate the unfavorable impact to adjusted EBIT was at least $2 billion. In our automotive business, lower volume accounted for $177 million loss in EBIT as $346 million positive EBIT from North America was more than offset by losses in other markets. To be helpful and informed by your input, slide 10 of our deck includes additional color on the drivers of the year-over-year change in EBIT, putting warranty, which is higher by $0.5 billion, and structural costs, which is lower by $0.3 billion. Looking at the business in more detail provides some color on why, up until the middle of the quarter, we were on track to meet or exceed our initial EBIT guidance for the first quarter. Supported by improved product mix and the benefits of our global redesign. In North America, while top and bottom line metrics were negatively affected by the decline in units, both revenue and EBIT did benefit from better mix, especially F Series and Explorer. This improvement reflects our more disciplined approach to capital allocation, which is focused on investments around the globe on our franchise strengths. This includes our upcoming launches of our all new F-150 and three products that are new to the market, a small rugged off road utility, Mustang Mach-E, and Bronco. We will be able to update you on launch timing once we have a better understanding of our operational readiness as we bring our manufacturing back up. EBIT was also negatively affected year-over-year by increased warranty costs as we roll forward higher flow rates from the second half of last year. We also absorbed higher material costs for new models during the quarter. In South America, wholesales and revenue declined 13% and 21% respectively. In addition to the lower volume, revenue also influenced by weaker currencies, which are only partially offset by higher net pricing. Importantly, we narrowed our EBIT loss in the region to $0.1 billion, a 29% year-over-year improvement and our strongest performance since 2013. EBIT results do favorably reflect benefits from our global redesign, including exiting heavy truck production, discontinuing certain passenger vehicles and reducing headcount as we migrate to a lower cost asset light footprint. In Europe, wholesales and revenue were down 25% and 16% respectively. In addition to the virus, wholesales are also weighed down by the timing of our all new Kuga, which follows a normal launch curve. We're also absorbing the effects of our decision to discontinue low margin products. As we focus our portfolio on industry leading commercial vehicle, a more selective range of passenger vehicles and selected imports. All new vehicles this year include Kuga, Puma and Explorer SUVs which together will drive an increase in our mix of SUVs year-over-year. The decline in volume also reduced EBIT, which was down $4.2 billion year-over-year. As expected, the region absorbs higher material costs to support compliance with new CO2 regulations. The favorable shifts in our European product portfolio, which we expect to continue once we restart production, supported higher net pricing, and the benefits of global redesign actions continue to drive down structural costs. We're on track to complete the balance of our headcount reductions, by 10,000 at year end. China was at the forefront of the crisis. Our team did a great job mitigating the negative effects of the virus on our customers, other stakeholders and on our business results. Wholesales and revenue were down about 30%. New product launches, including Escape and Corsair and faster improvement in sales relative to the market contributed to a 10 basis point improvement in share to 2.2%. Explorer and Aviator are on track to launch this year and should be important additions to our China portfolio. Our China EBIT loss of $0.2 billion was down $0.1 billion year-over-year, as lower volume and adverse exchange are partially offset by improvement in structural cost. Losses on mobility continued to reflect strategic investments in future growth opportunities in mobility services and vehicle business model development for our autonomous vehicle platform. Ford Credit delivered EBT of $30 million in the quarter, down $771 million year-over-year. Portfolio performance is strong in the first quarter and delinquencies and charge offs remain at low levels. However, the results include COVID-19 related accruals of about $700 million, the most significant of which is for future credit losses, as well as lower auction values for off lease units awaiting sale at auction. Lease share remains below industry average and off lease auction values performed better than expected, up 1% year-over-year, and up 2% sequentially. At present most vehicle auctions in the U.S. are closed. Sales volume is very low, and prices are disrupting. As vehicle auctions reopen, we expect market prices to be disrupted for some period. And it is difficult to say how badly or for how many months. However, we do expect used vehicle markets to normalize over time. Managed receivables of $147 billion at quarter end were $9 billion lower year-over-year and $5 billion lower at year end. At the end of the first quarter, Ford Credit had $28 billion in liquidity, which remains above target. And Ford Credit has access to diverse funding sources to continue providing financing in the future. Ford Credit balance sheet is strong with ample liquidity. And importantly, its funding structure is self-liquidating. This means the Ford Credit generates liquidity, which reduces its funding requirements as balance sheet shrinks with lower automotive sales. Ford Credit is an important source of support for customers and dealers during this crisis. And Ford Credit remains an important strategic asset. Now let me turn to automotive liquidity and provide a little more color on some of the strategic actions we've taken since March, to provide additional flexibility during this challenging time. In March, we suspended our regular dividend, which equates to $2.4 billion per year. We also suspended our anti-dilutive share repurchase program, which was S0.2 billion last year. At the same time, we drew down over $15 billion under our corporate and supplemental credit facilities to bring cash on the balance sheet and provide greater certainty. Finally, last week, we completed an $8 billion opportunistic unsecured issuance to further improve our cash and liquidity profile, while most of our global operations remain shut down. As of April 24, our cash balance is strong at $35 billion. An amount we believe is sufficient to take us through at year end with no additional wholesale. Our plan though, as we announced today about Europe is to begin to phased restart in the second quarter as we plan to have wholesale much sooner than the end of the year. Relative to working capital, just like most other OEMs, there are two phases of cash outflow after a halt in production. For us, this began in late March. The first phase is more severe, is driven by about a 45 day run off in supplier payables. We have about $13 billion of production supplier payables after a late March production suspension, which will run off by early May. While this number can move around during the year, depending on scheduled plant shutdowns and other factors, it is a good approximation of that production payable number. The second phase is post runoff. After production payables have been extinguished. Once this happens, our cash outflow drops substantially, our ongoing payments, which are fairly consistent, include structural costs and warranty and vehicle incentive payments. Once production starts, there's an inherent cash flow leverage. Once you've been modest wholesale resume, our cash flow dynamics will improve, driven by the restoration of supplier payables if the large part immediate payment of vehicles upon wholesale. We're also thoroughly assessing and aggressively addressing our operations and looking for opportunities to preserve cash, lower operating costs, improve fitness, and drive our business to amplify our long-term potential. These include reductions of capital spending, deferring or eliminating non-essential expenditures across our business and deferring executive compensation. The incremental cash from these and other actions provide additional flexibility as we navigate this challenging environment. For example, this year we expect CapEx to be $6.3 billion to $6.8 billion down by about $0.5 billion compared with our February guidance and $0.8 billion to $1.3 billion lower than last year. Turning to our outlook, in mid-March, we withdrew our financial guidance for 2020. As a reminder, when we gave you our outlook in early February, we said it excluded impacts of COVID-19. Today, unfortunately, the economic environment remains too uncertain to provide updated guidance for the year. However, assuming in the second quarter, we restart production in a phased way. We believe we will see the largest impact from this crisis in the second quarter as industry volumes continue to be down significantly in every region year-over-year. As a result, we believe in just a second quarter EBIT will be a loss of more than $5 billion. The recovery actions we've taken and are working on are in the billions. But we know we will not be able to recover everything or make up all of the last volume. Lower industry volume will be our biggest headwind this year and any mix in net pressing benefit, we may realize from our global focus on franchise strengths, including exiting lower margin products fully impact of Explorer launched in 2019 and new launches such as F-150, slated for later this year, will be overshadowed by the negative impact of lower industry volume. Relative to structural costs, we expect favorability year-over-year was driven by actions to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 and our ongoing business actions. Before we turn over to QA, let me close with. We remain committed to a strong balance sheet, and doing what is right to preserve our future which is why we've been proactive in charting our course in maximizing liquidity during this uniquely uncertain time. Our recent actions provide flexibility to weather the present disruptions caused by COVID-19 and the confidence to continue to invest in growth opportunities. We have a strong bias reaction to improve our customer experience, operational execution and drive our financial performance, including free cash flow generation over time. I'm optimistic we will better position than ever on the other side of this to achieve our long term potential. Operator? Thanks, Jim. Thanks, Emmanuel. So as it relates to the restructuring, the charges in the cash for 2020 that we commented on $0.7 billion to $1.2 billion are associated with the redesign actions that have been announced. And the cumulative of that would be $4.4 billion to $4.9 billion in charges, on the way up to $11 billion, as we've talked about, and the cash would be $1.8 billion to $2.3 billion cumulative on the way up to $7 billion overtime. To the extent that we are thoroughly assessing and aggressively addressing our operations looking at, identify as always opportunities to improve our fitness and redesign the business to amplify long term potential. That's why we give the longer term view of up to $11 billion EBIT and up to $7 billion cash. But specific amounts we are guiding to or related to actions we've announced thus far."

            "name": "Jim Hackett",
            "content": "Thanks Lynn, and hello everyone. And Lynn let me thank you for doing an incredible job in putting this virtual call together. In addition to Jim Farley, our Chief Operating Officer; and Tim Stone, our Chief Financial Officer, I'm proud to say that Rudy and Ozzie, my two big girls are joining me today in the call. Well, you know, the nature of times brings to mind the notion of paradox. And I like to think of the definition of a paradox as two truths that compete. Let me explain. The first truth is that safety is of the utmost concern in a pandemic; yours, your loved ones' and the people you work with. The communities you live in and amazingly all other humans you interact with, their safety guarantees your safety. The second truth, there is no future if we don't have an economic system that is always on. We didn't realize there was an off switch. We knew it might go into a recession more like a dimmer switch, but off. Well now as we bring these two truths together, they compete. Turning the economy back on challenges the question of whether it is safe enough. My goal today is to provide an update on where Ford stands and hopefully illustrate that Ford is doing a great job of managing this paradox and confirm that we have control of the business in a very difficult time. I am pleased to report to you that we have the foresight to move early, ahead of the shutdown. We kicked off our coronavirus response task force led by about 30 senior leaders from across the company. Independent of virus we call we had around the same time, reorganized our top team, enabled by a new Chief Operating officer position held by Jim Farley. Candidly, this now looks quite prescient as Jim in his new role, was able to quickly marshal our operating team to focus quickly on the most important actions. Minutes that led to hours made a huge difference in our responsiveness. We went from a 1,000 people who work remotely from home to more than 60,000. And we've had terrific productivity in the face of this unforeseen challenge, including our team in China which preceded the economic closure around the world. Jim, will talk more about that in a moment. Now, as we approach this challenge, we laid out three clear priorities underpinned by what we would say are Ford values. The first, undeniably, we have to protect the safety of our people, and do our part to limit the spread of the virus. Second, to leverage our knowledge and capability to deliver critical supplies to frontline workers and patients, while taking care of customers, dealers and communities in which we live. And three, skillfully manage our business through the crisis, safeguarding what we believe is a very bright future for Ford Motor Company. I have found it is true, that Ford people are at their best in tough times. It was true when Ford was building aircraft and arms that formed the arsenal of democracy in World War Two. And it was true just a short decade ago when we rallied to avoid bankruptcy, and a government bailout. And we emerged from the great recession a stronger company. I want to confirm it's certainly been true today. Let me take you through a bit more detail on those three priorities. As I said, the first priority was to protect our people, and do our part to limit the spread of this virus. So in mid-March, we were among the earliest company - the early companies to instruct the vast majority of our employees to work remotely. We also partnered with the UAW and other automakers to introduce new safety protections in our factories and warehouses, and then to shut down those facilities worldwide. In an illustration of the art of a global pandemic, these actions were taken even as we were cautiously restarting operations with our joint venture partners in China. Sadly though, in the face of this, Ford has not been immune from the ravages of the virus, we've lost 11 colleagues in the U.S. and the UK to this pandemic. Our second priority was to leverage our knowledge and capability to deliver critical supplies to frontline workers and patients. I couldn't have been more proud of our organization. The bottom line though, is when society needs you, we answer the call. In this case, we're doing that in many countries that Ford calls its own. Ford has always been a family business from the generations of leadership to the generations of the proud employees. And with that, we believe comes a special responsibility to take care of each other and this pandemic, of course is no different, in fact, it requires that in spades. We know this devastating crisis will come to an end. But in the meanwhile, we're doing everything we can to help. As we suspended a large portion of our work on designing and building great vehicles, we rally to begin producing vitally needed personal protection and medical equipment. Around the globe, our people, including the UAW partners, as I said, amaze me every day as they engineer and produce hundreds of ambulances and are up to 100,000 respirators for healthcare professionals with 3M. More than 8 million face shields so far. 50,000 patient ventilators with GE Healthcare. And about 1 million face masks, more like surgical masks every day. And up to now 100,000 washable isolation gowns per week with Joyson Safety Systems. Putting people first also means though taking care of our customers. We announced we find payments on new vehicles and a better online experience for customers. No contact vehicle delivery and service including disinfected products. And roadside and other services through the FordPass app. We also worked quickly to take care of our dealers with digital marketing, sales and service tools and advice on managing liquidity as you know, the government instituted a program that dealers could qualify for to enable them to keep their organizations intact, and taking care of our communities with millions of dollars in contributions of vehicles in cash. The third priority which will be the bulk of our call today was to skillfully manage our business through the crisis. One of the rallying cries rushed through all of this just as it was in '08 and '09, is not that - is that we must not only weather the crisis, we need to emerge from it ready to build a brighter future. So yes, as even though we took measures to preserve cash, we are moving forward on our creating tomorrow together plan, you're going to ask me about that. And we're totally committed to it. This is going to leverage fresh new portfolio of vehicles, a commitment to autonomy and electrification, along with connectivity, global partnerships that look precious as well that they started before this pandemic. And they're going to serve service in the future, including Rivian because we've gotten questions about that, and a better customer experience. In a moment, Jim Farley will provide more detail on the progress we're making in our underlying business during the crisis. I'm really proud of him and he's just worked around the clock frankly. And so to say it has been a 24/7 effort is not an exaggeration. At the same time, we're pulling every appropriate lever to protect our core business. Strengthen the balance sheet, Tim Stone, also working around the clock to make sure that the company lead in this initiative and bolster our cash to optimize our financial flexibility. I'm proud that we have that all in place before the first quarter was over. Part of skillfully managing through this crisis is having a well thought out protocol though, for back to work. And we did this for China. And I'm pleased that earlier today we announced we'll restart our European manufacturing production, with enhanced employee protection protocols in place. Is taking a phased approach starting on May 4. We will restart vehicle and the engine production at most of our sites in continental Europe. And there'll be a gradual ramp up over the next few months before full production is resumed globally. Well still, there's no denying the negative economic consequences of a pandemic. In the first quarter, our adjusted free cash flow was negative by $2.2 billion. Revenue amazingly was still $34 billion and we incurred of course an EBIT loss of around $0.6 billion. In fact, heading toward the middle of the quarter, listen to this, we were on track to meet or exceed our original guidance for adjusted EBIT in the quarter. Well, as I said earlier, be assured that everyone at Ford is squarely focused on both today, and in our future. We believe it remains bright. And it is a great source of motivation for us as we serve that future and of course, take care of all these immediate needs. Right now, I'd like to turn it over to Jim Farley. Jim? Thank you, John, Jim Hackett. I'm going to go for all the questioners our quarterback to call so that we don't have big lag here. And, John, just an observation that I agree with you. This is my third crisis in business. This one's a unique one. The other two were substantial. And I observe that there's cost that comes this added to income statement that comes from disruption. For example, we were shipping products, expediting product from China to get to the factories here, parts I should say, so that we didn't have any disruption. And as the virus spread like a water slick the stuff that we were air freighting was eventually going to get stopped in production. So, we had the cost of that and it is what Tim has talked about, that we've been working to offset those kinds of increased costs and there's a lot of examples of that. It is in the billions that we work to. Also confirming with you that in this time of focus, you start to think of things that matter to the company. I don't want you to think of them well, you should have stopped them anyways, these are things that there's no races going on. So, some of the investments that you would have because the virus has diminished participation and things, we don't have that cost so we have the savings there. And then having the focus that Jim Farley talked about, we find that we can actually improve our leverage. So, I want to confirm with you that, yes, we're thinking about this the same way. Now, you asked for some specifics and I'd like to turn it over to Jim, because I think China is a good example of where there was advantage as we came out of this. Jim. Operator, we'll take the next question. Thank you. Thank you, Rod. It is Jim Hackett. Let me start with saying to you that 26 years in a job like this, I never had a business plan that was called pandemic. And I mean that in all sincerity because we just never imagined the economy turning off. And the other two crises that I was in we had deep troughs of issues, but this was unique. Secondly, board has been really diligent at working on a number of fronts that I'm proud to tell you, as I look back at other companies, which I would admire in our industry, that some of you referenced. And I take the beginning point of when I guess they started and where they are now, I would say that are the effort to get all the new products in the portfolio are going to be extraordinarily beneficial to the company. You just got to remember we're going from one of the oldest product lines to the new. And in the course of this pandemic comes in and interrupts. And it is going to slide, the timing of that, but we've got a new F150. We've got a new small rugged off road SUV. We've got an all-new Bronco. We got the Mustang Mach-E. So, all the work before the pandemic is valued that we're going to enjoy. This is why we've believed - we thought last year was going to be the tunnel year and we had the problems in Chicago. We've totally fixed that. Explorer was doing really well. And now we were waiting for this new product. The second thing is we started on restructuring, particularly in Europe. Just want to comment again, I'm not being cynical, but that was 40 years of problems that we took on in a very short time. We actually sped up the commitment for restructuring. Bob Shanks and I had one plan. We turned up the vitality of it, we spent ahead. We actually borrowed money to match the returns we were going to get. It all worked out. We're not done there. I'll let Jim in a minute explain what's going on. We initiated a redesign, and I don't know whether that sunk in, but we took over 25% of the management out of the company in advance of what we didn't expect, which is a pandemic, although we thought a recession was in the offing. Many of you said, this is the longest expansion when we were getting ready for that. So, that's serving us well. And in fact, the way the team's working now with a recent management change I made it is moving much faster with much more clarity. So, I'm just want to confirm that the only thing that I would witness with you is I didn't expect China to be a problem in the last two and a half years the way it turned out to be. But I now feel that there was more problems there than just what Ford enjoyed. And now, the work we did earlier to start getting things turned around, we actually are feeling confident that China's actually the picture there is going to improve. Particularly with the emphasis that we put on to get the product right in that market it wasn't right, which is the gestation period for getting all that flipped around is not the thing that happens in the course of 90-days or 6 months. But that's not asking you to wait longer. It is just saying that, if you're impatient about all the stuff we've done, and why aren't we seeing the value I'm trying to portray to you they are synchronous, and they will yield that, but I didn't expect the pandemic. So, Jim Farley, let me just tie this back to you and let you add virtue in terms of the way you see the restructuring in Europe. Yes, Rod. And just to confirm there's that one truth, right, don't waste a crisis. So, I want to confirm to you that the attitude in the spirit is if we can speed things up or we can now have what I would say more productive discussions with social plans or governments, of course, all that's on the table. And the kinds of things that we would be working on but nothing to announce today. Emmanuel, hi, confirming I can hear you. Thanks. Yes, well, I guess the, the confirmation I want to make is yes, your instincts are, that there can be more that can be done. We're talking about just - and draw a parallel to you in 14 days. We got a ventilator designed and built for the country. So, I know Ford can move really fast. And the pandemic, we sent everybody home on March 13th. So I don't know if you're asking in that time, you would have expected a plan that would, change the strategy of the company. And the way I think about the crisis is you got a priority first of stabilizing that you can operate and recover some of the costs that are just, flying out the door and that's where we did a really great job. In parallel, we've begun planning in discussions with the spirit of don't waste the crisis. And I just, confirm there's nothing to announce to you today, but would not be fair for you to walk away and say, Ford's not doing anything. I don't think that would be right. And I'd like to clear up what you just asked about the budget. So, I'm going to turn to Tim to make sure we're you're reading correctly, the way the cash flows are working, given that we had the roll off of the payables and what we have committed to restructuring, Tim? Holly, back to you. Thank you. I'm going to hand that to Marion Harris, who's the President of Ford Credit, Marion. Yes, thank you. Thank you, callers. As I mentioned this represents the third meta-level crisis I've been involved with as a CEO. And yes, this one not only tragically has had a larger human toll, it also represents a first where for all intents and purposes, the economy was turned off. In the face of all these events, I've been able to pay witness to those who rise to be better and likely surprise you with their resourcefulness, selflessness and ultimately resilience. Companies too define themselves in the times of crisis. We hope that we've been able to talk to you why we think you are seeing Ford at its best as we protected our people and we did all we can to serve our fellow men and we believe we safeguarded the bright future of Ford Motor Company. We look forward to sharing more of our response and the ideas that you've asked about and impact as there will be lingering effects of the virus until it is totally contained. With that, we're all adjourned and thank you for joining us tonight."

So, in the quarter credit loss reserve changes for the retail loan book and for our commercial lending, as well as credit loss estimates on the lease book which actually flows through lease accounting, as well as a reduced valuation on those vehicles that were just off lease and awaiting sale at auction. You correctly pointed out that in the period was not included any changes and outlook on future auction values of the portfolio, those changes in auction values will flow through the future periods according to lease accounting, and we describe that's in great detail in some of our educational disclosures that we have on the topic. We're not going to disclose today. We're giving guidance on what we think that will be in the future. It is still too uncertain as Tim said. We don't know the depth that for how long the auction market will be disrupted, but we are very confident that the used vehicle market will return to normal. And then on dividends, the only thing I would say is their function of net income and balance sheet size and leverage and it'll be what it'll be. We're still continuing to target an eight to nine leverage. Back to you, Jim."

And on Thursday February 24, Bob Holycross our Vice President Sustainability, Environment and Safety Engineering; and Dave Webb Ford's Treasurer will participate in the RBC Global Environmental Social and Governance Conference. Now I'll turn the call over to Jim Farley.\nJim Farley: Thanks, Lynn. Hello everyone. Well, some may have described 2021 as a breakthrough year for Ford, I would simply portray it as a year of important progress for the company. We strengthened our base business last year and now expect to deliver even stronger results this year. And just as critical, we started moving with real speed and ambition to build a modern Ford. Our true breakthroughs are still ahead of us, like rapidly scaling production of our popular new battery electric vehicles, like turning Ford Pro a new growth engine for our commercial customers businesses and ours, like building our intelligent software platform to revolutionize our customers' experience. Even with the recent momentum, I know some observers may remain skeptical that a 118-year-old company like Ford will emerge as a winner in these disruptive times in our industry. And I'm okay with that. We're going to compete like a challenger, speak with our actions, prove ourselves over time. So let's dive into last year. As I mentioned, we have significantly improved our base business. In North America, our largest market, we have a very hot portfolio of new vehicles. We've now won awards of North America Truck and Utility of the Year for two years running. That's never happened by any company. The new Bronco, the Bronco Sport, the Maverick, the Mustang Mach-E all of them brand-new name plates for our lineup all, all of them kits. Last month, we launched E-Transit. In the spring, we're in the middle of launching F-150 Lightning. Few people ask us any more about why we phased out sedans and many more asking when they could take delivery of the new Bronco or Maverick or Lightning. So we're doing everything we can in our powers to increase our production and break constraints. We don't like making our customers wait and we're taking action to ensure that they don't pay unreasonable markups. We've also made progress outside of North America and this is very important. Ford has been a one-legged stool for too long. We stayed in Europe and South America and other regions, because we really believe we can create sustainably strong businesses in those markets. And we want to serve these customers with better, more connected and electric products and services. The deep restructuring in Europe and South America have put us in a position to grow profitability going forward. In China, we're now set up to play a much bigger role in the EV boom going on there. We've quietly grown Lincoln into a strong contender in the world's largest luxury vehicle market. In fact, China is now the number one Lincoln market globally. Our international markets group is profitable and we're now preparing for the important launch of our next-generation Ranger pickup this year. While we remain in the teeth of the COVID crisis and semiconductor shortages, our overall business is still in great shape. And at the same time, we're rapidly making progress on key aspects of the Ford+ plan. And for customers that means more distinctive products and solutions, more always on relationships with our brands and adding ever-improving user experiences. Now to deliver these things, we're building new muscles and that certainly includes scaling up our production of electric vehicles as I mentioned. We under-called the demand for our first wave of EVs. The Mustang Mach-E, the E-Transit, the F-150 Lightning. In the past six months, we doubled our 2023 planned capacity for EVs to 600,000 units a year. Now this required everything from working with SK and LG to increase battery supplies to knocking down walls at our Rouge electric vehicle center, while the mortar was still wet to make room to improve and build more Lightnings. Our team knows how to scale manufacturing and we're now harnessing that capability to ramp up production of EVs. We also have a task force dedicated to lowering the bill of materials for our bets above and beyond just the usual declines in material costs. For example, on Mustang Mach-E, in just the last month, our team found $1000 of opportunity per vehicle. And that's delivered through design simplification, vertical integration and leveraging our scale with supply chain as we ramp up production. And that team is just getting started. We plan to take full advantage of our first-mover position in the fully electric pickup truck market starting with Lightning, but there's much more to come. In the coming months, we'll break ground on the Blue Oval City electric truck plant in Tennessee. It will be the largest, the most advanced manufacturing complex in our history, and it will produce Ford's second generation of a full-sized electric pickup in high volumes starting in 2025. And at the same time, we have three large-scale battery plants in Tennessee and Kentucky, which will be coming on stream with capacity to produce enough battery cells for more than 1 million vehicles a year. This is in addition to our battery sourcing in China and Europe. We are well on our way to achieve at least a 40% mix of BEVs by 2030 with strong margins and equal to our higher market share in the key high-profit high-volume segments we compete. For example, the F-150 Lightning, if we had full production today to meet our current demand, we would rival the Model Y as the leading BEV nameplate in the U.S. market. We can't grow a profitable BEV business without a very healthy ICE business. And to do this, we're reducing complexity everywhere, while increasing, leveraging the benefits of our connectivity. Now this includes things like fewer top hats guided by customer demand and a judicious approach to vehicle content based on deep insights generated from that same vehicle data. We're also being disciplined with capital as we deploy that to our ICE products recognizing that as a mix of BEVs increases, we will continue to manufacture ICE vehicles but with a focus on optimizing cash returns. So our goal is to continue to improve our automotive EBIT margins. Let me say that again. Our goal is to continue to improve our auto EBIT margins even as we ramp up the mix of BEVs. In 2021, we began to bring our vision of an always on experience for retail and commercial customers to life. Our customers are realizing the benefits of our over-the-air software updates. But that's just the beginning. We're using our hubs in places like Palo Alto to attract more and more great software engineers and technology specialists. And we're fundamentally changing the culture of engineering inside Ford. The hardware will always be important, but the software and the embedded systems will define the next generation of our vehicles' experiences. I think customers will be amazed at the benefits as we move to central compute rather than the distributed compute we have across all the supplier-provided modules today. Our human-centered interface professionals are now in one single organization with authority over the in-car digital experiences, interfaces, screens and controls. And we're committed to providing an environment where software engineers can do the very best work of their careers. Before I turn it over to John, let me close, the velocity of change at Ford is increasing. We're not seeking half measures. Fear of change and risk has never served legacy automakers well in the past couple of decades. We're done with incremental change. We have a clear plan, a bias fraction and whatever-it-takes mindset. We're confident our strong base business will generate the capital we need to fund a very exciting future. We're recruiting incredible talent from outside the company to work with the best people from Ford. As excited as our customers are for that great portfolio we have in the market today, we can't wait to show them what's coming in the future. Now I'll turn it over to John, who will take you through the results for the quarter and our expectations for this year.\nJohn Lawler: Thank you, Jim. In the face of ongoing challenges with semiconductor constraints, and industry-wide supply chain disruptions, we executed our Ford+ plan, including closing out our global redesign, strengthening our product portfolio and investing in exciting new opportunities fundamental to growth and value creation. For the year, we posted $10 billion in adjusted EBIT, with a margin of 7.3%. That's our strongest performance since 2016. We delivered right at the midpoint of our guidance range adjusting for the re-class of our first quarter Rivian game to a special item. And despite a 6% decline in wholesale, our automotive business posted its strongest EBIT margin since 2016. North America delivered an 8.4% EBIT margin, and is firmly on the glide path to a 10% EBIT margin. In addition, our operations outside the US collectively posted their best results since 2017. I'm very proud of the team's hard work, the resiliency last year as we rose to the challenge and optimized constrained production to protect customer orders, new launches, our electrification strategy, and our most profitable vehicles. We also remain highly disciplined with our incentive spend, and mix management, which combined with improvement in warranty costs, more than offset commodity headwinds and supply chain-related production losses. Ford Credit, whose profits and dividends are an important source of capital for us delivered a strong year. EBT was $4.7 billion, as auction values were at record highs and credit losses were near record lows. Free cash flow was $4.6 billion, and we ended the year with strong cash and liquidity more than $36 billion and $52 billion respectively, which now includes our stake in Rivian valued at $10.6 billion at the end of the year. In 2021, we continue to advance our capital strategy given the improvements we're seeing in the underlying business. We reinstated the regular dividend at $0.10 per share in the fourth quarter as we continue to focus on creating value for our shareholders. We also further strengthened our balance sheet by repurchasing $7.6 billion of high-cost debt, deleveraging the balance sheet and significantly reducing our ongoing interest expense. We introduced the industry's first fully integrated sustainable financing framework covering both an auto OEM and its captive finance company. And in November, following the launch of the framework we completed our inaugural $2.5 billion green bond issuance, which was met with incredible investor demand and will help fund our exciting BEV portfolio. Our strong balance sheet including cash, provides a solid foundation to continue to invest in our Ford+ priorities. So let me briefly touch on the fourth quarter. With a margin of 5.4%, adjusted EBIT was $2 billion and we generated $2.3 billion in free cash flow. Some modeled stronger EBIT for us in this quarter. We know that was largely driven by higher volume expectations relative to the 10% sequential increase, we guided to in October and lower corporate other expenses. North America delivered $1.8 billion of profit with a margin of 7.1%. Volume was up 10% on a sequential basis, as supply chain constraints eased and custom demand for our products remained strong. South America delivered a modest profit for the second consecutive quarter and the business is now set up to deliver sustainable profitability. With restructuring of the legacy business complete, the region is now focused on strengthening Ford's position in the truck market, growing its new commercial vehicle business and enriching customer experiences. In Europe, the underlying trajectory of our business continues to accelerate towards a 6% EBIT margin. However, the adverse effect of near-term supply chain disruption continues to mask that improvement. Importantly we were the number one commercial vehicle brand in Europe for the seventh consecutive year and transit continues to have an extremely healthy order bank. Mustang Lockheed sales in the region are off to a strong start with the order bank building momentum as we accelerate the transition to BEV. In China, Lincoln continues to be a real bright spot and gain share in the highly profitable and growing premium segment. In the fourth quarter, we achieved record sales of the brand in China, contributing to an almost 50% increase for the year. We are expanding the Lincoln portfolio in 2022 with the launch of the all-new Zephyr. The order bank for that vehicle opened recently and is off to a fast start. In the fourth quarter we also achieved an important electrification milestone in China as we began local production and customer deliveries of the Mustang Mach-E. Our direct-to-customer model for Mach-E allows people to order online and through 25 Ford select city stores. Our international markets group performed well in the fourth quarter and had a record year playing to its strengths especially from our flagship Ranger pickup, which delivered full year segment share of 14.9% up 1.1 percentage points year-over-year. We also announced major investments in both South Africa and Thailand to modernize production and launch the next-generation Ranger from four assembly plants later this year. And in mobility, we've made steady progress towards the scaled commercialization of moving people and moving goods and we are confident in Argo's progress in delivering a Level 4 autonomous vehicle solution. And in addition, we are rationalizing our investment portfolio and focusing on autonomous development. Now, I'll share with you our current thinking about 2022. We expect supply constraints to remain fluid throughout the year, reflecting a variety of factors including semiconductors and COVID. Based on what we see now, we believe our full year wholesales will be up about 10% to 15% in 2022 with a high single to low digit decline in the first quarter, reflecting supplier shortages related to Omicron shutdown and semiconductors. For the full year, we expect to earn between $11.5 billion and $12.5 billion in adjusted EBIT and that's up 15% to 25% versus 2021. And the high end of the range equates to an adjusted company EBIT margin of 8% and our North America business at 10% EBIT margin, which if we achieve would be one year earlier than the target we shared with you last May. Now turning to GAAP results for a minute. It's important to point out that each quarter we will mark-to-market our investment in Rivian, which sits in cash and marketable securities on our balance sheet. This is not something we can forecast. The mark-to-market may cause volatility in our quarterly GAAP net income and EPS results. So looking at how our adjusted EBIT guidance rolls up. Our range assumes significantly higher profits in North America and collected profitability outside of North America, as we realize the full benefits of our global redesign efforts. We also expect Ford Credit EBT to be strong, but lower than 2021 profits, and we expect mobility and corporate other EBIT to be roughly flat. Lastly, we expect to generate adjusted free cash flow of between $5.5 billion and $6.5 billion. Now, other assumptions we factored into our guidance include. First, we expect customer demand enthusiasm to remain strong for our new and iconic nameplates. We will have a full year of production of the award-winning Bronco and Maverick, in addition to a robust BEV lineup, with Mustang Mach-E, E-Transit and F-150 Lightning all in production. Second, with wholesales up about 10% to 15%, we anticipate the pricing environment to remain strong, although the interplay between volume and pricing will remain dynamic. Third, we expect commodity headwinds of about $1.5 billion to $2 billion. Fourth, we anticipate other inflationary pressures, which will impact a broad range of costs. And fifth, at Ford Credit, we expect auction values to remain strong in 2022, as supply constraints persist. However, as I mentioned, we anticipate lower EBT reflecting primarily non-recurrence of reserve releases, fewer returned off-lease vehicles and more normalized credit losses. Most importantly, we're committed to our Ford+ plan and we'll continue to invest aggressively to drive growth and value creation. This includes devoting resources to customer-facing technology, connectivity, our always on relationships with customers and electrification. We are confident the long-term payback from those investments will be substantial. So that wraps up our prepared remarks. We'll use the balance of the time to hear and address what's on your mind. Thank you. Operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question is going to come from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America.\nJohn Murphy: Good evening, everybody. Thanks for the time tonight. Just a first question. Jim, there's been a lot of speculation that you might consider spinning a portion of the future car business whether it be EV or AV with Argo. But there's also the backside of that that might make more sense to spin some of your legacy ICE assets and have the entire company become a more pure-play EV/AV company in totality. So I mean, how do you think about this and what would you be your motivations either way? And how you -- I mean how are you strategizing this?\nJim Farley: Thanks, John. Yes, I don't want to speculate on rumors or speculate on the speculation in the press. But I will go back to something we said and I've said over and over again which is, running a successful ICE business and the successful BEV business are not the same. The customers are different. We think the go-to-market is going to have to be different. The product development process and the kinds of products we develop are different. The procurement supply chain are all different. The talent is different. The level of in-sourcing is different. And actually the rhythm of the business is different -- fundamentally different. So I'm not going to talk about speculation in the press, but I will tell you that the way we're operating the businesses acknowledges those differences. And I'm really excited about the company's commitment to operate the businesses as they should be.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research.\nRod Lache: Hi, everybody. I wanted to ask you a little bit about margins. As John said, it looks like you guys will hit 8% if you hit the high end of your target range. And Jim, you said that you're targeting improving margins from here. So maybe you can give us a little bit more color on that how we should think about it? I'm not sure that 8% is the benchmark anymore, just given how many years ago that's been and how many changes there are to the business. You're ramping up a lot of spending on engineering and spending up in EV infrastructure, but you're also going to grow the Ford Pro business. So maybe you can just give us some of the puts and takes how to think about it? And as part of it, if you might just give us a data point on where Ford Pro stood in 2021.\nJohn Lawler: Yes. Hi, Rod, it's John. So I guess I would say that -- as Jim just said that, we're looking at the ICE business and the BEV business and we're managing both differently. When you look at the ICE transition, I think there are still a lot of opportunities for us to improve that business. We're very focused on reducing our structural costs. We've done a lot already, but there's a lot more that we think we can do there. We're looking at operating with much lower stock levels as our business continues to develop. So we'll operate at leaner inventories than we have in the past which will help our top line and continue to strengthen that top line. We're improving our quality which is important. We saw that come through this year from a year-over-year warranty standpoint it was down roughly $1.4 billion. And we want to be at the top in quality in every segment and that's going to have opportunity for the business. We're also working to revitalize our business through our digital capabilities, leveraging what we have from the connected vehicle to improve warranty even further, as well as improve what we're doing from a manufacturing standpoint and leverage that technology to bring those types of cost down. There's opportunities in maximizing our parts business and we're going to lower our distribution costs. There's opportunity there. So we see that over time, as we manage the ICE business, there's opportunity to improve margins even further from there. And then when you talk about BEV, so as we've talked about in past calls, our BEV margins are not where we intend it to be. We have opportunity, but we need to do that through scaling them, right? We're not going to chase top hats. We're going to look at scale. We're going to want to have a strong lineup where we can lean into it with key vehicles in high-volume segments like we are today with Mustang Mach-E, the Lightning and in our commercial vehicles with the Transit. We're going to reduce complexity, right? We know that one of the things that we need to do on our vehicles and we saw that, as Jim talked about, with the team finding $1,000 a unit on Mach-E and they just got started is that, we need to approach the design of these vehicles differently. And that's what's really important about having the first-mover advantage there. We're on the road with these. We're in production with these. We understand what we need to do in that second generation and we're off doing that right now improving what we have on the road today and really bringing that knowledge into our second-generation design. And then as I said earlier on the ICE business, we're going to leverage the compute on the vehicles to really lower our manufacturing costs and leverage that compute to simplify what we do coming down the line and bring that down to the bottom line of the vehicle. And then distribution. We all know the difference in the distribution cost for the legacy system that's out there versus what we see with other manufacturers. So that's an opportunity for us to work with our partners to improve that. So on both of those we see opportunities. And then as you said, Rod, there's opportunities to grow our business and lean into our leading position in commercial vehicles with Ford Pro. And we're looking to grow that business to $45 billion in revenues by 2025. And so I think there's opportunities across both of our key segments and with Ford Pro to improve the business as we move forward beyond the 8%. And now we need to stay extremely focused and relentless on that execution.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is going to come from the line of Sam Levy with Credit Suisse.\nDan Levy: Hi. Thank you. It\u2019s Dan Levy with Credit Suisse. I'd like to ask about your JV with GlobalFoundries, and just broadly about what you're trying to do with electronic components and sort of the notion of simplification, which you've talked more about. So we've heard that with GlobalFoundries, I think, Hau Thai-Tang mentioned, you'd like to control more of the sub-sourcing to suppliers. You'd like to dictate more of the design of some of the electronic products that in the past have been handled by the suppliers. Maybe you could help us unpack this. How significant of a change is this in your operating model where you frankly focused on just the core vehicle itself and outsourcing where you can? How achievable is this especially given you're concurrently undergoing this transition to EV? And broadly, how should we think of the financial implications given you're going from what's been more of a just-in-time approach on inventory and components to now more of a just in case and deeper in the supply chain? Thank you.\nJim Farley: Thank you for your question. Perhaps the biggest gift for all the pain we're going through now in semiconductors is that we have very painfully learned the lesson that we cannot manage the supply chain for these key components as we have. In fact you could argue that in the change of transition to these digital electric vehicles that supply chain could be one of the biggest advantages a particular company has or doesn't have. The way we look at it is the key electric components memory chips semiconductors. I would break semiconductors into two types. I'll come back with GlobalFoundries in a second. Feature-rich chips that we still use a lot. A window regulator doesn't need to have a 4-nanometer chip. And the advance -- but we also have sensors power electronics for our inverters, the batteries themselves all the way back to the mine, the inverters of different battery. Chemistries itself have different raw materials and kind of ecosystems that support them. So this is a very important topic for the company. How different it is? It's really different. We need different talent at the company. We need physical inspection of the actual producers. We need direct contracts with them. We need to design the SoC ourselves. We need to direct in the case -- in some cases to even direct prefer build to print or actually use supplier XYZ to get out of where we've been. And this takes talent. It takes a different approach. It takes more resources. On GlobalFoundries, it's kind of the first big bet, but there'll be many, many more coming for us. We're very dependent on TSMC for our feature-rich nodes. Obviously, the capacity is at risk over time as the industry moves to more advanced nodes including us. And as I said we're going to need feature-rich nodes for many years to come. GlobalFoundries knows how to build them. They know to build them in the United States. We can partner with the government depending on the CHIPS Act to capacitize here. It will be a few years until we benefit from that but it's a really big thing to descale ourselves on the feature-rich chips from the current ecosystem that we depend on around the world. And I think GlobalFoundries is a really interesting deal when we get into the details. We have to put cash up when we participate. Those feature-rich semis will be used by other companies industrial companies, not just Ford. It's a really interesting deal. And I was talking to the US company. You can expect the same kind of thing on advanced nodes and all the other components I mentioned including more deals on the raw material for various types of battery chemistry. And this is a culture change at Ford. As I said this is part of the rhythm change between ICE and BEV.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.\nRyan Brinkman: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Slide 20 shows you with $36.5 billion of cash and investments which might be a record, but it is certainly the most that I can remember and compares to I think like five-plus years ago you used to talk about wanting to have cash of something closer to in excess of $20 billion with like another $10 billion or $13 billion of more liquidity on top of that. I get that there's more uncertainty now with the pandemic and the chip shortage. And of course you're investing heavily for electrification. Despite those investments though, I mean you're still calling for $5.5 billion to $6.5 billion of FCF this year versus the dividend costs like $1.5 billion or $1.6 billion. So, with the current trajectory it seems like the record cash pile should only grow bigger in 2022. I'm just curious what your thoughts are on this whether you have any updated thoughts on the optimal capital structure over what time or under what conditions you might move towards that more optimal capital structure. And it being so far above the earlier targeted cash balance might influence how you go about deciding what to do with the Rivian stake once the lockup expires.\nJohn Lawler: Thanks Ryan. So, yes we're really pleased with the position we have from a cash standpoint because it gives us the flexibility to invest in the business as we go. We've talked about the investments we'll be making in BEVs. We'll be breaking capacity contains and we're going to continue to focus on scaling as quickly as we can. The other thing we need to think about is the supply chain for our BEVs. There's opportunities potentially for vertical integration. There's opportunities for looking beyond as we move into these connected vehicles with more advanced electronics, potentially leveraging capital to secure supply chain there. So, there's a lot of opportunities as we move forward to leverage this cash to improve the business. We're also focused on our shareholders. And of course, total shareholder returns is important as well. So we're going to continue to provide dividends to our consumers -- to our shareholders, which is important for us as we move forward given our shareholder base. So I think what you'll see is that, that cash balance is going to be a benefit for us, as we look to grow the business, as we look to expand, as we look to vertically integrate, as we look to secure our supply chain and we continue to develop our Ford+ plan.\nRyan Brinkman: Very interesting. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank.\nEmmanuel Rosner: Thank you, very much. Good evening. I wanted to ask you a little bit more detail related to two items in the 2022 outlook. The first one is your volume and mix assumption. In the fourth quarter when I look at the North American walk, your wholesale were up something like 60,000 units year-over-year, but the volume mix piece of your North American bridge was up only $100 million and that's despite what F-150 may be up like 34% year-over-year, if [Indiscernible] is right. And so just curious what's going on in terms of mix and why that contribution didn't really flow through to the EBIT. And how do you think about, as you grow your volume 10% to 15% in 2022, what kind of EBIT contribution can we expect from this? That's the first item. And then the second one is in terms of additional investment costs, so you've quantified a step-up in CapEx for 2022. I'm just curious if there are things in the income statement that you're able to quantify in terms of additional investments in technology that we should think about as we model 2022?\nJohn Lawler: So let me focus on 2022 first. So looking at the walk for 2022, you have to think about the 10% to 15% in the volume growth, but mix is also a strong part of that on a year-over-year basis. We expect to see continued strong mix. Pricing, as I said in my remarks, we do expect the continued strong pricing environment. So when you look at volume mix and pricing, we expect that to be up about $5.5 billion to $6.5 billion. And so I'll just walk through what -- where we see that on the bridge to 2022. We are continuing to invest in modernization and that was along with our product related spending, as we're continuing to build out our BEV business. That's about $1.5 billion headwind, but that's broadly offset with other efficiencies that we're working on. You also see that commodities are going to be a headwind next year of about $1.5 billion to $2 billion. And then Ford Credit is going to be strong, but we do expect them to be down about $1.5 billion. And then of course, we've got lower net pension income. So we expect the top line to be strong with the volume increase. We continue to expect to have strong mix. And then we expect pricing to be a strength as well on a year-over-year basis.\nOperator: All right. And our next\u2026\nJim Farley: Sorry, what's nice about what we're seeing this year or our forecast this year is, we're seeing good profit leverage from that incremental top line. And I think that's very encouraging. We have lost statistics about how that compares in the past, but that hasn't always been the case at Ford. It's great to see that top line flow into our profitability increase.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is going to come from the line of Colin Langan with Wells Fargo.\nColin Langan: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just following up on the walk. If I actually annualize Q4, you're running at only $8 billion. What was particularly weaker about this quarter as a sort of starting point? It's also sort of down sequentially on higher sales. Is that seasonality, higher commodity costs hitting worse this quarter? Any color there?\nJohn Lawler: From a quarter-over-quarter basis and what \u2013 how the quarter developed, we hit the midpoint of the guidance. And one of the things is I think some expected volumes to be up higher than what we had guided. And just we had supply chain constraints hitting us this quarter. Omicron disrupted several of our key suppliers. They couldn't produce. They couldn't get us products. But net-net when you look at the fourth quarter relative to where we were third quarter, let's say as a proxy, volume and mix was up slightly. It was up about six-tenths. But then we had additional headwinds on commodities. We had some modernization costs that came through, specifically around our IT as well as connectivity as we're investing in those growth areas. And then we saw costs come through from inflation. We saw costs come through on transportation, on fuel, et cetera. So we're seeing some of those headwinds were hitting us in the fourth quarter. But demand was strong. If we could have met the demand and the production without the disruptions, you would have seen a stronger quarter. And so as we go into 2022, as we see those supply constraints ease, as we see the demand for our really strong product lineup, we see the top line growing. We see continued improvement in mix. We see continued improvement in price. And that's going to be much more of a tailwind versus some of the headwinds we're seeing [Technical Difficulty]\nColin Langan: And just following up on the mix. Any color on how the Lightning will impact as it runs in obviously, pretty large battery there? Is that going to be dilutive as we think about the second half as that starts to ramp?\nJohn Lawler: No. I don't think that as we ramp up at the start with the launch this year that it's going to have a significant impact on what we see from a standpoint of our profits in North America. And then coming back I think one of the questions Colin you had asked that, I didn't touch upon was the fourth quarter or maybe it was Emmanuel earlier on the mix side is we did have lower Super Duty mix in the quarter and that was again driven by supply chain disruptions. There were vehicles that we weren't able to build and complete because of certain commodities that weren't coming through to get those vehicles down the line and done.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Brian Johnson with Barclays.\nBrian Johnson: Yes, good afternoon. I want to talk a little bit about dealer pricing versus your pricing. The Detroit Press ran some articles in January on taking action in some of the more egregious markups on EV. Yet if I look at the broader lineup, I see that per J.D. Power your revenue per unit is up about 3-point \u2013 3,800, which clips to your $7.6 billion pricing you cited. Yet the transaction prices are up 5,600, meaning you're leaving about $1,850 of profit in the dealers' hands which would be about another $3.6 billion of profit. So just wondering kind of as you kind of go forward as the dealers, especially move to this simplified inventory model you're looking at how you're thinking about the balance between your invoice your revenue per vehicle and the actual transaction prices at the dealer level?\nJim Farley: Thank you. I would say, the answer to your question for ICE and BEV would be slightly different. We have about 10% of our dealers last year in the supply-constrained environment that, we're charging above MSRP to our best of our knowledge. We have very good knowledge of who they are. And their future allocation of product will be directly impacted because of that policy. And we've seen really quick action by our team. On the BEV side, this is quite an important topic, because the margins that we want to build to in BEV are going to be heavily dependent on a different go-to-market and customer experience. I won't go into any more than that, but this is a quite important lesson for us of the franchise system, and the way we will manage going forward. But I'm very optimistic now that our team has the intelligence in the market that we put an allocation trigger in for those dealers who choose to price that way. But it's inefficiency no doubt about it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is going to come from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.\nMark Delaney: Yes. Thanks very much for taking the call. So maybe you could help us better understand the linearity of reaching the 600,000 annualized EV capacity target, and what kind of visibility you have into securing the necessary supply to do that both in terms of things like semiconductors as well as batteries?\nJim Farley: Thank you. So we've been hard at work at this for quite some time actually. We knew we were oversubscribed pretty early in the process and the team has been at it. We have been working. Really, the primary lift for us is battery availability. So we've actually been securing extra batteries for quite some time now. We have some manning options for Mach-E. So we will move close to 100000 units this year on Mach-E. That will be our big move this year. Next year, our big move will be Lightning going to 150000 units. I won't get into battery chemistries and all the details, but I'm really excited about the progress we've made so far in securing batteries. On the F-150 Lightning, we actually had a physical capacity constraint of the facility. And so we took the decision already to again redesign the facility so that we can accommodate the 150,000 units. We have great capacity on F-150 for the nonelectric components. So this is just a matter of the Mach-E getting the labor in place and getting the batteries, and the F-150 getting the batteries out of Georgia and redesigning the facility so we can get the final assembly done. As far as chips are concerned these battery electric vehicles and the supply chain are a strategic advantage for our company. So we will protect in the constraint where we will protect our battery electric supply production.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.\nJoseph Spak: Thank you. Jim, it's really refreshing to hear you talk about the two different businesses and how you're managing them and running them and planning for them separately. I guess so to the -- and it's also good to hear you think you would have more to wring out of the ICE business. But I guess the question is, as CEO of Ford which is managing those two businesses like to the extent, you are able to wring more out of ICE, does that give you leeway to accelerate or increase your investment in the EV business? Like how do you think about combining the two businesses back together in terms of the investment spend?\nJim Farley: Absolutely. Absolutely. The profitability of ICE is very important because it gives us optionality, not only of scaling BEV, but also vertically integrating BEV which is increasingly becoming important for a profit lever. So we definitely want to push our ICE business as fast as far as we can. We're going into this transition with the freshest ICE lineup, I can think of any of our competitors not just in the US, globally. But we think there's, as John said, a ton of other levers that we can pull to improve the margins of our ICE business. We see our ICE business increasingly in kind of specialty groupings of passion brands like, Bronco and Mustang. And our pickup truck customers, retail side using those for recreation and for everything they use them for. And so look at the success of Maverick we've had for example. So, we're really excited about this opportunity for BEV. And you bet you, it gives us all sorts of optionality as a company to really continue to invest in high growth business but also focus -- allow us to focus our cash and our investment in building the margin for the high growth business through things like vertical integration and new customer experiences, accelerating our physical experiences to the dealers on both businesses.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is going to come from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi.\nItay Michaeli: Great. Thanks. Good evening everybody. I was hoping to go back and get an update on Mach-E profitability. I think a couple of quarters ago you mentioned you were already positive EBIT. It seems like pricing has been really strong in the last few quarters. You talked about taking out maybe $1000 of cost going forward. And of course, you're cutting up volume. I was hoping maybe you could give an update on kind of where you see Mach-E profitability this year versus your original expectation that maybe even relative to ICE vehicles perhaps like the Edge.\nJohn Lawler: Yes. Thanks. It's John here. So, when we look at our Mach-E profitability as we said, we are profitable from a Mach-E standpoint. We're seeing great demand. We're seeing strong mix. So, we've seen the profits improve. Importantly what else we're seeing is opportunities to continue to reduce the cost and reduce the complexity. So we're very focused on improving those margins. But overall, as we said in the past, our fab margins are not yet quite where we like them to be especially relative to our more profitable ICE vehicles. And so, we have to continue to do work there primarily around scaling, reducing the complexity as we move forward. So we're encouraged by what we're seeing on Mach-E so far, especially with the strong demand and the mix but there's other work that we need to do as well to continue to further improve those margins. And our expectation is that we're fully competitive on our BEV margins as we move forward and that's what we need to work towards.\nJim Farley: Just to complement John's input. I'm struck -- throughout my career I'm struck at how different the rhythm of this digital BEV business is versus ICE. We all grew up in a business where you kind of launched the vehicle and then you work on a minor change or a next model. I certainly grew up in that model. And what we're finding with ICE, thank goodness we're scaling now, because what we're finding in Mach-E is that actually most of the exciting work starts after job one. That's when the OTAs really make a customer impact. But on the cost side and the profit side, I guess we have learned so much about the lack of integration in our engineering operations as we compared our engineering on Mach-E to others that are best-in-class. And we are finding lots of profit opportunities as we get after that integration between engineering supply chain and manufacturing even within engineering. If I showed you our cooling system for Mach-E it has four motors probably needs to be two. It has 60 or 70 hoses probably needs to be one-third of that. And those are the opportunities we're going after. And we are not going to wait for next year. We're not going to wait for a minor change. We are going to reengineer that vehicle now and then use that expertise for Lightning, E-Transit and of course our all electric platforms. And I just -- I'm really excited about this opportunity. Being in the industry as long as I have, I haven't felt this chance to take out so much cost after job one both from the customers' use of the vehicle off the data as well as actually all these integration opportunities. And the other thing is the vehicles are much more simple than we thought. The F-150 has one cab, one box. And we -- for the same kind of ICE offering, it's like 40 configurations. So they're much simpler. And I'm really excited about -- I guess what I'm saying is we're at the very beginning of this journey. And it is -- it's already very exciting on the profit improvement as John said. And I haven't seen this kind of opportunity in the past in my career.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is going to come from the line of Anindya Das with Nomura. Your line is open. Okay. Our next question will come from the line of Jeoffrey Lambujon with Tudor Pickering.\nJeoffrey Lambujon: Good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in. I just wanted to go back to the regional discussion as we think about the thoughts you shared on margins in North America that are embedded in the upper end of the full year 2022 EBIT guide. I wonder if you could just give us a sense for how you're thinking about the trajectory of margin improvement in Europe and IMG specifically. Just thinking about the semiconductor shortfall evolving over time the focus on Ford Pro and new product launches potentially helping to accelerate some margin recovery in Europe, and then the continued focus on Ranger and new products in IMG?\nJohn Lawler: In Europe, we expect profit improvement. We expect them to be meaningfully profitable in this year in 2022. And we're still committed and Europe is on track to deliver the 6% EBIT margin by 2023. They're continuing to move forward. They're seeing favorable pricing environment continue. They're accelerating into the BEV. The Mach-E is a very strong product for them. And again commercial vehicles, it's a strength of ours and we continue to see that grow next year and be a pillar for Europe, a strength for Europe. With IMG as you go into 2022, International Markets Group, we expect them to be down year-over-year but profitable. And that's going to be driven by two key things: the India transition and what we see there as well as the fact that our Ranger volumes are going to be down year-over-year as we launch the new Ranger. And so it's a transition year for us in the International Markets Group. So they'll be down year-over-year but profitable. And then from there with the new Ranger, we're really excited about that product and what we can leverage with that product as we move forward in our International Markets Group.\nOperator: Thank you. And with that, we will conclude today's Ford Motor Company Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jim Farley",
            "content": "Thanks, Lynn. Hello everyone. Well, some may have described 2021 as a breakthrough year for Ford, I would simply portray it as a year of important progress for the company. We strengthened our base business last year and now expect to deliver even stronger results this year. And just as critical, we started moving with real speed and ambition to build a modern Ford. Our true breakthroughs are still ahead of us, like rapidly scaling production of our popular new battery electric vehicles, like turning Ford Pro a new growth engine for our commercial customers businesses and ours, like building our intelligent software platform to revolutionize our customers' experience. Even with the recent momentum, I know some observers may remain skeptical that a 118-year-old company like Ford will emerge as a winner in these disruptive times in our industry. And I'm okay with that. We're going to compete like a challenger, speak with our actions, prove ourselves over time. So let's dive into last year. As I mentioned, we have significantly improved our base business. In North America, our largest market, we have a very hot portfolio of new vehicles. We've now won awards of North America Truck and Utility of the Year for two years running. That's never happened by any company. The new Bronco, the Bronco Sport, the Maverick, the Mustang Mach-E all of them brand-new name plates for our lineup all, all of them kits. Last month, we launched E-Transit. In the spring, we're in the middle of launching F-150 Lightning. Few people ask us any more about why we phased out sedans and many more asking when they could take delivery of the new Bronco or Maverick or Lightning. So we're doing everything we can in our powers to increase our production and break constraints. We don't like making our customers wait and we're taking action to ensure that they don't pay unreasonable markups. We've also made progress outside of North America and this is very important. Ford has been a one-legged stool for too long. We stayed in Europe and South America and other regions, because we really believe we can create sustainably strong businesses in those markets. And we want to serve these customers with better, more connected and electric products and services. The deep restructuring in Europe and South America have put us in a position to grow profitability going forward. In China, we're now set up to play a much bigger role in the EV boom going on there. We've quietly grown Lincoln into a strong contender in the world's largest luxury vehicle market. In fact, China is now the number one Lincoln market globally. Our international markets group is profitable and we're now preparing for the important launch of our next-generation Ranger pickup this year. While we remain in the teeth of the COVID crisis and semiconductor shortages, our overall business is still in great shape. And at the same time, we're rapidly making progress on key aspects of the Ford+ plan. And for customers that means more distinctive products and solutions, more always on relationships with our brands and adding ever-improving user experiences. Now to deliver these things, we're building new muscles and that certainly includes scaling up our production of electric vehicles as I mentioned. We under-called the demand for our first wave of EVs. The Mustang Mach-E, the E-Transit, the F-150 Lightning. In the past six months, we doubled our 2023 planned capacity for EVs to 600,000 units a year. Now this required everything from working with SK and LG to increase battery supplies to knocking down walls at our Rouge electric vehicle center, while the mortar was still wet to make room to improve and build more Lightnings. Our team knows how to scale manufacturing and we're now harnessing that capability to ramp up production of EVs. We also have a task force dedicated to lowering the bill of materials for our bets above and beyond just the usual declines in material costs. For example, on Mustang Mach-E, in just the last month, our team found $1000 of opportunity per vehicle. And that's delivered through design simplification, vertical integration and leveraging our scale with supply chain as we ramp up production. And that team is just getting started. We plan to take full advantage of our first-mover position in the fully electric pickup truck market starting with Lightning, but there's much more to come. In the coming months, we'll break ground on the Blue Oval City electric truck plant in Tennessee. It will be the largest, the most advanced manufacturing complex in our history, and it will produce Ford's second generation of a full-sized electric pickup in high volumes starting in 2025. And at the same time, we have three large-scale battery plants in Tennessee and Kentucky, which will be coming on stream with capacity to produce enough battery cells for more than 1 million vehicles a year. This is in addition to our battery sourcing in China and Europe. We are well on our way to achieve at least a 40% mix of BEVs by 2030 with strong margins and equal to our higher market share in the key high-profit high-volume segments we compete. For example, the F-150 Lightning, if we had full production today to meet our current demand, we would rival the Model Y as the leading BEV nameplate in the U.S. market. We can't grow a profitable BEV business without a very healthy ICE business. And to do this, we're reducing complexity everywhere, while increasing, leveraging the benefits of our connectivity. Now this includes things like fewer top hats guided by customer demand and a judicious approach to vehicle content based on deep insights generated from that same vehicle data. We're also being disciplined with capital as we deploy that to our ICE products recognizing that as a mix of BEVs increases, we will continue to manufacture ICE vehicles but with a focus on optimizing cash returns. So our goal is to continue to improve our automotive EBIT margins. Let me say that again. Our goal is to continue to improve our auto EBIT margins even as we ramp up the mix of BEVs. In 2021, we began to bring our vision of an always on experience for retail and commercial customers to life. Our customers are realizing the benefits of our over-the-air software updates. But that's just the beginning. We're using our hubs in places like Palo Alto to attract more and more great software engineers and technology specialists. And we're fundamentally changing the culture of engineering inside Ford. The hardware will always be important, but the software and the embedded systems will define the next generation of our vehicles' experiences. I think customers will be amazed at the benefits as we move to central compute rather than the distributed compute we have across all the supplier-provided modules today. Our human-centered interface professionals are now in one single organization with authority over the in-car digital experiences, interfaces, screens and controls. And we're committed to providing an environment where software engineers can do the very best work of their careers. Before I turn it over to John, let me close, the velocity of change at Ford is increasing. We're not seeking half measures. Fear of change and risk has never served legacy automakers well in the past couple of decades. We're done with incremental change. We have a clear plan, a bias fraction and whatever-it-takes mindset. We're confident our strong base business will generate the capital we need to fund a very exciting future. We're recruiting incredible talent from outside the company to work with the best people from Ford. As excited as our customers are for that great portfolio we have in the market today, we can't wait to show them what's coming in the future. Now I'll turn it over to John, who will take you through the results for the quarter and our expectations for this year. Thanks, John. Yes, I don't want to speculate on rumors or speculate on the speculation in the press. But I will go back to something we said and I've said over and over again which is, running a successful ICE business and the successful BEV business are not the same. The customers are different. We think the go-to-market is going to have to be different. The product development process and the kinds of products we develop are different. The procurement supply chain are all different. The talent is different. The level of in-sourcing is different. And actually the rhythm of the business is different -- fundamentally different. So I'm not going to talk about speculation in the press, but I will tell you that the way we're operating the businesses acknowledges those differences. And I'm really excited about the company's commitment to operate the businesses as they should be. Thank you for your question. Perhaps the biggest gift for all the pain we're going through now in semiconductors is that we have very painfully learned the lesson that we cannot manage the supply chain for these key components as we have. In fact you could argue that in the change of transition to these digital electric vehicles that supply chain could be one of the biggest advantages a particular company has or doesn't have. The way we look at it is the key electric components memory chips semiconductors. I would break semiconductors into two types. I'll come back with GlobalFoundries in a second. Feature-rich chips that we still use a lot. A window regulator doesn't need to have a 4-nanometer chip. And the advance -- but we also have sensors power electronics for our inverters, the batteries themselves all the way back to the mine, the inverters of different battery. Chemistries itself have different raw materials and kind of ecosystems that support them. So this is a very important topic for the company. How different it is? It's really different. We need different talent at the company. We need physical inspection of the actual producers. We need direct contracts with them. We need to design the SoC ourselves. We need to direct in the case -- in some cases to even direct prefer build to print or actually use supplier XYZ to get out of where we've been. And this takes talent. It takes a different approach. It takes more resources. On GlobalFoundries, it's kind of the first big bet, but there'll be many, many more coming for us. We're very dependent on TSMC for our feature-rich nodes. Obviously, the capacity is at risk over time as the industry moves to more advanced nodes including us. And as I said we're going to need feature-rich nodes for many years to come. GlobalFoundries knows how to build them. They know to build them in the United States. We can partner with the government depending on the CHIPS Act to capacitize here. It will be a few years until we benefit from that but it's a really big thing to descale ourselves on the feature-rich chips from the current ecosystem that we depend on around the world. And I think GlobalFoundries is a really interesting deal when we get into the details. We have to put cash up when we participate. Those feature-rich semis will be used by other companies industrial companies, not just Ford. It's a really interesting deal. And I was talking to the US company. You can expect the same kind of thing on advanced nodes and all the other components I mentioned including more deals on the raw material for various types of battery chemistry. And this is a culture change at Ford. As I said this is part of the rhythm change between ICE and BEV. Sorry, what's nice about what we're seeing this year or our forecast this year is, we're seeing good profit leverage from that incremental top line. And I think that's very encouraging. We have lost statistics about how that compares in the past, but that hasn't always been the case at Ford. It's great to see that top line flow into our profitability increase. Thank you. I would say, the answer to your question for ICE and BEV would be slightly different. We have about 10% of our dealers last year in the supply-constrained environment that, we're charging above MSRP to our best of our knowledge. We have very good knowledge of who they are. And their future allocation of product will be directly impacted because of that policy. And we've seen really quick action by our team.

So we've actually been securing extra batteries for quite some time now. We have some manning options for Mach-E. So we will move close to 100000 units this year on Mach-E. That will be our big move this year. Next year, our big move will be Lightning going to 150000 units. I won't get into battery chemistries and all the details, but I'm really excited about the progress we've made so far in securing batteries.

As far as chips are concerned these battery electric vehicles and the supply chain are a strategic advantage for our company. So we will protect in the constraint where we will protect our battery electric supply production. Absolutely. Absolutely. The profitability of ICE is very important because it gives us optionality, not only of scaling BEV, but also vertically integrating BEV which is increasingly becoming important for a profit lever. So we definitely want to push our ICE business as fast as far as we can. We're going into this transition with the freshest ICE lineup, I can think of any of our competitors not just in the US, globally.

And you bet you, it gives us all sorts of optionality as a company to really continue to invest in high growth business but also focus -- allow us to focus our cash and our investment in building the margin for the high growth business through things like vertical integration and new customer experiences, accelerating our physical experiences to the dealers on both businesses. Just to complement John's input. I'm struck -- throughout my career I'm struck at how different the rhythm of this digital BEV business is versus ICE. We all grew up in a business where you kind of launched the vehicle and then you work on a minor change or a next model. I certainly grew up in that model.

            "content": "Thank you, Jim. In the face of ongoing challenges with semiconductor constraints, and industry-wide supply chain disruptions, we executed our Ford+ plan, including closing out our global redesign, strengthening our product portfolio and investing in exciting new opportunities fundamental to growth and value creation. For the year, we posted $10 billion in adjusted EBIT, with a margin of 7.3%. That's our strongest performance since 2016. We delivered right at the midpoint of our guidance range adjusting for the re-class of our first quarter Rivian game to a special item. And despite a 6% decline in wholesale, our automotive business posted its strongest EBIT margin since 2016. North America delivered an 8.4% EBIT margin, and is firmly on the glide path to a 10% EBIT margin. In addition, our operations outside the US collectively posted their best results since 2017. I'm very proud of the team's hard work, the resiliency last year as we rose to the challenge and optimized constrained production to protect customer orders, new launches, our electrification strategy, and our most profitable vehicles. We also remain highly disciplined with our incentive spend, and mix management, which combined with improvement in warranty costs, more than offset commodity headwinds and supply chain-related production losses. Ford Credit, whose profits and dividends are an important source of capital for us delivered a strong year. EBT was $4.7 billion, as auction values were at record highs and credit losses were near record lows. Free cash flow was $4.6 billion, and we ended the year with strong cash and liquidity more than $36 billion and $52 billion respectively, which now includes our stake in Rivian valued at $10.6 billion at the end of the year. In 2021, we continue to advance our capital strategy given the improvements we're seeing in the underlying business. We reinstated the regular dividend at $0.10 per share in the fourth quarter as we continue to focus on creating value for our shareholders. We also further strengthened our balance sheet by repurchasing $7.6 billion of high-cost debt, deleveraging the balance sheet and significantly reducing our ongoing interest expense. We introduced the industry's first fully integrated sustainable financing framework covering both an auto OEM and its captive finance company. And in November, following the launch of the framework we completed our inaugural $2.5 billion green bond issuance, which was met with incredible investor demand and will help fund our exciting BEV portfolio. Our strong balance sheet including cash, provides a solid foundation to continue to invest in our Ford+ priorities. So let me briefly touch on the fourth quarter. With a margin of 5.4%, adjusted EBIT was $2 billion and we generated $2.3 billion in free cash flow. Some modeled stronger EBIT for us in this quarter. We know that was largely driven by higher volume expectations relative to the 10% sequential increase, we guided to in October and lower corporate other expenses. North America delivered $1.8 billion of profit with a margin of 7.1%. Volume was up 10% on a sequential basis, as supply chain constraints eased and custom demand for our products remained strong. South America delivered a modest profit for the second consecutive quarter and the business is now set up to deliver sustainable profitability. With restructuring of the legacy business complete, the region is now focused on strengthening Ford's position in the truck market, growing its new commercial vehicle business and enriching customer experiences. In Europe, the underlying trajectory of our business continues to accelerate towards a 6% EBIT margin. However, the adverse effect of near-term supply chain disruption continues to mask that improvement. Importantly we were the number one commercial vehicle brand in Europe for the seventh consecutive year and transit continues to have an extremely healthy order bank. Mustang Lockheed sales in the region are off to a strong start with the order bank building momentum as we accelerate the transition to BEV. In China, Lincoln continues to be a real bright spot and gain share in the highly profitable and growing premium segment. In the fourth quarter, we achieved record sales of the brand in China, contributing to an almost 50% increase for the year. We are expanding the Lincoln portfolio in 2022 with the launch of the all-new Zephyr. The order bank for that vehicle opened recently and is off to a fast start. In the fourth quarter we also achieved an important electrification milestone in China as we began local production and customer deliveries of the Mustang Mach-E. Our direct-to-customer model for Mach-E allows people to order online and through 25 Ford select city stores. Our international markets group performed well in the fourth quarter and had a record year playing to its strengths especially from our flagship Ranger pickup, which delivered full year segment share of 14.9% up 1.1 percentage points year-over-year. We also announced major investments in both South Africa and Thailand to modernize production and launch the next-generation Ranger from four assembly plants later this year. And in mobility, we've made steady progress towards the scaled commercialization of moving people and moving goods and we are confident in Argo's progress in delivering a Level 4 autonomous vehicle solution. And in addition, we are rationalizing our investment portfolio and focusing on autonomous development. Now, I'll share with you our current thinking about 2022. We expect supply constraints to remain fluid throughout the year, reflecting a variety of factors including semiconductors and COVID. Based on what we see now, we believe our full year wholesales will be up about 10% to 15% in 2022 with a high single to low digit decline in the first quarter, reflecting supplier shortages related to Omicron shutdown and semiconductors. For the full year, we expect to earn between $11.5 billion and $12.5 billion in adjusted EBIT and that's up 15% to 25% versus 2021. And the high end of the range equates to an adjusted company EBIT margin of 8% and our North America business at 10% EBIT margin, which if we achieve would be one year earlier than the target we shared with you last May. Now turning to GAAP results for a minute. It's important to point out that each quarter we will mark-to-market our investment in Rivian, which sits in cash and marketable securities on our balance sheet. This is not something we can forecast. The mark-to-market may cause volatility in our quarterly GAAP net income and EPS results. So looking at how our adjusted EBIT guidance rolls up. Our range assumes significantly higher profits in North America and collected profitability outside of North America, as we realize the full benefits of our global redesign efforts. We also expect Ford Credit EBT to be strong, but lower than 2021 profits, and we expect mobility and corporate other EBIT to be roughly flat. Lastly, we expect to generate adjusted free cash flow of between $5.5 billion and $6.5 billion. Now, other assumptions we factored into our guidance include. First, we expect customer demand enthusiasm to remain strong for our new and iconic nameplates. We will have a full year of production of the award-winning Bronco and Maverick, in addition to a robust BEV lineup, with Mustang Mach-E, E-Transit and F-150 Lightning all in production. Second, with wholesales up about 10% to 15%, we anticipate the pricing environment to remain strong, although the interplay between volume and pricing will remain dynamic. Third, we expect commodity headwinds of about $1.5 billion to $2 billion. Fourth, we anticipate other inflationary pressures, which will impact a broad range of costs. And fifth, at Ford Credit, we expect auction values to remain strong in 2022, as supply constraints persist. However, as I mentioned, we anticipate lower EBT reflecting primarily non-recurrence of reserve releases, fewer returned off-lease vehicles and more normalized credit losses. Most importantly, we're committed to our Ford+ plan and we'll continue to invest aggressively to drive growth and value creation. This includes devoting resources to customer-facing technology, connectivity, our always on relationships with customers and electrification. We are confident the long-term payback from those investments will be substantial. So that wraps up our prepared remarks. We'll use the balance of the time to hear and address what's on your mind. Thank you. Operator, please open the line for questions. Yes. Hi, Rod, it's John. So I guess I would say that -- as Jim just said that, we're looking at the ICE business and the BEV business and we're managing both differently. When you look at the ICE transition, I think there are still a lot of opportunities for us to improve that business. We're very focused on reducing our structural costs. We've done a lot already, but there's a lot more that we think we can do there. We're looking at operating with much lower stock levels as our business continues to develop. So we'll operate at leaner inventories than we have in the past which will help our top line and continue to strengthen that top line. We're improving our quality which is important. We saw that come through this year from a year-over-year warranty standpoint it was down roughly $1.4 billion. And we want to be at the top in quality in every segment and that's going to have opportunity for the business. We're also working to revitalize our business through our digital capabilities, leveraging what we have from the connected vehicle to improve warranty even further, as well as improve what we're doing from a manufacturing standpoint and leverage that technology to bring those types of cost down. There's opportunities in maximizing our parts business and we're going to lower our distribution costs. There's opportunity there. So we see that over time, as we manage the ICE business, there's opportunity to improve margins even further from there. And then when you talk about BEV, so as we've talked about in past calls, our BEV margins are not where we intend it to be. We have opportunity, but we need to do that through scaling them, right? We're not going to chase top hats. We're going to look at scale. We're going to want to have a strong lineup where we can lean into it with key vehicles in high-volume segments like we are today with Mustang Mach-E, the Lightning and in our commercial vehicles with the Transit. We're going to reduce complexity, right? We know that one of the things that we need to do on our vehicles and we saw that, as Jim talked about, with the team finding $1,000 a unit on Mach-E and they just got started is that, we need to approach the design of these vehicles differently. And that's what's really important about having the first-mover advantage there. We're on the road with these. We're in production with these. We understand what we need to do in that second generation and we're off doing that right now improving what we have on the road today and really bringing that knowledge into our second-generation design. And then as I said earlier on the ICE business, we're going to leverage the compute on the vehicles to really lower our manufacturing costs and leverage that compute to simplify what we do coming down the line and bring that down to the bottom line of the vehicle. And then distribution. We all know the difference in the distribution cost for the legacy system that's out there versus what we see with other manufacturers. So that's an opportunity for us to work with our partners to improve that. So on both of those we see opportunities. And then as you said, Rod, there's opportunities to grow our business and lean into our leading position in commercial vehicles with Ford Pro. And we're looking to grow that business to $45 billion in revenues by 2025. And so I think there's opportunities across both of our key segments and with Ford Pro to improve the business as we move forward beyond the 8%. And now we need to stay extremely focused and relentless on that execution. Thanks Ryan. So, yes we're really pleased with the position we have from a cash standpoint because it gives us the flexibility to invest in the business as we go. We've talked about the investments we'll be making in BEVs. We'll be breaking capacity contains and we're going to continue to focus on scaling as quickly as we can. The other thing we need to think about is the supply chain for our BEVs. There's opportunities potentially for vertical integration. There's opportunities for looking beyond as we move into these connected vehicles with more advanced electronics, potentially leveraging capital to secure supply chain there. So, there's a lot of opportunities as we move forward to leverage this cash to improve the business. We're also focused on our shareholders. And of course, total shareholder returns is important as well. So we're going to continue to provide dividends to our consumers -- to our shareholders, which is important for us as we move forward given our shareholder base. So I think what you'll see is that, that cash balance is going to be a benefit for us, as we look to grow the business, as we look to expand, as we look to vertically integrate, as we look to secure our supply chain and we continue to develop our Ford+ plan. So let me focus on 2022 first. So looking at the walk for 2022, you have to think about the 10% to 15% in the volume growth, but mix is also a strong part of that on a year-over-year basis. We expect to see continued strong mix. Pricing, as I said in my remarks, we do expect the continued strong pricing environment. So when you look at volume mix and pricing, we expect that to be up about $5.5 billion to $6.5 billion. And so I'll just walk through what -- where we see that on the bridge to 2022. We are continuing to invest in modernization and that was along with our product related spending, as we're continuing to build out our BEV business. That's about $1.5 billion headwind, but that's broadly offset with other efficiencies that we're working on. You also see that commodities are going to be a headwind next year of about $1.5 billion to $2 billion. And then Ford Credit is going to be strong, but we do expect them to be down about $1.5 billion. And then of course, we've got lower net pension income. So we expect the top line to be strong with the volume increase. We continue to expect to have strong mix. And then we expect pricing to be a strength as well on a year-over-year basis. From a quarter-over-quarter basis and what \u2013 how the quarter developed, we hit the midpoint of the guidance. And one of the things is I think some expected volumes to be up higher than what we had guided. And just we had supply chain constraints hitting us this quarter. Omicron disrupted several of our key suppliers. They couldn't produce. They couldn't get us products. But net-net when you look at the fourth quarter relative to where we were third quarter, let's say as a proxy, volume and mix was up slightly. It was up about six-tenths. But then we had additional headwinds on commodities. We had some modernization costs that came through, specifically around our IT as well as connectivity as we're investing in those growth areas. And then we saw costs come through from inflation. We saw costs come through on transportation, on fuel, et cetera. So we're seeing some of those headwinds were hitting us in the fourth quarter. But demand was strong. If we could have met the demand and the production without the disruptions, you would have seen a stronger quarter. And so as we go into 2022, as we see those supply constraints ease, as we see the demand for our really strong product lineup, we see the top line growing. We see continued improvement in mix. We see continued improvement in price. And that's going to be much more of a tailwind versus some of the headwinds we're seeing [Technical Difficulty] No. I don't think that as we ramp up at the start with the launch this year that it's going to have a significant impact on what we see from a standpoint of our profits in North America. And then coming back I think one of the questions Colin you had asked that, I didn't touch upon was the fourth quarter or maybe it was Emmanuel earlier on the mix side is we did have lower Super Duty mix in the quarter and that was again driven by supply chain disruptions. There were vehicles that we weren't able to build and complete because of certain commodities that weren't coming through to get those vehicles down the line and done. Yes. Thanks. It's John here. So, when we look at our Mach-E profitability as we said, we are profitable from a Mach-E standpoint. We're seeing great demand. We're seeing strong mix. So, we've seen the profits improve. Importantly what else we're seeing is opportunities to continue to reduce the cost and reduce the complexity. So we're very focused on improving those margins. But overall, as we said in the past, our fab margins are not yet quite where we like them to be especially relative to our more profitable ICE vehicles. And so, we have to continue to do work there primarily around scaling, reducing the complexity as we move forward. So we're encouraged by what we're seeing on Mach-E so far, especially with the strong demand and the mix but there's other work that we need to do as well to continue to further improve those margins. And our expectation is that we're fully competitive on our BEV margins as we move forward and that's what we need to work towards. In Europe, we expect profit improvement. We expect them to be meaningfully profitable in this year in 2022. And we're still committed and Europe is on track to deliver the 6% EBIT margin by 2023. They're continuing to move forward. They're seeing favorable pricing environment continue. They're accelerating into the BEV. The Mach-E is a very strong product for them. And again commercial vehicles, it's a strength of ours and we continue to see that grow next year and be a pillar for Europe, a strength for Europe. With IMG as you go into 2022, International Markets Group, we expect them to be down year-over-year but profitable. And that's going to be driven by two key things: the India transition and what we see there as well as the fact that our Ranger volumes are going to be down year-over-year as we launch the new Ranger. And so it's a transition year for us in the International Markets Group. So they'll be down year-over-year but profitable. And then from there with the new Ranger, we're really excited about that product and what we can leverage with that product as we move forward in our International Markets Group."

Now, I will turn the call over to Jim Farley.\nJim Farley: Thank you, Lynn. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Well, this month marks one year since we'd began executing our Ford Plus Plan. It creates growth, value, and it allows us to win in emerging area of electric and connected vehicles. We built a strong team that combines top leaders from Ford with world-class talent recruited from outside of our Company.  Specific talents, specific people that are largely outside of our industry. This leadership team is committed to this plan and we're accelerating our progress. Ford Plus is not a tagline. It's not advertising. It's a larger, more ambitious way to think about our business and how we bringing value to our customers.  We're creating iconic and distinctive products that only four can do. Increasingly, always on relationships with our customers and ever improving user experiences, all why creating value for our shareholders. We're fully invested in this future. And we're taking big swings. Key to the plan is harnessing the power of connectivity.  We're designing a new generation of fully networked vehicles not delegated to our supply chain, but done inside the Company to revolutionize the experience of owning and operating Ford vehicle. That's embedded technology to unleash unlimited innovation. We're scaling the number of vehicles capable of over-the-air updates will be moving from 1 million vehicles today to 33 million by 2028.  That scale. At the same time, we're moving aggressively to lead the electric vehicle revolution, substantially expanding our battery production as we speak today in the U.S. Infact, we already announced plans that will give us enough battery production to meet our mid-decade goal of a 141 gigawatts, which is enough to build more than 1 million battery electric vehicles a year and I think we'll need more.  R7 billion investments in Blue Oval city in Tennessee in the BlueOvalSK park in Kentucky sets a new standard for scale sustainability, advanced manufacturing, and training the next-generation of technology leaders. At the same time, the billion dollars of investment in our electrified center in Cologne, Germany will allow us to go all electric soon. That center will be all electric by 2023.  We're making final preparations to launch the F-150 Lightning. That defining 0 mission version of an America's best-selling vehicle for the past 40 plus years. Our all electric Mustang Mach-E is a hit with customers, not just in the U.S., but around the world, bringing a stunning number of new customers to the Ford brand.  Over 90% of the Mach-E owners say they would recommend a Mach-E to other customers. Critical as a new-generation of battery electric customers make new brand choices. Our challenge now is to break production constraints and increase availability to meet this incredible demand both in North America and in Europe, and also in China, the biggest EV market in the world. where we are just starting production and Mach-E.  We believe the global demand just for Mustang Mach-E could approach about 200,000 vehicles a year. We've created new organization, Ford Pro to change and power the future of work with compelling commercial vehicles, distribution, and services. While growing revenues to Ford. In a few weeks, we will start production of the new E-Transit, an electric version in the world's best-selling commercial van.  And in the third quarter alone, FORDLiive, Europe 's new connected uptime center, which I wish you could all see for our commercial customers, helps customers in the UK secure additional up time, preventing about $8 million of lost revenue and associated costs for our valuable customers.  We're reinventing icons like Bronco and creating new ones like Maverick. In fact, the all-new Maverick, 42 miles per gallon I might add, is the first standard hybrid pickup in the U.S. It's also America 's most fuel-efficient hybrid pickup. This is the strongest, most compelling lineup I'd ever seen from any mass market brand in my career.  And we are creating a spring loaded future as we emerge from the cheap shortages and COVID constraints. And we continue to make important strides in the technology and go-to-market strategy for autonomous vehicles. In the Second Quarter, we told you about a new partnership with Argo AI and Lyft. And then the Third Quarter, we announced a new partnership with Argo AI and Walmart.  This is Walmart's first ever multi-city autonomous delivery service. And it will be anchored in cities where we already have operations. Not the easiest miles in one city, but multiple cities and hard miles. In addition to making real progress on autonomy vehicles, operating domains, SDS, we fully support Argo AI 's aspiration to access public capital. To build this future, and generate the margins and cash flow.  We need to fund Ford Plus; we had a turn around our automotive operations, and improve our competitiveness. Our results in the third quarter show we are making significant progress. In fact, Company-wide, we achieved an 8.4% EBIT margin, including 10.1% in North America. Those margins, I will remind you are in line with our targets for 2023.  More importantly, our operations outside of North America are likely to post the best performance in 4 years. Please note the performance in South America, largely driven by our success of our global redesign. We've been able to achieve this while thoughtfully managing our supply chain for short-term sustainable improvements including semiconductors, and prioritizing high demand and high profit vehicles.  And before I turn it over to John, a few thoughts. I believe we have the right plan to drive growth and unlock unprecedented value. You are already seeing favorable change in the slope of our earnings and cash flow. There's more to come. Given the strength of our business this year, we are increasing our full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance to between 10.5 and 11.5 billion. As we plan in earnest for next year, we're excited and energized about the opportunity in front of us and clear that we have so much more work to do to deliver on fourth potential. The word I would leave you with is focus.  That competitive environment has never been more interesting and tough. And we intend to live up to our promise to compete like a challenger focusing on our top priorities to unlock Ford Plus growth with customers at the very center of everything we do. Now I will turn it over to John, who'll take you through our results for the quarter, our outlook for the full year, our capital allocation priorities, and our expectations heading into next year. John?\nJohn Lawler: Thank you, Jim. Now in the face of continued industry-wide semiconductor constraints, we stayed focused on our plan, strengthening our portfolio, and investing in opportunities fundamental to growth and value creation. We delivered a solid quarter with 3 billion in adjusted Company EBITDA, and a margin of 8.4%. Free cash flow of 7.7 billion was as we expected up sharply on a sequential basis, driven by the positive working capital effects, from higher wholesales in EBITDA. We ended the quarter with strong cash and liquidity at over 31 billion and 47 billion respectively. Now across our automotive business, our playbook remained consistent as we optimize production for customer orders, new launches, and our most profitable vehicles.  And as expected on a sequential basis, our wholesales improved dramatically its chip supply for Ford improved. We also remained disciplined with incentive spending and mix management, which on a year-over-year basis, more than offset chip-related declines in volume. Ford Credit delivered another solid quarter with 1.1 billion in EBT as auction values continue to remain strong, and credit losses continue at near record lows.  For the fourth Quarter, we're assuming a sequential increase in wholesale. We also expect continued healthy mix and net pricing and solid results from Ford Credit, although not as strong as the Third Quarter. Headwinds include inflationary impacts on commodities and freight, and we also expect plan sequential increases in our Ford Plus modernization investments, including customer experience and IT.  So let me share with you some highlights from the quarter before I turn to guidance, capital allocation, in our preliminary view of 2022. With improved chips supply, North America wholesales increased sequentially by 67% as the team prioritized launches, customer orders, and high-margin units while reducing the number of vehicles built, but waiting for chips.  Demand remains strong for our exciting vehicles. The order bank we are building paid off in the third quarter, representing 28% of our retail sales in the third quarter, and reaching a high of 31% in September. And our overall customer orders increased over 50% from the Second Quarter to more than a 100,000 orders, excluding Bronco.  With the 10.1% EBITDA margin in the quarter, North America is now at a 9% margin year-to-date, just 100 basis points shy of our 2023 target of 10%. South America, marked its eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in EBITDA, and the business run rate is now approaching break even.  The region also launched its new commercial vehicle organization with the introduction of the new transit, which is manufactured in Uruguay. This transit is the first light commercial van to market in Brazil that includes connectivity as a standard feature. In Europe, the underlying trajectory of our business continues to strengthen though the adverse impact from chips has masked this improvement.  In the Third Quarter, the business lost about 50,000 units, which would have had a substantial favorable impact on EBITDA. Our leadership, as the number one commercial vehicle brand continued in the quarter along with an extremely robust quarter bank. In China, Lincoln continues to perform well, extending its success in the most profitable segment, luxury, with retail sales up 24% year-over-year.  In fact, Lincoln has doubled its share of the China luxury market over the past 18 months. Our newly created BEV organization to open its first 13 direct-to-consumer Ford -select city stores, with a total of 25 expected to open by year-end. In IMG, our leadership team in India made the difficult decision to end manufacturing; following accumulated operating losses of more than 2 billion over the past 10 years.  Going forward, we will focus on importing iconic vehicles, including EVs. And overall, IMG had a solid quarter, capitalizing on our strengths, including ranger. Now as Jim highlighted, the underlying strength of our business supports increasing our adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2021 to between $10.5 and $11.5 billion. And that's despite a lower than anticipated improvement in cheap availability in the second half of the year.  Consistent with our adjusted EBITDA guidance three this year, our updated guidance for 2021 includes the $900 million non-cash gain on our investment in Rivian in our First Quarter adjusted results. So let me spend a minute on Rivian. Now, in the event that Rivian completes its IPO, we will record any gain on our investment in any subsequent adjustments of special items.  Accordingly, we will recast the 900 million non-cash gain from adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter to a special [Indiscernible] As Rivian completes their IPO in the fourth quarter, we will make this change when we report our fourth quarter earnings on February 3, 2022. Our guidance for 2021 adjusted free cash flow is unchanged at 4 to 5 billion, reflecting the higher EBITDA, but less favorable improvement in working capital and timing differences.  Now this is due to lower than anticipated volumes than previously assumed in the back half of the quarter, and that's as a result of chip constraints. We do expect free cash flow to increase with higher production, and the associated improvement in supplier payables and other timing differences. Now let me turn to capital allocation, which again is the foundation of our value creation framework.  Our capital allocation discipline is driving a strong core business and Balance Sheet that provides the flexibility to invest in new growth opportunities as we deliver our Ford Plus plan. Ultimately, and ensures we returned value to our shareholders, both in the form of a higher share price and dividends. Today, we announced the reinstatement of our dividend.  Our board has approved restarting of regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share in the fourth quarter of 2021. Importantly, the dividend reflects our confidence in the improving run rate of the business and our ability to fund all of our calls on capital, including the growing investment in electrification and the trajectory of our Ford Plus plan.  The dividend was also sized to ensure we maintain appropriate optionality to manage continued uncertainties in the external environment. To give you a better sense of our calls on capital between 2020 and 2025, we expect total capital expenditures of about 40-45 billion or run rate of roughly $7 billion per year. Over the same time, we expect to invest over $30 billion in BEV. And above the investment in BEV that\u2019s about 50% is CAPEX, 25% is expense, and 25% is direct investments. And these numbers, they'll be dynamic, and we are confident we have ample financial flexibility to increase our investments even if BEV adoption further accelerates.  And I'll let me share with you our early thinking about 2022, a year which like this one is likely to experience some industry crosswinds that could drive a range of outcomes that we typically don't talk about the upcoming year this soon. And we're not yet prepared to give financial guidance, but we do want to share how we're thinking about next year, given the dynamic operating environment.  Ford's underlying strengths give me great confidence we can build on our results in 2021. First, our portfolio of products and services is exceptional. And we have a significant amount of new product coming to market spanning our iconic high-volume nameplate. Second, our industrial base gives us significant optionality as the adoption of electric vehicles accelerates.  Third, driven by the chip shortage of roughly 4 million in wholesales, we are likely to deliver this year fall significantly below our capacity. And based on our current assessment, we believe our wholesales to be up about 10% in 2022, but that number is very dynamic and changes almost weekly. And fourth, the effects of our global redesign, which is largely completed, are now evident and substantial.  We have drastically de -risked and rationalized our global footprint and product lineup, vastly improving our earnings and cash generation power in the process. Now for headwinds next year, it's difficult to predict the interplay between semiconductor-related constraints, volume and pricing and this will continue to remain dynamic.  For 2021, we expect commodities to be up 3 to 3.5 billion and they could be up another 1.5 billion in 2022, largely driven by steel and aluminum similar to this year. There will also likely be other inflationary costs, but it's too early to size that right now. Ford Credit is likely to be lower as strong auction values will be moderated by a smaller inventory of vehicles and lower lease end return rates.  And lastly, we're obviously going to continue to invest in our Ford Plus Plan for growth and value creation. And this includes in customer-facing technology, connectivity, and our always on relationships with customers, and electrification. And, of course, we believe long-term payback from those investments will be substantial.  Now that wraps up our prepared remarks. And if you perceive that the upfront portion of these calls is becoming more efficient, well, you're right. And that's a function of us being very specific with you and our team about what's truly important, and our confidence in executing effectively against those things and reporting accordingly will use the balance of the time here and address what's on your mind. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America.\nJohn Murphy: Good evening, everybody. Thanks for making the call efficient. I think it's going to be tough to limit to one question, but I will. If you think about the 10% increase you are talking about in 2022 wholesales, and if we could focus on North America and just assume you're going to do about 2 million units this year in '21, give or take. We're only talking about 200,000 units of increase next year.  There's just an assumption that the price and mix will deteriorate an incremental units are produced semi shortage is relieved. But given that that's still gonna be a relatively low -- a very low level of production, do you believe that the price mix are really going to actually come under pressure next year and aren't we really going to stay in a very tight environment that you are selling through and not even building inventory if that's true, which means that pricing mix might stay very strong next year and we will still get the benefit. Thanks John. You're right. It's going to remain dynamic and that's what the interplay is going to be volume increases for the industry. They're higher, we'll probably see more pressure on price if they remain as they are today. And we see a moderate increase; I think you're going to continue to see strong pricing and mix continue through next year.  So that's where we have to stay disciplined and we have to stay very focused on managing that well so that we can have, as you said, the play-through next year relative to what happens from an overall volume standpoint, and we're focused on that. So I agree with you. That's going to be one of the key dynamic elements for next year. And just to follow-up on that. I think right now, based on wards, you have about 213,000 units in dealer inventory. Pre-COVID travel rate was about 650,000 units. You think about ultimately getting into a time where you can rebuild or restock that inventory, where do you think that runs, and how much opportunity is there to try to maintain some of this mix and price discipline to offset any cost inflation, and also invest in the future?\nJohn Lawler: Yeah, so if you look at where we ended in September, we ended at about 20 days\u2019 supply in the U.S. and we're watching it very closely from a day supply standpoint. In -- as we talked about last quarter, in our historical base supply was somewhere around 75 days. We're not going back there.  As Jim said, we're going to be very disciplined and we expect to be in the 50 days\u2019 supply when we're fully at full capacity and we're running and producing everything that we can, so that's gonna be the key. The other thing I would say, John, is that the move as we talked about in our remarks to having more of our sales come through orders, unlike orders in the order bank.  That's really important for us to manage our day supply. So it's a less of a scrounge stock push through and its customer demand pull-through based on the orders and we had over a 100,000 orders at the end of the quarter and that's grown since then in our order bank and that play well for us in the third quarter.\nJim Farley: $139,454 order.\nJohn Lawler: As of -- as of today.\nJim Farley: As of today.\nJohn Murphy: To be exact that's it sounds like you are on that and maybe if I could sneak one in just on cap allocation real quick on the dividend. I mean why now? And I'll hop back in the queue.\nJim Farley: Yeah. It's the underlying strength of the business, John. And we're not capital constrained. We're able to fund our initiatives for growth. We know that there are going to be other opportunities that surface. We're confident that we can fund those. And we're focused on total shareholder returns. Not only stock appreciation, but also the dividend. And so given the strength of the business, the Board elected that we would restart the dividend this quarter.\nJohn Murphy: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Levy with Credit Suisse.\nDan Levy: Hey, good evening. Thank you for taking the question. I would like to just like to ask a question on the shape of recovery in volumes A, is this magnesium shortage going to cause any term -- any sort of near-term supply disruption for you?  I mean, we heard some during the comments that I could just outright stop European production and just maybe you can give us a sense broadly how you anticipate the shape of recovery in terms of volumes -- at what point do we get or is your baseline expectation that the chip shortages fully mitigated that you can be back at full run rate production?\nJohn Lawler: Yeah. So from the magnesium standpoint, when we look at that, we are seeing price pressure on aluminum broadly, we saw that all year and probably see a little bit more price pressure due to the magnesium issue, but our sheet metal suppliers -- our sheet aluminum suppliers don't purchase magnesium from China for North American production. So we don't see that having any significant impact or any impact on us.  We do see the chip issue continuing to run through 22, as we said, it's very dynamic. Right now, if you ask us what we think the sequential increase in supply will be year-over-year, we think we will have about 10% more, but that's changing weekly.  And we're doing everything we can to get our hands on as many chips as we can. But we do see that running through 2022, it could extend into 2023, although we do anticipate the scope and severity of that to reduce as we move through 22 into 23.\nDan Levy: Great. Thank you. Second question. I'd like to be now, just a bit more strategic. Think if we just look at the pace of progress at Ford, just both financially and in terms of EV all things digital and just overseeing today is far greater than what you we saw 12 or 18 months ago, which is actually pretty impressive given the large organizations, it takes time to really affect change.  I just want to I'm trying understand how much of what we're seeing today was something that was always there and it's just always starting to come to the surface now, there's sort of getting the fruits of prior initiatives or has something fundamentally changed in the past 12, 18 months? What does this tell us about the pace of change at Ford has an extra period, maybe just to be a bit more specific, as I know, you can take that a number of ways. Maybe you can answer that specifically to what we're seeing on product and planning on the business trends with that transition EBITDA\nJim Farley: Thank you for your question. A lot of the product we've been working on for several years, we made the tough choices. I would say the answer is we have a plan; it's not an advertising peer taglines. It's our plan, everyone in the Company knows what we have to do. We are out of time. And we have focused. We need to get an 8% margin like we did this quarter as a Company, regularly because we have to fund a high-growth BEV and digital business.  It's not to make more money -- yes, it is that. But it's motivated in the mission of transforming Ford through these digital products. So running the ICE business for cash, getting serious about our cost, our quality, our launches, our 8% return. It's all a mission, and the team knows the plan and I think the culture is starting to change to be quicker, more accountability, less bureaucracy and that mission permeates through the Company.  I'm probably the worst person to ask whether something's changed, because it sure has changed for me, and my leadership team. But to me the proof is in the putting like our third quarter. And whether we really changed this Company will be proven out in our numbers over time, like to have the last year.\nDan Levy: And then just to be more specific on the product front, because I think we're seeing a much faster pace of products. Is the time of developments, products, like how much have you accelerated that meaning typically in the past we would hear of 3.5 to 4 years of drawing boards that product and showroom. Is there a new normal for what that is?\nJim Farley: If we make up our mind, and we come together as a team like we did on Maverick, it could be just 2 years. We did -- we knocked 20 months off the Maverick development, but it required the leadership team to not have the hand-wringing on the studio for 6 months, like we normally did. I think that's an improve point. But the question I ask myself is a little different.  When we see a technology change like this, like BEV, it's not just the speed of your product creation. It's can you be flexible and agile in your industrial system, like in manufacturing. We have 3 complete hits on our hands; a Mach-E with 200,000 units of demand, that's we have the Lightning with over a 160,000 orders and the transits completely sold out.  So how I like to think about it, it's not just a product creation speeding up the total Company. And we have to do our job to break constraints now, so that we can deliver hundreds of thousands of battery electric next year. That to me is the proof of our change, not just our faster product creation process works.\nDan Levy: Great. Thank you very much, very helpful.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.\nRyan Brinkman: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I thought to ask a few on the order bank, just given the commentary that it grew 50% sequentially in 3Q, excluding the Bronco. So can you talk about the benefits of the order bank? How it helps to optimize your operations? And what kind of pricing or other trends you might be seeing with regard to the order bank?  And then how much of the increase in orders do you think may stem from the currently very strong new product cadence or from the currently low inventory environment? And what avenues are there available to drive orders as industry conditions eventually normalize?\nJim Farley: Thank you so much for your question. I'll ask John to comment. From my view, the order bank model that we're going to in North America that we're in right now, has benefits across the patch. We are an incredibly complicated Company. And so, having an order bank allows us to push simplification into the order that the customer facing options, which we need to do. And a reduces costs and improves our quality.  Number 2, it eliminates the need for expensive conquest, fixed marketing. Number 3, it's incredibly helpful for industrial system. You cannot imagine Ryan how much money we waste by guessing what our launch mix is for new product. When you have an order bank special for new models. You could capacitize the high series mixes that are very profitable, right in line with customer demand.  So it's incredibly cost-effective. And it allows you to address the long tail revenues that we've lost in the past because of our undrawn ground stock model. And the last one is its lower cost. There is less parts hanging around. We can manage our industrial system and our manufacturing and a leaner way.  The question really is how we maintain it as you said, is the market improves and the way we are looking at that. Is not just having a day supply target in the past that we've managed, but actually putting in the infrastructure to maintain, or prefer an order-based system. That means we train our system to put in orders.  We reward people for putting in orders. We dynamically price for customers so that they are incentivized to keep ordering versus buying off the lot. So it's going to be a journey. It's been a very rewarding one so far. And we're just beginning. This is the model we have to go through as most of our business are -- majority of our business goes battery electric and digital. It's the right loyalty model.\nRyan Brinkman: Okay, great, thanks. And then just as a quick follow-up to that, it seems as was discussed earlier, that product development times are speeding up, maybe particularly with regard to EV is the Lightning, for example, seem to together very fast.  Another trend seems to be that automakers are revealing their EV's for a longer period of time before the actual start of production, maybe because there's so eager to show them consumers are so clamoring for them. Does that mean that you think that order banks and ordering in advance might be even more popular with electric vehicles? What are you seeing with regard to that?\nJim Farley: The move to a digital product means we have to go to a 100% loyalty model. So the reason why you're seeing us launch battery electrics early is very simple. It's our Super Bollard. Our new Super Bollard, or new Detroit Motor Show is our reveal. because there's starts the clock on reservations and you have to do it early enough so you are industrial system gets informed by the results of your reservation. That's the closed loop that has to happen.  We need to open it early enough so that our industrial system can react to the orders and we don't waste money and take advantage of long tail revenue. And it's a more controlled environment than a broadcast media advertising on the Super Bowl.\nRyan Brinkman: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research.\nRod Lache: Hi everybody. I have just 2 questions. So first you've got a lot of growth that you're targeting and in BEv's and digital businesses. So it's not surprising that we would see some structural cost inflation. What we're seeing right now is actually really benign.  It's 200 million and in the quarter, considering what you've got going on, but maybe can you talk a little bit about, how we should think about the feathering in of those additional structural costs, which presumably come in ahead of the revenue. So how should we think about that as we look out to the next year or 2?\nJohn Lawler: Yeah, Rod. We'll start to see those come in as we get into 22 and then they'll feather in to 23 as we continue to ramp our investments in our plan, our priorities. Not only in the products, the BEv's, but also as we're building out our customer facing technologies, our connectivity, etc. So yeah, you will see that start to come in on a year-over-year basis next year and it will continue into 23.\nRod Lache: Can you just give us any sort of brackets around what I mean you did mention that 25% of the EBITDA spending will be expense, but any sort of thoughts on the magnitude of what that headwind is?\nJohn Lawler: Not -- I'm not ready to do that today for '22 and going in through '23. We're completely targeted on getting to that 8% in 2023, so we'll manage it within that. But today, I'm not ready to talk in that level of detail about.\nRod Lache: Okay. And I was a little surprised about the comment about just 10% volume growth for next year. It seems to me like the Renesas fire in Texas storms alone might have not 200,000 units off of your production in Q2, and it wasn't too long ago you guys were routinely doing over 700,000 units a quarter.  So do you have any thoughts that you might be able to share about when -- would you be able to get back up to that kind of a level of production, and if so, when should we expect that to happen?\nJohn Lawler: Right. I think what you'll find is that as you look through 2022, the first half will have less supply than through the second half. And as I said earlier, we see this mitigating over time. It may extend into 2023. But I would say that we should be back up and running based on what we're seeing today, our run rate, the end of next year into '23. And then in 2023, we'd start to rebuild our inventories.  But it's dynamic, Rod, and it's hard to make a pinpoint call at this point in time. But we wanted to share with you what we're seeing is that -- we're seeing about 10% for next year, and we see that the chip constraints is going to still...[Indiscernible] going to still be at [Indiscernible]. So we have to keep managing as we are this year.\nRod Lache: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays.\nBrian Johnson: 2 questions. First, a quick quite housekeeping, but definitely Balance Sheet question. As you stated the dividend at the level, just could you maybe talk us through the investment grade rating implications and timeline to get there that you are and the board considered when setting that.\nJim Farley: So we're gonna continue to work and focus on improving our business, right? Our target is to have an investment-grade Balance Sheet, but that's going to come by improving the business, and you're seeing the strength of that come through. And so, that's what we're focused on. What the rating agencies to -- decide to do with our rating, they'll manage that.  That's up to them. What we're laser-focused on is improving the run rate of the business, improving our performance, improving our overall metrics, and eventually, the rating agencies and the ratings will take care of themselves.\nBrian Johnson: Okay. Second question. As you think about that 10% volume increase rough guidance. A couple of things One, where do you see fleet sales coming back as you kind of bring that up and second, are you going to take a different attitude towards fleet sales than in Ford of the past? I remember Don Leclair saying he had 2 factories making Tauruses and when took our companies, we're about the only buyer so that several.  But there are also really rental cars, but maybe some of the government business that's not pleased with not quite the same and related to that as you think about prioritizing production or their models where you're more comfortable, you'll get good price retention. And other models, and I'm gonna pick on like the escape maybe, that have a lot of competition in their segment. And as capacity comes back, less likely to hold price, say compared to our Bronco.\nJohn Lawler: So it's interesting because I remember those days when Don probably made that comment about rental fleets and that they were low margin, etc. I think what you're finding is business models are changing and the fleet business is evolving just like everything else in our industry. And we see that there could potentially be a positive fleet business where there could make good money.  And so we're not going to shy away from that if we see that its right for our brand and we think is right for the bottom line. And so we're going to continue to look at fleets differently and we're going to continue to think about vehicles as-a-service and what that potential holds for us is that business model changes and we'll see where that takes us. But we're not going to go back to the times where we're putting in capacity; we're pumping out unit, selling them at little to no margin for rental cars. That's not going to happen again.\nBrian Johnson: I'm sorry.\nJohn Lawler: It's okay, I was just going to see our fleet business now. Now that we've rationalized the Company, our fleet business is very strategic for us. It's also very profitable. It certainly varies in Europe, and North America, and China. Different fleet segments have different profitability. The one thing I would ask you to think about is that most of fleet that matters at Ford is commercial vehicles.  And the most important commercial vehicles for us are small, medium-sized businesses. And those are very profitable business for us, for transit, for super duty. That's where Ford excels in the fleet business. And it's smaller fleets, it's not big fleet sales. So the texture of this is that we're revenue managing the Company very carefully.  We know the margins by geography, even within the country and we know by distribution channel. So this is a very thoughtful approach for us, but strategically, especially because of the Pro business and its profitability, we want to make sure we have where reliable partner with fleet customers.  They do business with companies that are reliable, that don't come in and out of the market, they do business with companies that have a full range of products, a full range of services. That's why Marion is investing in Ford Pro, and why we're vertically integrating our services.\nJim Farley: So I think we have a really good, profitable fleet business around the world. We look at the margins very carefully, but it's strategically very important for the Company to be a reliable partner.\nBrian Johnson: Okay. And then in terms of price retention and how that's going to vary, caution product line?\nJim Farley: Well, John, I think you should you should answer that one in terms of how we revenue manage in a constrained environment.\nJohn Lawler: Yeah. So as you would expect, we're very conscientious about the dynamic of the supply and demand and the impact that has on the pricing and we look at this on a daily basis managing our incentives, looking at if we should be taking top-line pricing given the inflationary pressures we're seeing.  As we talked about, we're not going to go back to the old habits of loading of the dealers with stock and then looking through the push through for sales, were going to focus more on orders coming through online. Specific orders to customers being satisfied, understanding what their demands are, simplifying the system.  And with all of that, we expect to retain quite a bit of a price. Now will it mitigate as we go through next year as supply and demand comes more in Bell and in '23? Yes. But our job is going to be to manage that and retain as much pricing as we can. And while providing customers good value for those products. So it's something that we look at very closely on a daily basis.\nBrian Johnson: Thank you.\nJim Farley: In the Escape business, we now have another player called Bronco Sport, in a segment. It's incredibly profitable and people really appreciate the product. We're know in the business of commodity products in that segment anymore, we changed, we made investments several years ago.\nBrian Johnson: Right.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with Wells Fargo.\nColin Langan: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I just want to clarify, as part of your original guidance was that the first -- the second half was supposed to be up in volume 30%. I mean, I'm not sure if I'm misreading it, it sounds like Q3 maybe up a bit from Q4. So is that 30% still not accurate? Obviously, it's important when you think about the 10% to 2022 web-based are going off.\nJohn Lawler: Yeah, Colin, that's a great question. Thank you. Now, we did say last quarter that we expected the second half to be up about 30% looks like it's going to be up somewhere around 15%. And so what you're seeing flow-through is the strength we had in the quarter relative to the top line and other actions that we took relative to cost, etc.  So when you look at that walk, that bridge between Q3 to Q4, we expect market factors to be positive. We also said, we think volume is going to be up sequentially about 10% and also see a little bit stronger, stronger mix continuing, and then of course you'll have some product-related costs, production-related costs associated with that.  But net -- net market factors, net of those costs to produce the increased volumes is going to be positive. We're seeing from a headwind standpoint, if you look at Q3 to Q4 our commodities, we expect that on a quarter-over-quarter basis, they are going to be up about $700 million. And if you look at that so far, year-to-date, we've seen about $1.6 billion of commodities hit us. When you get to the Fourth Quarter.  You can get the Cumulus factor that on a year-over-year basis, commodities are going to be up about another billion five in the Fourth Quarter. Year-over-year up a billion five sequentially, up $700 million.  And then we are going to see some higher warranty costs on a sequential basis in the Fourth Quarter for things that we have to take care of around extended warranties and a little bit higher coverages. But again, on a year-over-year basis, our warranty will improve in the fourth quarter. In full-year, on a year-over-year basis, our warranty, we expect to be good by about a billion for.\nColin Langan: Got it. Right. That's very helpful.\nJohn Lawler: So does that help you with the bridge?\nColin Langan: Yes -- no, that's great. I just -- secondly, in terms of the redesign plan that's been out for a while, is India the last major step? I mean, is this going to sort of -- is this it, or next quarter may be the last time we see these slides? Just kind of curious. Or is there more still coming?\nJim Farley: Well, I think we're in good shape for now. Obviously the acceleration of the BEV business, and our ICE assets will be, I think the next big transition for the whole industry, not just Ford. But Ford specifically, India's really the principal region country where we have struggled over time.  And it's really great to see the progress the team is making in India and the very vibrant position will now have with the new lineup. And I'd just like to highlight the progress in North America for this quarter. John when's last time we were profitable in South America?\nJohn Lawler: I believe it was 2013.\nJim Farley: So let -- let's hang that in the air for 2013.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC.\nJoseph Spak: Thank you. Maybe just one quick one on the free cash guidance or so. I think you maintained despite the EBITDA guidance went higher. So is there something going on with working capital because you're, you're saying you're releasing more vehicles, so I wouldn't think that would actually be positive factor in the fourth quarter as well as from curious what the offset is.\nJohn Lawler: Yeah. So what we're seeing there is that we've got the EBITDA coming in, right that improvement, but the less favorable improvement in working capital and timing differences hitting us in the quarter. Because we have lower than anticipated volume in the back half of the quarter due to the chip constraints, and so we get with that working capital at the end of the year. So that's what's happening to us on the free cash flow, so it's a timing issue.\nJoseph Spak: Okay, and then I want to go back to some of the announcements you've made over the past couple of months and you talked again about the spend today. And end up spending more than 30 billion. And I appreciate the breakdown you gave us, sort of how you're spending that.  Maybe this is just me but I actually find it still fairly difficult to track what exactly you're spending over the coming year because I believe some of that has already been spent. So is it possible to maybe just say like olive that 30 billion, what's being spent, like starting next year through the middle of the decade?\nJohn Lawler: So of the 30 billion, when you look at the cap, very little. We said about half of that was cap. Very little of that has been spent through 2021 relative to the 13 to 15 billion, about half of it. Of course, you're going to see the expense front-loaded because that's primarily be engineering that we have in developing the battery electric vehicles.  And then the direct investment, which is about 25% of it bats with things like the virtual go integration of J.D. and those types of things. And you saw those announcements this quarter with our plan in BlueOvalSK, the battery plans. That's how we're going to unfold that bad spending over time.\nJoseph Spak: That's helpful. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi.\nItay Michaeli: Great. Thanks. Good evening, everybody. Two quick ones from me. First, is there any update on the BlueCruise deployment, including through OTA, maybe some initial customer feedback?\nJim Farley: Great. Thank you. We're shipping with marquee F-Series now BlueCruise as they leave the factory and we're going to be OTA in BlueCruise in the first quarter. We wanted to improve the customer experience, so we've pushed it back in terms of an OTA because we wanted to be much simpler for the customer than was originally planned and that takes a little planning to consolidate. Often these level 2 systems require multiple updates in the car. We wanted to be very simple that took a little bit more work on our team's part, and so it's available. as we ship products now and as in OTA, it'll be in the first quarter and it will be a lot simpler to use. And get that OTA and update for the customer than it was originally planned. Does that answer your question?\nItay Michaeli: Yeah. That's very helpful. And then maybe just does super quick follow-ups, just a point of clarification. Thank you for 2022 initial indications. And at least you mentioned you expect to build on the strong performance in 2021. I am just curious if that if we should interpret that as you expect to grow EBITDA adjusted year-over-year in 2022.\nJohn Lawler: Yeah so we're not going to give a number at this point and say, but what we're saying is that the strength of our new product lineup, our high-volume nameplates like in the strength of what we're seeing Rod Lache, as Jim said, we think there's about demand for 200,000 units. We've got the Bronco, Maverick, E-Transit, and F-150 Lightning is coming.  It's the best lineup that we had, and so that's going to be a tailwind for us for sure as we go into next year. You're seeing that come through this year, and we're going to build on that. But we're also going to have to manage the headwinds that we've talked about.  And the other puts and takes but what we can tell you is we are laser-focused on getting to the 8% target in 2023. And so we will manage into next year. These are the types of things we're seeing from a puts and takes standpoint strength, the tailwinds and headwinds. And we will manage that next year and will be on the path next year towards our 8% target in 2020.\nItay Michaeli: Great, that's super helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank.\nEmmanuel Rosner: Thank you very much and good evening. 2 questions please.\nJohn Lawler: Good evening.\nEmmanuel Rosner: Hi, two questions. The first one very pleased to see beyond target and for this 8% margins by 2023, big focus of the Company and clearly showing some progress there. How should we think about the impact on this from the margins on your electric vehicles? Obviously, the scale takes some time to build up, but Europe going through that right now, and probably has some level of visibility.  What are what's really leader thinking around trajectory for margins on some of your EVs, and to what extent you will, or will not impact overall Company margins, and potentially, how do we think about it beyond 2023?\nJim Farley: Thanks, such an important question for the Company. I'd like John to comment on the margins. Right now, we have 3 high-volume. Very well accepted battery electric vehicles on our hands. Mach-E, E-Transit and the F - F-150 Lightning. So the way we look at it is we want to grow this business really fast. Just the Mach-E demand itself we think is 200 thousand units that do not include the Lightning or the E-Transit.  Our first job is course post-job one customer experience improvement. Post-job one simplification and improvement of the cost vehicle and post-job one quality improvements using the data off the vehicles. Perhaps our biggest job in my opinion, is to break the constraints we have in manufacturing and our supply chain, so we can get these products out to these customers.  That post-job one orientation is quite different than how we historically looked at the ice business where we wait to a minor change or something later to make those changes. The constraint for Mach-E right now as batteries, we think we can break some of those constraints by working creatively with our China team and get our batteries from China. So stay tuned and I'll ask John to comment on the margins.\nJohn Lawler: As we talked about last quarter Mach-E is EBITDA profitable today, but we also know that the margins are not as strong as our ICE margins. And so we're working on that. Overtime we expect as we scale, as you said and as the technology costs come down, we will grow those margins and ultimately, we do expect with these connected vehicles is connected bands that the profit margins will be better than what we're seeing on ICE today but that's over time.\nEmmanuel Rosner: Thank you. And then my second question was on Argo. So [Indiscernible] you see that you would like to encourage them as supportive of accessing the public markets. How do you envisage the future relationship between Ford and our book to be how important and is that going to be as part of your overall business model?\nJim Farley: Mission critical for us to truly disrupt personal ownership. We have to democratize shared mobility. And the self-driving and mobility in the driven world are absolutely mission-critical for the Company and disruptive itself. I am really proud of the team's progress. It's different than our competitors in the space. We've gone to the most difficult miles in 4 or 5 different cities.  Our mapping, our SDS deployment, and the algorithms are built to be scaled for production deployment. So we're not going to a small market area and easy miles like others. We're taking on the toughest problems now and building our capability for scaling quickly. And I think that's always been our approach.  The relationship with Argo and us and Volkswagen is very close, but we do see us moving into more of a production mode now. And we're really ready for that. And we think this will take capital and little more time. and we think the access to public capital is really mission-critical for our journey.\nEmmanuel Rosner: Thank you.\nOperator: Final question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Jonas: I think explained as [Indiscernible] all this on in the [Indiscernible] the way you have. Right. So you get curious for that. You're saying some of the competitors, critical investments in the downstream to make up for that customer experience, Volkswagen buying your car, and some stocks including ones that you know pretty well.  Kind of part of it. Was there any gap in your strategy [Indiscernible] really [Indiscernible] is vertically integrate [Indiscernible] franchises [Indiscernible] suspicion given the change in [Indiscernible] tax.\nJim Farley: Great question. Our philosophy is different. We think partnerships on the demand layer for our autonomy and Priya autonomy is making critical for our always on strategy. Are there pieces missing that we're working really hard on [Indiscernible]? We're not going to talk about it today though.\nAdam Jonas: Alright [Indiscernible] that might be [Indiscernible] because [Indiscernible] with [Indiscernible] starting to see Candle GPU [Indiscernible]. We're big chunk of the price of got a question. Do you think there's [Indiscernible] that you can capture [Indiscernible] the consumer?\nJim Farley: Well, this is also really important. First of all, I would say the heart and soul of Ford strategy is our commercial business. And that business where vehicles are highly utilized. Our dealer network is one of our most important advantages versus the new competitors. I will give you some statistics.  We have 650 dedicated commercial, mostly service centers in the U.S. in 850 transit centers across Europe. So that will take a lot of time and a lot of money for someone to recreate. Every one of those dealers has multiple bodybuilders that can call design for those trades. And those vacation locations for our Ford vehicles.  So the dealer body is not only important for the after sales experience and making sure those vehicles can be serviced but it's also mission-critical for the outfit of those products. The dealer network is absolutely strategically critical for our leadership and maintaining that as we go to digital connected vehicles for our commercial customers.  There's no doubt that many customers want us 3 or 4 clicks very easy service experience on the retail side. We're working really carefully on that, including a simple e-commerce platform. And actually in China, our BEV business already has 25 direct stores by the end of this year. So we're starting to experiment.  I think our dealers and served us really well. I'm very proud of them. I'm especially proud of our commercial dealer and we're, we're very vigilant. You can imagine I get lots of e-mails every day about transaction prices from customers on our hottest products. And we all feel obligated to represent the brand professionally for our customers.\nAdam Jonas: Thanks, Jim.\nOperator: This concludes the Ford Motor Company's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call.

            "name": "Jim Farley",
            "content": "Thank you, Lynn. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Well, this month marks one year since we'd began executing our Ford Plus Plan. It creates growth, value, and it allows us to win in emerging area of electric and connected vehicles. We built a strong team that combines top leaders from Ford with world-class talent recruited from outside of our Company.  Specific talents, specific people that are largely outside of our industry. This leadership team is committed to this plan and we're accelerating our progress. Ford Plus is not a tagline. It's not advertising. It's a larger, more ambitious way to think about our business and how we bringing value to our customers.  We're creating iconic and distinctive products that only four can do. Increasingly, always on relationships with our customers and ever improving user experiences, all why creating value for our shareholders. We're fully invested in this future. And we're taking big swings. Key to the plan is harnessing the power of connectivity.  We're designing a new generation of fully networked vehicles not delegated to our supply chain, but done inside the Company to revolutionize the experience of owning and operating Ford vehicle. That's embedded technology to unleash unlimited innovation. We're scaling the number of vehicles capable of over-the-air updates will be moving from 1 million vehicles today to 33 million by 2028.  That scale. At the same time, we're moving aggressively to lead the electric vehicle revolution, substantially expanding our battery production as we speak today in the U.S. Infact, we already announced plans that will give us enough battery production to meet our mid-decade goal of a 141 gigawatts, which is enough to build more than 1 million battery electric vehicles a year and I think we'll need more.  R7 billion investments in Blue Oval city in Tennessee in the BlueOvalSK park in Kentucky sets a new standard for scale sustainability, advanced manufacturing, and training the next-generation of technology leaders. At the same time, the billion dollars of investment in our electrified center in Cologne, Germany will allow us to go all electric soon. That center will be all electric by 2023.  We're making final preparations to launch the F-150 Lightning. That defining 0 mission version of an America's best-selling vehicle for the past 40 plus years. Our all electric Mustang Mach-E is a hit with customers, not just in the U.S., but around the world, bringing a stunning number of new customers to the Ford brand.  Over 90% of the Mach-E owners say they would recommend a Mach-E to other customers. Critical as a new-generation of battery electric customers make new brand choices. Our challenge now is to break production constraints and increase availability to meet this incredible demand both in North America and in Europe, and also in China, the biggest EV market in the world. where we are just starting production and Mach-E.  We believe the global demand just for Mustang Mach-E could approach about 200,000 vehicles a year. We've created new organization, Ford Pro to change and power the future of work with compelling commercial vehicles, distribution, and services. While growing revenues to Ford. In a few weeks, we will start production of the new E-Transit, an electric version in the world's best-selling commercial van.  And in the third quarter alone, FORDLiive, Europe 's new connected uptime center, which I wish you could all see for our commercial customers, helps customers in the UK secure additional up time, preventing about $8 million of lost revenue and associated costs for our valuable customers.  We're reinventing icons like Bronco and creating new ones like Maverick. In fact, the all-new Maverick, 42 miles per gallon I might add, is the first standard hybrid pickup in the U.S. It's also America 's most fuel-efficient hybrid pickup. This is the strongest, most compelling lineup I'd ever seen from any mass market brand in my career.  And we are creating a spring loaded future as we emerge from the cheap shortages and COVID constraints. And we continue to make important strides in the technology and go-to-market strategy for autonomous vehicles. In the Second Quarter, we told you about a new partnership with Argo AI and Lyft. And then the Third Quarter, we announced a new partnership with Argo AI and Walmart.  This is Walmart's first ever multi-city autonomous delivery service. And it will be anchored in cities where we already have operations. Not the easiest miles in one city, but multiple cities and hard miles. In addition to making real progress on autonomy vehicles, operating domains, SDS, we fully support Argo AI 's aspiration to access public capital. To build this future, and generate the margins and cash flow.  We need to fund Ford Plus; we had a turn around our automotive operations, and improve our competitiveness. Our results in the third quarter show we are making significant progress. In fact, Company-wide, we achieved an 8.4% EBIT margin, including 10.1% in North America. Those margins, I will remind you are in line with our targets for 2023.  More importantly, our operations outside of North America are likely to post the best performance in 4 years. Please note the performance in South America, largely driven by our success of our global redesign. We've been able to achieve this while thoughtfully managing our supply chain for short-term sustainable improvements including semiconductors, and prioritizing high demand and high profit vehicles.  And before I turn it over to John, a few thoughts. I believe we have the right plan to drive growth and unlock unprecedented value. You are already seeing favorable change in the slope of our earnings and cash flow. There's more to come. Given the strength of our business this year, we are increasing our full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance to between 10.5 and 11.5 billion. As we plan in earnest for next year, we're excited and energized about the opportunity in front of us and clear that we have so much more work to do to deliver on fourth potential. The word I would leave you with is focus.  That competitive environment has never been more interesting and tough. And we intend to live up to our promise to compete like a challenger focusing on our top priorities to unlock Ford Plus growth with customers at the very center of everything we do. Now I will turn it over to John, who'll take you through our results for the quarter, our outlook for the full year, our capital allocation priorities, and our expectations heading into next year. John? $139,454 order. As of today. Yeah. It's the underlying strength of the business, John. And we're not capital constrained. We're able to fund our initiatives for growth. We know that there are going to be other opportunities that surface. We're confident that we can fund those. And we're focused on total shareholder returns. Not only stock appreciation, but also the dividend. And so given the strength of the business, the Board elected that we would restart the dividend this quarter. Thank you for your question. A lot of the product we've been working on for several years, we made the tough choices. I would say the answer is we have a plan; it's not an advertising peer taglines. It's our plan, everyone in the Company knows what we have to do. We are out of time. And we have focused. We need to get an 8% margin like we did this quarter as a Company, regularly because we have to fund a high-growth BEV and digital business.  It's not to make more money -- yes, it is that. But it's motivated in the mission of transforming Ford through these digital products. So running the ICE business for cash, getting serious about our cost, our quality, our launches, our 8% return. It's all a mission, and the team knows the plan and I think the culture is starting to change to be quicker, more accountability, less bureaucracy and that mission permeates through the Company.  I'm probably the worst person to ask whether something's changed, because it sure has changed for me, and my leadership team. But to me the proof is in the putting like our third quarter. And whether we really changed this Company will be proven out in our numbers over time, like to have the last year. If we make up our mind, and we come together as a team like we did on Maverick, it could be just 2 years. We did -- we knocked 20 months off the Maverick development, but it required the leadership team to not have the hand-wringing on the studio for 6 months, like we normally did. I think that's an improve point. But the question I ask myself is a little different.  When we see a technology change like this, like BEV, it's not just the speed of your product creation. It's can you be flexible and agile in your industrial system, like in manufacturing. We have 3 complete hits on our hands; a Mach-E with 200,000 units of demand, that's we have the Lightning with over a 160,000 orders and the transits completely sold out.  So how I like to think about it, it's not just a product creation speeding up the total Company. And we have to do our job to break constraints now, so that we can deliver hundreds of thousands of battery electric next year. That to me is the proof of our change, not just our faster product creation process works. Thank you so much for your question. I'll ask John to comment. From my view, the order bank model that we're going to in North America that we're in right now, has benefits across the patch. We are an incredibly complicated Company. And so, having an order bank allows us to push simplification into the order that the customer facing options, which we need to do. And a reduces costs and improves our quality.  Number 2, it eliminates the need for expensive conquest, fixed marketing. Number 3, it's incredibly helpful for industrial system. You cannot imagine Ryan how much money we waste by guessing what our launch mix is for new product. When you have an order bank special for new models. You could capacitize the high series mixes that are very profitable, right in line with customer demand.  So it's incredibly cost-effective. And it allows you to address the long tail revenues that we've lost in the past because of our undrawn ground stock model. And the last one is its lower cost. There is less parts hanging around. We can manage our industrial system and our manufacturing and a leaner way.  The question really is how we maintain it as you said, is the market improves and the way we are looking at that. Is not just having a day supply target in the past that we've managed, but actually putting in the infrastructure to maintain, or prefer an order-based system. That means we train our system to put in orders.  We reward people for putting in orders. We dynamically price for customers so that they are incentivized to keep ordering versus buying off the lot. So it's going to be a journey. It's been a very rewarding one so far. And we're just beginning. This is the model we have to go through as most of our business are -- majority of our business goes battery electric and digital. It's the right loyalty model. The move to a digital product means we have to go to a 100% loyalty model. So the reason why you're seeing us launch battery electrics early is very simple. It's our Super Bollard. Our new Super Bollard, or new Detroit Motor Show is our reveal. because there's starts the clock on reservations and you have to do it early enough so you are industrial system gets informed by the results of your reservation. That's the closed loop that has to happen.  We need to open it early enough so that our industrial system can react to the orders and we don't waste money and take advantage of long tail revenue. And it's a more controlled environment than a broadcast media advertising on the Super Bowl. So we're gonna continue to work and focus on improving our business, right? Our target is to have an investment-grade Balance Sheet, but that's going to come by improving the business, and you're seeing the strength of that come through. And so, that's what we're focused on. What the rating agencies to -- decide to do with our rating, they'll manage that.  That's up to them. What we're laser-focused on is improving the run rate of the business, improving our performance, improving our overall metrics, and eventually, the rating agencies and the ratings will take care of themselves. So I think we have a really good, profitable fleet business around the world. We look at the margins very carefully, but it's strategically very important for the Company to be a reliable partner. Well, John, I think you should you should answer that one in terms of how we revenue manage in a constrained environment. In the Escape business, we now have another player called Bronco Sport, in a segment. It's incredibly profitable and people really appreciate the product. We're know in the business of commodity products in that segment anymore, we changed, we made investments several years ago. Well, I think we're in good shape for now. Obviously the acceleration of the BEV business, and our ICE assets will be, I think the next big transition for the whole industry, not just Ford. But Ford specifically, India's really the principal region country where we have struggled over time.  And it's really great to see the progress the team is making in India and the very vibrant position will now have with the new lineup. And I'd just like to highlight the progress in North America for this quarter. John when's last time we were profitable in South America? So let -- let's hang that in the air for 2013. Great. Thank you. We're shipping with marquee F-Series now BlueCruise as they leave the factory and we're going to be OTA in BlueCruise in the first quarter. We wanted to improve the customer experience, so we've pushed it back in terms of an OTA because we wanted to be much simpler for the customer than was originally planned and that takes a little planning to consolidate. Often these level 2 systems require multiple updates in the car. We wanted to be very simple that took a little bit more work on our team's part, and so it's available. as we ship products now and as in OTA, it'll be in the first quarter and it will be a lot simpler to use. And get that OTA and update for the customer than it was originally planned. Does that answer your question? Thanks, such an important question for the Company. I'd like John to comment on the margins. Right now, we have 3 high-volume. Very well accepted battery electric vehicles on our hands. Mach-E, E-Transit and the F - F-150 Lightning. So the way we look at it is we want to grow this business really fast. Just the Mach-E demand itself we think is 200 thousand units that do not include the Lightning or the E-Transit.  Our first job is course post-job one customer experience improvement. Post-job one simplification and improvement of the cost vehicle and post-job one quality improvements using the data off the vehicles. Perhaps our biggest job in my opinion, is to break the constraints we have in manufacturing and our supply chain, so we can get these products out to these customers.  That post-job one orientation is quite different than how we historically looked at the ice business where we wait to a minor change or something later to make those changes. The constraint for Mach-E right now as batteries, we think we can break some of those constraints by working creatively with our China team and get our batteries from China. So stay tuned and I'll ask John to comment on the margins. Mission critical for us to truly disrupt personal ownership. We have to democratize shared mobility. And the self-driving and mobility in the driven world are absolutely mission-critical for the Company and disruptive itself. I am really proud of the team's progress. It's different than our competitors in the space. We've gone to the most difficult miles in 4 or 5 different cities.  Our mapping, our SDS deployment, and the algorithms are built to be scaled for production deployment. So we're not going to a small market area and easy miles like others. We're taking on the toughest problems now and building our capability for scaling quickly. And I think that's always been our approach.  The relationship with Argo and us and Volkswagen is very close, but we do see us moving into more of a production mode now. And we're really ready for that. And we think this will take capital and little more time. and we think the access to public capital is really mission-critical for our journey. Great question. Our philosophy is different. We think partnerships on the demand layer for our autonomy and Priya autonomy is making critical for our always on strategy. Are there pieces missing that we're working really hard on [Indiscernible]? We're not going to talk about it today though. Well, this is also really important. First of all, I would say the heart and soul of Ford strategy is our commercial business. And that business where vehicles are highly utilized. Our dealer network is one of our most important advantages versus the new competitors. I will give you some statistics.  We have 650 dedicated commercial, mostly service centers in the U.S. in 850 transit centers across Europe. So that will take a lot of time and a lot of money for someone to recreate. Every one of those dealers has multiple bodybuilders that can call design for those trades. And those vacation locations for our Ford vehicles.  So the dealer body is not only important for the after sales experience and making sure those vehicles can be serviced but it's also mission-critical for the outfit of those products. The dealer network is absolutely strategically critical for our leadership and maintaining that as we go to digital connected vehicles for our commercial customers.  There's no doubt that many customers want us 3 or 4 clicks very easy service experience on the retail side. We're working really carefully on that, including a simple e-commerce platform. And actually in China, our BEV business already has 25 direct stores by the end of this year. So we're starting to experiment.  I think our dealers and served us really well. I'm very proud of them. I'm especially proud of our commercial dealer and we're, we're very vigilant. You can imagine I get lots of e-mails every day about transaction prices from customers on our hottest products. And we all feel obligated to represent the brand professionally for our customers."

            "name": "John Lawler",
            "content": "Thank you, Jim. Now in the face of continued industry-wide semiconductor constraints, we stayed focused on our plan, strengthening our portfolio, and investing in opportunities fundamental to growth and value creation. We delivered a solid quarter with 3 billion in adjusted Company EBITDA, and a margin of 8.4%. Free cash flow of 7.7 billion was as we expected up sharply on a sequential basis, driven by the positive working capital effects, from higher wholesales in EBITDA. We ended the quarter with strong cash and liquidity at over 31 billion and 47 billion respectively. Now across our automotive business, our playbook remained consistent as we optimize production for customer orders, new launches, and our most profitable vehicles.  And as expected on a sequential basis, our wholesales improved dramatically its chip supply for Ford improved. We also remained disciplined with incentive spending and mix management, which on a year-over-year basis, more than offset chip-related declines in volume. Ford Credit delivered another solid quarter with 1.1 billion in EBT as auction values continue to remain strong, and credit losses continue at near record lows.  For the fourth Quarter, we're assuming a sequential increase in wholesale. We also expect continued healthy mix and net pricing and solid results from Ford Credit, although not as strong as the Third Quarter. Headwinds include inflationary impacts on commodities and freight, and we also expect plan sequential increases in our Ford Plus modernization investments, including customer experience and IT.  So let me share with you some highlights from the quarter before I turn to guidance, capital allocation, in our preliminary view of 2022. With improved chips supply, North America wholesales increased sequentially by 67% as the team prioritized launches, customer orders, and high-margin units while reducing the number of vehicles built, but waiting for chips.  Demand remains strong for our exciting vehicles. The order bank we are building paid off in the third quarter, representing 28% of our retail sales in the third quarter, and reaching a high of 31% in September. And our overall customer orders increased over 50% from the Second Quarter to more than a 100,000 orders, excluding Bronco.  With the 10.1% EBITDA margin in the quarter, North America is now at a 9% margin year-to-date, just 100 basis points shy of our 2023 target of 10%. South America, marked its eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in EBITDA, and the business run rate is now approaching break even.  The region also launched its new commercial vehicle organization with the introduction of the new transit, which is manufactured in Uruguay. This transit is the first light commercial van to market in Brazil that includes connectivity as a standard feature. In Europe, the underlying trajectory of our business continues to strengthen though the adverse impact from chips has masked this improvement.  In the Third Quarter, the business lost about 50,000 units, which would have had a substantial favorable impact on EBITDA. Our leadership, as the number one commercial vehicle brand continued in the quarter along with an extremely robust quarter bank. In China, Lincoln continues to perform well, extending its success in the most profitable segment, luxury, with retail sales up 24% year-over-year.  In fact, Lincoln has doubled its share of the China luxury market over the past 18 months. Our newly created BEV organization to open its first 13 direct-to-consumer Ford -select city stores, with a total of 25 expected to open by year-end. In IMG, our leadership team in India made the difficult decision to end manufacturing; following accumulated operating losses of more than 2 billion over the past 10 years.  Going forward, we will focus on importing iconic vehicles, including EVs. And overall, IMG had a solid quarter, capitalizing on our strengths, including ranger. Now as Jim highlighted, the underlying strength of our business supports increasing our adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2021 to between $10.5 and $11.5 billion. And that's despite a lower than anticipated improvement in cheap availability in the second half of the year.  Consistent with our adjusted EBITDA guidance three this year, our updated guidance for 2021 includes the $900 million non-cash gain on our investment in Rivian in our First Quarter adjusted results. So let me spend a minute on Rivian. Now, in the event that Rivian completes its IPO, we will record any gain on our investment in any subsequent adjustments of special items.  Accordingly, we will recast the 900 million non-cash gain from adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter to a special [Indiscernible] As Rivian completes their IPO in the fourth quarter, we will make this change when we report our fourth quarter earnings on February 3, 2022. Our guidance for 2021 adjusted free cash flow is unchanged at 4 to 5 billion, reflecting the higher EBITDA, but less favorable improvement in working capital and timing differences.  Now this is due to lower than anticipated volumes than previously assumed in the back half of the quarter, and that's as a result of chip constraints. We do expect free cash flow to increase with higher production, and the associated improvement in supplier payables and other timing differences. Now let me turn to capital allocation, which again is the foundation of our value creation framework.  Our capital allocation discipline is driving a strong core business and Balance Sheet that provides the flexibility to invest in new growth opportunities as we deliver our Ford Plus plan. Ultimately, and ensures we returned value to our shareholders, both in the form of a higher share price and dividends. Today, we announced the reinstatement of our dividend.  Our board has approved restarting of regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share in the fourth quarter of 2021. Importantly, the dividend reflects our confidence in the improving run rate of the business and our ability to fund all of our calls on capital, including the growing investment in electrification and the trajectory of our Ford Plus plan.  The dividend was also sized to ensure we maintain appropriate optionality to manage continued uncertainties in the external environment. To give you a better sense of our calls on capital between 2020 and 2025, we expect total capital expenditures of about 40-45 billion or run rate of roughly $7 billion per year. Over the same time, we expect to invest over $30 billion in BEV. And above the investment in BEV that's about 50% is CAPEX, 25% is expense, and 25% is direct investments. And these numbers, they'll be dynamic, and we are confident we have ample financial flexibility to increase our investments even if BEV adoption further accelerates.  And I'll let me share with you our early thinking about 2022, a year which like this one is likely to experience some industry crosswinds that could drive a range of outcomes that we typically don't talk about the upcoming year this soon. And we're not yet prepared to give financial guidance, but we do want to share how we're thinking about next year, given the dynamic operating environment.  Ford's underlying strengths give me great confidence we can build on our results in 2021. First, our portfolio of products and services is exceptional. And we have a significant amount of new product coming to market spanning our iconic high-volume nameplate. Second, our industrial base gives us significant optionality as the adoption of electric vehicles accelerates.  Third, driven by the chip shortage of roughly 4 million in wholesales, we are likely to deliver this year fall significantly below our capacity. And based on our current assessment, we believe our wholesales to be up about 10% in 2022, but that number is very dynamic and changes almost weekly. And fourth, the effects of our global redesign, which is largely completed, are now evident and substantial.  We have drastically de -risked and rationalized our global footprint and product lineup, vastly improving our earnings and cash generation power in the process. Now for headwinds next year, it's difficult to predict the interplay between semiconductor-related constraints, volume and pricing and this will continue to remain dynamic.  For 2021, we expect commodities to be up 3 to 3.5 billion and they could be up another 1.5 billion in 2022, largely driven by steel and aluminum similar to this year. There will also likely be other inflationary costs, but it's too early to size that right now. Ford Credit is likely to be lower as strong auction values will be moderated by a smaller inventory of vehicles and lower lease end return rates.  And lastly, we're obviously going to continue to invest in our Ford Plus Plan for growth and value creation. And this includes in customer-facing technology, connectivity, and our always on relationships with customers, and electrification. And, of course, we believe long-term payback from those investments will be substantial.  Now that wraps up our prepared remarks. And if you perceive that the upfront portion of these calls is becoming more efficient, well, you're right. And that's a function of us being very specific with you and our team about what's truly important, and our confidence in executing effectively against those things and reporting accordingly will use the balance of the time here and address what's on your mind. Thank you. Yeah, so if you look at where we ended in September, we ended at about 20 days' supply in the U.S. and we're watching it very closely from a day supply standpoint. In -- as we talked about last quarter, in our historical base supply was somewhere around 75 days. We're not going back there.  As Jim said, we're going to be very disciplined and we expect to be in the 50 days' supply when we're fully at full capacity and we're running and producing everything that we can, so that's gonna be the key. The other thing I would say, John, is that the move as we talked about in our remarks to having more of our sales come through orders, unlike orders in the order bank.  That's really important for us to manage our day supply. So it's a less of a scrounge stock push through and its customer demand pull-through based on the orders and we had over a 100,000 orders at the end of the quarter and that's grown since then in our order bank and that play well for us in the third quarter. As of -- as of today. Yeah. So from the magnesium standpoint, when we look at that, we are seeing price pressure on aluminum broadly, we saw that all year and probably see a little bit more price pressure due to the magnesium issue, but our sheet metal suppliers -- our sheet aluminum suppliers don't purchase magnesium from China for North American production. So we don't see that having any significant impact or any impact on us.  We do see the chip issue continuing to run through 22, as we said, it's very dynamic. Right now, if you ask us what we think the sequential increase in supply will be year-over-year, we think we will have about 10% more, but that's changing weekly.  And we're doing everything we can to get our hands on as many chips as we can. But we do see that running through 2022, it could extend into 2023, although we do anticipate the scope and severity of that to reduce as we move through 22 into 23. Yeah, Rod. We'll start to see those come in as we get into 22 and then they'll feather in to 23 as we continue to ramp our investments in our plan, our priorities. Not only in the products, the BEv's, but also as we're building out our customer facing technologies, our connectivity, etc. So yeah, you will see that start to come in on a year-over-year basis next year and it will continue into 23. Not -- I'm not ready to do that today for '22 and going in through '23. We're completely targeted on getting to that 8% in 2023, so we'll manage it within that. But today, I'm not ready to talk in that level of detail about. Right. I think what you'll find is that as you look through 2022, the first half will have less supply than through the second half. And as I said earlier, we see this mitigating over time. It may extend into 2023. But I would say that we should be back up and running based on what we're seeing today, our run rate, the end of next year into '23. And then in 2023, we'd start to rebuild our inventories.  But it's dynamic, Rod, and it's hard to make a pinpoint call at this point in time. But we wanted to share with you what we're seeing is that -- we're seeing about 10% for next year, and we see that the chip constraints is going to still...[Indiscernible] going to still be at [Indiscernible]. So we have to keep managing as we are this year. So it's interesting because I remember those days when Don probably made that comment about rental fleets and that they were low margin, etc. I think what you're finding is business models are changing and the fleet business is evolving just like everything else in our industry. And we see that there could potentially be a positive fleet business where there could make good money.  And so we're not going to shy away from that if we see that its right for our brand and we think is right for the bottom line. And so we're going to continue to look at fleets differently and we're going to continue to think about vehicles as-a-service and what that potential holds for us is that business model changes and we'll see where that takes us. But we're not going to go back to the times where we're putting in capacity; we're pumping out unit, selling them at little to no margin for rental cars. That's not going to happen again. It's okay, I was just going to see our fleet business now. Now that we've rationalized the Company, our fleet business is very strategic for us. It's also very profitable. It certainly varies in Europe, and North America, and China. Different fleet segments have different profitability. The one thing I would ask you to think about is that most of fleet that matters at Ford is commercial vehicles.  And the most important commercial vehicles for us are small, medium-sized businesses. And those are very profitable business for us, for transit, for super duty. That's where Ford excels in the fleet business. And it's smaller fleets, it's not big fleet sales. So the texture of this is that we're revenue managing the Company very carefully.  We know the margins by geography, even within the country and we know by distribution channel. So this is a very thoughtful approach for us, but strategically, especially because of the Pro business and its profitability, we want to make sure we have where reliable partner with fleet customers.  They do business with companies that are reliable, that don't come in and out of the market, they do business with companies that have a full range of products, a full range of services. That's why Marion is investing in Ford Pro, and why we're vertically integrating our services. Yeah. So as you would expect, we're very conscientious about the dynamic of the supply and demand and the impact that has on the pricing and we look at this on a daily basis managing our incentives, looking at if we should be taking top-line pricing given the inflationary pressures we're seeing.  As we talked about, we're not going to go back to the old habits of loading of the dealers with stock and then looking through the push through for sales, were going to focus more on orders coming through online. Specific orders to customers being satisfied, understanding what their demands are, simplifying the system.  And with all of that, we expect to retain quite a bit of a price. Now will it mitigate as we go through next year as supply and demand comes more in Bell and in '23? Yes. But our job is going to be to manage that and retain as much pricing as we can. And while providing customers good value for those products. So it's something that we look at very closely on a daily basis. Yeah, Colin, that's a great question. Thank you. Now, we did say last quarter that we expected the second half to be up about 30% looks like it's going to be up somewhere around 15%. And so what you're seeing flow-through is the strength we had in the quarter relative to the top line and other actions that we took relative to cost, etc.  So when you look at that walk, that bridge between Q3 to Q4, we expect market factors to be positive. We also said, we think volume is going to be up sequentially about 10% and also see a little bit stronger, stronger mix continuing, and then of course you'll have some product-related costs, production-related costs associated with that.  But net -- net market factors, net of those costs to produce the increased volumes is going to be positive. We're seeing from a headwind standpoint, if you look at Q3 to Q4 our commodities, we expect that on a quarter-over-quarter basis, they are going to be up about $700 million. And if you look at that so far, year-to-date, we've seen about $1.6 billion of commodities hit us. When you get to the Fourth Quarter.  You can get the Cumulus factor that on a year-over-year basis, commodities are going to be up about another billion five in the Fourth Quarter. Year-over-year up a billion five sequentially, up $700 million.  And then we are going to see some higher warranty costs on a sequential basis in the Fourth Quarter for things that we have to take care of around extended warranties and a little bit higher coverages. But again, on a year-over-year basis, our warranty will improve in the fourth quarter. In full-year, on a year-over-year basis, our warranty, we expect to be good by about a billion for. So does that help you with the bridge? I believe it was 2013. Yeah. So what we're seeing there is that we've got the EBITDA coming in, right that improvement, but the less favorable improvement in working capital and timing differences hitting us in the quarter. Because we have lower than anticipated volume in the back half of the quarter due to the chip constraints, and so we get with that working capital at the end of the year. So that's what's happening to us on the free cash flow, so it's a timing issue. So of the 30 billion, when you look at the cap, very little. We said about half of that was cap. Very little of that has been spent through 2021 relative to the 13 to 15 billion, about half of it. Of course, you're going to see the expense front-loaded because that's primarily be engineering that we have in developing the battery electric vehicles.  And then the direct investment, which is about 25% of it bats with things like the virtual go integration of J.D. and those types of things. And you saw those announcements this quarter with our plan in BlueOvalSK, the battery plans. That's how we're going to unfold that bad spending over time. Yeah so we're not going to give a number at this point and say, but what we're saying is that the strength of our new product lineup, our high-volume nameplates like in the strength of what we're seeing Rod Lache, as Jim said, we think there's about demand for 200,000 units. We've got the Bronco, Maverick, E-Transit, and F-150 Lightning is coming.  It's the best lineup that we had, and so that's going to be a tailwind for us for sure as we go into next year. You're seeing that come through this year, and we're going to build on that. But we're also going to have to manage the headwinds that we've talked about.  And the other puts and takes but what we can tell you is we are laser-focused on getting to the 8% target in 2023. And so we will manage into next year. These are the types of things we're seeing from a puts and takes standpoint strength, the tailwinds and headwinds. And we will manage that next year and will be on the path next year towards our 8% target in 2020. Good evening. As we talked about last quarter Mach-E is EBITDA profitable today, but we also know that the margins are not as strong as our ICE margins. And so we're working on that. Overtime we expect as we scale, as you said and as the technology costs come down, we will grow those margins and ultimately, we do expect with these connected vehicles is connected bands that the profit margins will be better than what we're seeing on ICE today but that's over time."

Now, I will turn the call over to Jim Farley.\nJim Farley: Thank you, Lynn. Hello, everyone. And thanks for joining us today. Early in the second quarter, 2 months ago, we detailed our strategy for the future Ford. Put simply, our Ford Plus plan is focused on 2 things, really distinctive products that only Ford could do and an always-on relationship and experience for our customers that gets better and better over time. We're building on our foundational strengths, our iconic products, the uniquely appealing vehicles, our manufacturing excellence, and the industry's best captive finance company. But we're now adding new capabilities and new talents, and we're investing in new businesses that will accelerate our value we create for customers and our investors. We're committed to delivering a richer experience for our Ford and Lincoln customers, one that improves over time with things like our over-the-air software upgrades, data-driven experiences, productivity and uptime services for our critical commercial customers, charging software, and a lot more. Ford Plus also means introducing the industry's most compelling, high-volume, electric vehicle line-up and investing the capital and human resources required to design and build world-class batteries and electric powertrain components. And with Argo AI, we're well-positioned to launch an autonomous people and goods delivery business with significant future growth potential. But fundamental to transforming forward is to further strengthen our auto operations while we're also expanding our addressable market. Our commitment is to earn your confidence with strong execution quarter-after-quarter, year-after-year, delivering solid returns regardless of the challenges that we face with external environment like we did in the second quarter. Despite the many headwinds from the semiconductor shortage, some of which were unique to Ford, our teams skillfully managed our business and we generated a positive EBIT. And I can tell you that this outcome was far from certain at the beginning of the quarter. It required intense focus from our team, on cost, pricing and mix. The primary advantage we have right now is the strength of our product portfolio. And it's about to get a lot stronger. We stopped making me too products in declining segments few years ago. And we unleashed our product development team to create emotional and distinctive products that only can come from Ford. The Mustang Mach-E, which is already the second best-selling electric SUV in the U.S., was recently named Car and Driver Electric Vehicle of the Year after rigorous testing against 10 other great EVs, including the Tesla Model Y Performance, the Porsche Taycan, and the Audi e-tron. The demand for our first round of high-volume EVs clearly has exceeded our most optimistic projections. The reservations for the F-150 Lightning have now climbed well past a 120,000 units. And 75% of those customers are new to Ford. We're now working around the clock to break constraints and increase our manufacturing capacity for these red hot new battery electric vehicles. We're working with LG Chem, SKI Innovation to increase our annual battery capacity for the Mustang Mach-E by 70%. And we're taking similar actions ahead of the launches of E-Transit later this year and the F-150 Lightning early next year. The customer and critical reception to our new Bronco lineup has also been remarkable. In June, we started shipments to fulfill 125,000 orders we have for Bronco II and four-door models. And 70% of those Bronco customers are also new to Ford. And then there's the Maverick, our upcoming hybrid pickup, that offers room for five, gets 40 miles per gallon in the city and is priced starting at less than $20,000, and customer already recognize the value of this product and the initial interest to our dealers is more than almost 80,000 orders. Great products alone are not sufficient, though, to deliver Ford Plus. Always on means, we are regularly interacting with our customers on things large and small, and we're building new capabilities, like connected services, to enrich the customer experience and drive reoccurring revenue streams. We developed a proprietary software and hardware stack we called Blue Oval Intelligence to deliver updates to customers' vehicles over the year. Some of our competitors can do it for their entertainment systems, we do it for almost all of our modules in the vehicle. For example, the Mustang Mach-E activation rates, the number of customers who opt in to Connected services like FordPass, are now over 95%. We have now updated more than 150,000 vehicles over-the-air just this year. And we expect this to top 600,000 vehicles by year-end. And by 2028, we will have 33 million OTA capability vehicles on the road around the world. And we are mining the real-world data from these vehicles real-time to better meet our customer needs. To me, this is the most important point. For example, driven by the vehicle data from the Mustang Mach-E and the F-150 already, we've identified $50 million in efficiencies just from warranty cost avoidance and other opportunities. We're also building out our global Ford Pro commercial business, which we expect to grow from 45 billion in 2025, from 27 billion in 2019. Last month, we announced our acquisition of Electriphi to help accelerate electric vehicle fleet adoption. By offering those customers the best-scaled depot charging experience for all commercial customers. It's an example of how we're building out Ford Pro now. In mobility, we are now focused on planning and executing a phased deployment of AVs that will lead to large scale commercialization of Ford's AVs. Last week, as you've seen, we reached the industry first collaboration between Argo and Lyft, to deploy Ford Driverless Vehicles on the Lyft TNC network. This collaboration will enable commercial deployment at scale and demonstrate Ford and Argo 's ability to connect into multiple TNCs or transportation networks. And on the technology front, Argo, I'm really excited about this, introduced Argo Lidar, which will help us expand our autonomous services beyond the dense urban areas that most are focused on. This new lidar designed to be cost effective and manufacturing at scale will offer what we believe is the industry's longest distance sensing range of 400 meters with dark object detection for safe highway driving. Now, before John reports on the quarter, and our expectations for the rest of the year, let me give you an update on the semiconductor situation. In April, we said we'd expect to lose about 50% of our planned volume in the second quarter, which then implied a loss in adjusted EBIT . In fact, we did better than expected. We leveraged the strong demand to optimize our revenue and profits. We're seeing signs of improvement in the flow of chips now in the third quarter, but the situation remains fluid, especially due to the delay in ramp up of one of our key suppliers, Renesas, that Ford is uniquely exposed to in the first half. Overall, after effectively managing through the first half, we are now spring-loaded for growth in the second half and beyond because of those red-hot products, pent-up demand, and improving chip supply. Navigating these chip constraints has led us to make important permanent changes in our business model at Ford. We are modernizing our go-to-market strategy. What does that mean? We're placing greater emphasis on build-to-order sales bank, not just low stocks. We have learned that, yes, operating with fewer vehicles on lots is not only possible, but it's better for customers, dealers, and Ford. But we're also driving a significant increase in the number of customers configuring and ordering their vehicles online. So we have better visibility to real demand using an order bank. This allows us to lower inventories, simplify our incentives, and reduce our order complexity in the industrial systems cost. For our customers, upside is that they more quickly get the precise vehicle they want. Now, this isn't theoretical. I hope we get into the Q&A. We're doing it right now as we speak. Relative to the supply chain, we made 3 notable changes. First, we are no longer relying heavily on a tier-procurement structure for transparency. We are now engaging directly, for example, with the fabs on semiconductors and key points in supply chain for critical components, electronic components. With closer relationships and more transparent exchange of information, such as technology roadmaps, we can integrate their know-how into our designs to better align supply and demand. Second, we're providing longer-term forecast to critical vendors so they can better understand and accommodate our requirements. And third, we are more comprehensively scanning for obstacles in our supply chain. Risk mitigation actions include stockpiling of critical parts like semis, dual sourcing and design interchangeability in the case of single sources. These changes are all being applied to new technologies as well, including batteries, which are rapidly becoming a larger portion of our bill of material at Ford. Our pending joint venture with SK Innovation, called BlueOvalSK, will produce EV battery cells and arrays, helping us secure supplies of batteries at competitive cost and performance levels really critical given our demand for our new electric vehicles. And now I'd like to turn over to John to take us through the results for the quarter and our outlook.\nJohn Lawler: Thank you, Jim. So first I want to reiterate that everything we do and every decision we're making, including capital allocation, it's squarely focused on delivering our Ford Plus plan. And you'll see that as I share our key takeaways from the quarter, our full-year outlook, and describe how we're positioned for even stronger performance heading into 2022. And as Jim said, we delivered better-than-expected results, given the semiconductor constraints. Year-over-year, our automotive business improved across several key financial metrics as we overlap the industry-wide COVID-related manufacturing shutdowns we saw in the second quarter of last year. Now, for a more accurate picture of our true trajectory in this present environment, we're focusing more on sequential comparison, and we think those are more appropriate. While wholesales were down 28% sequentially, our teams optimized from revenue and profit with disciplined incentive spending and mix management. We allocated chips to customer orders, new launches, and our more profitable vehicles. In addition, the strength of our sales order bank gives us confidence in our ability to drive a more balanced performance of wholesales, revenue, and profit in the second half of this year, including sequential improvement in wholesales and share. So let's turn to our results. On a consolidated basis, wholesales and revenue were up 18% and 38% year-over-year respectively, and we delivered adjusted EBIT of 1.1 billion with adjusted margin of 4%. Outside of North America, our underlying trajectory continues to improve despite the impact of the semiconductors and that's driven by more focused product portfolios, geographic footprint, as well as, lower costs. And Ford Credit continued to deliver strong performance with record quarterly EBT of 1.6 billion. And that's demonstrating why it's a strategic asset and critical to enabling Ford Plus. And a prime example is through the launch of a new service like Ford Pro FinSimple, which provides bundled financing for commercial vehicles, services and EV charging. And so it's another example of Ford Credit being a strategic weapon for us.  Now, turning to the regions. North America posted a 40% sequential decline in wholesale due to the semiconductor shortage. Now, as we managed the chip constraints, we focused our efforts on customer or customers ordering vehicles for future delivery. We exited the second quarter with our U.S. customer sold order bank up more than seven times compared to a year ago. And with new models to come, we are clearly poised for a rebound in North America when the semiconductor supply stabilizes and aligns with demand. On a year-over-year basis, EBIT was up 1.1 billion. Outside of North America, the turnaround of our operations remains on track. In aggregate, EBIT improved 800 million year-over-year, but declined sequentially, mainly driven by Europe, where the semiconductor shortage caused wholesale units to drop sequentially by nearly 35%. The transformation in Europe continues as the region capitalizes on strength in commercial vehicles with Ford Pro, and a more focused passenger portfolio, including key imports. Europe has stepped up investments in electrification, including 1 billion for a new EV manufacturing center in Cologne, the launch of our E-Transit next spring, and a new all-electric light commercial vehicle from Romania. In South America, our restructuring is on track. Our lean de-risked and asset-light business model is focused on our strengths with ranger, transit and key imported vehicles. The region introduced Bronco Sport and Mustang Mach-1 I in selected markets, and is preparing now for the launch of the new transit van in the second half of this year. In China, we continue to see improvement in key areas of focus, including Lincoln, commercial vehicles, electric vehicles, and with our portfolio of near premium Ford vehicles. Lincoln attained its highest ever quarterly sales, was profitable, and also captured the number 1 spot in J.D. Power's luxury sales satisfaction ranking. unseating Audi, which had held the position for 11 years. In addition, 97% of Lincoln's volume is now produced locally, and commercial vehicles now account for 52% of overall sales mix in China. And finally, we are readying for the launch of the localized Mustang Mach-E later this year. Our international markets group, we delivered another solid quarter, leveraging its portfolio strengths with Ranger pickups and Everest SUV. And we're continuing to assess our business in India and we'll have more to say on this later this year. Company-wide second quarter adjusted free cash flow was negative 5.1 billion. As expected, semiconductor-related volume losses had a greater impact on the free cash flow than EBIT because of adverse working capital and timing differences related to customer allowances from marketing incentives. Ford Credit did provide a partial offset with distributions of 4 billion in the quarter. Now, we expect working capital and these timing differences to normalize over time as the semiconductor supply is restored. Cash and liquidity remained very strong, ending the quarter at 25.1 billion and 41 billion respectively. The strength of our balance sheet provides significant financial flexibility to navigate periods of stress, while also continuing to invest in growth in our Ford Plus plan. So now let's turn to the outlook. Based on the underlying strength of our business and present assessment of the semiconductor supplies through the second half, along with other factors, we have increased our outlook for full-year adjusted EBIT to between $9 billion to $10 billion. Now this assumes about a 30% sequential increase in volume in our second half versus our first half, which is supported by the anticipated improvement in the supply of semiconductors. Our guidance implies we expect second-half adjusted EBIT to be lower than the first half of the year. And so we provided a bridge to help with this. And we've included that on page 19 of our earnings presentation. So let me provide a little bit of color around this. Relative to tailwinds, we expect about 3 to 4 billion in favorable market factors and that of an increase in volume-related production costs for the higher volumes. Headwinds, right? We see headwinds coming through and we see pressure on contribution margin. We expect commodities to be up almost $2 billion, half-over-half. Warranty costs are expected to be higher in the second half up about 500 million that we still expect full-year warranty expense to be down year-over-year. Relative to structural costs, about 1.5 billion in investments in modernization, consistent with what we laid out in May, including customer experiences, connectivity, IT, new product launches. Looking at Ford Credit. Based on current market dynamics, we expect Ford Credit to decline by about 1 billion as auction values begin to normalize and we also have a non-repeat of reserve releases that we had in the first half. And lastly, we also have the non-recurrence of the 900 million non-cash gain [Indiscernible] we booked in the first quarter. And it's important to note that this gain also impacts our run rate heading into 2022. We are also increasing our full-year adjusted free cash flow target to 4 to 5 billion, supported by expected favorable working capital in the second half as production increases from an anticipated improvement and chip availability. Now, as our operating results improve, so those are cash conversion, which we continue to target in the range of 50% to 60%, and the strengthened cash conversion in our balance sheet provides us ample financial flexibility to invest in growth, including in EVs; Ford Pro, our connected services and mobility. And looking towards 2022, we are confident in the underlying trajectory of our business and excited to see the momentum continue as we leveraged one of the strongest product lineups in our history and continue to implement our Ford Plus plan. We're on a new path at Ford. We got a plan, the resources, and the result to build a better business. So now, I'll hand it over to the operator to open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brian Johnson, Barclays.\nBrian Johnson: I got a couple of questions. First, a little bit of housekeeping. but just thinking ahead to '22. If we take the second half exit rate of 3.5 billion, but also bear in mind that your first half is typically the stronger half of the year for Ford, is there any read through for 2022?\nJohn Lawler: Hi, Brian. Thanks. Yeah. I think the way we see it is that we've got strength in the underlying performance of our business. As we head into 2022, we also know that the product lineup is going to get stronger, right? We're just launching Bronco now. We've got F-150 Lightning next year. We have Maverick next year. And we also expect that we should get to more of a full line rate on our manufacturing of all our other vehicles in new vehicles that we've had this year. So we do see strength in the product line heading into next year. But what we also see heading into next year are a few headwinds. Ford Credit, we expect that to be more normalized to our run rate that we normally see, and that's because we see auction values coming down. And then we shouldn't -- we should see our credit reserves and our credit losses normalize as well. We also see that next year as volumes increase and stocks increase across the industry, we should see some pricing moderation. Again, we also see commodities being higher next year as well. And we're going to continue to invest in our new product portfolios. We've got the launches coming in next year. We've got our Ford Plus plan. So we see that continuing as we head into next year as well. So, there are some headwinds, but the underlying strength of the business continues to be positive. And with that, we see that trajectory continuing into 22 and then on our way to the 8% EBIT margin for 23.\nBrian Johnson: Okay. And just a follow up, 1.5 billion 2H headwind from investments in modernization, is that something new that was planned for this year, but maybe back-end loaded due to management focusing on the chip shortage or how do you think about that?\nJohn Lawler: Well, that was planned, that's coming in. Part of that's due to the launches of the vehicle; with the launch costs comes advertising. But we're also investing in connectivity, the IT we need to put in place for the connectivity, as well as, customer experiences, digital experiences, user experiences with the vehicle. So we're continuing to invest to build out our Ford Plus plan.\nJim Farley: And we're not slowing down our modernization because of the chip situation; in fact, we're doing the opposite.\nBrian Johnson: Okay. And a question for Jim. As you look at the order book for the F-150 Lightning and what's shaping up for the Bronco and the Maverick, any sense of how many of those customers are, as you mentioned, [in the F-15] (ph) new to Ford, but also maybe new to that segment. So for example, SUV buyers migrating to the E Lightning due to the storage or the bi-directional charging or other features?\nJim Farley: Great question. Put simply, what we've learned about our very large order bank for Lightning is way over indexed on the coast. Almost 80% are new to Ford, what\u2019s interesting 2 out of 5 are people who are going to trade in an ICE pickup which is very important because it indicates a move little bit faster to full-size truck BEV than maybe are our optimistic assumptions. And so I would say what we've learned so far is that the customers are largely new to Ford, but they aren't new to the segment. These are customers who really like these silhouetted vehicles. What is really interesting for me is some would portray the full-size truck industry as kind of a conservative customer. It's not what we're seeing, is these very large order bank for F-150 Lightning, they're new to BEV, and they are excited to move to BEV. And they are -- more than half of them are pickup truck customers.\nBrian Johnson: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research.\nRod Lache: Hi everybody. I just first wanted to clarify the answer that you gave to Brian's question. So you're going to be annualizing at 6 billion to 8 billion in the back half, and I think what a lot of people want to understand is, is that kind of a fair bridging-off point for us to think about what happens from here into 2022 and beyond. So did you assume some moderation of pricing already in that number? Is that level of investment kind of the run rate? And how should we think about the incremental benefit from that run rate for Bronco, Maverick, for the warranty improvement and some of the international improvements that you're working on?\nJohn Lawler: Hi, Rod. Thanks. So in the second half, we show the net number there for the volume net of the manufacturing production costs and other market factors. So what we are assuming is that in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter, we start to see some moderation in pricing due to the fact that we should see volumes in inventories and stocks coming up a bit. So that is something that we do have built into that number for the second half, particularly in the fourth quarter. And then when it comes to 2022, Bronco is just getting up now -- up and running now, launched now. As Jim said, we have a hefty order bank there. And then F150 Lightning Maverick, they're launching next year. So our product portfolio is strong today, it's going to be even stronger next year. And so we see that contributing to the run rate as well. So I think coming out of Capital Markets Day, we talked about the trajectory of the business. 2022 being definitely stronger than '21 as we walk towards 2023 and the 8% EBIT margin that we plan to hit.\nRod Lache: And just secondly, really interesting comment about that sevenfold increase in your order bank and changing the way the vehicles are sold, can you just talk a little bit about what that actually means from a volume perspective? Because I don't think we've ever really known what your actual customer order bank actually what was the magnitude of that? Maybe you could just tell us what that number was a year ago and any thoughts on what this actually means for pricing? Obviously, it's positive, but those units are not going to land on dealer lots for very long. So it would seem that it's really not a big reason to significantly boost incentives anytime soon if they're leaving lots very quickly.\nJim Farley: Thank you, Rod. Put simply, we're really committed to both going to an order based system and keeping our inventories between 50 and 60 days' supply. I've been here at Ford for 13 years. There were many years after the financial crisis where our day supply was 20, 30, 40 days. And in those years, the maximum retail order bank we had in the U.S. was 1000 to 2000 a month. We're now at 70,000 units on our way to 80,000 units. That gives you the order of magnitude difference in the way we are looking at this order bank change for the company. Lot of people in our industry are making big deal about the move online? Sure. But for Ford, we think there's massive benefit across all stakeholders for going to an order bank system. It put pressure on our industrial system to deliver quickly. It reduces our dealers costs more than just low day supplies, you mentioned. It allows us to significantly reduce our incentives. And I \u2013guarantee you, I don't know how much money we're wasting. I know we're wasting money on incentives, I just don't know where. With an order based system, we will have much less risk of that. It requires us to dramatically reduce our order complexity as well. So there are a lot of enablers that have been put in place to move us to this new system and new go-to-market approach. I'd love to talk to you more about it, but I'll try to give you the high hard ones.\nRod Lache: Thanks. Makes sense. Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Murphy, Bank of America.\nJohn Murphy: I just wanted to actually follow up quickly on that. Jim, you mentioned getting back to 50 days to 60 days supply. That sounds closer to normal than not, but you're also -- the way you're describing the order bank, it looks -- sounds like 20%, 25% of your sales would be built-to-order, the horseshoes and hand grenades. So I'm just curious how you decide where that balance lands? how you keep the inventory tight, your partners to dealership, happy, and selling and creating value for you. But then also big part of the story is the tightness in the secondary market, and the used market, keeping [resids] (ph) high, which is helping the new vehicle pricing and it certainly helping out at Ford Motor Credit. So there's a seesaw effect you get the benefit on both sides. Just how do you figure out where this should land and how you actually execute on it.\nJim Farley: Really good question. So the team has done a lot of work on this. I will try to answer it very simply. Our target is 50 days to 60 days supply. That means trucks will be a little bit higher. We have a lot -- about a third of our truck dealers [in C&D] (ph) county, 5 trucks to them could be a 100-day supply, but they need 5 trucks for the local community. And for urban and suburban dealers, it will be less than that range. Different segments will have different targets. We actually did this post-financial crisis for a few years. And then over time, [lost] (ph) discipline. And this is quite important for this management team. We have a weekly and monthly operations review, where we'll look at this very carefully by segment for each of the regions. That's the kind of soft wiring or management judgment. Going to an order bank, I would say is a hardwired way of reducing the stock. And I think it's going to take both for Ford to make this transition. It can't be just relying on management. keeping within that range. We certainly will have an exception process to go beyond that, and there will be a pretty tough discussion with our operating teams. But I think what I'm more excited about is the hardwiring of going to an order-to-delivery order system, which actually our new launches gave us that gift. Because for Bronco, and Mach-E, and some of the other high demand vehicles, we moved the reservation system into an order bank system. We then realized, my God, why don't we do this for all the vehicles, not just those vehicles. And that's when we had to put a series of incentives and more policy changes like order complexity reduction in the system to make it kind of the way we do things at Ford. I think it's going to require both changes.\nJohn Murphy: Okay. That's helpful. And just a follow-up on that, current state of affairs of retail versus fleet mix. It seems like can you talk to the dealers, is an emphasis on retail. The dealers, certainly at your level, just curious, if fleet comes back -- I mean, the demand is there, how are you balancing that \u2013\nJim Farley: Sure, it is.\nJohn Murphy: -- current days and go forward. I mean, because the demand is there, it's just some of it is getting fulfilled in the used market. They're going after auctions instead of ordering from you guys. So how do we think about that recovery go forward and where does it stand right now?\nJim Farley: Really good question. So it depends on the region. Of course, we're a dominant commercial brand in multiple regions like Western Europe and the U.S., even in China in certain segments. And we're seeing in Europe a very dramatic order bank on our vans. It is -- it is something I've never seen in my career. We're talking months and months and months of back orders. So the demand for our commercial vehicles in Europe is extremely strong and the order bank is months and months. In the U.S. we're very fortunate that our commercial business is heavily focused on transit and Super Duty, and of course, F-150 is kind of mix. And so for those vehicle lines, transit and Super Duty, it's very easy to -- we don't have to prioritize between retail and commercial because those vehicle lines are almost a 100% commercial. The one that's challenging for us to balance is F-150. And we -- as you could see in this quarter, we're very carefully mix managing. But we are very respectful of the needs of our commercial customers. We know where our toast is buttered. And those customers are really important for us. In fact, we\u2019re in discussions with them right now about the trade-off between feature content and availability. We have many commercial customers in the U.S. that have been waiting for months and months for their vehicle. And we are discussing with them, would you be willing to take off feature content to get your vehicles now? And that's -- and you can expect us to be balanced about that discussion and negotiation and compromise. And it's -- we'll make the right call for the company and for the customer. But they are pushing us for availability now, even if it means lower feature content.\nJohn Murphy: That's very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Jonas: Thanks. A great call so far. And Jim, I have to say, I did a Ctrl+F for the word hybrid in the [Indiscernible] and in the press release and I don't see it, man. No hybrid. It's a beautiful thing. So good. Yeah. But they're dead. They're gone. All right. My question on EVs, your BEVs. When do you think that they can be positive profit on a fully costed basis, not contribution. Like, when can they be profitable? And do you think it's 2022 is still too early for that? My first, and I have a follow-up.\nJohn Lawler: Thanks, Adam. Actually, Mach-E is profitable. Contribution margin, positive and profitable on the bottom line today.\nAdam Jonas: Wow.\nJohn Lawler: So we've seen strong demand for that. Yeah. So I think when we look at it over time, as we talked about [Indiscernible] , and we've talked about with you. We've got to ride that technology curve down. We've got to get to the $80 per kilowatt hour for the battery pack before the end of the decade. We've got to scale the BEV content. We have commonality, and the top hats, and other components that will help us as well. And then, of course, we need to build on our services and such to really improve the profitability of the [Indiscernible] as we move forward. But I can tell you that Mach-E is profitable today.\nAdam Jonas: Wow, that's incredible at 50,000 type run rate for that to be correct. Okay. My follow-on question, Jim, is about always on and the order bank. I mean, really huge. Just really interesting when you combine the order bank system with always on, where you go connect -- can engage the consumer directly for services and F&I and insurance and the OTA. But I am talking to some dealers that are freaking out. That some Darwinian forces could be at work where you're not, let's say, directly infringing on the franchise laws, but you're dancing close as you probably should given all the technological changes over the past 70 or 80 years since these laws came. So what's your message to them? What if order book goes to 80% of your units or the majority, and then the dealers are just these delivery centers? And then, you're going direct on all the other wonderful services. What's the message to the dealers?\nJim Farley: Great question. Well, we're going to have a couple of different population of dealers. We are going to have our professional dealers and the answer is a little different for them versus our retail dealers. We'll have our rural dealers and the answer is a little bit different for them than suburban and urban dealers. The -- I would say the message we're giving to our team, our dealers is, look, we're going to have to work really carefully together, so -- because the customers are going to have a lot of questions on Ford BlueCruise, for example. So we want to make sure the dealers are very knowledgeable about these new OTA features, that are really meaningful in the use of the customer's life. That's one. The second one is service, service, service, service. Service. That is the most important thing for us, is wiring a closed loop between the vehicle, the condition of the vehicle, the service capacity of the dealers, and the customer is going to be the most important ballet we're going to have to play together with the dealers. This is especially true for Ford Pro. And in fact, today, we already have 160 remote trucks doing service for our commercial customers at their business. Warranty work, that's a good example of the evolution of the business model, where they're taking their Service Department from a fixed hub and going on the road with their service capacity. And those trucks have to be cooked into the vehicle data and the prognostics. Our parts legacy system to order parts and the dealers on dispatch system. That has to be a closed loop. So, all I would say to you is the orchestration and our benefit, our chance to win. Just like maybe targets, a chance to win versus online retailers is that in-person service, especially in professional customers.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Colin Langan with Wells Fargo.\nColin Langan: Great, thanks for taking my question, and congrats on a good quarter. Inventory levels. We've never seen them at these levels obviously before and obviously it's impacting your market share. Any sense of how much of that you think you could recoup and how much are you concerned may switch to other brands because people might only wait for so long?\nJohn Lawler: Yeah. Hi, Colin. It's John. So I think what we're seeing here from a market share drop is completely related to the fact that our stocks reduced so much. We have the chip issue. We lost the volumes that we lost in the second quarter. We expect that as we work to improve the run rate and through the third quarter, we're very focused on maintaining this high turn rate, filling the orders that we have. As Jim said, we're going to continue to work on retail orders. And continue to bring our customers along that way as well. So we think that we have a good chance to regain that share, especially with the strong lineup that we have. and so we see this as a temporary issue related to the chip issue and the volume and production we had in the quarter.\nJim Farley: And we will not cede truck leadership to anyone.\nColin Langan: Okay. [Indiscernible] touch on Connected Services. You rolled out Ford Liive in Europe on commercial vehicles. I -- I believe it's free right now. I mean, how is that rollout going? And when do you try to monetize that and get revenue out of these services?\nJim Farley: Great question. So we do -- we just launched FORDLiive, as Jim mentioned, in the UK and Spain. We have 5 more EU countries covered by the end of the year to launch, so we're really excited about FORDLiive. What we've committed to so far is in the next couple of years by 2025, we expect our digital and charging revenue in Ford Pro to be about 1 billion dollars today. I wish we had more time to focus on this frankly. We have about just under 200,000 unique subscriptions for our telematics and data services. We grew at about 20,000 units in the quart -- 20,000 subscriptions in the quarter. And we feel like that digital telematics and [Indiscernible] data like fuel tank information plus adding the charging services like Electriphi for Depot charging for our customers, our high-growth area with the revenue to that level in the next couple years. The monetization of FORDLiive is really around our traditional parts business, which has very high margins and we have a very low share. So the opportunity for us upside is tremendous, post warranty. Even our commercial customers, we get very few of those customers. And so the real payoff for this closed loop is going to be much higher share post warranty of that very profitable business.\nColin Langan: Thanks for taking my question.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.\nRyan Brinkman: Thanks for taking my question. One thing that especially stood out in your results, I think, is on Slide 6, where it shows that units wholesaled in the quarter rose 18% year-over-year, but that revenue was up by more than twice as much by 38%. So just a few questions around pricing and overall revenue per unit. I can see from the [Indiscernible] on Slide 9 that Net pricing helped EBIT by 1.9 billion or kind of 10% of last year's revenue, which seems suggests about the idea that half of the growth in revenue over unit volume into Q was driven by price and the other half by makes. Is that roughly correct? And what do you think the outlook is for continuing to grow revenue in excess of the change in volume?\nJohn Lawler: Yeah. Thanks, Ryan. I think pricing is the majority of what was behind that growth. We had a very strong quarter relative to pricing as we saw, our inventory shrink. And we see the strength in the underlying demand of the products that we have. And so I think I would think about it more as pricing, a little bit of mix in there, but more of it is pricing.\nRyan Brinkman: Okay, very helpful. And then just as a follow-up, we saw some estimates that your incentive spending in June in the U.S., it may have fallen like 50% year-over-year, leading the decline in industry-wide incentives. I'm curious how much of the decline in incentives do you think maybe driven by hot new products like the F-150, Bronco, Bronco Sport, Mach-E, et cetera, versus how much is the function of the low inventory environment or maybe just a general inflationary environment? And to that end, it might be helpful to know if carryover pricing, which I think usually declines year-over-year, if that might also be tracking stronger and what your outlook is for incentive spending going forward, maybe in light of some of the comments you made earlier on the call about inventories and order bank, etc.?\nJohn Lawler: that's a great question. I think we've been working [Indiscernible] this as you'd expect. It's a combination of all of the above, right? We have strong products. We see continued demand for those strong products, supply is well short of that, it's allowed us to continue to keep the pricing strong and improve the pricing in the second quarter versus what we had expected. And I think as long as you see this imbalance between supply and demand, we'll continue to have stronger pricing power. As we've seen through the first quarter and the second quarter. As we go through the year, when we start to see supply and demand normalize. we'll see some of this pricing come off a little bit in the fourth quarter and then we'll have to see how that runs through next year. But given the strength of our product lineup and the demand we see, we expect to have a relatively strong pricing power for the near foreseeable future.\nRyan Brinkman: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.\nJoseph Spak: Thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to get back to the investments in, in modernization and maybe frame that in the context of the 2023 view you laid out at the Capital Markets Day. How does that investment trend through those years as you think about the margin targets you laid out and there's an assumption that by the time you got to '23 or maybe a little bit later, there's a return on that investment, such that it becomes a neutral or even positive to the margin.\nJohn Lawler: Yes, thanks. Of course. as we make our capital allocations and we make these investments, we expect that we're going to get a return on them. And that's all part of our walk up into 2023, the 8% margin. We're also continuing to work on cost reductions elsewhere. right? These are investments that we're making in our new products with the launches and connectivity and IT. We've got advertising in there for these launches, and then, of course, customer experiences as I talked about earlier. But we're also driving cost reductions elsewhere as we continue to improve the business towards that 8% margin in 2023. So we'll invest in certain areas. We will see costs go up in certain areas, but we should also see cost coming down another areas, particularly material costs, et cetera.\nJim Farley: One particular area? of modernization that doesn't I don't think get enough attention in where we're investing as a Company. Certainly 30 billion in electrification, and the vertical integration of batteries and our, of course our investment on autonomy. I think you all know about where we're spending our money in the general categories. The 1 I really want to highlight is the very significant investment in our embedded electrical architecture upgrade. This is really a significant move by Ford to not just invest in electrification, but move those products to fully digital updatable in all modules and go to a fully modern zonal electric architecture. I'm not going to go through the details, but this is a very expensive transition, but it will enable a whole new capability for the always -on experience than even today's connected vehicles like Mustang Mach-E. And I want to highlight that because it often gets lost in the other categories of investment and monetization.\nJoseph Spak: Okay, so just to clarify, so the EV spend is included in that bucket you mentioned?\nJim Farley: Yes. Yes. So when we talk about upgrading our electric vehicles, it's much more fundamental than just the investment, and the tooling, and the engineering of the electric vehicle and its components and propulsion. It also includes a completely new approach to an embedded software and hardware system.\nJoseph Spak: Okay, And just -- and going back to the order bank, which is clearly interesting, that's -- it seems like an easier task, quite frankly, when you have great product like you do with the Bronco, the Mach-E, and the Lightning, which are -- seem well-received and also limited. I guess what I'm wondering is how are you going to sort of balance that with inventory as you think about like you're an explorer and your 4 or 5 of its product lifecycle or like is the plan to still keep inventories of the older products or more mature products tight such that you can still get some into the order bank or are there other plans to keep the product fresh throughout the lifecycle. That can lead to \u2013\nJim Farley: Sure. We'll have ground stock for sure in dealers. And we obviously have to keep the vehicle fresh. More and more of that will be the digital freshness of the vehicle. But I would say if you look at our 60 plus thousand unit order bank in North America, a lot of -- not all of those are Bronco s and Mustang Mach-Es. We're doing this for our whole brands.\nJoseph Spak: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Philippe Houchois with Jefferies.\nPhilippe Houchois: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you very much. I've got 2 questions. The first one, sorry, I'll go back on this order bank and inventory levels. To be honest, I'm a bit surprised you talking about 50 days to 60 days of inventory in the few Trump because that's done much lower than what we've had in the past. And I would've thought the order bank would actually enable to actually carry much [Indiscernible] inventory and we've seen that benefit to pricing. So I wonder if the 56 days is the first step, but do you think you can do better in the future? And along those lines and then maybe more on the Ford Credit side. But when I look at European car companies, they carry more finished products on their balance sheet, the core balance sheet. And then [Indiscernible] to be less on the Cinco balance sheet, through the dealer receivables, where you guys are proxying. It's the opposite in the U.S. And I'm just wondering if you look at a situation where you go to more order banking for your production. If you end up carrying more inventory on your Industrial balance sheet, which would increase your working capital requirement from an industrial standpoint, that was my first question. And the second one, if I can ask, briefly on China. It seems like you're stalling a bit in China, and because you've localized lot more of Lincoln, more profit able. You had big losses I [Indiscernible] before, and side before. And I'm just wondering, can you comment maybe on what is happening generally in China? Is there -- there seems to be concern about how the Chinese brands are making good progress by some of the EVs launched by your competitors are not quite getting the love from customers that was expected. And I'm just wondering if you see a more difficult environment in China for you in the balance of the year into next year. Thank you.\nJohn Lawler: Yes. I will take the working capital. Now, where we see the order bank helping us is we actually see it simplifying the industrial system because we'll know exactly what we're going to build. So we're actually working through that now and trying to use that to simplify and reduce things like working capitals. So I think if anything, it would have the opposite impact. It would increase working capital. We use it to drive down working capital. And then on the day supply. What we've seen in the past is around a 75-day supply. So 50 day, it's a 25-day reduction. so we do see that as substantial. And, of course, that'll be different across the different vehicle lines. So we do see that as a substantial pull back in the day supply.\nJim Farley: And just remember, in Europe, just [Indiscernible] Ford of Europe, the cross-border issue in Europe is not so small. We have holding centers and lots of ways to manage the stock. We don't plan to implement that system in the U.S. It evolved over time and we have one country. So I think we're getting -- our intention is, as John said, is not to handle it that way. In China, the team has made tremendous progress from a $1.5 billion loss hovering around breakeven now was slightly below that. And we're in a very important time for Ford in China. Lincoln is now profitable, and we just localized those models. We only launched Lincoln in 2015. I was there. So it's a recent phenomenon. And we're just about to launch a whole plethora of brand new vehicles, like we're doing in North America today. So we're on the eve of the Mustang Mach-E launch localized, and then we have all these new vehicles, the Evos, I can go on a long list, and it will be just like what we're seeing in North America, full of freshness, and that will play out over the next couple of years. So China is very important for our profit plans. I think the team has done a tremendous job in stabilizing our sales situation and improving our cost, and now And now it's going to be a growth story in China. We're just commercializing and industrializing the vehicles as we speak. And Mustang Mach-E, it's the first major one. Thanks.\nPhilippe Houchois: Thank you very much.\nOperator: And our final question for the day will come from the line of Dan Levy with Credit Suisse.\nDan Levy: Hi. Good evening. Thank you for squeezing me in. First, wanted to just ask on the chip shortage and I fully recognize the situation is very fluid and your crystal ball was as good as anyone else's. But do you have a sense for how long it might take until you're no longer supply-constrained on production or something that's fully resolved, by your best guess by early next year or do you think that this -- there might be still some supply constraint lasting much longer and deeper into 2022. So just the baseline expectations around that.\nJohn Lawler: So Dan Yes, I mean, I think my guess is as good as anybody is on this. We do see that the chip issue running through this year, and we could see it bleeding into the first part of next year. But I think we won't really have a good feel for that, until later in this year. We know that, as we've had discussions with the [Indiscernible] suppliers, they're telling us they're reallocating capital, they're increasing supply for automotive et cetera. But I think this is one of those things where we need to see the release coming through before we can really feel comfortable that we're out of the woods here.\nDan Levy: Great. I understand. And second question is just on ICE versus BEV. And clearly you're deemphasizing ICE, and presumably that means the investment is coming down. I assume that part of that 30 billion headline number you gave includes some reallocation from ICE to EV. But I think we also know right now that, and maybe this is just a function of the market, but ICE sales are extremely strong in the U.S.. It could remain the case for a while. So what should we expect on margin for ICE vehicles, especially as some of that investment comes down? Is it possible that the outgoing margin on some of the ICE vehicles actually increases and you could potentially run into a negative mix issue as we -- as you start to pivot from ice to the beds?\nJim Farley: Yeah. It's a good question. Generally speaking, that certainly could happen. We don't know how the demand will shift. Obviously, our guess is 40% of [Indiscernible] , 240 gigawatt capacity by 2030. So we're busy making all that happen as you say, 40% is a lot -- is a lot higher than today and I think we have -- well, I know we have the right strategy for the Company. But so much of this transition is going to depend on government support, infrastructure buildout. And we need to be patient. And I think agility will become a very important skill for the Company. So far, the first inning would imply that Ford 's number 1 in sports car is Mustang, we're number one in vans with transit, we're number 1 in pickups with F-150. We're electrifying all 3 of those in the next 6 months. And so far, the demand is actually higher than we expected. So I don't know what's going to happen. We don't know what's going to happen. The support in China, but especially in Europe, has accelerated the BEV adoption in those regions. But as you say, we get into the next phase of expansion with a lot more product offering and all that capital pointed at BEV s, it's hard to say. And it's hard to handicap the government's policy at a government level. over time. I think the most important thing isn't how much money we're spending, because that's necessary -- that's enough. It is our agility and the kind of execution of our BEVs and our management of the profitability of those vehicles, and that's where we're putting our energy. The agility of our industrial system, our manufacturing, our focus on the profitability improvement and the vertical integration for key electric components, and making our vehicles different and more competitive than others. I know it's a very general answer, but I don't think we know enough to answer your question.\nDan Levy: Understood. That's helpful, nevertheless. But thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And with that, this concludes the Ford Motor Company's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. We'd like to thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jim Farley",
            "content": "Thank you, Lynn. Hello, everyone. And thanks for joining us today. Early in the second quarter, 2 months ago, we detailed our strategy for the future Ford. Put simply, our Ford Plus plan is focused on 2 things, really distinctive products that only Ford could do and an always-on relationship and experience for our customers that gets better and better over time. We're building on our foundational strengths, our iconic products, the uniquely appealing vehicles, our manufacturing excellence, and the industry's best captive finance company. But we're now adding new capabilities and new talents, and we're investing in new businesses that will accelerate our value we create for customers and our investors. We're committed to delivering a richer experience for our Ford and Lincoln customers, one that improves over time with things like our over-the-air software upgrades, data-driven experiences, productivity and uptime services for our critical commercial customers, charging software, and a lot more. Ford Plus also means introducing the industry's most compelling, high-volume, electric vehicle line-up and investing the capital and human resources required to design and build world-class batteries and electric powertrain components. And with Argo AI, we're well-positioned to launch an autonomous people and goods delivery business with significant future growth potential. But fundamental to transforming forward is to further strengthen our auto operations while we're also expanding our addressable market. Our commitment is to earn your confidence with strong execution quarter-after-quarter, year-after-year, delivering solid returns regardless of the challenges that we face with external environment like we did in the second quarter. Despite the many headwinds from the semiconductor shortage, some of which were unique to Ford, our teams skillfully managed our business and we generated a positive EBIT. And I can tell you that this outcome was far from certain at the beginning of the quarter. It required intense focus from our team, on cost, pricing and mix. The primary advantage we have right now is the strength of our product portfolio. And it's about to get a lot stronger. We stopped making me too products in declining segments few years ago. And we unleashed our product development team to create emotional and distinctive products that only can come from Ford. The Mustang Mach-E, which is already the second best-selling electric SUV in the U.S., was recently named Car and Driver Electric Vehicle of the Year after rigorous testing against 10 other great EVs, including the Tesla Model Y Performance, the Porsche Taycan, and the Audi e-tron. The demand for our first round of high-volume EVs clearly has exceeded our most optimistic projections. The reservations for the F-150 Lightning have now climbed well past a 120,000 units. And 75% of those customers are new to Ford. We're now working around the clock to break constraints and increase our manufacturing capacity for these red hot new battery electric vehicles. We're working with LG Chem, SKI Innovation to increase our annual battery capacity for the Mustang Mach-E by 70%. And we're taking similar actions ahead of the launches of E-Transit later this year and the F-150 Lightning early next year. The customer and critical reception to our new Bronco lineup has also been remarkable. In June, we started shipments to fulfill 125,000 orders we have for Bronco II and four-door models. And 70% of those Bronco customers are also new to Ford. And then there's the Maverick, our upcoming hybrid pickup, that offers room for five, gets 40 miles per gallon in the city and is priced starting at less than $20,000, and customer already recognize the value of this product and the initial interest to our dealers is more than almost 80,000 orders. Great products alone are not sufficient, though, to deliver Ford Plus. Always on means, we are regularly interacting with our customers on things large and small, and we're building new capabilities, like connected services, to enrich the customer experience and drive reoccurring revenue streams. We developed a proprietary software and hardware stack we called Blue Oval Intelligence to deliver updates to customers' vehicles over the year. Some of our competitors can do it for their entertainment systems, we do it for almost all of our modules in the vehicle. For example, the Mustang Mach-E activation rates, the number of customers who opt in to Connected services like FordPass, are now over 95%. We have now updated more than 150,000 vehicles over-the-air just this year. And we expect this to top 600,000 vehicles by year-end. And by 2028, we will have 33 million OTA capability vehicles on the road around the world. And we are mining the real-world data from these vehicles real-time to better meet our customer needs. To me, this is the most important point. For example, driven by the vehicle data from the Mustang Mach-E and the F-150 already, we've identified $50 million in efficiencies just from warranty cost avoidance and other opportunities. We're also building out our global Ford Pro commercial business, which we expect to grow from 45 billion in 2025, from 27 billion in 2019. Last month, we announced our acquisition of Electriphi to help accelerate electric vehicle fleet adoption. By offering those customers the best-scaled depot charging experience for all commercial customers. It's an example of how we're building out Ford Pro now. In mobility, we are now focused on planning and executing a phased deployment of AVs that will lead to large scale commercialization of Ford's AVs. Last week, as you've seen, we reached the industry first collaboration between Argo and Lyft, to deploy Ford Driverless Vehicles on the Lyft TNC network. This collaboration will enable commercial deployment at scale and demonstrate Ford and Argo 's ability to connect into multiple TNCs or transportation networks. And on the technology front, Argo, I'm really excited about this, introduced Argo Lidar, which will help us expand our autonomous services beyond the dense urban areas that most are focused on. This new lidar designed to be cost effective and manufacturing at scale will offer what we believe is the industry's longest distance sensing range of 400 meters with dark object detection for safe highway driving. Now, before John reports on the quarter, and our expectations for the rest of the year, let me give you an update on the semiconductor situation. In April, we said we'd expect to lose about 50% of our planned volume in the second quarter, which then implied a loss in adjusted EBIT . In fact, we did better than expected. We leveraged the strong demand to optimize our revenue and profits. We're seeing signs of improvement in the flow of chips now in the third quarter, but the situation remains fluid, especially due to the delay in ramp up of one of our key suppliers, Renesas, that Ford is uniquely exposed to in the first half. Overall, after effectively managing through the first half, we are now spring-loaded for growth in the second half and beyond because of those red-hot products, pent-up demand, and improving chip supply. Navigating these chip constraints has led us to make important permanent changes in our business model at Ford. We are modernizing our go-to-market strategy. What does that mean? We're placing greater emphasis on build-to-order sales bank, not just low stocks. We have learned that, yes, operating with fewer vehicles on lots is not only possible, but it's better for customers, dealers, and Ford. But we're also driving a significant increase in the number of customers configuring and ordering their vehicles online. So we have better visibility to real demand using an order bank. This allows us to lower inventories, simplify our incentives, and reduce our order complexity in the industrial systems cost. For our customers, upside is that they more quickly get the precise vehicle they want. Now, this isn't theoretical. I hope we get into the Q&A. We're doing it right now as we speak. Relative to the supply chain, we made 3 notable changes. First, we are no longer relying heavily on a tier-procurement structure for transparency. We are now engaging directly, for example, with the fabs on semiconductors and key points in supply chain for critical components, electronic components. With closer relationships and more transparent exchange of information, such as technology roadmaps, we can integrate their know-how into our designs to better align supply and demand. Second, we're providing longer-term forecast to critical vendors so they can better understand and accommodate our requirements. And third, we are more comprehensively scanning for obstacles in our supply chain. Risk mitigation actions include stockpiling of critical parts like semis, dual sourcing and design interchangeability in the case of single sources. These changes are all being applied to new technologies as well, including batteries, which are rapidly becoming a larger portion of our bill of material at Ford. Our pending joint venture with SK Innovation, called BlueOvalSK, will produce EV battery cells and arrays, helping us secure supplies of batteries at competitive cost and performance levels really critical given our demand for our new electric vehicles. And now I'd like to turn over to John to take us through the results for the quarter and our outlook. And we're not slowing down our modernization because of the chip situation; in fact, we're doing the opposite. Great question. Put simply, what we've learned about our very large order bank for Lightning is way over indexed on the coast. Almost 80% are new to Ford, what's interesting 2 out of 5 are people who are going to trade in an ICE pickup which is very important because it indicates a move little bit faster to full-size truck BEV than maybe are our optimistic assumptions. And so I would say what we've learned so far is that the customers are largely new to Ford, but they aren't new to the segment. These are customers who really like these silhouetted vehicles. What is really interesting for me is some would portray the full-size truck industry as kind of a conservative customer. It's not what we're seeing, is these very large order bank for F-150 Lightning, they're new to BEV, and they are excited to move to BEV. And they are -- more than half of them are pickup truck customers. Thank you, Rod. Put simply, we're really committed to both going to an order based system and keeping our inventories between 50 and 60 days' supply. I've been here at Ford for 13 years. There were many years after the financial crisis where our day supply was 20, 30, 40 days. And in those years, the maximum retail order bank we had in the U.S. was 1000 to 2000 a month. We're now at 70,000 units on our way to 80,000 units. That gives you the order of magnitude difference in the way we are looking at this order bank change for the company. Lot of people in our industry are making big deal about the move online? Sure. But for Ford, we think there's massive benefit across all stakeholders for going to an order bank system. It put pressure on our industrial system to deliver quickly. It reduces our dealers costs more than just low day supplies, you mentioned. It allows us to significantly reduce our incentives. And I \u2013guarantee you, I don't know how much money we're wasting. I know we're wasting money on incentives, I just don't know where. With an order based system, we will have much less risk of that. It requires us to dramatically reduce our order complexity as well. So there are a lot of enablers that have been put in place to move us to this new system and new go-to-market approach. I'd love to talk to you more about it, but I'll try to give you the high hard ones. Really good question. So the team has done a lot of work on this. I will try to answer it very simply. Our target is 50 days to 60 days supply. That means trucks will be a little bit higher. We have a lot -- about a third of our truck dealers [in C&D] (ph) county, 5 trucks to them could be a 100-day supply, but they need 5 trucks for the local community. And for urban and suburban dealers, it will be less than that range. Different segments will have different targets. We actually did this post-financial crisis for a few years. And then over time, [lost] (ph) discipline. And this is quite important for this management team. We have a weekly and monthly operations review, where we'll look at this very carefully by segment for each of the regions. That's the kind of soft wiring or management judgment. Going to an order bank, I would say is a hardwired way of reducing the stock. And I think it's going to take both for Ford to make this transition. It can't be just relying on management. keeping within that range. We certainly will have an exception process to go beyond that, and there will be a pretty tough discussion with our operating teams. But I think what I'm more excited about is the hardwiring of going to an order-to-delivery order system, which actually our new launches gave us that gift. Because for Bronco, and Mach-E, and some of the other high demand vehicles, we moved the reservation system into an order bank system. We then realized, my God, why don't we do this for all the vehicles, not just those vehicles. And that's when we had to put a series of incentives and more policy changes like order complexity reduction in the system to make it kind of the way we do things at Ford. I think it's going to require both changes. Sure, it is. Really good question. So it depends on the region. Of course, we're a dominant commercial brand in multiple regions like Western Europe and the U.S., even in China in certain segments. And we're seeing in Europe a very dramatic order bank on our vans. It is -- it is something I've never seen in my career. We're talking months and months and months of back orders. So the demand for our commercial vehicles in Europe is extremely strong and the order bank is months and months. In the U.S. we're very fortunate that our commercial business is heavily focused on transit and Super Duty, and of course, F-150 is kind of mix. And so for those vehicle lines, transit and Super Duty, it's very easy to -- we don't have to prioritize between retail and commercial because those vehicle lines are almost a 100% commercial. The one that's challenging for us to balance is F-150. And we -- as you could see in this quarter, we're very carefully mix managing. But we are very respectful of the needs of our commercial customers. We know where our toast is buttered. And those customers are really important for us. In fact, we're in discussions with them right now about the trade-off between feature content and availability. We have many commercial customers in the U.S. that have been waiting for months and months for their vehicle. And we are discussing with them, would you be willing to take off feature content to get your vehicles now? And that's -- and you can expect us to be balanced about that discussion and negotiation and compromise. And it's -- we'll make the right call for the company and for the customer. But they are pushing us for availability now, even if it means lower feature content. Great question. Well, we're going to have a couple of different population of dealers. We are going to have our professional dealers and the answer is a little different for them versus our retail dealers. We'll have our rural dealers and the answer is a little bit different for them than suburban and urban dealers. The -- I would say the message we're giving to our team, our dealers is, look, we're going to have to work really carefully together, so -- because the customers are going to have a lot of questions on Ford BlueCruise, for example. So we want to make sure the dealers are very knowledgeable about these new OTA features, that are really meaningful in the use of the customer's life. That's one. The second one is service, service, service, service. Service. That is the most important thing for us, is wiring a closed loop between the vehicle, the condition of the vehicle, the service capacity of the dealers, and the customer is going to be the most important ballet we're going to have to play together with the dealers. This is especially true for Ford Pro. And in fact, today, we already have 160 remote trucks doing service for our commercial customers at their business. Warranty work, that's a good example of the evolution of the business model, where they're taking their Service Department from a fixed hub and going on the road with their service capacity. And those trucks have to be cooked into the vehicle data and the prognostics. Our parts legacy system to order parts and the dealers on dispatch system. That has to be a closed loop. So, all I would say to you is the orchestration and our benefit, our chance to win. Just like maybe targets, a chance to win versus online retailers is that in-person service, especially in professional customers. And we will not cede truck leadership to anyone. Great question. So we do -- we just launched FORDLiive, as Jim mentioned, in the UK and Spain. We have 5 more EU countries covered by the end of the year to launch, so we're really excited about FORDLiive. What we've committed to so far is in the next couple of years by 2025, we expect our digital and charging revenue in Ford Pro to be about 1 billion dollars today. I wish we had more time to focus on this frankly. We have about just under 200,000 unique subscriptions for our telematics and data services. We grew at about 20,000 units in the quart -- 20,000 subscriptions in the quarter. And we feel like that digital telematics and [Indiscernible] data like fuel tank information plus adding the charging services like Electriphi for Depot charging for our customers, our high-growth area with the revenue to that level in the next couple years. The monetization of FORDLiive is really around our traditional parts business, which has very high margins and we have a very low share. So the opportunity for us upside is tremendous, post warranty. Even our commercial customers, we get very few of those customers. And so the real payoff for this closed loop is going to be much higher share post warranty of that very profitable business. One particular area? of modernization that doesn't I don't think get enough attention in where we're investing as a Company. Certainly 30 billion in electrification, and the vertical integration of batteries and our, of course our investment on autonomy. I think you all know about where we're spending our money in the general categories. The 1 I really want to highlight is the very significant investment in our embedded electrical architecture upgrade. This is really a significant move by Ford to not just invest in electrification, but move those products to fully digital updatable in all modules and go to a fully modern zonal electric architecture. I'm not going to go through the details, but this is a very expensive transition, but it will enable a whole new capability for the always -on experience than even today's connected vehicles like Mustang Mach-E. And I want to highlight that because it often gets lost in the other categories of investment and monetization. Yes. Yes. So when we talk about upgrading our electric vehicles, it's much more fundamental than just the investment, and the tooling, and the engineering of the electric vehicle and its components and propulsion. It also includes a completely new approach to an embedded software and hardware system. Sure. We'll have ground stock for sure in dealers. And we obviously have to keep the vehicle fresh. More and more of that will be the digital freshness of the vehicle. But I would say if you look at our 60 plus thousand unit order bank in North America, a lot of -- not all of those are Bronco s and Mustang Mach-Es. We're doing this for our whole brands. And just remember, in Europe, just [Indiscernible] Ford of Europe, the cross-border issue in Europe is not so small. We have holding centers and lots of ways to manage the stock. We don't plan to implement that system in the U.S. It evolved over time and we have one country. So I think we're getting -- our intention is, as John said, is not to handle it that way. In China, the team has made tremendous progress from a $1.5 billion loss hovering around breakeven now was slightly below that. And we're in a very important time for Ford in China. Lincoln is now profitable, and we just localized those models. We only launched Lincoln in 2015. I was there. So it's a recent phenomenon. And we're just about to launch a whole plethora of brand new vehicles, like we're doing in North America today. So we're on the eve of the Mustang Mach-E launch localized, and then we have all these new vehicles, the Evos, I can go on a long list, and it will be just like what we're seeing in North America, full of freshness, and that will play out over the next couple of years. So China is very important for our profit plans. I think the team has done a tremendous job in stabilizing our sales situation and improving our cost, and now And now it's going to be a growth story in China. We're just commercializing and industrializing the vehicles as we speak. And Mustang Mach-E, it's the first major one. Thanks. Yeah. It's a good question. Generally speaking, that certainly could happen. We don't know how the demand will shift. Obviously, our guess is 40% of [Indiscernible] , 240 gigawatt capacity by 2030. So we're busy making all that happen as you say, 40% is a lot -- is a lot higher than today and I think we have -- well, I know we have the right strategy for the Company. But so much of this transition is going to depend on government support, infrastructure buildout. And we need to be patient. And I think agility will become a very important skill for the Company. So far, the first inning would imply that Ford 's number 1 in sports car is Mustang, we're number one in vans with transit, we're number 1 in pickups with F-150. We're electrifying all 3 of those in the next 6 months. And so far, the demand is actually higher than we expected. So I don't know what's going to happen. We don't know what's going to happen. The support in China, but especially in Europe, has accelerated the BEV adoption in those regions. But as you say, we get into the next phase of expansion with a lot more product offering and all that capital pointed at BEV s, it's hard to say. And it's hard to handicap the government's policy at a government level. over time. I think the most important thing isn't how much money we're spending, because that's necessary -- that's enough. It is our agility and the kind of execution of our BEVs and our management of the profitability of those vehicles, and that's where we're putting our energy. The agility of our industrial system, our manufacturing, our focus on the profitability improvement and the vertical integration for key electric components, and making our vehicles different and more competitive than others. I know it's a very general answer, but I don't think we know enough to answer your question."

            "name": "John Lawler",
            "content": "Thank you, Jim. So first I want to reiterate that everything we do and every decision we're making, including capital allocation, it's squarely focused on delivering our Ford Plus plan. And you'll see that as I share our key takeaways from the quarter, our full-year outlook, and describe how we're positioned for even stronger performance heading into 2022. And as Jim said, we delivered better-than-expected results, given the semiconductor constraints. Year-over-year, our automotive business improved across several key financial metrics as we overlap the industry-wide COVID-related manufacturing shutdowns we saw in the second quarter of last year. Now, for a more accurate picture of our true trajectory in this present environment, we're focusing more on sequential comparison, and we think those are more appropriate. While wholesales were down 28% sequentially, our teams optimized from revenue and profit with disciplined incentive spending and mix management. We allocated chips to customer orders, new launches, and our more profitable vehicles. In addition, the strength of our sales order bank gives us confidence in our ability to drive a more balanced performance of wholesales, revenue, and profit in the second half of this year, including sequential improvement in wholesales and share. So let's turn to our results. On a consolidated basis, wholesales and revenue were up 18% and 38% year-over-year respectively, and we delivered adjusted EBIT of 1.1 billion with adjusted margin of 4%. Outside of North America, our underlying trajectory continues to improve despite the impact of the semiconductors and that's driven by more focused product portfolios, geographic footprint, as well as, lower costs. And Ford Credit continued to deliver strong performance with record quarterly EBT of 1.6 billion. And that's demonstrating why it's a strategic asset and critical to enabling Ford Plus. And a prime example is through the launch of a new service like Ford Pro FinSimple, which provides bundled financing for commercial vehicles, services and EV charging. And so it's another example of Ford Credit being a strategic weapon for us.  Now, turning to the regions. North America posted a 40% sequential decline in wholesale due to the semiconductor shortage. Now, as we managed the chip constraints, we focused our efforts on customer or customers ordering vehicles for future delivery. We exited the second quarter with our U.S. customer sold order bank up more than seven times compared to a year ago. And with new models to come, we are clearly poised for a rebound in North America when the semiconductor supply stabilizes and aligns with demand. On a year-over-year basis, EBIT was up 1.1 billion. Outside of North America, the turnaround of our operations remains on track. In aggregate, EBIT improved 800 million year-over-year, but declined sequentially, mainly driven by Europe, where the semiconductor shortage caused wholesale units to drop sequentially by nearly 35%. The transformation in Europe continues as the region capitalizes on strength in commercial vehicles with Ford Pro, and a more focused passenger portfolio, including key imports. Europe has stepped up investments in electrification, including 1 billion for a new EV manufacturing center in Cologne, the launch of our E-Transit next spring, and a new all-electric light commercial vehicle from Romania. In South America, our restructuring is on track. Our lean de-risked and asset-light business model is focused on our strengths with ranger, transit and key imported vehicles. The region introduced Bronco Sport and Mustang Mach-1 I in selected markets, and is preparing now for the launch of the new transit van in the second half of this year. In China, we continue to see improvement in key areas of focus, including Lincoln, commercial vehicles, electric vehicles, and with our portfolio of near premium Ford vehicles. Lincoln attained its highest ever quarterly sales, was profitable, and also captured the number 1 spot in J.D. Power's luxury sales satisfaction ranking. unseating Audi, which had held the position for 11 years. In addition, 97% of Lincoln's volume is now produced locally, and commercial vehicles now account for 52% of overall sales mix in China. And finally, we are readying for the launch of the localized Mustang Mach-E later this year. Our international markets group, we delivered another solid quarter, leveraging its portfolio strengths with Ranger pickups and Everest SUV. And we're continuing to assess our business in India and we'll have more to say on this later this year. Company-wide second quarter adjusted free cash flow was negative 5.1 billion. As expected, semiconductor-related volume losses had a greater impact on the free cash flow than EBIT because of adverse working capital and timing differences related to customer allowances from marketing incentives. Ford Credit did provide a partial offset with distributions of 4 billion in the quarter. Now, we expect working capital and these timing differences to normalize over time as the semiconductor supply is restored. Cash and liquidity remained very strong, ending the quarter at 25.1 billion and 41 billion respectively. The strength of our balance sheet provides significant financial flexibility to navigate periods of stress, while also continuing to invest in growth in our Ford Plus plan. So now let's turn to the outlook. Based on the underlying strength of our business and present assessment of the semiconductor supplies through the second half, along with other factors, we have increased our outlook for full-year adjusted EBIT to between $9 billion to $10 billion. Now this assumes about a 30% sequential increase in volume in our second half versus our first half, which is supported by the anticipated improvement in the supply of semiconductors. Our guidance implies we expect second-half adjusted EBIT to be lower than the first half of the year. And so we provided a bridge to help with this. And we've included that on page 19 of our earnings presentation. So let me provide a little bit of color around this. Relative to tailwinds, we expect about 3 to 4 billion in favorable market factors and that of an increase in volume-related production costs for the higher volumes. Headwinds, right? We see headwinds coming through and we see pressure on contribution margin. We expect commodities to be up almost $2 billion, half-over-half. Warranty costs are expected to be higher in the second half up about 500 million that we still expect full-year warranty expense to be down year-over-year. Relative to structural costs, about 1.5 billion in investments in modernization, consistent with what we laid out in May, including customer experiences, connectivity, IT, new product launches. Looking at Ford Credit. Based on current market dynamics, we expect Ford Credit to decline by about 1 billion as auction values begin to normalize and we also have a non-repeat of reserve releases that we had in the first half. And lastly, we also have the non-recurrence of the 900 million non-cash gain [Indiscernible] we booked in the first quarter. And it's important to note that this gain also impacts our run rate heading into 2022. We are also increasing our full-year adjusted free cash flow target to 4 to 5 billion, supported by expected favorable working capital in the second half as production increases from an anticipated improvement and chip availability. Now, as our operating results improve, so those are cash conversion, which we continue to target in the range of 50% to 60%, and the strengthened cash conversion in our balance sheet provides us ample financial flexibility to invest in growth, including in EVs; Ford Pro, our connected services and mobility. And looking towards 2022, we are confident in the underlying trajectory of our business and excited to see the momentum continue as we leveraged one of the strongest product lineups in our history and continue to implement our Ford Plus plan. We're on a new path at Ford. We got a plan, the resources, and the result to build a better business. So now, I'll hand it over to the operator to open it up for questions. Hi, Brian. Thanks. Yeah. I think the way we see it is that we've got strength in the underlying performance of our business. As we head into 2022, we also know that the product lineup is going to get stronger, right? We're just launching Bronco now. We've got F-150 Lightning next year. We have Maverick next year. And we also expect that we should get to more of a full line rate on our manufacturing of all our other vehicles in new vehicles that we've had this year. So we do see strength in the product line heading into next year. But what we also see heading into next year are a few headwinds. Ford Credit, we expect that to be more normalized to our run rate that we normally see, and that's because we see auction values coming down. And then we shouldn't -- we should see our credit reserves and our credit losses normalize as well. We also see that next year as volumes increase and stocks increase across the industry, we should see some pricing moderation. Again, we also see commodities being higher next year as well. And we're going to continue to invest in our new product portfolios. We've got the launches coming in next year. We've got our Ford Plus plan. So we see that continuing as we head into next year as well. So, there are some headwinds, but the underlying strength of the business continues to be positive. And with that, we see that trajectory continuing into 22 and then on our way to the 8% EBIT margin for 23. Well, that was planned, that's coming in. Part of that's due to the launches of the vehicle; with the launch costs comes advertising. But we're also investing in connectivity, the IT we need to put in place for the connectivity, as well as, customer experiences, digital experiences, user experiences with the vehicle. So we're continuing to invest to build out our Ford Plus plan. Hi, Rod. Thanks. So in the second half, we show the net number there for the volume net of the manufacturing production costs and other market factors. So what we are assuming is that in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter, we start to see some moderation in pricing due to the fact that we should see volumes in inventories and stocks coming up a bit. So that is something that we do have built into that number for the second half, particularly in the fourth quarter. And then when it comes to 2022, Bronco is just getting up now -- up and running now, launched now. As Jim said, we have a hefty order bank there. And then F150 Lightning Maverick, they're launching next year. So our product portfolio is strong today, it's going to be even stronger next year. And so we see that contributing to the run rate as well. So I think coming out of Capital Markets Day, we talked about the trajectory of the business. 2022 being definitely stronger than '21 as we walk towards 2023 and the 8% EBIT margin that we plan to hit. Thanks, Adam. Actually, Mach-E is profitable. Contribution margin, positive and profitable on the bottom line today. So we've seen strong demand for that. Yeah. So I think when we look at it over time, as we talked about [Indiscernible] , and we've talked about with you. We've got to ride that technology curve down. We've got to get to the $80 per kilowatt hour for the battery pack before the end of the decade. We've got to scale the BEV content. We have commonality, and the top hats, and other components that will help us as well. And then, of course, we need to build on our services and such to really improve the profitability of the [Indiscernible] as we move forward. But I can tell you that Mach-E is profitable today. Yeah. Hi, Colin. It's John. So I think what we're seeing here from a market share drop is completely related to the fact that our stocks reduced so much. We have the chip issue. We lost the volumes that we lost in the second quarter. We expect that as we work to improve the run rate and through the third quarter, we're very focused on maintaining this high turn rate, filling the orders that we have. As Jim said, we're going to continue to work on retail orders. And continue to bring our customers along that way as well. So we think that we have a good chance to regain that share, especially with the strong lineup that we have. and so we see this as a temporary issue related to the chip issue and the volume and production we had in the quarter. Yeah. Thanks, Ryan. I think pricing is the majority of what was behind that growth. We had a very strong quarter relative to pricing as we saw, our inventory shrink. And we see the strength in the underlying demand of the products that we have. And so I think I would think about it more as pricing, a little bit of mix in there, but more of it is pricing. that's a great question. I think we've been working [Indiscernible] this as you'd expect. It's a combination of all of the above, right? We have strong products. We see continued demand for those strong products, supply is well short of that, it's allowed us to continue to keep the pricing strong and improve the pricing in the second quarter versus what we had expected. And I think as long as you see this imbalance between supply and demand, we'll continue to have stronger pricing power. As we've seen through the first quarter and the second quarter. As we go through the year, when we start to see supply and demand normalize. we'll see some of this pricing come off a little bit in the fourth quarter and then we'll have to see how that runs through next year. But given the strength of our product lineup and the demand we see, we expect to have a relatively strong pricing power for the near foreseeable future. Yes, thanks. Of course. as we make our capital allocations and we make these investments, we expect that we're going to get a return on them. And that's all part of our walk up into 2023, the 8% margin. We're also continuing to work on cost reductions elsewhere. right? These are investments that we're making in our new products with the launches and connectivity and IT. We've got advertising in there for these launches, and then, of course, customer experiences as I talked about earlier. But we're also driving cost reductions elsewhere as we continue to improve the business towards that 8% margin in 2023. So we'll invest in certain areas. We will see costs go up in certain areas, but we should also see cost coming down another areas, particularly material costs, et cetera. Yes. I will take the working capital. Now, where we see the order bank helping us is we actually see it simplifying the industrial system because we'll know exactly what we're going to build. So we're actually working through that now and trying to use that to simplify and reduce things like working capitals. So I think if anything, it would have the opposite impact. It would increase working capital. We use it to drive down working capital. And then on the day supply. What we've seen in the past is around a 75-day supply. So 50 day, it's a 25-day reduction. so we do see that as substantial. And, of course, that'll be different across the different vehicle lines. So we do see that as a substantial pull back in the day supply. So Dan Yes, I mean, I think my guess is as good as anybody is on this. We do see that the chip issue running through this year, and we could see it bleeding into the first part of next year. But I think we won't really have a good feel for that, until later in this year. We know that, as we've had discussions with the [Indiscernible] suppliers, they're telling us they're reallocating capital, they're increasing supply for automotive et cetera. But I think this is one of those things where we need to see the release coming through before we can really feel comfortable that we're out of the woods here."

And on June 17, Deutsche Bank will host a virtual fireside chat with Jim Farley. Now I'll turn the call over to Jim.\nJim Farley: Thanks, Lynn. Hello, everyone. Thanks so much for joining us today. Our first quarter of the year really defies an easy explanation or a pithy sound bite. But if I had to sum up one way, it would be this. We're executing on our plan. And I'm excited to say Ford is becoming a stronger, more resilient company that can deliver under pressure, manage risks and seize opportunities, all while generating consistent returns for our stakeholders. In the quarter, we earned $4.8 billion in adjusted EBIT. It's our best quarterly adjusted EBIT ever. And we achieved these results in the midst of a persistent global pandemic, and an unprecedented supply shock tied to the global semiconductor shortage. We mobilized the global team as we always do in these times of crisis. And we rapidly adjusted to the realities that we were seeing. Our team very skillfully navigated the supply constraints, through sharp yield management, and a relentless focus on turning around our automotive operations. That means improving our launch performance, improving our quality, enhancing our brand, strengthening our customer relationships, and improving our go-to-market execution. And Ford Credit, which in our view, is the best automotive finance captive in the industry, also delivered an outstanding quarter. Aided by higher prices, our results benefited from the industry-wide imbalance of supply and demand, given the semiconductor shortage. However, we also delivered improvements that will persist over time, including our global redesign in our overseas operations, which contribute to the largest swing in year-over-year profitability for those operations that we've seen. The benefit of our incredibly fresh portfolio refresh, which lowers the average showroom age now in the U.S. to just three years. And, of course, we made progress on cost across the business. As we share with you today, there are more white waters moments ahead for us that we have to navigate. The semiconductor shortage and the impact to production will get worse before it gets better. In fact, we believe our second quarter will be the trough for this year. We have worked to do to get our industry footprint back to firing on all cylinders or maybe should I say fully charged. Overall, though, I'm proud of the progress we made as a team. As our underlying strength at Ford improves, enhances our cash flow, access to capital, gives us financial flexibility to modernize and disrupt our business while investing in growth. We are very intentional about this because these are the catalyst factors that will transform Ford into a form of vibrant company that will deliver not only our iconic must-have products, but also and I would argue more importantly, and always on ever improving customer experience for both our retail and commercial customers. So let me share a few milestones from the quarter. Turning around auto. Over the past four years, our overseas markets lost a total of $5.8 billion in EBIT. This quarter, the regions delivered roughly $500 million of EBIT, that's a $1 billion improvement year-over-year. Let's look at those must-have services and products. We'll start with the new F-150, which gained share and also gained share of revenue. And it had new innovations like Pro Power Onboard, which showed again, that we understand Ford customers afford these truck customers better than anyone. And the Bronco Sport is off to a fast start bringing 60% new customers to our brand. The new Mustang Mach-E is proving to be a hit with customers just a few days on lot with very strong demand in North America, now in Europe and coming to China. And it's also bringing in new customers to the brand, almost 70%. And we still have the Big Bronco, the two and the four door with incredible order bank, the F-150 Electric and the E-Transit, and we have some surprises for you as well. Stay tuned. Just as we are in the early stages of our electric vehicle plans, we're only scratching the surface of our customers benefiting from our fully connected vehicles. We have successfully deployed our first major over their update software updates to hundreds of thousands of customers for Mach-E and F-150. And this pace will only accelerate the next several years, making our vehicles better over time. Later this year, for example, we will offer our very first tested \u2013 fully tested Ford BlueCruise hands-free driving technology, which will be delivered over the air to Mustang E and F-150 customers. And by 2028, we expect to have more than 33 million over the air updated capable vehicles on the road. Now this installed base gives Ford a significant opportunity to develop products. And for us, very exciting new services that will transform the way we deliver products to our customers. They'll make significant improvements to our customers\u2019 experience and drive quality of our vehicles. And we're on track to lead the electric revolution in areas of Ford strength. For example, we announced we're investing $1 billion in the new electric vehicle manufacturing center in Germany, where by 2023, just a few years from now, we'll be assembling our very first high volume all electric passenger car for Europe. A year later in 2024, all Ford Europe commercial vehicles will be zero emissions capable. And by 2030, all Ford European passenger cars will be all electric. Now these investments are part \u2013 just part of our $22 billion commitment to lead the electric revolution in areas that we're strong. And yesterday, we announced a very important new development. We have formed a new global battery center of excellence called Ford Ion Park, which will accelerate our research and development of battery as well as battery cell technology, including future battery manufacturing. This only starts to hint at our electric vehicle ambitions. There is so much more to come. Now before I turn it over to John, let me share a bit more about where we and the industry are in semiconductors. When we initially gave guidance in February, we expected that the semiconductor supply chains would remain constrained through the second quarter. And we have an opportunity to begin recovering lost volumes in the second-half. It\u2019s kind of played out similar to that with one big exception. The industry faced another setback on March 19 when Renesas, a leading semiconductor supplier, who manufactures about two-thirds of all chips in the auto industry, experienced a significant fire at their Naka 3 facility. Multiple Tier 1s who supply global OEMs sourced their chips from this facility, including nine Tier 1s who supply us at Ford. Now Renesas expects, it will return to full capacity in July and they're making great progress. While most of the chips for our modules for this facility are definitely dual sourced, Ford and others are facing additional constraints. And we've yet to see significant new chip capacity come online for our industry. Estimates project the full recovery of the auto chip supply will stretch into fourth quarter of this year and possibly even into 2022 making industry volume recovery in the second half of this year even more challenging. As you can imagine, we are working this issue 24x7 and engaging with key political leaders and decision makers globally, as well as of course our supply chain. Ford relationship with the new Biden administration rests on our distinctive profile that we assemble more vehicles and have more US auto jobs than any other competitor. It's also well recognized that Ford sided with California on greenhouse gas regulations when that wasn't the easy choice to make. So from COVID, PPE to the current semiconductor crisis, to batteries for EVs, this past year has vividly spotlighted the importance of improving domestic supply chain for both our industry and our country. Now we found the White House and the new cabinet engaging, accessible and responsive. We look forward to continued close working relationship as the country formulates policies to facilitate the transformation from iced above and finally address infrastructure deficits. As you would expect, we're committed to learn from this crisis to be a much stronger company. We're taking this opportunity to revamp our supply chain to eliminate vulnerabilities down the road. This is especially relevant as we consider not only semiconductors, but also battery cells and other commodities critical to our modernization and transformation. We're also learning as we operate in this extraordinary low stock high demand environment in the US and around the world that we will see a leaner, more efficient company in the future, we're getting more fit. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to John.\nJohn Lawler: Thank you, Jim. So heading into 2021, the run rate of our business was on track to deliver 8 billion to 9 billion in adjusted EBIT and that's up about 33% versus 2019. And that, of course, is all before the impact of global semiconductor shortage. So our confidence in the stronger run rate is built on the durable changes that we've made to improve our returns, improve our cash flow and of course provides us financial flexibility to invest in growth. And these improvements were embedded in our original 2021 outlook. So for example, after shifting an overwhelming majority of our capital to our franchise strengths like trucks and utilities, we refreshed our product portfolio, we lowered our average showroom age and shifted our mix to our higher margin vehicles. And as a result, relative to 2019, the increase in our average transaction prices in the US was $1900 more per unit than the industry average. Now, also the tough choices we made to redesign our overseas businesses started to turn the tide. Rationalizing manufacturing footprints, strengthening the product portfolios, focusing relentlessly on cost and investing in areas of growth and strength are now producing results. Another item we've also talked to you about is warranty. Over the last three years, our warranty expense is increased by more than $2 billion. Now, we've addressed this issue through changes in design, how we inspect vehicles, how we work with suppliers on quality, and now how we're using connected data to identify issues early in the process and drive quality improvements. Now, this quarter, we delivered a $400 million improvement in warranty expense year-over-year, and we're intent on accelerating this positive progress. So these are just a few - three of the many examples of how the trajectory of our business is changing and what gave us the confidence when we set our original targets for 2021. Now, let me turn to this quarter. Wholesales declined 6% and in most cases that's due to the chip constraints. Now despite the declines in wholesales, revenue grew 6% aided by higher net pricing and favorable mix. We delivered 4.8 billion in adjusted EBIT, and an adjusted EBIT margin of 13.3%. And as expected, adjusted EBIT, including an investment gain of 900 million from a Rivian funding round that they had in January, so that was included as well. And then adjusted free cash flow was negative 400 million. The global semiconductor shortage reduced our planned Q1 volume by about 17% or 200,000 units. And that's consistent with the 10% to 20% range of expected losses that we shared with you in February. In Q1, we fully offset the EBIT impact of the loss volume, but we reduced incentives as part of the industry wide response to tight dealer inventories and that's especially in North America. We optimized the mix of our production to build our higher margin higher demand vehicles. We also reduced our structural costs in areas including manufacturing and advertising. We improved results in our FCSD parts business and in our joint ventures. And we benefited from strong used vehicle prices in Ford Credit as customers and dealers drove up demand for used vehicles as new vehicle supply sell. So some of these improvements, like the lower manufacturing costs and the robust pricing improvement, we do expect those to moderate as the industry returns to full production and dealer inventories rebound. Now, our adjusted free cash flow in the quarter of negative 400 million was significantly lower than our 4.8 billion of adjusted EBIT. Now, there's three main factors that contributed to this gap. First, our gain on Rivian was non-cash. Second, in the quarter, we grew inventory by $2.2 billion. Now, this includes parts for vehicles we could not build due to the lack of chips, but it also included approximately 22,000 vehicles. Those are primarily in North America that are awaiting installation of chip related components and so some of this inventory impact though was offset by a growth in payables. And third is timing differences. Now, this primarily relates to the reserves for customer allowances for incentives and warranty. This reserve - that reserve fell by $1.6 billion in the quarter. The vehicle incentive portion is based on the number of vehicles awaiting sale and dealer inventory, and the expected incentive per unit and both of those fell in the quarter due to the supply disruption. Now, we do expect that working capital and the timing differences to normalize as the semiconductor supply is restored, if dealer stocks rebound and incentives return to more normal levels, and we believe this process will take several quarters and will most likely extend into 2022. Our strong balance sheet provides considerable flexibility to navigate times of stress such as this chip shortage while also investing in growth. So we ended the quarter with over 31 billion of cash and 47 billion of liquidity, which includes our recent 2.3 billion convertible issuance. We will continue to be very proactive in managing our capital structure. Overall, our business units did a fantastic job prioritizing newly launched products, making sure that we process customer orders and high margin vehicles quickly. And that was all in a supply constrained environment and the strong customer response to Mach-E affirms our choice to shift more capital for best, including investments to in source key elements of the value chain necessary for competitive and sustainable profitability. So let me share a few of the highlights from the quarter. In North America, wholesales declined 14% while revenue increased 5%. Revenue was aided by strong net pricing and favorable mix, robust customer demand for our new product portfolio, tight industry wide inventories and favorable cost performance on a year-over-year basis and that included warranty. All of that helped us deliver 2.9 billion of EBIT and a margin of 12.8% which was North America's highest margin in five years. In South America, wholesales and revenue declined 70% and 40% respectively, and that reflects the exit of unprofitable products. The renewed focus on strengths like Ranger, Transit and key imports drove our best quarterly EBIT since 2013 and our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement. In Europe, wholesale declined 4% as revenue grew 13%, aided by improved product mix, led by our commercial vehicles and net pricing. These actions together with our continued focus on cost delivered 341 million in EBIT with a margin of 4.8%. In China, China delivered strong growth in both wholesale and revenue. EBIT was about breakeven, which marked the fourth consecutive quarter of improvement, supported by strength in Lincoln, Ford near premium utilities and commercial vehicles. In fact, Lincoln now produces 90% of its products locally, was profitable, posting its best ever Q1 retail sales, nearly doubling its share on a year-over-year basis. And commercial vehicle sales were also strong and now comprise 48% of Ford's total China sales. In IMG, growth both wholesales revenue - grew both wholesales and revenue as they focused on their franchise strengths of Ranger and Everest. And IMG achieved its best quarterly EBIT, reflecting strong cost performance, net pricing, and favorable exchange. All markets in IMG were profitable except for India. And IMG also committed to invest 1 billion to expand Ranger capacity in our South Africa export hub to meet customer demand in more than 100 global markets. In mobility, our AV business continues to invest in refining its go-to-market strategy. It added a new 140,000 square foot command center in Miami and along with Argo AI is simulating ride hail and delivery across six cities. And I'd be remiss not to highlight the continued strength of our Ford Credit business, which delivered 1 billion in EBIT in the quarter. Now turning to guidance, as we entered 2021, we were among the first to identify the potential for a 10% to 20% adverse impact in volume in the first half of the year, due to the growing chip constraints. We said at that time that this risk had the potential to reduce our full year adjusted EBIT by $1 billion to $2.5 billion. That would take us off our original target of 8 billion to 9 billion in adjusted EBIT. We've updated our outlook to include the expanded impact of the global chip shortage, and that's largely driven by the Renesas fire. While the situation is a significant headwind, we have definitive actions to address a full range of potential outcomes. So we now expect to lose about 50% of our planned Q2 production, an increase from the 17% loss in Q1, making Q2 the trough for our performance this year. Now, while we expect the flow of chips from Renesas to be restored in July, we and many in the industry now believe the global shortage may not be fully resolved until 2022. So our outlook now assumes we lose roughly 10% of planned second half production. In total, we believe the shortage for the year will drive a loss of about 1.1 million wholesale units, which translates to about 2.5 billion EBIT. That headwind - and that headwind in EBIT is net of recovery actions for the year. Now this EBIT impact was the high end of the range we gave in February, and brings our full year adjusted EBIT guidance range to between 5.5 billion and 6.5 billion. And it's very important to highlight that even though our expected volume loss for the year has more than doubled. We have worked to contain the EBIT in back to the high end of our original range. But we now also expect full year adjusted free cash flow of 500 million to 1.5 billion, and this includes a 3 billion adverse impact from semiconductors. The semiconductor impact on cash is 500 million worse than the impact on EBIT due to timing differences and the working capital impacts that will recover once a run rate of production is fully restored, dealer stocks return to more normal levels and incentives rebound. Our Q2 free cash flow will be significantly negative. And that's despite additional Ford Credit distributions driven by our adoption of the updated tax accounting standard, which reduces our tax allocation of Ford Credit and supports additional Ford Credit distributions. However, we expect our cash and liquidity to remain healthy throughout the year, providing us with considerable flexibility to manage the present situation. And this supports our growing confidence in the resilience of our business and our ability to effectively navigate the challenge just as we navigated the COVID related production disruptions last year. So now I'd like to turn it back to Jim for a few comments about the Capital Markets Day.\nJim Farley: Thanks John. Before we turn it over to questions, I want to reiterate how proud I'm with this Ford team for its commitment to deliver on our plan, to fix automotive, to modernize the company, and to find ways to disrupt our business and the traditional auto industry to create value that will be rewarded - that will reward our stakeholders. On May 26, we will hold a virtual presentation for investment community where we plan to deep dive into our plan as Lynn said. We're going to cover how we're going to lead the electric vehicle revolution in areas that we're strong at Ford. Number two, we're going to build out our industry leading commercial vehicle business with products, but as well services that lead to growth and new revenue streams. And we're going to leverage our connected vehicles to transform the customer experience and truly shift Ford from a more traditional OEM to a company where the manufacture and sale of the vehicle is just the very first step, and then ever improving always on and far more rewarding customer experience. I so look forward to speaking to all of you soon as we continue our effort to create a Ford that can compete and especially win in this exciting new era of our industry. So with that, let's start the Q&A.\nOperator: All right. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is going to come from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research.\nRod Lache: Hi, everybody. Can you hear me? Hello?\nOperator: Yes, we can hear you.\nRod Lache: Okay. Look, I wanted to just maybe get a little bit more clarification on the guidance. I think everybody understands that the underlying guidance ex the semiconductor shortage impact isn't really changing. And I don't think anyone would react to that at all if it wasn't for how surprisingly strong Q1 was. You almost did $5 billion of EBIT, including the gain and $4 billion excluding it. So the numbers obviously are going to be pretty low for the rest of the year. I guess my questions on this are, was there first of all, an unusual gain on incentives for inventory at dealers in Q1? Could Q2 actually be as low as Q2 of last year? And then even more importantly, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about whether we can extrapolate anything from these kinds of numbers that you did a double-digit margin in North America, 5% Europe looks like some pretty good warranty improvement. So when the dust settles, what do you think we can pull out of this as we think about 2022?\nJohn Lawler: Yes. Hi, Rod. Thanks. Good afternoon. That's a lot there. Let me see if I can unpack that and do justice to the question. So as you said, the run rate to the business is $8 billion to $9 billion. And without chips, we clearly believe that's where we would be. And I think you're seeing come through the quarter a combination of things, as I said, in my remarks, you're seeing the strength of the underlying businesses improving and you're seeing that come through. You saw that in the redesign of our overseas operations. You saw that in warranty expense improving, right? Those are two things that we said we needed to improve in our business as we move forward through the redesign, and you're seeing that come through. You're also seeing the strength of our new products. Now, it's a little opaque, I think, for people to say, well, you also saw considerable pricing opportunity because of supply and demand imbalances. That is true. But so we go back and we look at what's happened with the pricing for our products, since we started the redesign, the refresh. And that's where we come back to. Since 2019, if you look at our price increases, our average transaction price increase compared to what's happened in the industry, our transaction prices have increased $1900 more than the industry. So that strength is flowing through. Now we had additional pricing opportunity in Q1 due to the supply demand and - supply and demand imbalance. And so that hit the quarter as well. We also saw a very strong mix in the quarter. As we had lower production, so we optimized the production to our higher margin and higher mix vehicles. So we saw that flow through as well. So you're seeing that combination happen and impact as in Q1. Now remember for the year, as we go through the year, we're also going to see a significant headwind from commodities. We saw very little commodity impact in Q1. That's because we still had our contracts from last year in place and we had our hedging. And so as we go through the year, we expect as contracts roll off, and we've seen the commodity prices increase primarily for aluminum, steel and in precious metals, we expect to see about a $2.5 billion increase in commodities Q2 through Q4. So that's going to hit us as we go through the rest of the year. We also won't have the non-recurrence of the $900 million Rivian gain. And we also expect that as we go through the quarter, and we get to more normalized levels of production albeit we said 10% lower in the second-half, we should start to see more and a gradual normalization of those incentives that we experienced in the first quarter the benefit of that. And then at Ford Credit, we did benefit again in the first quarter from the strong residual values and we do expect those to moderate as we go through the rest of the year. So we've taken all that into account as we've gone through. And I'd have to say that, what's encouraging to me and what the team has been able to do is we've been able to maintain the impact of the semiconductor chips to that high end of our range, the $2.5 billion, despite the volume impact growing significantly.\nRod Lache: Yes. Thanks for that. Could you maybe - just to ask this a different way, the $8 billion to $9 billion guidance, excluding the semiconductor impact, that includes things like the inflation from commodities and so forth, it does include Rivian as well. But maybe you could just speak to at a high level, can we think about that $8 billion to $9 billion is kind of a launching point, if we wanted to think about bridging to next year? Is that sort of the run rate of profitability for the business? And there's obviously adjustments in warranty and South America restructuring, new product and things. Maybe you could just speak to that and how we should be thinking about the run rate of profitability?\nJohn Lawler: Absolutely, that is the run rate leading into next year. And we still have new products, Bronco, coming this year, the two and four door. We have some surprises Jim talked about, we have the F-150 Electric, we have the Transit Electric. So we have more products coming next year. We're going to continue to be aggressive. Our cost structure pushing that. And the other thing that we're learning coming out of this situation that we're in is how do you operate in a lean environment? And we've learned some quite a few good things about operating with leaner inventory. So I think there's opportunities there as well as we head into 2022. So absolutely, the eight to nine is a launching pad, we see that as a launching pad into 2022.\nRod Lache: Okay. And just lastly, it sounds like there's some permanency to this transition to the lean inventory sales model. Could you speak to what kind of changes you're expecting here to distribution?\nJohn Lawler: So we've been doing quite a bit, of course, to get customers vehicles, to move people to more on order process, we've made changes to our processes to lower the gap between the time and order goes into the time we can deliver the order. And we're also seeing that as we look at making these types of changes to modernizing or improving our processes in a lower inventory environment, you get benefits across the patch, right? It would allow us to have lower capital required at Ford Credit, if we have to finance less dealer inventory for our dealers. That could free up some capital to invest in other growth areas. We would see better quality, because we'd have fresher vehicles and vehicles wouldn't be sitting on classes long. We'd have improved dealer profitability, because they wouldn't be financing that floor plan and we'd have lower incentives. We believe we'd have low incentives, because we'd have quick returning vehicles and we'd have higher orders. So as we're working through this lower inventory and these opportunities that we're seeing today, we're working on how we make them a normal part of our business as we go forward.\nRod Lache: Okay. All right. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question is going to come from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America.\nJohn Murphy: Good afternoon, everybody. I just wanted to follow-up on that line of reasoning. I mean, you guys are kind of apologizing in some ways for the good environment and what it's kind of forced you into in this lean inventory situation. Obviously, let's forget about the second, third and fourth quarter because they're going to be disrupted by the chip shortage. But I mean, you're seeing and you saw us in the third quarter of last year, these incredible margins, particularly North America, and then with the international one second, but that's being positive. I mean, you're kind of rolling off this list of things that have happened and that you may be able to maintain. Why wouldn't you maintain them and maintain this supply demand balance or imbalance as you call it, but really some people might say it's a great balance, and really focus on the higher mix vehicles and drive similar performance. I mean, we just seen it happen third quarter, fourth quarter, there was some launch costs, but you saw it happen in the third quarter, you saw it happen in the first quarter. I mean, why would it - why would you let it reverse? I mean, and obviously, there's some industry dynamics that are - other people are in the - other companies are in the same situation, but you yourselves are controlling this - can control this going forward on your product mix and what you do with your own production and it's produced wonderful results. I mean, why would you let it reverse?\nJim Farley: We won't. Hi, it's Jim. I want to make it really clear John. That's not our intention. We're a smart team, we're running our business responsibly and there's real goodness here. This is - personally 10 years ago, I saw this industry go from 30-day supply way back up to 100 in 10 years, we're not going to let that happen. This is a better way to run our business, it's even more important now why? We get to move online. We get to use a reservation system with customers for most customers, when products are lean. We can simplify our sentence, we have the most complicated go-to-market system, I think on planet Earth. We could simplify all of that with tighter inventories. And it's better for the fitness. It also requires our industrial system to be more responsive. So no, I want to make it extremely clear to everyone, we are going to run our business with a lower day supply than we have had in recent past because that's good for our company and good for customers.\nJohn Murphy: Okay and investors too, which is important. And I guess as you think about the experiment or not the experiment of what you're executing in South America of backing away and putting just a few vehicles - supply a few vehicles into that market, it seems like Europe and China are kind of heading in that same direction. I mean, are you learning - I mean, I know its early days in South America, from that business plan. And I mean, and we're looking at Europe, that will be centered more around commercial vehicles, with maybe just a few easy passenger vehicles, and then China, which will be mostly Lincoln, and maybe some commercial vehicles. And then IMG, which is the Transit and the Ranger and that's it. And we'll see some stability in these international regions that hopefully will be profitable, but we won't always kind of be running around freaking out about whack a mole in one of the regions blowing up on us. It just seems like you're getting a handle on South America, you getting handle on these other regions. I mean, is this slimmed down product offering and maybe smaller size with more stability and better profitability really the direction that you're heading in these international regions?\nJim Farley: Yes, we had a billion-dollar swing year-over-year. We've been at this for a long time in Europe. We're entering a new phase in Europe. So John, absolutely, the focus in Europe is in commercial vehicles and passion specialty passenger cars. In international markets it's the Ranger and derivatives of the Ranger. And in China, there's a - China like North America will have a more diverse product range than the other markets. But let's be really clear, we're doubling down on our iconic nameplates and building out a family of products. We just localized Explorer in China, it's doing great. Lincoln is profitable. I mean the growth rate in Lincoln in China and the profitability improvement as we localize to 90% as John said, it's been very encouraging to us. So in China and North America, we'll focus on these really passionate segments, where we think we naturally do well. But the big change is not just improving the profitability by simplifying where we compete. The big change in the company is going to be investing to an always on relationship with the customer. That is the real change at Ford. The change of simplifying our lineup and focusing on markets where we can be profitable is necessary. It's the important foundation. But what's sufficiency for us is to evolve into a different model with the customer. And you'll hear more about that in Capital Markets Day.\nJohn Murphy: It's great and just quickly on FMCC, obviously, reserves are probably going to stay stronger this year. I think you're probably being a little bit conservative there on your expectations. But if you also once again think about this focus on mix and price and not over producing, the net beneficiary also is FMCC. You mentioned the balance sheet being potentially a little bit smaller in the future as you can do more with less maybe everywhere. What is FMCC going to look like and I think we know, traditionally kind of think about $100 billion balance sheet. But it sounds like it might be somewhat smaller and have better returns and maybe more stability in it where are the net benefits in FMCC overtime as the strategy emerges.\nMarion Harris: Hey, John, it's Marion. I think you've covered a lot of it. We do see used vehicle prices being stronger throughout this supply shock. And so they're going to remain strong for quite some time, just as John said earlier. And I think that's going to provide a lot of support for new vehicle pricing as well. The 100 billion you mentioned is about size of the US balance sheet. The Ford Credit in total bear in that 130 billion this year. So we're down quite a bit. But it's all dealer for plan and so that's affecting - that's a downside to our profitability, but on the other side of it is the strong used car prices.\nJohn Murphy: Okay, but could that be somewhat structural going forward? Or you really think this as transitory through the course of this year?\nMarion Harris: At this stage, I'd say it's transitory.\nJohn Murphy: Okay, all right. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Colin Langan with Wells Fargo.\nColin Langan: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to step back. If we look at the semi-issue, do you think you're more impacted than the industry? We're just trying to understand if you lose 1.1 million, do you think you're able to recoup those in 2022? Or other competitors maybe kind of sweep in and take some of them because they have maybe a better supply chain? Just trying to understand, maybe you could kind of recoup that loss volume into next year?\nJim Farley: Great question. Thank you, Colin. I would say it's difficult to make that judgment. If you look into change of inventory, which is I think, a great predictor of wholesale back in the quarter competitively. I think most of the major brands were impacted almost equally. So a lot of different news releases, a lot of different opaque data coming out. I can understand why you asked a question. We don't know yet, how this will play out competitively. But we do know, the first quarter actually played out a lot more evenly than maybe even we thought. As it goes on in the second half and into 2022, we're starting to grow in confidence that we can support our recovery volume, we think it's prudent to have the 10% in our planning, but we are going to work very hard to make sure that doesn't happen. It's just too early to tell. The Renesas impact we think is going to be largely finished by the second quarter, if they execute, and they're just in the middle of that right now. And so that kind of leads us back with the time when these foundries and how persistent that's going to be. And right now, I just think it's a little too early to declare what that's going to look like. But what we do know is the first quarter kind of turned out that most major players except for some of the companies who had buffer stock and saw this coming. They weren't affected. But I think Renesas now swept up almost everyone in the industry, just hard to tell how lumpy that's going to be across different brands.\nColin Langan: No, thank you. That's a very helpful color. Just more strategically, you made the announcement on Ion Park yesterday. I mean, how should we be viewing this? I mean, is this an effort to make your own batteries? Or is this trying to build that expertise in house so you could provide that to your battery partners? I'm not sure if we should read more than to that announcement.\nJim Farley: Thank you so much for asking this question. The answer is this is a very important announcement from Ford strategically. In the first inning we could buy off the shelf and cherry pick the technology and energy density and the cost. We've totally entered a different zone now, with our volumes - planned volumes going up so much. So we've already made the decision of vertically integrating the company. We're now building motors e-axles now. We've been writing our own battery management software for quite some time. And now it's time for us to lock in on the latest technology and to have a secure cell production relationship. There's no news to make today. But the reason why that Ion Park announcement is so important is because it's our place where we will learn. We will learn about with our partners how to transition to the very best in technology, energy density, the minerals, all the supply chain for batteries and cells, but also the manufacturability. And ultimately, I think to be competitive in this industry, a major brand like Ford will have to vertically integrate all the way through the system. It's just too early to make a bunch of announcements. But this is our dream team, who will be developing that capability in the company.\nColin Langan: Okay, thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC capital markets.\nJoseph Spak: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Actually I wanted to go back to something Rod brought up earlier. I know you mentioned 700,000 units out in the second quarter. Of course, we don't know what you were originally planning. So is it likely the second quarter looks similar to the second quarter of last year? And somewhat related to your point John, like the $2.5 billion headwind for the year is really just the high end of your prior range, but is the gross number higher? And that's been offset by other factors such as stronger pricing and maybe Ford Credit that bring it back down to that high end?\nJim Farley: Yes, that's - thanks, great question. So it is similar to what we saw last year. We're going to lose about 700,000 units, which said was 50%, roughly 50% of the planned production we had. Maybe you look at second quarter of last year and it was very similar to that. And I would say, as we got into this - through the quarter, we have seen the team identify opportunities to offset more of the impact than we had originally thought. That's why we're able to contain a much higher miss on the volumes within that original guidance and so the teams have been working extremely hard to bring the goodness that we're seeing in the core run rate of the business through and then to find other opportunities, so absolutely, in both of those.\nJoseph Spak: Okay. And then second question - glad to hear the discussion about trying to keep dealer inventories more balanced. I guess the other lesson that could be learned here, and I'm curious Jim, [indiscernible] whether you have any preliminary thoughts is, do you just need to - we've gone through a couple of these crisis, do you need to change how you think about assuring supply of key components including chips, and or that sort of keeping more inventory historically, maybe it's more direct buy and not relying on Tier 1s? And if so, maybe again, at a high level, how should we think about that practically working? Like, where in the value chain will that inventory be stored? And is that maybe a cost you're willing to incur for greater stability in the future?\nJim Farley: Thank you. The answer is, yes. We have learned a lot through this crisis that can be applied to many critical components. That will be the essence of our new business, our modernized Ford, and it goes far beyond semi chips, there are other components that are really key enablers. It was very interesting for me, personally as the CEO, to talk to many of our colleagues in other industries and to find out how common buffer stocks are and how common direct buys are for the width of boundaries. Even if the company still buys the components with the chips on them from a supplier, they still negotiated a direct deal. These are all on the table of Ford right now, as you can imagine, yet we're also thinking about what this means for the world of batteries, and silicon and all sorts of other components that are really mission critical for our company and our capability. When I look at the company and what we need to vertically integrate, these are the areas. These are the areas we're going to bet on moving inside the company for core competency. And as we do that the supply chain becomes even more critical, but we also know more about it. So thank you for the question and you can imagine everything is on the table like you mentioned, from buffer stocks to direct deals with the foundries.\nJoseph Spak: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.\nRyan Brinkman: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Obviously, a standout performance in North America despite downtime and costs associated with the F-150 launch and the semiconductor shortage and a lot of moving pieces with regard to the guide and the rest of the year with the changes impacting the chip issue and now the Renesas fire, et cetera. So I thought maybe it would be great to just sort of zero in on your performance in the first quarter itself and get your thoughts on what a 12.3% North American margin in 1Q might imply for margin potential in a normalized environment. Kind of looking at the historical cadence of North America margin over the past five years or the five years ended in 2019. It seems like 1Q margin averages just about 40 BPS higher than the full year amount. And so maybe you're already operating in 1Q at almost a 12% kind of annual run rate. And that's amidst an F-150 launch and before any contributions from the Bronco. So how would you rate the underlying performance in North America? And does that performance in 1Q suggest once all the supply chain dust settles a stronger than targeted 10% regional margin?\nJohn Lawler: Thanks, Ryan. So I think we have to go back and just ground ourselves again, in that run rate of the business of 8 billion to 9 billion. And I don't want to get too far out ahead of ourselves on North America and what this quarter might mean for the run rate going forward. Given as you said, there's just a lot of moving parts within this quarter. I think the team's done a great job of managing through it. We really saw the 8 billion to 9 billion as the run rate heading into '22. We're going to do everything we can to continue to drive margin improvement, both here and overseas. And the team is focused and Jim's pushing us really hard to continue to modernize and improve the business in every place that we can. But as far as trying to predict coming out of this quarter what that means for the margin in North America in putting a number on the table. I'm not going to do that right now.\nRyan Brinkman: Okay, thanks.\nJim Farley: And Ryan just - it's Jim. Quickly, I'll be really quick. I've been in this business worked for different brands, I can't remember a time in my life, in my career, to have had so many hot products in one market like North America as Ford does right now. I mean, Mach-E sold out, Bronco Sport sold out, F Series sold out, Super Duty sold out, we have a very - our fresh new lineup is not only fresh, but it seems to be hitting the mark of the side case of the customer right now. And I don't know where that's going to take us. Yes, a really good question. I don't know where that's going to take us. But I do know it feels like we're going to be chasing demand for quite some time.\nRyan Brinkman: That's helpful color. Let me ask just lastly, around the commodity inflation you're seeing and your ability to price for it. You've called out to 2.5 billion headwind for the year, you did take 3 billion of price in 1Q, although I'm cognizant, there's a lot that goes into that calculation including relative to new launches, et cetera. I think pricing is historically positive on launch models. Thankfully, as you mentioned, you have a lot of those this year, but it tends to be negative for carryover models, and I'm just thinking back to like, 2011, 2012 kind of coming out of the financial crisis in '08, '09 after a lot of final assembly capacity have been taken out every call you and others reporting on the relative anomaly of positive pricing on even no carryover model. So I'm just curious if we could see something similar now, say if the commodities headwind were to grow worse if the supply demand dynamic puts the industry in a position to pass really all the incremental costs on to the consumer or how do you see maybe the share of the burden taking place maybe the higher commodity is being - the cost of it being shared between yourselves versus the consumer versus suppliers, dealer margin. I don't know what you think.\nJim Farley: Yes, I would say, we're definitely feeling the commodity headwind, as John said and inflation, it feels like we're seeing inflation in variety parts of our industry kind of in ways we haven't seen for many years. On the other hand, it feels like it's all due to a lot of one timers as the economy comes out of lockdown. So I think it's a bit too early to declare the run rate, where it's going to be, it's just too hard to tell from my standpoint. I will note though, based on your question that many of the vehicles that are supposedly ageing at Ford or normally would be ageing are still relatively new. Super Duty is relatively new, Explorer is relatively new. Yes, Escape - we have all the Lincoln lineup is brand new. So normally we wouldn't have so much new at the same time. And even the vehicles that are one or two years old are still relatively new in their segments.\nRyan Brinkman: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our last question for the day will come from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank.\nEmmanuel Rosner: So I'm still trying to better understand the $8 billion to $9 billion run rate, which is unchanged from your view earlier in the year. So let me try and ask it this way, did the first quarter earnings results play out as you had expected at the beginning of the year? And if it played out better, what are some of the expected offsets which are non-semi related that would prompt you to keep the same basis as the underlying profitability?\nJohn Lawler: No, the quarter did not play out as we originally expected, right. It came in much better, we did not expect that we would be able to more than offset all of the impact of the chips in the quarter, which was 17%, or about 200,000 units. So we saw incredible opportunity there from the industry wide supply and demand imbalance. So we saw pricing increase significantly. We also then, because of the supply imbalance, we really pushed hard on mix. So those were things that allowed us to improve the quarter. We did not expect to use vehicle prices to increase 14% in the quarter. And they did and that helped. And that was part of what's happened with Ford Credit and the performance of Ford Credit. And then as we go through the year Emmanuel, one of the things that did not hit us in the first quarter that's going to hit us through the rest of the year is the commodity cost increases that come in quite significantly through Q2 to Q4. So those are some of the things that are coming back and are going to come through in the second half of the year. And then the other thing is as production normalizes a bit and supply and demand comes worn balance, we do expect that we should see some of this pricing that we saw in the first quarter moderate a bit. And we should see some of that happen through the second quarter - through the second half of the year.\nEmmanuel Rosner: Is the commodities impact larger, much larger than you had though originally?\nJohn Lawler: When we had first looked at it, we thought it was going to be significant, somewhere between 1.5 billion to 2 billion. So it's slightly higher than where we had thought coming into the year.\nEmmanuel Rosner: Okay, and then follow up question. I find very impressive some of the improvement that you're showing in the first quarter in terms of net pricing and cost in some of the international markets and showing some good traction with the fitness initiative. I was hoping you could comment directly on Europe in particular around - and South America around the sustainability of some of these performance that we're seeing? How much you think is sort of market driven versus some of your own actions, both on the net pricing side, and also obviously on the cost side, the sustainability of those.\nJohn Lawler: Yes, so in Europe this is the second strong quarter that Ford of Europe is printed for us. And I think what you're seeing there is the redesign flowing through and showing up significantly again in this quarter. And of course, the market was aided a bit by what we're seeing the dynamics in this quarter, but the fundamental underlying strength of the business in Europe has improved. We took over a billion dollars of structural costs out as we relooked at the footprint. We've moved into commercial vehicles and improved our share there. We have a higher mix of utilities. All of that is providing a much stronger business for us in Europe. And you've seen that two quarters in a row now. Then when we look at South America, we reduced our volumes significantly and we improved our profitability. And that just comes back to the point that we brought to the market and we are and now we're going to focus on our higher margin vehicle or smaller footprint or smaller business down there leaning into Ranger in Transit, which are good vehicles in the market. And they're strong vehicles for us as a company and so you're starting to see that redesign really take hold.\nEmmanuel Rosner: Good to hear. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And with that, we must conclude today's Ford Motor Company first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. We do appreciate your participation and ask that you please disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jim Farley",
            "content": "Thanks, Lynn. Hello, everyone. Thanks so much for joining us today. Our first quarter of the year really defies an easy explanation or a pithy sound bite. But if I had to sum up one way, it would be this. We're executing on our plan. And I'm excited to say Ford is becoming a stronger, more resilient company that can deliver under pressure, manage risks and seize opportunities, all while generating consistent returns for our stakeholders. In the quarter, we earned $4.8 billion in adjusted EBIT. It's our best quarterly adjusted EBIT ever. And we achieved these results in the midst of a persistent global pandemic, and an unprecedented supply shock tied to the global semiconductor shortage. We mobilized the global team as we always do in these times of crisis. And we rapidly adjusted to the realities that we were seeing. Our team very skillfully navigated the supply constraints, through sharp yield management, and a relentless focus on turning around our automotive operations. That means improving our launch performance, improving our quality, enhancing our brand, strengthening our customer relationships, and improving our go-to-market execution. And Ford Credit, which in our view, is the best automotive finance captive in the industry, also delivered an outstanding quarter. Aided by higher prices, our results benefited from the industry-wide imbalance of supply and demand, given the semiconductor shortage. However, we also delivered improvements that will persist over time, including our global redesign in our overseas operations, which contribute to the largest swing in year-over-year profitability for those operations that we've seen. The benefit of our incredibly fresh portfolio refresh, which lowers the average showroom age now in the U.S. to just three years. And, of course, we made progress on cost across the business. As we share with you today, there are more white waters moments ahead for us that we have to navigate. The semiconductor shortage and the impact to production will get worse before it gets better. In fact, we believe our second quarter will be the trough for this year. We have worked to do to get our industry footprint back to firing on all cylinders or maybe should I say fully charged. Overall, though, I'm proud of the progress we made as a team. As our underlying strength at Ford improves, enhances our cash flow, access to capital, gives us financial flexibility to modernize and disrupt our business while investing in growth. We are very intentional about this because these are the catalyst factors that will transform Ford into a form of vibrant company that will deliver not only our iconic must-have products, but also and I would argue more importantly, and always on ever improving customer experience for both our retail and commercial customers. So let me share a few milestones from the quarter. Turning around auto. Over the past four years, our overseas markets lost a total of $5.8 billion in EBIT. This quarter, the regions delivered roughly $500 million of EBIT, that's a $1 billion improvement year-over-year. Let's look at those must-have services and products. We'll start with the new F-150, which gained share and also gained share of revenue. And it had new innovations like Pro Power Onboard, which showed again, that we understand Ford customers afford these truck customers better than anyone. And the Bronco Sport is off to a fast start bringing 60% new customers to our brand. The new Mustang Mach-E is proving to be a hit with customers just a few days on lot with very strong demand in North America, now in Europe and coming to China. And it's also bringing in new customers to the brand, almost 70%. And we still have the Big Bronco, the two and the four door with incredible order bank, the F-150 Electric and the E-Transit, and we have some surprises for you as well. Stay tuned. Just as we are in the early stages of our electric vehicle plans, we're only scratching the surface of our customers benefiting from our fully connected vehicles. We have successfully deployed our first major over their update software updates to hundreds of thousands of customers for Mach-E and F-150. And this pace will only accelerate the next several years, making our vehicles better over time. Later this year, for example, we will offer our very first tested \u2013 fully tested Ford BlueCruise hands-free driving technology, which will be delivered over the air to Mustang E and F-150 customers. And by 2028, we expect to have more than 33 million over the air updated capable vehicles on the road. Now this installed base gives Ford a significant opportunity to develop products. And for us, very exciting new services that will transform the way we deliver products to our customers. They'll make significant improvements to our customers' experience and drive quality of our vehicles. And we're on track to lead the electric revolution in areas of Ford strength. For example, we announced we're investing $1 billion in the new electric vehicle manufacturing center in Germany, where by 2023, just a few years from now, we'll be assembling our very first high volume all electric passenger car for Europe. A year later in 2024, all Ford Europe commercial vehicles will be zero emissions capable. And by 2030, all Ford European passenger cars will be all electric. Now these investments are part \u2013 just part of our $22 billion commitment to lead the electric revolution in areas that we're strong. And yesterday, we announced a very important new development. We have formed a new global battery center of excellence called Ford Ion Park, which will accelerate our research and development of battery as well as battery cell technology, including future battery manufacturing. This only starts to hint at our electric vehicle ambitions. There is so much more to come. Now before I turn it over to John, let me share a bit more about where we and the industry are in semiconductors. When we initially gave guidance in February, we expected that the semiconductor supply chains would remain constrained through the second quarter. And we have an opportunity to begin recovering lost volumes in the second-half. It's kind of played out similar to that with one big exception. The industry faced another setback on March 19 when Renesas, a leading semiconductor supplier, who manufactures about two-thirds of all chips in the auto industry, experienced a significant fire at their Naka 3 facility. Multiple Tier 1s who supply global OEMs sourced their chips from this facility, including nine Tier 1s who supply us at Ford. Now Renesas expects, it will return to full capacity in July and they're making great progress. While most of the chips for our modules for this facility are definitely dual sourced, Ford and others are facing additional constraints. And we've yet to see significant new chip capacity come online for our industry. Estimates project the full recovery of the auto chip supply will stretch into fourth quarter of this year and possibly even into 2022 making industry volume recovery in the second half of this year even more challenging. As you can imagine, we are working this issue 24x7 and engaging with key political leaders and decision makers globally, as well as of course our supply chain. Ford relationship with the new Biden administration rests on our distinctive profile that we assemble more vehicles and have more US auto jobs than any other competitor. It's also well recognized that Ford sided with California on greenhouse gas regulations when that wasn't the easy choice to make. So from COVID, PPE to the current semiconductor crisis, to batteries for EVs, this past year has vividly spotlighted the importance of improving domestic supply chain for both our industry and our country. Now we found the White House and the new cabinet engaging, accessible and responsive. We look forward to continued close working relationship as the country formulates policies to facilitate the transformation from iced above and finally address infrastructure deficits. As you would expect, we're committed to learn from this crisis to be a much stronger company. We're taking this opportunity to revamp our supply chain to eliminate vulnerabilities down the road. This is especially relevant as we consider not only semiconductors, but also battery cells and other commodities critical to our modernization and transformation. We're also learning as we operate in this extraordinary low stock high demand environment in the US and around the world that we will see a leaner, more efficient company in the future, we're getting more fit. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to John. Thanks John. Before we turn it over to questions, I want to reiterate how proud I'm with this Ford team for its commitment to deliver on our plan, to fix automotive, to modernize the company, and to find ways to disrupt our business and the traditional auto industry to create value that will be rewarded - that will reward our stakeholders. On May 26, we will hold a virtual presentation for investment community where we plan to deep dive into our plan as Lynn said. We're going to cover how we're going to lead the electric vehicle revolution in areas that we're strong at Ford. Number two, we're going to build out our industry leading commercial vehicle business with products, but as well services that lead to growth and new revenue streams. And we're going to leverage our connected vehicles to transform the customer experience and truly shift Ford from a more traditional OEM to a company where the manufacture and sale of the vehicle is just the very first step, and then ever improving always on and far more rewarding customer experience. I so look forward to speaking to all of you soon as we continue our effort to create a Ford that can compete and especially win in this exciting new era of our industry. So with that, let's start the Q&A. We won't. Hi, it's Jim. I want to make it really clear John. That's not our intention. We're a smart team, we're running our business responsibly and there's real goodness here. This is - personally 10 years ago, I saw this industry go from 30-day supply way back up to 100 in 10 years, we're not going to let that happen. This is a better way to run our business, it's even more important now why? We get to move online. We get to use a reservation system with customers for most customers, when products are lean. We can simplify our sentence, we have the most complicated go-to-market system, I think on planet Earth. We could simplify all of that with tighter inventories. And it's better for the fitness. It also requires our industrial system to be more responsive. So no, I want to make it extremely clear to everyone, we are going to run our business with a lower day supply than we have had in recent past because that's good for our company and good for customers. Yes, we had a billion-dollar swing year-over-year. We've been at this for a long time in Europe. We're entering a new phase in Europe. So John, absolutely, the focus in Europe is in commercial vehicles and passion specialty passenger cars. In international markets it's the Ranger and derivatives of the Ranger. And in China, there's a - China like North America will have a more diverse product range than the other markets. But let's be really clear, we're doubling down on our iconic nameplates and building out a family of products. We just localized Explorer in China, it's doing great. Lincoln is profitable. I mean the growth rate in Lincoln in China and the profitability improvement as we localize to 90% as John said, it's been very encouraging to us. So in China and North America, we'll focus on these really passionate segments, where we think we naturally do well. But the big change is not just improving the profitability by simplifying where we compete. The big change in the company is going to be investing to an always on relationship with the customer. That is the real change at Ford. The change of simplifying our lineup and focusing on markets where we can be profitable is necessary. It's the important foundation. But what's sufficiency for us is to evolve into a different model with the customer. And you'll hear more about that in Capital Markets Day. Great question. Thank you, Colin. I would say it's difficult to make that judgment. If you look into change of inventory, which is I think, a great predictor of wholesale back in the quarter competitively. I think most of the major brands were impacted almost equally. So a lot of different news releases, a lot of different opaque data coming out. I can understand why you asked a question. We don't know yet, how this will play out competitively. But we do know, the first quarter actually played out a lot more evenly than maybe even we thought. As it goes on in the second half and into 2022, we're starting to grow in confidence that we can support our recovery volume, we think it's prudent to have the 10% in our planning, but we are going to work very hard to make sure that doesn't happen. It's just too early to tell. The Renesas impact we think is going to be largely finished by the second quarter, if they execute, and they're just in the middle of that right now. And so that kind of leads us back with the time when these foundries and how persistent that's going to be. And right now, I just think it's a little too early to declare what that's going to look like. But what we do know is the first quarter kind of turned out that most major players except for some of the companies who had buffer stock and saw this coming. They weren't affected. But I think Renesas now swept up almost everyone in the industry, just hard to tell how lumpy that's going to be across different brands. Thank you so much for asking this question. The answer is this is a very important announcement from Ford strategically. In the first inning we could buy off the shelf and cherry pick the technology and energy density and the cost. We've totally entered a different zone now, with our volumes - planned volumes going up so much. So we've already made the decision of vertically integrating the company. We're now building motors e-axles now. We've been writing our own battery management software for quite some time. And now it's time for us to lock in on the latest technology and to have a secure cell production relationship. There's no news to make today. But the reason why that Ion Park announcement is so important is because it's our place where we will learn. We will learn about with our partners how to transition to the very best in technology, energy density, the minerals, all the supply chain for batteries and cells, but also the manufacturability. And ultimately, I think to be competitive in this industry, a major brand like Ford will have to vertically integrate all the way through the system. It's just too early to make a bunch of announcements. But this is our dream team, who will be developing that capability in the company. Yes, that's - thanks, great question. So it is similar to what we saw last year. We're going to lose about 700,000 units, which said was 50%, roughly 50% of the planned production we had. Maybe you look at second quarter of last year and it was very similar to that. And I would say, as we got into this - through the quarter, we have seen the team identify opportunities to offset more of the impact than we had originally thought. That's why we're able to contain a much higher miss on the volumes within that original guidance and so the teams have been working extremely hard to bring the goodness that we're seeing in the core run rate of the business through and then to find other opportunities, so absolutely, in both of those. Thank you. The answer is, yes. We have learned a lot through this crisis that can be applied to many critical components. That will be the essence of our new business, our modernized Ford, and it goes far beyond semi chips, there are other components that are really key enablers. It was very interesting for me, personally as the CEO, to talk to many of our colleagues in other industries and to find out how common buffer stocks are and how common direct buys are for the width of boundaries. Even if the company still buys the components with the chips on them from a supplier, they still negotiated a direct deal.

When I look at the company and what we need to vertically integrate, these are the areas. These are the areas we're going to bet on moving inside the company for core competency. And as we do that the supply chain becomes even more critical, but we also know more about it. So thank you for the question and you can imagine everything is on the table like you mentioned, from buffer stocks to direct deals with the foundries. And Ryan just - it's Jim. Quickly, I'll be really quick. I've been in this business worked for different brands, I can't remember a time in my life, in my career, to have had so many hot products in one market like North America as Ford does right now. I mean, Mach-E sold out, Bronco Sport sold out, F Series sold out, Super Duty sold out, we have a very - our fresh new lineup is not only fresh, but it seems to be hitting the mark of the side case of the customer right now. And I don't know where that's going to take us. Yes, a really good question. I don't know where that's going to take us.

The 100 billion you mentioned is about size of the US balance sheet. The Ford Credit in total bear in that 130 billion this year. So we're down quite a bit. But it's all dealer for plan and so that's affecting - that's a downside to our profitability, but on the other side of it is the strong used car prices. At this stage, I'd say it's transitory."

            "content": "Thank you, Jim. So heading into 2021, the run rate of our business was on track to deliver 8 billion to 9 billion in adjusted EBIT and that's up about 33% versus 2019. And that, of course, is all before the impact of global semiconductor shortage. So our confidence in the stronger run rate is built on the durable changes that we've made to improve our returns, improve our cash flow and of course provides us financial flexibility to invest in growth. And these improvements were embedded in our original 2021 outlook. So for example, after shifting an overwhelming majority of our capital to our franchise strengths like trucks and utilities, we refreshed our product portfolio, we lowered our average showroom age and shifted our mix to our higher margin vehicles. And as a result, relative to 2019, the increase in our average transaction prices in the US was $1900 more per unit than the industry average. Now, also the tough choices we made to redesign our overseas businesses started to turn the tide. Rationalizing manufacturing footprints, strengthening the product portfolios, focusing relentlessly on cost and investing in areas of growth and strength are now producing results. Another item we've also talked to you about is warranty. Over the last three years, our warranty expense is increased by more than $2 billion. Now, we've addressed this issue through changes in design, how we inspect vehicles, how we work with suppliers on quality, and now how we're using connected data to identify issues early in the process and drive quality improvements. Now, this quarter, we delivered a $400 million improvement in warranty expense year-over-year, and we're intent on accelerating this positive progress. So these are just a few - three of the many examples of how the trajectory of our business is changing and what gave us the confidence when we set our original targets for 2021. Now, let me turn to this quarter. Wholesales declined 6% and in most cases that's due to the chip constraints. Now despite the declines in wholesales, revenue grew 6% aided by higher net pricing and favorable mix. We delivered 4.8 billion in adjusted EBIT, and an adjusted EBIT margin of 13.3%. And as expected, adjusted EBIT, including an investment gain of 900 million from a Rivian funding round that they had in January, so that was included as well. And then adjusted free cash flow was negative 400 million. The global semiconductor shortage reduced our planned Q1 volume by about 17% or 200,000 units. And that's consistent with the 10% to 20% range of expected losses that we shared with you in February. In Q1, we fully offset the EBIT impact of the loss volume, but we reduced incentives as part of the industry wide response to tight dealer inventories and that's especially in North America. We optimized the mix of our production to build our higher margin higher demand vehicles. We also reduced our structural costs in areas including manufacturing and advertising. We improved results in our FCSD parts business and in our joint ventures. And we benefited from strong used vehicle prices in Ford Credit as customers and dealers drove up demand for used vehicles as new vehicle supply sell. So some of these improvements, like the lower manufacturing costs and the robust pricing improvement, we do expect those to moderate as the industry returns to full production and dealer inventories rebound. Now, our adjusted free cash flow in the quarter of negative 400 million was significantly lower than our 4.8 billion of adjusted EBIT. Now, there's three main factors that contributed to this gap. First, our gain on Rivian was non-cash. Second, in the quarter, we grew inventory by $2.2 billion. Now, this includes parts for vehicles we could not build due to the lack of chips, but it also included approximately 22,000 vehicles. Those are primarily in North America that are awaiting installation of chip related components and so some of this inventory impact though was offset by a growth in payables. And third is timing differences. Now, this primarily relates to the reserves for customer allowances for incentives and warranty. This reserve - that reserve fell by $1.6 billion in the quarter. The vehicle incentive portion is based on the number of vehicles awaiting sale and dealer inventory, and the expected incentive per unit and both of those fell in the quarter due to the supply disruption. Now, we do expect that working capital and the timing differences to normalize as the semiconductor supply is restored, if dealer stocks rebound and incentives return to more normal levels, and we believe this process will take several quarters and will most likely extend into 2022. Our strong balance sheet provides considerable flexibility to navigate times of stress such as this chip shortage while also investing in growth. So we ended the quarter with over 31 billion of cash and 47 billion of liquidity, which includes our recent 2.3 billion convertible issuance. We will continue to be very proactive in managing our capital structure. Overall, our business units did a fantastic job prioritizing newly launched products, making sure that we process customer orders and high margin vehicles quickly. And that was all in a supply constrained environment and the strong customer response to Mach-E affirms our choice to shift more capital for best, including investments to in source key elements of the value chain necessary for competitive and sustainable profitability. So let me share a few of the highlights from the quarter. In North America, wholesales declined 14% while revenue increased 5%. Revenue was aided by strong net pricing and favorable mix, robust customer demand for our new product portfolio, tight industry wide inventories and favorable cost performance on a year-over-year basis and that included warranty. All of that helped us deliver 2.9 billion of EBIT and a margin of 12.8% which was North America's highest margin in five years. In South America, wholesales and revenue declined 70% and 40% respectively, and that reflects the exit of unprofitable products. The renewed focus on strengths like Ranger, Transit and key imports drove our best quarterly EBIT since 2013 and our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement. In Europe, wholesale declined 4% as revenue grew 13%, aided by improved product mix, led by our commercial vehicles and net pricing. These actions together with our continued focus on cost delivered 341 million in EBIT with a margin of 4.8%. In China, China delivered strong growth in both wholesale and revenue. EBIT was about breakeven, which marked the fourth consecutive quarter of improvement, supported by strength in Lincoln, Ford near premium utilities and commercial vehicles. In fact, Lincoln now produces 90% of its products locally, was profitable, posting its best ever Q1 retail sales, nearly doubling its share on a year-over-year basis. And commercial vehicle sales were also strong and now comprise 48% of Ford's total China sales. In IMG, growth both wholesales revenue - grew both wholesales and revenue as they focused on their franchise strengths of Ranger and Everest. And IMG achieved its best quarterly EBIT, reflecting strong cost performance, net pricing, and favorable exchange. All markets in IMG were profitable except for India. And IMG also committed to invest 1 billion to expand Ranger capacity in our South Africa export hub to meet customer demand in more than 100 global markets. In mobility, our AV business continues to invest in refining its go-to-market strategy. It added a new 140,000 square foot command center in Miami and along with Argo AI is simulating ride hail and delivery across six cities. And I'd be remiss not to highlight the continued strength of our Ford Credit business, which delivered 1 billion in EBIT in the quarter. Now turning to guidance, as we entered 2021, we were among the first to identify the potential for a 10% to 20% adverse impact in volume in the first half of the year, due to the growing chip constraints. We said at that time that this risk had the potential to reduce our full year adjusted EBIT by $1 billion to $2.5 billion. That would take us off our original target of 8 billion to 9 billion in adjusted EBIT. We've updated our outlook to include the expanded impact of the global chip shortage, and that's largely driven by the Renesas fire. While the situation is a significant headwind, we have definitive actions to address a full range of potential outcomes. So we now expect to lose about 50% of our planned Q2 production, an increase from the 17% loss in Q1, making Q2 the trough for our performance this year. Now, while we expect the flow of chips from Renesas to be restored in July, we and many in the industry now believe the global shortage may not be fully resolved until 2022. So our outlook now assumes we lose roughly 10% of planned second half production. In total, we believe the shortage for the year will drive a loss of about 1.1 million wholesale units, which translates to about 2.5 billion EBIT. That headwind - and that headwind in EBIT is net of recovery actions for the year. Now this EBIT impact was the high end of the range we gave in February, and brings our full year adjusted EBIT guidance range to between 5.5 billion and 6.5 billion. And it's very important to highlight that even though our expected volume loss for the year has more than doubled. We have worked to contain the EBIT in back to the high end of our original range. But we now also expect full year adjusted free cash flow of 500 million to 1.5 billion, and this includes a 3 billion adverse impact from semiconductors. The semiconductor impact on cash is 500 million worse than the impact on EBIT due to timing differences and the working capital impacts that will recover once a run rate of production is fully restored, dealer stocks return to more normal levels and incentives rebound. Our Q2 free cash flow will be significantly negative. And that's despite additional Ford Credit distributions driven by our adoption of the updated tax accounting standard, which reduces our tax allocation of Ford Credit and supports additional Ford Credit distributions. However, we expect our cash and liquidity to remain healthy throughout the year, providing us with considerable flexibility to manage the present situation. And this supports our growing confidence in the resilience of our business and our ability to effectively navigate the challenge just as we navigated the COVID related production disruptions last year. So now I'd like to turn it back to Jim for a few comments about the Capital Markets Day. Yes. Hi, Rod. Thanks. Good afternoon. That's a lot there. Let me see if I can unpack that and do justice to the question. So as you said, the run rate to the business is $8 billion to $9 billion. And without chips, we clearly believe that's where we would be. And I think you're seeing come through the quarter a combination of things, as I said, in my remarks, you're seeing the strength of the underlying businesses improving and you're seeing that come through. You saw that in the redesign of our overseas operations. You saw that in warranty expense improving, right? Those are two things that we said we needed to improve in our business as we move forward through the redesign, and you're seeing that come through. You're also seeing the strength of our new products. Now, it's a little opaque, I think, for people to say, well, you also saw considerable pricing opportunity because of supply and demand imbalances. That is true. But so we go back and we look at what's happened with the pricing for our products, since we started the redesign, the refresh. And that's where we come back to. Since 2019, if you look at our price increases, our average transaction price increase compared to what's happened in the industry, our transaction prices have increased $1900 more than the industry. So that strength is flowing through. Now we had additional pricing opportunity in Q1 due to the supply demand and - supply and demand imbalance. And so that hit the quarter as well. We also saw a very strong mix in the quarter. As we had lower production, so we optimized the production to our higher margin and higher mix vehicles. So we saw that flow through as well. So you're seeing that combination happen and impact as in Q1. Now remember for the year, as we go through the year, we're also going to see a significant headwind from commodities. We saw very little commodity impact in Q1. That's because we still had our contracts from last year in place and we had our hedging. And so as we go through the year, we expect as contracts roll off, and we've seen the commodity prices increase primarily for aluminum, steel and in precious metals, we expect to see about a $2.5 billion increase in commodities Q2 through Q4. So that's going to hit us as we go through the rest of the year. We also won't have the non-recurrence of the $900 million Rivian gain. And we also expect that as we go through the quarter, and we get to more normalized levels of production albeit we said 10% lower in the second-half, we should start to see more and a gradual normalization of those incentives that we experienced in the first quarter the benefit of that. And then at Ford Credit, we did benefit again in the first quarter from the strong residual values and we do expect those to moderate as we go through the rest of the year. So we've taken all that into account as we've gone through. And I'd have to say that, what's encouraging to me and what the team has been able to do is we've been able to maintain the impact of the semiconductor chips to that high end of our range, the $2.5 billion, despite the volume impact growing significantly. Absolutely, that is the run rate leading into next year. And we still have new products, Bronco, coming this year, the two and four door. We have some surprises Jim talked about, we have the F-150 Electric, we have the Transit Electric. So we have more products coming next year. We're going to continue to be aggressive. Our cost structure pushing that. And the other thing that we're learning coming out of this situation that we're in is how do you operate in a lean environment? And we've learned some quite a few good things about operating with leaner inventory. So I think there's opportunities there as well as we head into 2022. So absolutely, the eight to nine is a launching pad, we see that as a launching pad into 2022. So we've been doing quite a bit, of course, to get customers vehicles, to move people to more on order process, we've made changes to our processes to lower the gap between the time and order goes into the time we can deliver the order. And we're also seeing that as we look at making these types of changes to modernizing or improving our processes in a lower inventory environment, you get benefits across the patch, right? It would allow us to have lower capital required at Ford Credit, if we have to finance less dealer inventory for our dealers. That could free up some capital to invest in other growth areas. We would see better quality, because we'd have fresher vehicles and vehicles wouldn't be sitting on classes long. We'd have improved dealer profitability, because they wouldn't be financing that floor plan and we'd have lower incentives. We believe we'd have low incentives, because we'd have quick returning vehicles and we'd have higher orders. So as we're working through this lower inventory and these opportunities that we're seeing today, we're working on how we make them a normal part of our business as we go forward. Thanks, Ryan. So I think we have to go back and just ground ourselves again, in that run rate of the business of 8 billion to 9 billion. And I don't want to get too far out ahead of ourselves on North America and what this quarter might mean for the run rate going forward. Given as you said, there's just a lot of moving parts within this quarter. I think the team's done a great job of managing through it. We really saw the 8 billion to 9 billion as the run rate heading into '22. We're going to do everything we can to continue to drive margin improvement, both here and overseas. And the team is focused and Jim's pushing us really hard to continue to modernize and improve the business in every place that we can. But as far as trying to predict coming out of this quarter what that means for the margin in North America in putting a number on the table. I'm not going to do that right now. No, the quarter did not play out as we originally expected, right. It came in much better, we did not expect that we would be able to more than offset all of the impact of the chips in the quarter, which was 17%, or about 200,000 units. So we saw incredible opportunity there from the industry wide supply and demand imbalance. So we saw pricing increase significantly. We also then, because of the supply imbalance, we really pushed hard on mix. So those were things that allowed us to improve the quarter. We did not expect to use vehicle prices to increase 14% in the quarter. And they did and that helped. And that was part of what's happened with Ford Credit and the performance of Ford Credit. And then as we go through the year Emmanuel, one of the things that did not hit us in the first quarter that's going to hit us through the rest of the year is the commodity cost increases that come in quite significantly through Q2 to Q4. So those are some of the things that are coming back and are going to come through in the second half of the year. And then the other thing is as production normalizes a bit and supply and demand comes worn balance, we do expect that we should see some of this pricing that we saw in the first quarter moderate a bit. And we should see some of that happen through the second quarter - through the second half of the year. When we had first looked at it, we thought it was going to be significant, somewhere between 1.5 billion to 2 billion. So it's slightly higher than where we had thought coming into the year. Yes, so in Europe this is the second strong quarter that Ford of Europe is printed for us. And I think what you're seeing there is the redesign flowing through and showing up significantly again in this quarter. And of course, the market was aided a bit by what we're seeing the dynamics in this quarter, but the fundamental underlying strength of the business in Europe has improved. We took over a billion dollars of structural costs out as we relooked at the footprint. We've moved into commercial vehicles and improved our share there. We have a higher mix of utilities. All of that is providing a much stronger business for us in Europe. And you've seen that two quarters in a row now. Then when we look at South America, we reduced our volumes significantly and we improved our profitability. And that just comes back to the point that we brought to the market and we are and now we're going to focus on our higher margin vehicle or smaller footprint or smaller business down there leaning into Ranger in Transit, which are good vehicles in the market. And they're strong vehicles for us as a company and so you're starting to see that redesign really take hold."

At this time, I would like to welcome you to the Ford Motor Company Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Lynn Antipas Tyson, Executive Director of Investor Relations.\nLynn Antipas Tyson: Thank you, Jason, and welcome to Ford Motor Company's fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. With me today are Jim Farley, our President and CEO; and John Lawler, our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us for Q&A is Marion Harris, CEO of Ford Credit. Today's discussion includes some non-GAAP references. These are reconciled to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures in the appendix of our earnings deck. You can find the deck along with the rest of our earnings materials and other important content at, shareholder.ford.com. Today's discussion also includes forward-looking statements about our expectations. Actual results may differ from those stated. The most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ are included on Page 24. Unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year-over-year. Company EBIT, EPS and free cash flow are on an adjusted basis and product mix is volume weighted. I want to call out a few near-term key IR engagements. On February 15, Jim Farley and John Lawler will participate in a fireside chat in New York with Rod Lash at the Wolf Global Auto, Autotech and Mobility Conference. On March 23, at the New York Stock Exchange, we will hold a teach-in about our new Ford+ segment reporting. This event featuring John Lawler and Kathy O'Callaghan, our Controller, will be webcast. And I'm also pleased to share that our next Capital Markets Day will be Monday, May 22, at our headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan. Please save the date. We'll have more information about this over the coming weeks. Now I'll turn the call over to Jim.\nJim Farley: Thanks, Lynn, and hello, everyone. We appreciate you all joining us. I'll start by addressing the obvious. Our fourth quarter and full year financial performance last year fell short of our potential. And while we generated record cash flow, we left about $2 billion of profit on the table due to cost and especially continued supply chain issues. These are the simple facts and to say I'm frustrated as an understatement because the year could have been so much more for us at Ford. Now I know the question you must be asking, why Ford with that incredible product lineup, and all the restructuring overseas, why aren't you delivering higher profits and more competitive margins? And it's the right question. So [Technical Difficulty] while we're making progress, it's hard work. As with any transformation of this magnitude, certain parts are moving faster than I expected and other parts are taking longer. Now the first part of our transformation is to completely overhaul our industrial system. Product development, manufacturing and supply chain management to deliver better cost and quality, this is critical because it provides the foundation for everything else we do. It funds our future, that's second transformation, which we're aggressively building today. Building new and incredible new growth businesses like Model e and of course, Ford Pro are huge bet on commercial vehicles, which will be high growth, high margin, not just products but software and services business. Now the second transformation, the growth part is going better than I imagined. At this point in our journey, I did not expect to be number two in EV sales in the U.S. I didn't know that Lightning would be completely sold out. And I didn't predict that BlueCruise would be the best hands-free autonomy system in the market or the Ford Pro software sales would be growing off the charts. And that doesn't even touch all the incredible next-generation EVs and software platforms that will soon be entering the market. Bottom line, in a double transformation, we have to significantly improve our cost and our quality, but at the same time, grow to fulfill that huge promise in Ford+. And frankly, the first part of the transformation has not moved fast enough. Now this is what we should be known for. It's our legacy and will show we can do it again. We have deeply entrenched issues in our industrial system that have proven tough to root out. Candidly, the strength of our products and revenue has masked this functionality for a long time. It's not an excuse. But it's our reality, and we're dealing with it urgently. Over the past year, we have made sweeping leadership changes and brought in world-class talent to reenergize and rebuild a leading industrial organization. We've committed company-wide to implement a lean operating system that will scrub billions of dollars of waste out of our company. And we are shining the light on every inch of our legacy business with knowledge that we must do better every day. This has been humbling for both me and our team. That said, I've never been more convinced about our plan. I cannot wait to get into work every day because I'm so optimistic about our plan and what we are creating here at Ford. Now I respect our competition, but I would not trade our places with anyone. Why? Because we have a real strategy to grow. We have incredible products, both on the road and the ones you haven't seen in the pipeline. And I believe we now have a world-class leadership team, made up of new and existing talent ready to compete and win. These strengths will shine through. Ultimately, the proof will be in our results. That's exactly how it should be. We appreciate those who place their faith in Ford, and we are committed to creating value for all of our stakeholders. So with that, let me quickly cover some areas of focus. First, we remain committed to disciplined capital allocation saw this in the actions we took in Brazil and India and most recently in Argo. And now South America and IMG are healthy and generating sustainable profits. This work is never done and will continue to be the focus for us going forward. Our balance sheet, liquidity remains strong and our ability to generate free cash flow has really improved significantly. And this is allowing us to accelerate our investment in growth, of course, electrification, but also Pro and software, while importantly, also returning capital to our shareholders. And we now have created three distinct customer-facing business segments: Blue, e and Pro, which have given us greater clarity and insights into each of these businesses and how we can improve each of them uniquely. So let me cover a couple of highlights. I'm going to start with Pro, my favorite, the not-so-secret weapon at Ford. Ford Pro embodies all of our growth levers, and it capitalizes on our commercial vehicle sales leadership and scale to build a world-class ecosystem that delivers great value to our customers and profitable growth for us at Ford. In North America, our vehicle share is almost twice that of our closest competitor. And in Europe, Ford has been the number one vehicle brand -- commercial vehicle brand for eight years in a row. Let me bring this point home. Here in North America, whole market, Super Duty, our most important Pro vehicle, owns half the mining business. It owns half the emergency response business and have the utility business. And the requirements for all these customers are complex. They're not going to commoditize and they require a partner who deeply understands these unique businesses and is dedicated to providing a mix of vehicles, but also services that can improve uptime and total cost of ownership. And we know these customers will pay for software that will enhance their productivity. Now we're going to future-proof this business by leading the commercial electrification solutions as well, both at E-Transit and F-150 Lightning today. E-Transit is already America's top-selling electric van with 73% market share, 60% of all of our U.S. fleet managers plan to add an electric vehicle within the next two years to their fleet. And that's even before the $7,500 IRA tax credit that was announced and applies irregardless of the location of raw materials of batteries. This year, Pro really gets going. We introduced our most important vehicle gets refreshed, the new Super Duty Pickup. And in Europe, the Super Duty equivalent, we have an all-new 1-ton Transit. And Ford Pro's high-margin software business will continue to grow, especially software for fleet management, telematics and charging. Last year, these subscriptions for software grew over 70%, reflecting new software offerings, better platform for our software and contracts and growth in fleet charging attach rates, which are close to 50% now. We're also increasing our sales of parts and services via network of 1,000 mobile service vehicles on the road in North America and Europe and over 1,400 specialized commercial vehicle dealerships, many of which opened 24/7. In fact, last year, mobile service repair orders increased 85% for us in Pro. And this improves the customer experience while importantly increasing the attach rates of our high-margin parts business. Now moving to Blue. The team is focused and has delivered the freshest and most appealing product lineup in our industry. We know that typically the fresher the ICE portfolio, the greater the pricing power. So, our decision to move away from and commoditized utilities to vehicles like Bronco Sport and the Big Bronco, the Maverick, the Puma in Europe and hybrid powertrains has really paid off. Ford gained nearly one point of market share here in the U.S. last year. And we expect 2023 to be another big, strong year of share growth. Ford Blue is a growth business for the foreseeable future with strong profits and robust free cash flow. An F-Series was America's best-selling truck for 46 consecutive year now, outselling its second-place competitor by more than 140,000 trucks. We're launching even new pickups like the new Ranger here in North America and in South America after we've already launched the new Ranger in Asia and Europe last year. In addition, Blue is going after billions of cost improvements from engineering to manufacturing to our bill of material. And in quality, we have work to do. Ford has been the number one in recalls in the U.S. for the last two years. Clearly, that's not acceptable. We've overhauled our entire enterprise quality operating system. And we are already seeing improvements in initial quality for vehicles coming out of our plants here in North America. And Model e. It's operating with a start-up intensity to build profitable EVs with differentiated industry-leading portfolios that customers are going to love. In the U.S., our EV sales growth is twice the rate of the EV segment and more than 60% of our Model e customers are new to Ford. The F-150 Lightning has been America's best- selling electric pickup since it launched. And the Mustang Mach-E remains a huge hit for our customers. We remain on track to reach our annualized EV production capacity of 50,000 units per month or 600,000 units globally by the end of this year. For reference, in the fourth quarter, our run rate of production was more like 12,000. So 50,000 is a big growth. And by the end of -- and we are on plan for that 2 million units of incremental capacity by the end of 2026. Now to deliver this incredible growth, as we speak, through our facilities in North America, we're adding shifts, expanding our facilities, building out battery capacity and assembly capacity. Construction is in full swing in Tennessee and Kentucky on our BlueOval City and our three BlueOval SK battery plants. And in Europe, we're moving ahead with a new commercial vehicle battery facility in Turkey. Now critical to our plan is securing the necessary raw materials for these batteries to get to that 2 million unit rate, especially lithium and lithium hydroxide and nickel. We expect to have 100% of raw materials we need for the 2 million unit run rate secured by the end of this year. Now we are deep in the development of our second- generation EVs, including our next-generation electric full-size pickup, which, by the way, is awesome. These EVs will be fully software-updatable. That means a brand-new electric architecture, and they're going to be radically simplified. Imagine three body styles, each with volume potential of up to 1 million units and just a handful of orderable combinations. That's what we're doing at Ford for the second generation of products. And that means higher customer sat, better quality, lower bill material and lower manufacturing costs. When are when we start reporting according to these new segments in the fourth quarter, you're going to have complete visibility in the Model e's margin trajectory and understand the key levers to achieve our Model EBIT target of 8%. We're already making the customer buying experience better with less friction. Now this is only going to accelerate when the new Model e dealer program takes effect in January next year. This program has been adopted by nearly 2/3 of our 3,000 U.S. dealers, and it's based on a radical redesign on our customer experience. Next January, we'll be selling EVs at high volume with virtually no inventory, a simple e-commerce platform for our customers, non-negotiated price set by the local dealer and remote pickup and delivery for all customer experiences. We're also expanding BlueOval charging network at all of our dealers and we'll have dealer staff trained not only on software but all the EVs. Now I've said before, software and experiences will be the key differentiator for our industry. I mentioned earlier that BlueCruise, our driver assist hands-free technology, was just tested by consumer ports and judge the best hands-free autonomous system on the market. Let that sink in for a while, the best on the market. Now have you not experienced BlueCruise, I challenge you to go out and do your side-by-side comparison with our two major competitors. And at the end of last year, our customers using BlueCruise have now traveled 42 million hands-free miles. So we're scaling incredibly rapidly. That's a fourfold increase in the millions of miles since the second quarter of last year. And we have incredible software talent, making this system better every day, including those 600 former Argo engineers who are now working full time at Ford on our autonomous systems. Now before I hand it over to John, just a few things. Ford is a different company today. We're all about building a stronger customer-focused business that generates sustainable profitable growth and returns above the cost of capital. While our 2022 results fell short of my expectations, I've never been more excited about our future because we have the right plan, the right structure to succeed, the best team on the field and real strategic clarity. This year is about execution. It's time for us to deliver, and we will with relentless attention to our founding principles, drift and growth, and we are hitting the ground running. John?\nJohn Lawler: Thanks, Jim. As Jim pointed out, our performance in 2022 was below our expectations, and our industrial platform is frankly not where we need it to be. The simple way I measure this is by looking at our cost of goods sold as a percent of revenue and then compare it to our competition. You've all done it. We're much higher. And this speaks to the significant operating deficits we have in product development, manufacturing and procurement. And this is no different from the tough capital allocation choices we made on our geographic footprint and product portfolio. Choice is designed to yield higher quality growth and improved returns. And we are now applying that same level of discipline to our industrial platform with urgency. Now on the positive side, our product portfolio has never been stronger. Our new vehicles are a hit with our customers. Our iconic vehicles remain market leaders, and we continue to make strategic and capital allocation decisions to drive growth, strengthen our competitive position and produce returns above our cost of capital. So turning to the year. We generated a record $9.1 billion in free cash flow, well above our cash conversion target of 50% to 60%. And importantly, most of the free cash flow came from the Automotive business, and this reflects more disciplined capital allocation, including the restructuring of our operations outside of North America, which until recently was a significant source of cash burn. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we ended the year with $32 billion of cash and $48 million of liquidity. This, coupled with the improvement in free cash flow, provides us with ample flexibility to both fund our growth and return capital to our shareholders. In fact, today, we declared our first quarter regular dividend of $0.15 per share as well as a supplemental dividend of $0.65 per share, reflecting our strong free cash flow and the monetization of our Rivian stake, which is now nearly complete. Going forward, we intend to target distribution of 40% to 50% of free cash flow, consistent with our focus on total shareholder return. Now for the year, we delivered $10.4 billion in adjusted EBIT with a margin of 6.6%. And as Jim said, by better executing the things we control, we should have generated as much as $2 more in adjusted EBIT. For example, the instability of our supply chain and production plans caused us to not only deliver lower- than-planned volumes in the fourth quarter but also incur higher costs through premium freight and other supplier charges. Now let me give you a quick overview of how our '22 segments performed recognizing that beginning with our first quarter 2023 results will no longer have the automotive segments with regional breakouts. Now North America delivered $9.2 billion of EBIT, an improvement of $1.8 billion, driven by higher net pricing and increased volume, which was partially offset by higher commodities and other inflation-related cost increases. EBIT margin was 8.4%. We continue to maintain a healthy order bank, and the team is busy preparing the launch of the all-new Super Duty and our seventh generation Mustang later this year, and both of those are incredible products. In South America, we delivered a profit of over $400 million, and the region is now derisked and sustainably profitable. In Europe, we were slightly above breakeven for the year, but as our fourth quarter results showed clearly below our target. Given the changing macroeconomic environment and demand environment in Europe, we will make the changes necessary to deliver a sustainable business that consistently generates returns above our cost of capital. Our core strength in the region continues to be our leading commercial vehicle business. In China, we posted a loss of about $600 million, driven by increased investment in EVs. Lincoln continues to be our profit pillar in the region, but clearly, we have more work to do to ensure our business is growing sustainable and delivering appropriate returns. Our International Markets Group earned more than $600 million, driven by the launch of the Ranger and our decision to exit India. And similar to South America, the region is now primed for sustainable profitability. And finally, Ford Credit had another solid year, delivering EBT of $2.7 billion, which was down $2.1 billion from the prior year, reflecting lower credit loss and lease residual reserve releases, lower financing margin and lower lease return rates. Now given the continued uncertainties in the macro environment, I want to provide some context to how we're thinking about 2023. For the full year, we expect to earn $9 billion to $11 billion in adjusted EBIT, and that assumes a SAR of 15 million units in the U.S. and 13 million units in Europe. We expect to generate adjusted free cash flow of about $6 billion and for capital expenditures to be between $8 billion to $9 billion. Our adjusted EBIT guidance includes various headwinds and tailwinds and that we believe could impact our business in the coming year. And for example, when you think about the headwinds, they include an expected mild recession in the U.S. in moderate recession in Europe, higher industry incentives as supply and demand come back into balance. Ford Credit EBT of about $1.3 billion, and that's about $1.4 billion lower than in 2022, reflecting unfavorable lease residual and credit losses and the nonreoccurrence of derivative games. We expect a continued strong dollar. We also expect about $2 billion lower past service pension income. And we're also going to continue investments in growth, including in customer experience, connected services and CapEx as we build out our growth plan. Now tailwinds include improvements in supply chain and industry volume, launch of our all-new Super Duty and then, of course, lower cost of goods sold, including efficiencies in materials, commodities, logistics and other parts of our industrial platform. Now before taking questions, let me briefly touch on our new financial reporting as well as plans for our next Capital Markets Day. On March 23, we'll hold a teach-in at the New York Stock Exchange. And I'm really excited about this opportunity because it will be our chance to take you through how the new Ford+ segments will alter our financial reporting. The changes will include how revenue, cost products and assets are assigned to each segment. At the teaching, we'll also share our recast financials for both 2021 and 2022, and we hope many of you join us at the New York Stock Exchange in person. But we will also broadcast a webcast live, and will be -- and will post a toolkit and other materials to orient you around all the materials and help you migrate your models. Now the teaching will not be a strategic update. That will come at our Capital Markets Day in Dearborn in May, when we'll update you on our Ford+ strategy. We'll do a deep dive into financial targets and KPIs for each of our new segments as well as for software and services. Now with this new level of transparency, which will be tracked and validated in our earnings materials and SEC filings, we think investors will be better equipped to value how each of our customer-focused segments is contributing to Ford's overall growth and return profile. And as Jim mentioned earlier, 2023 is a pivotal year for Ford. We have the plan, the talent and the product portfolio in place to take the Company to an exciting new level, one that is both differentiated from our past performance and our competitors. And going forward, our new segmentation will provide unprecedented levels of transparency and insight into all aspects of our business, making it easier to hold Ford leadership accountable for delivering superior growth and value for all of our stakeholders. Now that wraps up the prepared remarks, and we'll use the balance of the time to address what's on your mind. So thank you. And operator, please open up the line for questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nAdam Jonas: I appreciate the humility and the self-criticism and the spirit of that on the cost and the execution shortfall. It's kind of refreshing to see that. But when you begin the description about it and how frustrated you are, Jim, and how it's not good enough, I was getting all excited to hear some details and there's just not a lot here, okay? I'm just going to say, it's not a lot of details at all about what exactly the problem is and what you're doing about it and how much and get better this year? You can disagree if you want, that is my impression. I want to know what it is and because $2 billion on the table, frankly, that's 130 bps of margin. I mean that's going to go to the consumer anyway. So tell us that's just the beginning, and there's way more to go. Do we have to wait until May for that? Or is there anything else you can tell us to help model the Company in the year ahead and what you're doing about it? Appreciate it.\nJim Farley: No, there is a lot more to go. And the industrial system at Ford is a huge opportunity for us. And we have spent the last several months really getting deep on where we need to go. So John, maybe you could share or feeling comfortable on sharing, but you're going to hear a drumbeat from Ford on this all during the year.\nJohn Lawler: Yes. So Adam, I think if you just step back and look at the three elements of the industrial platform, there's opportunities across each. If you look at our product development system and in our engineering, the level of productivity that we have, so think about $1 of input and what you get out for that $1 of input is probably about 25% to 30% inefficient. So, we should be either getting more products through the pipeline or our cost should be significantly lower. Now we have to be very smart about how we go about doing that because we've got incredible products in the pipeline, and there's a huge opportunity on that front, but we also have to balance the quality as well. And so, when it comes to our engineering, I think you should think about it that way, and that's what we're going after. Our supply chain, there are issues across the supply chain. It cost us, as we talked about last year, at least $1 billion in premiums that we had to pay, increased freight premiums on chips, premiums on disruption that we called our suppliers because our schedule stability was probably worst in class and fixing that and the root cause it gets to that will drive incredible opportunities for us. And let's say that for 2023, it should be at least an incremental $1 billion at least. And then when you look at our manufacturing system and you go through our plants, you look at the level of working capital we have in, you look at our production schedules, you look at the complexity and what it does for time that takes us to build a vehicle. And you understand just how inefficient that is. And then you bring that back through that -- complexity back through the supply chain, and you talked about the number of changeovers that our suppliers have to make to produce the complexity that we have and the time that, that adds to production and the time that it adds the cost and the issues that it drives through. So those are just some of the tip of the iceberg or the things we're going after. And then if you go back and you look at it, as I said in my remarks, just you look at the math and you look at our cost of goods sold relative to our revenue and then compare that to traditional OEMs, let alone the new OEMs, and you see the size of the prize that we're going after. And what's changed, Adam, I think the answer is, is we just have to show you guys. I mean that's where we're at. We have to deliver it. But as Jim said, as we're taking this lean approach and getting into it, there's a very systematic way we're going at it now, and we are very focused. And we know that this is the number one thing that needs to get fixed in the first part of our transformation.\nJim Farley: And Adam, I'd just like to add as the CEO, there's a lot of choices, they're all very consequential when it comes to the approach to do this. The most important thing for me is sustainable. When you look at Ford, we have cut in the past and it grows back or we have cut everywhere and not really focused on the industrial system. So for me, the approach that we're taking that's very different and very difficult is that it has to be daily work, gaps to competition, countermeasures, action plans for those countermeasures, constant evaluation of the effectiveness of those countermeasures, celebration of those KPIs and our status and daily management. It has to be a more fundamental approach than holding our breath or dealing with the output like people and getting into the real industrial systems efficiency. And that is a cultural change as a leader. It's a behavioral change. It is not just a program.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Murphy from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJohn Murphy: Just kind of wanted to follow up sort of on a similar vein, short term and long term. Just for short term, when we think about the '23 outlook and you look at the $1 billion for decline in Ford Credit and take that as a reasonably given number, something in that direction and then $2 billion of lower past service pension income. That's a $3.4 billion headwind. But sort of at the midpoint of the range, you're talking about EBIT being roughly flat. So that sort of indicates a very significant $3 billion plus improvement in the core business, which is a lot to kind of believe when you're looking at sort of the headwinds and the issues that you just faced. I'm just curious if you can comment on that, maybe kind of walk us to how we get comfortable like we'll see a $3 billion plus improvement in the core business this year? I mean -- and how do you get these supply chain issues fixed when some of that are a bit outside of your control and what we hear from suppliers is volatility and schedules and it's not just specific to Ford, still pretty volatile?\nJohn Lawler: Yes. Thanks, John. It's a great question. That's exactly it. The headwinds are $4.5 billion to $5 billion, as we pointed out. And we said we expect on the tailwinds pricing to be about neutral. The market forces, I think, are going to drive average transaction prices down. We think probably around 5%. And that will come some from the dealer margins, but also from higher incentives. And then you step back from it, and we do have the new Super Duty, and we expect that to be a positive and we also have a very strong order bank on our commercial vehicles. So we're looking at pricing being about flattish we said volumes, there's a slight opportunity as industry comes along. So the rest of it falls into cost reductions, and that's exactly right. When you look at those cost reductions, you have to see what's happening relative to the material. And in, there's two phases there. There's one, it's -- we do expect commodity prices to come off a bit to improve a bit, but we also have significant opportunities in our material cost, and we have several initiatives going on to identify those efficiencies. We also have quite a bit of cost when you talk about schedule stability. I don't have the exact data from the competition. But when I look at our scheduled stability, there are significant opportunities through changes that we can take to improve that schedule stability, which will flow straight through to lower surcharges from the supply base because they have to deal with that instability and there's cost that drives as well as the significant premiums we paid in freight for expedite, air freight, et cetera, to just try to keep plants going and keep our suppliers' plans going. So, those are two immediate actions that we can take based on the inefficiencies we saw in '22 that cost us the $2 billion. And then on top of that, we have to build through the core industrial platform just productivity and efficiencies to drive even more improvement. So that's how we're thinking about it, and that's how we're going about it.\nJohn Murphy: Okay. That's actually incredibly helpful. And just on the long term, I mean you mentioned, Jim, about scrubbing things foundationally and really getting to some costs there excess, and I appreciate the three areas you've highlighted. But as we look around the world, I mean, Europe is -- had fits and starts of making us all kind of excited that it's going to work and then it doesn't from time to time. And China, you kind of been chasing competition there, and it hasn't really paid out for you. But there are two very important parts of Europe and China that are very strong for you. Commercial vehicle in Europe is incredibly strong. So could we just strip Europe back to pure commercial vehicle and could China just strip back to pure Lincoln? Two places we know you're making money and cut out the other stuff so that you can actually fund the transition that you're talking about? I mean, just -- we kind of all dance around this stuff and you've headed in this direction with the global redesign, but there's real opportunities here to be really profitable.\nJim Farley: No, you hit on it. And I'm glad we're getting into some of the strategies. I mean I would think of China business similar to what we've done in South America and IMG. Small but profitable, focused. We've been in the past in China kind of small but focused on everything. And Lincoln and our commercial with JMC is very profitable and an important business, but they have to make the EV transition. And I don't think you can be globally successful in the EV business if you don't compete with the Chinese. I mean they're going to come to Europe -- they're already there. They're going to come to the U.S. a powerhouse. Geely, there's so many others. And so we believe China is very strategically important for us. But to win there, we have to make those businesses transition profitably to EV, but I would think of it as kind of small and focused, maybe even more than past. And Europe is definitely -- we have a great CV business, commercial vehicle business that now is getting electrified. So we're like making that transition now. We have a new Ranger, the electric version of one-ton. Transit, and all of them, we have a new manufacturing site in Romania that's really scaling up now in commercial. So we have a really strong business. And the decision really is how much do we need how much -- how many engineers, how many people do we need in Europe and how big of a profile do we need in passenger cars? That's the decision. We've already electrified Cologne and that's really the decision. It's not the right time to talk about where we're going to go, but we know exactly our strength in Europe, and we know what we need to do. So -- and you won't have to wait long to hear from us on these things.\nOperator: The next question comes from Rod Lache from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nRod Lache: I think, John, you said in response to Adam's question that variable costs would come down by at least $1 billion. But at the same time, you're acknowledging that pricing could easily be more than $1 billion negative for $100 billion North American business with 5 points of average transaction price decline. Can you maybe give us a little bit more insight into that? And can you provide a few specific KPIs that would demonstrate progress on structural costs they were up another $2 billion in 2022?\nJohn Lawler: Yes. So on the pricing, we do see the broad market coming in at about transaction prices falling about 5%. Some of that's going to come out of the dealer margins, of course. It's not all going to come from us. But we also have upside, Rod, with some of the launch of the new vehicles. We won't see as much of a price compression there. So, we see pricing net-net for us next year being about flattish. And so don't think about it as we're working through '23 as being a negative $1 billion. And then I would say that when it comes to the cost reductions, I think what we've got to start showing is, one, that we're getting leverage out of the business if we're growing the business that our cost of goods sold is growing at a much slower pace. And that as we're coming out with new vehicles, our cost per units are coming down, so our margins are improving. When you look at the design of our vehicles and you compare it to competition, I think if you go through those benchmarks and you go through those teardowns, you can see that there's a tremendous amount of opportunity for us to design out complexity. And you should see that coming through complexity reduction KPIs on our vehicles. I think that will be key. And it not only will be in the order combinations but also in the parts complexity in the number of parts. And what we'll be doing is as we move forward through this year, especially at Capital Markets Day, we'll be providing more details on those KPIs. But it's the key areas you should be seeing how much productivity we're getting out of $1 of engineering, and we should do something around that from a KPI standpoint because these are the areas that we need to improve.\nJim Farley: Rod, some of the things I think about -- some of the things I think about is a number of complex sequencing centers we have. Our line sight complexity, number of parts sitting on side of the line, our inventory turns inside the plant. And on the supplier side, it's going to be transparency. We had full transparency down to Tier 3 in our supply chain. It's very important to operationalize better quality and cost. On the engineering side, it's also indirect. What's the ratio of indirect to direct engineering that we're spending, i.e., the productive engineering that's resulting in customer-facing products. And increasingly, I know it's going to sound a little bit weird, but it's the software output. We are spending as a management team more and more time on our software platform, and the cost of creating software and the complexity of software. And that's something that -- we have a lot of KPIs. They're increasing quickly and are increasingly important for us. It may not be significant for structural cost, but we have to be careful to add a lot of complexity in software.\nRod Lache: So just to put a landmark out there, do you think a year from now will be looking at structural costs that are up or down, obviously, ex-pension because you have this $3 billion cost reduction plan? And then I have a second question just on Model e.\nJohn Lawler: Rod, I think it's beyond just structural cost. Our biggest cost element is our material cost. We will continue to invest in our growth-related investments, some connected services. The software, as Jim talked about, we're also continuing to invest, as you know, in our build-out of our batteries. So our spending related costs are going to go up. Volume will drive manufacturing cost, which is in our structural cost. So there will be puts and takes on the structural costs. Our biggest opportunity is in our level of material cost that we have. It's the largest cost element on our income statement, and it's where we are most uncompetitive.\nRod Lache: Yes. Okay...\nJohn Lawler: So, we're going after everything, but I...\nRod Lache: Yes. I think I got the answer on that. Maybe just to switch gears on Model e, if I can ask Jim a question, you've got this target of 8%. And that 8% margin target presumably has some assumptions for where costs will go, but also where pricing is going to go. And just considering everyone's aspirations for growth in EVs, do you think you can stand by those pricing assumptions and maybe a different way of asking this is, do you think you can sell a $40,000 electric crossover with a 20% gross margin?\nJim Farley: That is a very important question. The reality is we will -- we are structuring our portfolio to compete in very specific segments. The crossover is turning out to be the core civic of the EV business. And the last thing we want to do is commoditize our products by dropping the price. Just look what happened to Henry Ford in the 20s in the early teens. And that's exactly what we're seeing play out here. We didn't have to touch the pricing in offer Lightning and E-Transit because we pick the right segments. But the real driver of our future profitability on Model e is the second cycle products. We didn't know when we designed these first three products. We didn't know that our wiring harness for Mach-E was 1.6 kilometers longer than it needed to be. We didn't know it's 70 pounds heavier and that that's worth $300 a battery. We didn't know that we underinvested in braking technology to save on the battery size. We didn't know that we needed the world's best aerodynamics to get the size of the battery smaller. And so now we have learned a lot and that second cycle of the product is in the factory right now being developed with a lot of new talent. So I'm very optimistic about our 8% because we are not going to be playing in the two-row commodity SUV market because that's -- because tried that in the ICE business, didn't really work out for us. We want to play our hand, our strength, commercial, truck, larger vehicles on the category side. We do not want to have too many top ads because that costs a lot to engineer. We want to have minimum choice for customers, but we want to design the smallest possible battery for competitive size, and we want to invest differently in our ICE business for radical simplification, 30%, 40%, 50% less fasteners, no brackets in the vehicle. I can go on and on. We'll get into it at Capital Markets Day. I think we should expect all brands to protect growth when it comes to EV. And that for we have to expect negative pricing. And that means software and other items like that becoming even more critical. I can't wait to show you our new electric architecture. To me, that's the most critical strategic investment the Company is making, not our batteries, not the EV platforms, but our new fully updatable electric architecture because what we've learned on Pro is we can make real money on software.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRyan Brinkman: Maybe to follow up on that. I heard you say in the prepared remarks that revenue for software services and charging rows 70% year-over-year in 2022. I remember you discussing like a potential $20 billion market opportunity by 2030 with a lot of exciting on Pro at the last Investor Day target for 33 million connected vehicles in 2028. But have you dimensioned how large or profitable this business may be currently? Or are you able to share any more interim goals such as what your expectations are for services revenue or services revenue growth in 2023? Or what the next catalyst might be here for this business, such as I don't know, the number of vehicles launching with Blue intelligence or anything else we should be monitoring?\nJim Farley: Right. Yes, great question. We're going to see that on Pro first, and this year is a breakout year for Pro because we have brand-new products, both core in Europe and U.S. are most -- the highest volume, highest profit vehicles are all new. So, a very important year for us, I would say we absolutely have a fantastic business plan that's very specific about software and physical services. The biggest opportunity for us in the short term is the after sales business. Only 10% of our Pro customers do business with us, and we hardly do any financing with them. And so between financing and parts and service, we have enormous upside in the short term. And those are very profitable parts of our business. So I would think of it this way, Ryan. It's like software is starting to drive a closed loop where the customer wants to do more physical service with us. We have all those mobile units, more and more dedicated dealers and more of our commercial customers because of the use of the software is coming back and buying parts for us. And then the next level of performance is really going to be prognostics. When we could put predictive failure in all the vehicles, like you see on John Deere and Caterpillar, and then drive that into our physical repair facilities, we're going to see a much larger retention in parts and service. So I think the basics of the business are, these are profitable vehicles. We've got new ones coming out. We're going to grow that. We're -- I mean, we blew through our parts and service profits and revenue for Pro last year. It's almost like we can't even predict as this -- that software starts to really drive a different behavior for our customers, the growth in parts and service. But that's the monetization in the short term for these services in the integrated ecosystem. And then long term, the real game changer kind of like autonomy in the retail space is going to be that prognostics.\nOperator: Our next question comes from James Picariello from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nJames Picariello: So the third quarter negative pre-announcement had a narrative around it, right? It was very high mix on wheels inventory that you couldn't ship and the additional $1 billion of supplier costs. I know Adam hit on this in his question, but this quarter is missing that storyline. I know it was mentioned that you have line of sight to $2 billion in profit that you left on the table. But what could really turn around almost immediately in this first quarter in '23 here in terms of like what operational mishaps you know will reverse in the coming months and quarter, whatever the time frame might be?\nJohn Lawler: Yes. I think it comes down to the key driver for the in the fourth quarter was the volumes. And the volumes was on availability of key commodities, primarily chips and the fact that many of our suppliers had equipment issues as they were ramping. We think we've worked through a lot of those issues on the ramp in our supply chain. And as far as the rate inflow on the commodities, the chips, it continues to be hand-to-hand comment. But we're putting corrective actions in place. We've got better pipelines from brokers and spot buys, and we're working very closely with our supply chain down to the Tier 2 chip suppliers. So that's execution, it changes that we're putting in place on the rate and flow, and it's being more efficient in our scheduling and the stability of our production to reduce expedited freight, expedited costs at our supply chain, et cetera. So, part of it's operational. Part of it's what we're doing working with our supply chain partners. And part of it is getting through the hump on ramping up run rates, et cetera, throughout the system.\nJames Picariello: Okay. Understood. That's helpful. And then in terms of the earnings bridge for this year, with respect to materials and freight, that $9 billion headwind in '22. I know you mentioned you're baking in commodity prices to come down. But all in relative to that $9 billion this past year, what's assumed in the '23 guide here on this line item?\nJohn Lawler: Right. So if you look at that, it's at least $2.5 billion depending on where we fall within the range of the guidance. So I think that would be a start point, and then we would go from there. And of course, we're going to be working to do better than that. But that's what we see so far.\nJames Picariello: At least $2.5 billion positive.\nJohn Lawler: Yes.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Itay Michaeli from Citi. Please go ahead.\nItay Michaeli: Just two questions for me. First, I was hoping you could maybe talk about the regional outlook in your 2023 guidance. I don't know that the segments are about to change but hoping we touch on the regions. And then second, maybe for Jim. When we're thinking about the software opportunity on your new electrical architecture on the consumer side of the business, where do you see the biggest opportunity there from a revenue perspective? Is it automated driving? Is it connected services? Just curious what is most interesting there?\nJohn Lawler: Yes. So I think what we would have to say is that given that we're moving to our segments for 2023, we're not going to be reporting the regions. And so we will give more color on 2023 by each of the business unit segments. And so I'm not going to comment on regions anymore going forward, unless there's a specific reason to do that within one of the segments.\nJim Farley: I think on the demand side, we see the U.S. around the $15 million range, Europe around $13 million. We're going to see more incentives in the U.S. So we can go through the demand side if that's what you're interested in.\nItay Michaeli: Yes, sure. That would be helpful. Yes. Maybe pricing in Europe would be helpful as well.\nJohn Lawler: Yes. I think in Europe, we're going to see continued pressure on the top line. We've got a 13 million unit in the industry. We think we still have such a strong order bank. We not think we know we have a strong order bank on our commercial vehicles that we don't see as much pressure there. More of the pressure will come on the passenger side. But pricing in Europe, incentives continue to be strong throughout this year. So I don't think you'll see as much price compression in Europe, as you've seen in -- you'll see in North America and the U.S. But I think definitely for Europe, it's the call on the industry and where do we think that will be offset by the strength of the order bank we have on our commercial vehicles. Coming back to the U.S., as we said, a 15 million unit industry, we think prices are going to come and the industry are going to fall, transaction prices will fall about 5%. You think about that as about a combination of incentives and lower dealer margins. We're starting to see dealer margins come down now as our demand from the industry is easing a bit. And we're starting to see the inflationary costs come through with the pricing. And so we're starting to see those margins come off. And I think through as we go through the year, particularly in the second half, you'll start to see prices come down through higher incentives by the OEMs. When you look at our International Markets Group, I think it's a little bit different there. Our key product is Ranger, and that's all new, and that's launching, and so there's incredible demand for it. And so we think we have some pricing power there as well. So I think the puts and takes around the region, if you look at it on a macro basis. And I think it will be more insightful as we talk about what's happening in each of the segments and then specifically what's happening in Pro Blue and e in those segments around the world.\nJohn Lawler: On the software side, we were guessing before, but now we kind of know what the first three shippable large TAM software revenue sources are for our industry. The first is partial autonomy, the second is safety and security and the third is productivity. And the star people in there, the early leaders definitely ADAS on pricing revenue growth. I mean, the growth we're seeing, the demand we're seeing for BlueCruise and all ADAS features is really driving a lot of software shipment. We're about to ship our second cycle of BlueCruise already, and we are really starting to see -- that is clearly what customers want revenue-wise. And I do believe in this first three, four years of software to the car that ADAS, that Level 2, Level 3 system, is really the most remarkable TAM. However, in the background, for Ford, the productivity software in Pro is really important. It's maybe unique to us, but it is a very important part of our software revenue, which we will lay out in May. You'll see more specifics on it, but it's very profitable. The customers love the data, and they have a higher demand for the data and the software than the retail customer. I think the slow burn, the one in the background that I'm super excited about is the third leg of the stool of safety and security, not like someone stole your car, but it's video content, a lot of it tied to insurance. So this is going to be a really interesting area. Kind of think of your cars and extension of your ring and all the safety and security you have in your house now, all that technology, the cars give me another note on that. It will go for everything from teenage drivers to all sorts of things and that video capture is going to be the essence. Another reason why we think our next electrical architecture is so strategically important for the Company because we want to embed that hardware and software and adaptability in the electric architecture so we can ship the software, better software than our competition on safety and security, even if it's a little fuzzy on what the features are today.\nOperator: This concludes the Ford Motor Company fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call.

            "name": "Jim Farley",
            "content": "Thanks, Lynn, and hello, everyone. We appreciate you all joining us. I'll start by addressing the obvious. Our fourth quarter and full year financial performance last year fell short of our potential. And while we generated record cash flow, we left about $2 billion of profit on the table due to cost and especially continued supply chain issues. These are the simple facts and to say I'm frustrated as an understatement because the year could have been so much more for us at Ford. Now I know the question you must be asking, why Ford with that incredible product lineup, and all the restructuring overseas, why aren't you delivering higher profits and more competitive margins? And it's the right question. So [Technical Difficulty] while we're making progress, it's hard work. As with any transformation of this magnitude, certain parts are moving faster than I expected and other parts are taking longer. Now the first part of our transformation is to completely overhaul our industrial system. Product development, manufacturing and supply chain management to deliver better cost and quality, this is critical because it provides the foundation for everything else we do. It funds our future, that's second transformation, which we're aggressively building today. Building new and incredible new growth businesses like Model e and of course, Ford Pro are huge bet on commercial vehicles, which will be high growth, high margin, not just products but software and services business. Now the second transformation, the growth part is going better than I imagined. At this point in our journey, I did not expect to be number two in EV sales in the U.S. I didn't know that Lightning would be completely sold out. And I didn't predict that BlueCruise would be the best hands-free autonomy system in the market or the Ford Pro software sales would be growing off the charts. And that doesn't even touch all the incredible next-generation EVs and software platforms that will soon be entering the market. Bottom line, in a double transformation, we have to significantly improve our cost and our quality, but at the same time, grow to fulfill that huge promise in Ford+. And frankly, the first part of the transformation has not moved fast enough. Now this is what we should be known for. It's our legacy and will show we can do it again. We have deeply entrenched issues in our industrial system that have proven tough to root out. Candidly, the strength of our products and revenue has masked this functionality for a long time. It's not an excuse. But it's our reality, and we're dealing with it urgently. Over the past year, we have made sweeping leadership changes and brought in world-class talent to reenergize and rebuild a leading industrial organization. We've committed company-wide to implement a lean operating system that will scrub billions of dollars of waste out of our company. And we are shining the light on every inch of our legacy business with knowledge that we must do better every day. This has been humbling for both me and our team. That said, I've never been more convinced about our plan. I cannot wait to get into work every day because I'm so optimistic about our plan and what we are creating here at Ford. Now I respect our competition, but I would not trade our places with anyone. Why? Because we have a real strategy to grow. We have incredible products, both on the road and the ones you haven't seen in the pipeline. And I believe we now have a world-class leadership team, made up of new and existing talent ready to compete and win. These strengths will shine through. Ultimately, the proof will be in our results. That's exactly how it should be. We appreciate those who place their faith in Ford, and we are committed to creating value for all of our stakeholders. So with that, let me quickly cover some areas of focus. First, we remain committed to disciplined capital allocation saw this in the actions we took in Brazil and India and most recently in Argo. And now South America and IMG are healthy and generating sustainable profits. This work is never done and will continue to be the focus for us going forward. Our balance sheet, liquidity remains strong and our ability to generate free cash flow has really improved significantly. And this is allowing us to accelerate our investment in growth, of course, electrification, but also Pro and software, while importantly, also returning capital to our shareholders. And we now have created three distinct customer-facing business segments: Blue, e and Pro, which have given us greater clarity and insights into each of these businesses and how we can improve each of them uniquely. So let me cover a couple of highlights. I'm going to start with Pro, my favorite, the not-so-secret weapon at Ford. Ford Pro embodies all of our growth levers, and it capitalizes on our commercial vehicle sales leadership and scale to build a world-class ecosystem that delivers great value to our customers and profitable growth for us at Ford. In North America, our vehicle share is almost twice that of our closest competitor. And in Europe, Ford has been the number one vehicle brand -- commercial vehicle brand for eight years in a row. Let me bring this point home. Here in North America, whole market, Super Duty, our most important Pro vehicle, owns half the mining business. It owns half the emergency response business and have the utility business. And the requirements for all these customers are complex. They're not going to commoditize and they require a partner who deeply understands these unique businesses and is dedicated to providing a mix of vehicles, but also services that can improve uptime and total cost of ownership. And we know these customers will pay for software that will enhance their productivity. Now we're going to future-proof this business by leading the commercial electrification solutions as well, both at E-Transit and F-150 Lightning today. E-Transit is already America's top-selling electric van with 73% market share, 60% of all of our U.S. fleet managers plan to add an electric vehicle within the next two years to their fleet. And that's even before the $7,500 IRA tax credit that was announced and applies irregardless of the location of raw materials of batteries. This year, Pro really gets going. We introduced our most important vehicle gets refreshed, the new Super Duty Pickup. And in Europe, the Super Duty equivalent, we have an all-new 1-ton Transit. And Ford Pro's high-margin software business will continue to grow, especially software for fleet management, telematics and charging. Last year, these subscriptions for software grew over 70%, reflecting new software offerings, better platform for our software and contracts and growth in fleet charging attach rates, which are close to 50% now. We're also increasing our sales of parts and services via network of 1,000 mobile service vehicles on the road in North America and Europe and over 1,400 specialized commercial vehicle dealerships, many of which opened 24/7. In fact, last year, mobile service repair orders increased 85% for us in Pro. And this improves the customer experience while importantly increasing the attach rates of our high-margin parts business. Now moving to Blue. The team is focused and has delivered the freshest and most appealing product lineup in our industry. We know that typically the fresher the ICE portfolio, the greater the pricing power. So, our decision to move away from and commoditized utilities to vehicles like Bronco Sport and the Big Bronco, the Maverick, the Puma in Europe and hybrid powertrains has really paid off. Ford gained nearly one point of market share here in the U.S. last year. And we expect 2023 to be another big, strong year of share growth. Ford Blue is a growth business for the foreseeable future with strong profits and robust free cash flow. An F-Series was America's best-selling truck for 46 consecutive year now, outselling its second-place competitor by more than 140,000 trucks. We're launching even new pickups like the new Ranger here in North America and in South America after we've already launched the new Ranger in Asia and Europe last year. In addition, Blue is going after billions of cost improvements from engineering to manufacturing to our bill of material. And in quality, we have work to do. Ford has been the number one in recalls in the U.S. for the last two years. Clearly, that's not acceptable. We've overhauled our entire enterprise quality operating system. And we are already seeing improvements in initial quality for vehicles coming out of our plants here in North America. And Model e. It's operating with a start-up intensity to build profitable EVs with differentiated industry-leading portfolios that customers are going to love. In the U.S., our EV sales growth is twice the rate of the EV segment and more than 60% of our Model e customers are new to Ford. The F-150 Lightning has been America's best- selling electric pickup since it launched. And the Mustang Mach-E remains a huge hit for our customers. We remain on track to reach our annualized EV production capacity of 50,000 units per month or 600,000 units globally by the end of this year. For reference, in the fourth quarter, our run rate of production was more like 12,000. So 50,000 is a big growth. And by the end of -- and we are on plan for that 2 million units of incremental capacity by the end of 2026. Now to deliver this incredible growth, as we speak, through our facilities in North America, we're adding shifts, expanding our facilities, building out battery capacity and assembly capacity. Construction is in full swing in Tennessee and Kentucky on our BlueOval City and our three BlueOval SK battery plants. And in Europe, we're moving ahead with a new commercial vehicle battery facility in Turkey. Now critical to our plan is securing the necessary raw materials for these batteries to get to that 2 million unit rate, especially lithium and lithium hydroxide and nickel. We expect to have 100% of raw materials we need for the 2 million unit run rate secured by the end of this year. Now we are deep in the development of our second- generation EVs, including our next-generation electric full-size pickup, which, by the way, is awesome. These EVs will be fully software-updatable. That means a brand-new electric architecture, and they're going to be radically simplified. Imagine three body styles, each with volume potential of up to 1 million units and just a handful of orderable combinations. That's what we're doing at Ford for the second generation of products. And that means higher customer sat, better quality, lower bill material and lower manufacturing costs. When are when we start reporting according to these new segments in the fourth quarter, you're going to have complete visibility in the Model e's margin trajectory and understand the key levers to achieve our Model EBIT target of 8%. We're already making the customer buying experience better with less friction. Now this is only going to accelerate when the new Model e dealer program takes effect in January next year. This program has been adopted by nearly 2/3 of our 3,000 U.S. dealers, and it's based on a radical redesign on our customer experience. Next January, we'll be selling EVs at high volume with virtually no inventory, a simple e-commerce platform for our customers, non-negotiated price set by the local dealer and remote pickup and delivery for all customer experiences. We're also expanding BlueOval charging network at all of our dealers and we'll have dealer staff trained not only on software but all the EVs. Now I've said before, software and experiences will be the key differentiator for our industry. I mentioned earlier that BlueCruise, our driver assist hands-free technology, was just tested by consumer ports and judge the best hands-free autonomous system on the market. Let that sink in for a while, the best on the market. Now have you not experienced BlueCruise, I challenge you to go out and do your side-by-side comparison with our two major competitors. And at the end of last year, our customers using BlueCruise have now traveled 42 million hands-free miles. So we're scaling incredibly rapidly. That's a fourfold increase in the millions of miles since the second quarter of last year. And we have incredible software talent, making this system better every day, including those 600 former Argo engineers who are now working full time at Ford on our autonomous systems. Now before I hand it over to John, just a few things. Ford is a different company today. We're all about building a stronger customer-focused business that generates sustainable profitable growth and returns above the cost of capital. While our 2022 results fell short of my expectations, I've never been more excited about our future because we have the right plan, the right structure to succeed, the best team on the field and real strategic clarity. This year is about execution. It's time for us to deliver, and we will with relentless attention to our founding principles, drift and growth, and we are hitting the ground running. John? No, there is a lot more to go. And the industrial system at Ford is a huge opportunity for us. And we have spent the last several months really getting deep on where we need to go. So John, maybe you could share or feeling comfortable on sharing, but you're going to hear a drumbeat from Ford on this all during the year. And Adam, I'd just like to add as the CEO, there's a lot of choices, they're all very consequential when it comes to the approach to do this. The most important thing for me is sustainable. When you look at Ford, we have cut in the past and it grows back or we have cut everywhere and not really focused on the industrial system. So for me, the approach that we're taking that's very different and very difficult is that it has to be daily work, gaps to competition, countermeasures, action plans for those countermeasures, constant evaluation of the effectiveness of those countermeasures, celebration of those KPIs and our status and daily management. It has to be a more fundamental approach than holding our breath or dealing with the output like people and getting into the real industrial systems efficiency. And that is a cultural change as a leader. It's a behavioral change. It is not just a program. No, you hit on it. And I'm glad we're getting into some of the strategies. I mean I would think of China business similar to what we've done in South America and IMG. Small but profitable, focused. We've been in the past in China kind of small but focused on everything. And Lincoln and our commercial with JMC is very profitable and an important business, but they have to make the EV transition. And I don't think you can be globally successful in the EV business if you don't compete with the Chinese. I mean they're going to come to Europe -- they're already there. They're going to come to the U.S. a powerhouse. Geely, there's so many others. And so we believe China is very strategically important for us. But to win there, we have to make those businesses transition profitably to EV, but I would think of it as kind of small and focused, maybe even more than past. And Europe is definitely -- we have a great CV business, commercial vehicle business that now is getting electrified. So we're like making that transition now. We have a new Ranger, the electric version of one-ton. Transit, and all of them, we have a new manufacturing site in Romania that's really scaling up now in commercial. So we have a really strong business. And the decision really is how much do we need how much -- how many engineers, how many people do we need in Europe and how big of a profile do we need in passenger cars? That's the decision. We've already electrified Cologne and that's really the decision. It's not the right time to talk about where we're going to go, but we know exactly our strength in Europe, and we know what we need to do. So -- and you won't have to wait long to hear from us on these things. Rod, some of the things I think about -- some of the things I think about is a number of complex sequencing centers we have. Our line sight complexity, number of parts sitting on side of the line, our inventory turns inside the plant. And on the supplier side, it's going to be transparency. We had full transparency down to Tier 3 in our supply chain. It's very important to operationalize better quality and cost. On the engineering side, it's also indirect. What's the ratio of indirect to direct engineering that we're spending, i.e., the productive engineering that's resulting in customer-facing products. And increasingly, I know it's going to sound a little bit weird, but it's the software output. We are spending as a management team more and more time on our software platform, and the cost of creating software and the complexity of software. And that's something that -- we have a lot of KPIs. They're increasing quickly and are increasingly important for us. It may not be significant for structural cost, but we have to be careful to add a lot of complexity in software. That is a very important question. The reality is we will -- we are structuring our portfolio to compete in very specific segments. The crossover is turning out to be the core civic of the EV business. And the last thing we want to do is commoditize our products by dropping the price. Just look what happened to Henry Ford in the 20s in the early teens. And that's exactly what we're seeing play out here. We didn't have to touch the pricing in offer Lightning and E-Transit because we pick the right segments. But the real driver of our future profitability on Model e is the second cycle products. We didn't know when we designed these first three products. We didn't know that our wiring harness for Mach-E was 1.6 kilometers longer than it needed to be. We didn't know it's 70 pounds heavier and that that's worth $300 a battery. We didn't know that we underinvested in braking technology to save on the battery size. We didn't know that we needed the world's best aerodynamics to get the size of the battery smaller. And so now we have learned a lot and that second cycle of the product is in the factory right now being developed with a lot of new talent. So I'm very optimistic about our 8% because we are not going to be playing in the two-row commodity SUV market because that's -- because tried that in the ICE business, didn't really work out for us. We want to play our hand, our strength, commercial, truck, larger vehicles on the category side. We do not want to have too many top ads because that costs a lot to engineer. We want to have minimum choice for customers, but we want to design the smallest possible battery for competitive size, and we want to invest differently in our ICE business for radical simplification, 30%, 40%, 50% less fasteners, no brackets in the vehicle. I can go on and on. We'll get into it at Capital Markets Day. I think we should expect all brands to protect growth when it comes to EV. And that for we have to expect negative pricing. And that means software and other items like that becoming even more critical. I can't wait to show you our new electric architecture. To me, that's the most critical strategic investment the Company is making, not our batteries, not the EV platforms, but our new fully updatable electric architecture because what we've learned on Pro is we can make real money on software. Right. Yes, great question. We're going to see that on Pro first, and this year is a breakout year for Pro because we have brand-new products, both core in Europe and U.S. are most -- the highest volume, highest profit vehicles are all new. So, a very important year for us, I would say we absolutely have a fantastic business plan that's very specific about software and physical services. The biggest opportunity for us in the short term is the after sales business. Only 10% of our Pro customers do business with us, and we hardly do any financing with them. And so between financing and parts and service, we have enormous upside in the short term. And those are very profitable parts of our business. So I would think of it this way, Ryan. It's like software is starting to drive a closed loop where the customer wants to do more physical service with us. We have all those mobile units, more and more dedicated dealers and more of our commercial customers because of the use of the software is coming back and buying parts for us. And then the next level of performance is really going to be prognostics. When we could put predictive failure in all the vehicles, like you see on John Deere and Caterpillar, and then drive that into our physical repair facilities, we're going to see a much larger retention in parts and service. So I think the basics of the business are, these are profitable vehicles. We've got new ones coming out. We're going to grow that. We're -- I mean, we blew through our parts and service profits and revenue for Pro last year. It's almost like we can't even predict as this -- that software starts to really drive a different behavior for our customers, the growth in parts and service. But that's the monetization in the short term for these services in the integrated ecosystem. And then long term, the real game changer kind of like autonomy in the retail space is going to be that prognostics. I think on the demand side, we see the U.S. around the $15 million range, Europe around $13 million. We're going to see more incentives in the U.S. So we can go through the demand side if that's what you're interested in."

            "name": "John Lawler",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim. As Jim pointed out, our performance in 2022 was below our expectations, and our industrial platform is frankly not where we need it to be. The simple way I measure this is by looking at our cost of goods sold as a percent of revenue and then compare it to our competition. You've all done it. We're much higher. And this speaks to the significant operating deficits we have in product development, manufacturing and procurement. And this is no different from the tough capital allocation choices we made on our geographic footprint and product portfolio. Choice is designed to yield higher quality growth and improved returns. And we are now applying that same level of discipline to our industrial platform with urgency. Now on the positive side, our product portfolio has never been stronger. Our new vehicles are a hit with our customers. Our iconic vehicles remain market leaders, and we continue to make strategic and capital allocation decisions to drive growth, strengthen our competitive position and produce returns above our cost of capital. So turning to the year. We generated a record $9.1 billion in free cash flow, well above our cash conversion target of 50% to 60%. And importantly, most of the free cash flow came from the Automotive business, and this reflects more disciplined capital allocation, including the restructuring of our operations outside of North America, which until recently was a significant source of cash burn. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we ended the year with $32 billion of cash and $48 million of liquidity. This, coupled with the improvement in free cash flow, provides us with ample flexibility to both fund our growth and return capital to our shareholders. In fact, today, we declared our first quarter regular dividend of $0.15 per share as well as a supplemental dividend of $0.65 per share, reflecting our strong free cash flow and the monetization of our Rivian stake, which is now nearly complete. Going forward, we intend to target distribution of 40% to 50% of free cash flow, consistent with our focus on total shareholder return. Now for the year, we delivered $10.4 billion in adjusted EBIT with a margin of 6.6%. And as Jim said, by better executing the things we control, we should have generated as much as $2 more in adjusted EBIT. For example, the instability of our supply chain and production plans caused us to not only deliver lower- than-planned volumes in the fourth quarter but also incur higher costs through premium freight and other supplier charges. Now let me give you a quick overview of how our '22 segments performed recognizing that beginning with our first quarter 2023 results will no longer have the automotive segments with regional breakouts. Now North America delivered $9.2 billion of EBIT, an improvement of $1.8 billion, driven by higher net pricing and increased volume, which was partially offset by higher commodities and other inflation-related cost increases. EBIT margin was 8.4%. We continue to maintain a healthy order bank, and the team is busy preparing the launch of the all-new Super Duty and our seventh generation Mustang later this year, and both of those are incredible products. In South America, we delivered a profit of over $400 million, and the region is now derisked and sustainably profitable. In Europe, we were slightly above breakeven for the year, but as our fourth quarter results showed clearly below our target. Given the changing macroeconomic environment and demand environment in Europe, we will make the changes necessary to deliver a sustainable business that consistently generates returns above our cost of capital. Our core strength in the region continues to be our leading commercial vehicle business. In China, we posted a loss of about $600 million, driven by increased investment in EVs. Lincoln continues to be our profit pillar in the region, but clearly, we have more work to do to ensure our business is growing sustainable and delivering appropriate returns. Our International Markets Group earned more than $600 million, driven by the launch of the Ranger and our decision to exit India. And similar to South America, the region is now primed for sustainable profitability. And finally, Ford Credit had another solid year, delivering EBT of $2.7 billion, which was down $2.1 billion from the prior year, reflecting lower credit loss and lease residual reserve releases, lower financing margin and lower lease return rates. Now given the continued uncertainties in the macro environment, I want to provide some context to how we're thinking about 2023. For the full year, we expect to earn $9 billion to $11 billion in adjusted EBIT, and that assumes a SAR of 15 million units in the U.S. and 13 million units in Europe. We expect to generate adjusted free cash flow of about $6 billion and for capital expenditures to be between $8 billion to $9 billion. Our adjusted EBIT guidance includes various headwinds and tailwinds and that we believe could impact our business in the coming year. And for example, when you think about the headwinds, they include an expected mild recession in the U.S. in moderate recession in Europe, higher industry incentives as supply and demand come back into balance. Ford Credit EBT of about $1.3 billion, and that's about $1.4 billion lower than in 2022, reflecting unfavorable lease residual and credit losses and the nonreoccurrence of derivative games. We expect a continued strong dollar. We also expect about $2 billion lower past service pension income. And we're also going to continue investments in growth, including in customer experience, connected services and CapEx as we build out our growth plan. Now tailwinds include improvements in supply chain and industry volume, launch of our all-new Super Duty and then, of course, lower cost of goods sold, including efficiencies in materials, commodities, logistics and other parts of our industrial platform. Now before taking questions, let me briefly touch on our new financial reporting as well as plans for our next Capital Markets Day. On March 23, we'll hold a teach-in at the New York Stock Exchange. And I'm really excited about this opportunity because it will be our chance to take you through how the new Ford+ segments will alter our financial reporting. The changes will include how revenue, cost products and assets are assigned to each segment. At the teaching, we'll also share our recast financials for both 2021 and 2022, and we hope many of you join us at the New York Stock Exchange in person. But we will also broadcast a webcast live, and will be -- and will post a toolkit and other materials to orient you around all the materials and help you migrate your models. Now the teaching will not be a strategic update. That will come at our Capital Markets Day in Dearborn in May, when we'll update you on our Ford+ strategy. We'll do a deep dive into financial targets and KPIs for each of our new segments as well as for software and services. Now with this new level of transparency, which will be tracked and validated in our earnings materials and SEC filings, we think investors will be better equipped to value how each of our customer-focused segments is contributing to Ford's overall growth and return profile. And as Jim mentioned earlier, 2023 is a pivotal year for Ford. We have the plan, the talent and the product portfolio in place to take the Company to an exciting new level, one that is both differentiated from our past performance and our competitors. And going forward, our new segmentation will provide unprecedented levels of transparency and insight into all aspects of our business, making it easier to hold Ford leadership accountable for delivering superior growth and value for all of our stakeholders. Now that wraps up the prepared remarks, and we'll use the balance of the time to address what's on your mind. So thank you. And operator, please open up the line for questions. Yes. So Adam, I think if you just step back and look at the three elements of the industrial platform, there's opportunities across each. If you look at our product development system and in our engineering, the level of productivity that we have, so think about $1 of input and what you get out for that $1 of input is probably about 25% to 30% inefficient. So, we should be either getting more products through the pipeline or our cost should be significantly lower. Now we have to be very smart about how we go about doing that because we've got incredible products in the pipeline, and there's a huge opportunity on that front, but we also have to balance the quality as well. And so, when it comes to our engineering, I think you should think about it that way, and that's what we're going after. Our supply chain, there are issues across the supply chain. It cost us, as we talked about last year, at least $1 billion in premiums that we had to pay, increased freight premiums on chips, premiums on disruption that we called our suppliers because our schedule stability was probably worst in class and fixing that and the root cause it gets to that will drive incredible opportunities for us. And let's say that for 2023, it should be at least an incremental $1 billion at least. And then when you look at our manufacturing system and you go through our plants, you look at the level of working capital we have in, you look at our production schedules, you look at the complexity and what it does for time that takes us to build a vehicle. And you understand just how inefficient that is. And then you bring that back through that -- complexity back through the supply chain, and you talked about the number of changeovers that our suppliers have to make to produce the complexity that we have and the time that, that adds to production and the time that it adds the cost and the issues that it drives through. So those are just some of the tip of the iceberg or the things we're going after. And then if you go back and you look at it, as I said in my remarks, just you look at the math and you look at our cost of goods sold relative to our revenue and then compare that to traditional OEMs, let alone the new OEMs, and you see the size of the prize that we're going after. And what's changed, Adam, I think the answer is, is we just have to show you guys. I mean that's where we're at. We have to deliver it. But as Jim said, as we're taking this lean approach and getting into it, there's a very systematic way we're going at it now, and we are very focused. And we know that this is the number one thing that needs to get fixed in the first part of our transformation. Yes. Thanks, John. It's a great question. That's exactly it. The headwinds are $4.5 billion to $5 billion, as we pointed out. And we said we expect on the tailwinds pricing to be about neutral. The market forces, I think, are going to drive average transaction prices down. We think probably around 5%. And that will come some from the dealer margins, but also from higher incentives. And then you step back from it, and we do have the new Super Duty, and we expect that to be a positive and we also have a very strong order bank on our commercial vehicles. So we're looking at pricing being about flattish we said volumes, there's a slight opportunity as industry comes along. So the rest of it falls into cost reductions, and that's exactly right. When you look at those cost reductions, you have to see what's happening relative to the material. And in, there's two phases there. There's one, it's -- we do expect commodity prices to come off a bit to improve a bit, but we also have significant opportunities in our material cost, and we have several initiatives going on to identify those efficiencies. We also have quite a bit of cost when you talk about schedule stability. I don't have the exact data from the competition. But when I look at our scheduled stability, there are significant opportunities through changes that we can take to improve that schedule stability, which will flow straight through to lower surcharges from the supply base because they have to deal with that instability and there's cost that drives as well as the significant premiums we paid in freight for expedite, air freight, et cetera, to just try to keep plants going and keep our suppliers' plans going. So, those are two immediate actions that we can take based on the inefficiencies we saw in '22 that cost us the $2 billion. And then on top of that, we have to build through the core industrial platform just productivity and efficiencies to drive even more improvement. So that's how we're thinking about it, and that's how we're going about it. Yes. So on the pricing, we do see the broad market coming in at about transaction prices falling about 5%. Some of that's going to come out of the dealer margins, of course. It's not all going to come from us. But we also have upside, Rod, with some of the launch of the new vehicles. We won't see as much of a price compression there. So, we see pricing net-net for us next year being about flattish. And so don't think about it as we're working through '23 as being a negative $1 billion. And then I would say that when it comes to the cost reductions, I think what we've got to start showing is, one, that we're getting leverage out of the business if we're growing the business that our cost of goods sold is growing at a much slower pace. And that as we're coming out with new vehicles, our cost per units are coming down, so our margins are improving. When you look at the design of our vehicles and you compare it to competition, I think if you go through those benchmarks and you go through those teardowns, you can see that there's a tremendous amount of opportunity for us to design out complexity. And you should see that coming through complexity reduction KPIs on our vehicles. I think that will be key. And it not only will be in the order combinations but also in the parts complexity in the number of parts. And what we'll be doing is as we move forward through this year, especially at Capital Markets Day, we'll be providing more details on those KPIs. But it's the key areas you should be seeing how much productivity we're getting out of $1 of engineering, and we should do something around that from a KPI standpoint because these are the areas that we need to improve. Rod, I think it's beyond just structural cost. Our biggest cost element is our material cost. We will continue to invest in our growth-related investments, some connected services. The software, as Jim talked about, we're also continuing to invest, as you know, in our build-out of our batteries. So our spending related costs are going to go up. Volume will drive manufacturing cost, which is in our structural cost. So there will be puts and takes on the structural costs. Our biggest opportunity is in our level of material cost that we have. It's the largest cost element on our income statement, and it's where we are most uncompetitive. So, we're going after everything, but I... Yes. I think it comes down to the key driver for the in the fourth quarter was the volumes. And the volumes was on availability of key commodities, primarily chips and the fact that many of our suppliers had equipment issues as they were ramping. We think we've worked through a lot of those issues on the ramp in our supply chain. And as far as the rate inflow on the commodities, the chips, it continues to be hand-to-hand comment. But we're putting corrective actions in place. We've got better pipelines from brokers and spot buys, and we're working very closely with our supply chain down to the Tier 2 chip suppliers. So that's execution, it changes that we're putting in place on the rate and flow, and it's being more efficient in our scheduling and the stability of our production to reduce expedited freight, expedited costs at our supply chain, et cetera. So, part of it's operational. Part of it's what we're doing working with our supply chain partners. And part of it is getting through the hump on ramping up run rates, et cetera, throughout the system. Right. So if you look at that, it's at least $2.5 billion depending on where we fall within the range of the guidance. So I think that would be a start point, and then we would go from there. And of course, we're going to be working to do better than that. But that's what we see so far. Yes. Yes. So I think what we would have to say is that given that we're moving to our segments for 2023, we're not going to be reporting the regions. And so we will give more color on 2023 by each of the business unit segments. And so I'm not going to comment on regions anymore going forward, unless there's a specific reason to do that within one of the segments. Yes. I think in Europe, we're going to see continued pressure on the top line. We've got a 13 million unit in the industry. We think we still have such a strong order bank. We not think we know we have a strong order bank on our commercial vehicles that we don't see as much pressure there. More of the pressure will come on the passenger side. But pricing in Europe, incentives continue to be strong throughout this year. So I don't think you'll see as much price compression in Europe, as you've seen in -- you'll see in North America and the U.S. But I think definitely for Europe, it's the call on the industry and where do we think that will be offset by the strength of the order bank we have on our commercial vehicles. Coming back to the U.S., as we said, a 15 million unit industry, we think prices are going to come and the industry are going to fall, transaction prices will fall about 5%. You think about that as about a combination of incentives and lower dealer margins. We're starting to see dealer margins come down now as our demand from the industry is easing a bit. And we're starting to see the inflationary costs come through with the pricing. And so we're starting to see those margins come off. And I think through as we go through the year, particularly in the second half, you'll start to see prices come down through higher incentives by the OEMs. When you look at our International Markets Group, I think it's a little bit different there. Our key product is Ranger, and that's all new, and that's launching, and so there's incredible demand for it. And so we think we have some pricing power there as well. So I think the puts and takes around the region, if you look at it on a macro basis. And I think it will be more insightful as we talk about what's happening in each of the segments and then specifically what's happening in Pro Blue and e in those segments around the world. On the software side, we were guessing before, but now we kind of know what the first three shippable large TAM software revenue sources are for our industry. The first is partial autonomy, the second is safety and security and the third is productivity. And the star people in there, the early leaders definitely ADAS on pricing revenue growth. I mean, the growth we're seeing, the demand we're seeing for BlueCruise and all ADAS features is really driving a lot of software shipment. We're about to ship our second cycle of BlueCruise already, and we are really starting to see -- that is clearly what customers want revenue-wise. And I do believe in this first three, four years of software to the car that ADAS, that Level 2, Level 3 system, is really the most remarkable TAM. However, in the background, for Ford, the productivity software in Pro is really important. It's maybe unique to us, but it is a very important part of our software revenue, which we will lay out in May. You'll see more specifics on it, but it's very profitable. The customers love the data, and they have a higher demand for the data and the software than the retail customer. I think the slow burn, the one in the background that I'm super excited about is the third leg of the stool of safety and security, not like someone stole your car, but it's video content, a lot of it tied to insurance. So this is going to be a really interesting area. Kind of think of your cars and extension of your ring and all the safety and security you have in your house now, all that technology, the cars give me another note on that. It will go for everything from teenage drivers to all sorts of things and that video capture is going to be the essence. Another reason why we think our next electrical architecture is so strategically important for the Company because we want to embed that hardware and software and adaptability in the electric architecture so we can ship the software, better software than our competition on safety and security, even if it's a little fuzzy on what the features are today."

On November 7th, tech analyst, Toni Sacconaghi, will host a fireside chat with Doug Field at the AllianceBernstein\u2019s Electric Revolution Conference in London. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jim Farley.\nJim Farley: Thank you, Lynn. Hi, everyone. We really appreciate you being with us today. We introduced the Ford+ Plan for growth and value creation two years ago, and the investment thesis had three drivers: leveraging our iconic vehicles, our strengths, both geographically and nameplates; number two, add to that, integrated hardware, software and connectivity into those vehicles; and then expand the total addressable market and unlocking value with Conquest EVs, new commercial vehicles, connected services and physical services as well as mobility. So today, I\u2019d like to share a progress report on Ford\u2019s transformation, of course, update you on our autonomy strategy and our announcement and, of course, recap the quarter. Our ambition to be the leader in EV is already taking shape. In our home market, Ford Model e is now -- has now had incredible successful launch of three products. They\u2019re now in scaling F-150 Lightning, Mach-E and E-Transit, and each are attracting, interesting for us, almost all new customers. So, this is growth. We\u2019re now the number two electric brand in the U.S., and we\u2019re just beginning with our scaling. Our decision to create Blue for both ICE and hybrid vehicles has focused and energized our team to leverage what we do best at Ford. We have launched a string of hits that our products -- our customers not only love, but have lined up to buy, and we have so many more exciting products to come. We have made tough capital allocation and restructuring decisions like the one today, particularly in South America and our international market groups like India and our results and cash flow, you could see in our results, have improved dramatically. Our balance sheet remains strong. We ended the quarter with nearly $50 billion in liquidity, even as we accelerate investments in connectivity and electrification. And what is perhaps the biggest untold story at Ford, we\u2019ve successfully recruited a roster of an incredible talent from some of the world\u2019s best technology companies who are here to ship product and are supercharging our ability to design that software-defined vehicle and, of course, the software and services that go into those vehicles for the future. At the same token and at the same time, we have still so much work ahead. Clearly, we need to continue to improve our competitiveness, not just on quality, but on cost and supply chain management. And our performance in China and Europe is not nearly as healthy as we\u2019d like it to be. I can\u2019t overstate the sense of urgency we have to address these critical operating areas. I look forward to updating you on future calls. Now, I\u2019d like to share an important strategic shift in our autonomous vehicle strategy. Five years ago, we committed to invest $1 billion in Argo AI to develop autonomous Level 4 technology. In 2020, we completed the transaction that resulted in Ford and VW both owning the majority of Argo at equal levels. We still believe in Level 4 autonomy that it will have a big impact on our business of moving people. We\u2019ve learned though in our partnership with Argo and after our own internal investments, that we will have a very long road. It\u2019s estimated that more than $100 billion has been invested in the promise of Level 4 autonomy. And yet no one has defined a profitable business model at scale. Based on the change in this outlook and our increasing promise and focus on Level 2+ and Level 3 autonomy, we\u2019ve decided to wind down the Argo business and impair the investment. We\u2019re working closely with Argo and VW on all the details. But here\u2019s what I want to focus on. Advancing Level 2 hardware and software beyond what BlueCruise can do today and ultimately enabling our customers to travel in very large ODDs, or operating domains, with their eyes off the road will give them back the single most valuable commodity in our modern lives, time. This has become mission-critical for us at Ford. Ford has deployed BlueCruise on many vehicles across hundreds of thousands of Blue zone miles. We have strong technology partners working alongside us. And now, we\u2019re going to bring in several hundred people from Argo, a brilliant collection of minds, who\u2019ve done a great job, who have done wonderful work in the L4 space, but their job and mission now is to help us create a differentiated Level 4 BlueCruise system. Yes, there are huge -- this is a huge addressable market and the potential for highly accretive new revenue streams tied to Level 3, but at the end of the day, this is about giving millions of people that time and eliminating the monotony of highway miles and stop-and-go traffic. And as for the future of true L4 autonomy, we don\u2019t expect there to be a sudden aha moment like we used to. Deploying L4 broadly, perhaps the toughest technical problem of our time, will require significant breakthroughs going forward in many areas: reliable and low-cost sensing, it\u2019s not the case today; algorithms that can operate on limited compute resources without constraining the operating time and domain of an electric vehicle; breakthroughs in neural networks that can learn to operate a car more safely than a human, even in very complex urban environments. The muscles we have built with our new talent in broadly deploying a transformative Blue Cruise L3 system will ultimately be essential to the future of accessible driverless vehicles in everyday life. What\u2019s so exciting for me is that we are on the cusp of a transformational moment for Ford. We will introduce a lineup of not first, but second cycle EVs that are not only fully software updatable and constantly improving, but they will generate an 8% plus margin, an amazing array of software-enabled services, not just BlueCruise L3, but many others, video services for software -- for safety and security, and we\u2019re already shipping a broad range of Ford Pro productivity tools and 100% uptime services for our commercial customers. That is a transformation for us. Let me now switch to the quarter. With Ford Model e, we\u2019re on track to reach our annual production rate of 600,000 EVs by the end of next year and 2 million by 2026. I\u2019ll say that carefully. There is no change to our target. We\u2019re adding shifts to the Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightings as we speak, and we\u2019re scaling production of E-Transit. In Europe, our all-new EV manufacturing center in Cologne will finish complete -- will be complete in turning out vehicles midway through next year. Our Ford Otosan JV in Turkey is not only scaling the 2-ton E-Transit, but they\u2019re also going to be launching a brand-new product, a 1-ton E-Transit custom electric while breaking ground on a new battery plant that will supply those for those transits. And in September, we\u2019re starting production -- we\u2019ve already started construction of Blue Oval City in Tennessee, where we will build a new generation EV truck and batteries. And at the same time, we\u2019ve already broken ground as well on the new BlueOval SK battery plants, plural, in Kentucky. We\u2019re also further strengthening Model e\u2019s EV supply chain. Our team is making great progress in securing raw materials, importantly the processing of those raw materials and the battery capacity that we need. We expect the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act to have a wide range of positive impacts for both our customers and for Ford. What\u2019s not yet clear is the degree to which the IRA will drive customer demand versus offsetting our EV investments in growth. So, let me touch on some of the potential benefits of the IRA. The first opportunity is our largest, the battery production tax credit of about $45 per kilowatt hour. From \u201823 to \u201826, we estimate a combined available tax credit for Ford and our battery partners could total more than $7 billion with large step-up in annual credits in \u201827 as our JV battery plants ramp up to full production. The second benefit is often overlooked. I haven\u2019t actually read any one of the media covering this, but it\u2019s super important for Ford. And that\u2019s the commercial EV credit. You know that Ford is the number one commercial vehicle brand in the U.S., and our commercial customers can now claim next year $7,500 per EV vehicle they buy with no restrictions on battery sourcing or manufacturing. Our preliminary estimate is that between 55% and 65% of all of our commercial vehicle customers will qualify. The third opportunity is retail. Ford EVs and our PHEVs remain eligible for the $7,500 tax credit until guidance is issued at the end of this year. Next year, we believe we\u2019ll meet the $3,750 critical materials credit requirement on certain Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning models. In \u201824, the rules will further restrict this critical materials credit. So, we believe it\u2019s playing -- a fairly level playing field right now for all the OEMs as our supply chains of critical material extraction and course processing in the U.S. and FTA develops. The fourth benefit centers on the funding growth in our investments, such as geothermal energy credit critical for Blue Oval City, the Department of Energy loans, grants to convert our domestic facilities to produce electric vehicles, battery plants and other EV components. We\u2019re exploring all these capabilities and possibilities as you can imagine. Now, as you know, we shared the new electric customer standards with all of our North America dealers last month in Vegas. That means a single, simple e-commerce platform, ultra-low vehicle-finished inventory, non-negotiated pricing and fast charges at all of our dealerships. Now early response from the dealers have been very favorable. Many are poised to invest to meet these new standards for electric vehicle customers, while other dealers will opt to specialize Ford Blue Oval or Ford Pro. And there\u2019s real rewards for going first. Turning to Ford Blue. We view this business Ford Blue as growth. Last month, we unveiled the seventh generation Mustang. We showed the all-new amazing Super Duty in Churchill Downs in Kentucky. And there -- these are all very well-executed products with incredible technology and upgraded electrical architectures with advanced powertrains, and they really set them apart from the competition. What you can\u2019t see is what we see. Our design studio is filled with new products and derivatives that will expand our hit franchises like F-150 and Bronco and Mustang and the new Maverick and the Explorer and the Ranger, all segments that we\u2019re a leader among the leaders. And I can\u2019t wait to show you these new derivatives based on ICE and hybrid powertrains. Finally, let\u2019s talk about Pro. In the U.S., customers trust us more than -- with more than 40% of the market for full-sized commercial trucks and vans. In Europe, we\u2019re also the number one commercial vehicle brand. That\u2019s for 7 years now, soon to be 8. Businesses of all sizes and types are using Ford Pro\u2019s vehicles as well as the suite of our services to lower their cost and improve their productivity. Now, that includes multi-mix fleets, and fleets that are a mix of ICE and EVs. Ford Pro has a real opportunity to grow service and parts sales by offering better experiences like mobile service. We expect to have more than 1,200 mobile service units in operation globally by the end of this year, and they\u2019re driving significant dealer parts and service revenue. Actually, more than $10,000 per global -- per unit, service unit, per month. But the real game changer for us in the Pro business, in parts and service growth, is software, software centered on productivity, telematics, security and predictive failure of all components. In the third quarter, we saw our paid telematics for Pro grow by over 40% sequentially for the third straight quarter. Our suite of Ford Pro software solutions keeps getting stronger and stronger, as we launch new offerings like Ford Pro fleet and the VIIZR field service management software. But before I hand it over to John, let me end with this. We have many challenges as a company, and we\u2019re tackling them head-on. That\u2019s clear from our third quarter results. At the same time, I\u2019m so excited about the future we\u2019re creating with Ford+. We\u2019re building completely new businesses with the best of Ford talent and incredibly -- incredible new talent across not just Model e, but Ford Blue and Ford Pro. We\u2019re strengthening our product portfolio across the board, building on what we think is the strongest portfolio we\u2019ve ever had. And we\u2019re tracking the scale to a global run rate of 2 million EVs a year by 2026, and we\u2019re investing in growth. Taken together, this work statement is nothing short of refounding one of the world\u2019s most iconic companies to compete and win in a brand-new era. There\u2019s no holding back. There\u2019s no looking back. There\u2019s no slowing down. In fact, we\u2019re accelerating our transformation. John?\nJohn Lawler: Thanks, Jim. So, when I look at the quarter and our performance year-to-date, I actually see some real promises. First, our strategic actions to segment and stand out three distinct businesses, Ford Model e, Ford Blue and Ford Pro, while complete yet, is truly transformational and is already changing how we manage the business. So, it\u2019s about more than just accelerating profitable growth, it\u2019s also about how we are going to do that by orienting everything around our different types of customers. The separation of these businesses is revealing to the entire organization how deeply rooted complexity is in our legacy business and how this disadvantages us in quality, innovation, customer satisfaction and ultimately, cost and efficiency. And we see it everywhere, from design, to engineering, to manufacturing and how we interact with each other and our suppliers. And so, to me, this is really exciting. We understand the magnitude of opportunity and leverage that this will provide across the entire business. Now, we just need to deliver. Second, our product portfolio has never been stronger. Starting with our top-selling first-generation EVs like Mustang Mach-E, F-150 Lightning and E-Transit to our new models of category-leading vehicles like Mustang and Super Duty as well as popular derivatives like Raptor and Tremor. These are all inspiring products that our customers love. And finally, our capital allocation choices are really paying off. Our sustainable free cash flow generation from our automotive business is improving significantly, even as we accelerate investments in electrification and connectivity. And this improvement reflects the tough choices that we have made to focus on our strengths, hone our footprint and our product portfolio, especially outside of North America. So, with that as a backdrop, let me turn to our financial results for the quarter. We delivered $1.8 billion in adjusted EBIT, above the $1.4 billion to $1.7 billion guidance range we provided last month. In automotive, wholesales were up 7% year-over-year. However, EBIT was weighed down by the rich mix of 40,000 vehicles on wheels we had in inventory at the end of the quarter and about $1 billion in lump-sum supplier settlements. The settlements offset costs incurred by our suppliers, partially due to inflationary impacts on labor, freight and commodities as well as higher costs because of our inconsistent production schedule, which has been disruptive for our partners. So, providing greater certainty and schedule stability to our supply base is just one example of the many opportunities we have in front of us as we transform our global supply chain. So, we\u2019re very grateful for our suppliers\u2019 ongoing support and the collaborative approach they are taking to address production shortfalls, while also focusing on improving the quality of the parts they ship to us. In the quarter, we delivered $3.6 billion in free cash flow with strong cash generation by our automotive business, despite the adverse effects of the 40,000 vehicles on wheels. We expect the negative working capital impact of those units to reverse in the fourth quarter when the vehicles are completed and shipped to dealers. Our balance sheet continues to be very healthy. And we ended the quarter with strong cash and liquidity of $32 billion and $49 billion, respectively. And these numbers include our remaining stake in Rivian, which was valued at less than $1 billion at the end of the quarter. Now, I\u2019ll touch on the performance of our business units. North America delivered $1.3 billion of EBIT and a margin of 5%. Both of those measures were driven down year-over-year by higher commodity costs, inflationary pressures and a diverse mix, reflecting the buildup of vehicles on wheels and inventory. Our brand strength and order banks remain very strong, and we expect the North American margin to return to double digits in the fourth quarter. South America continues to benefit from our global redesign efforts, delivering strong margins in its fifth consecutive profitable quarter. In Europe, we posted a profit of $200 million. And supply chain constraints began to ease, resulting in sequential wholesale growth of 23%. Our commercial vehicle business continues to fortify its leadership position ending the quarter with a 15.2% share year-to-date. And in China, we posted a loss of $200 million, driven by the investments we are making in electric vehicles. Lincoln continues to be a bright spot for the region with share improving again sequentially. Our International Markets Group continues to be solidly profitable. EBIT margins were over 8%, driven by the launch of our exciting all-new Ranger. And then finally, Ford Credit delivered another strong quarter with EBT of $600 million that reflected a more normalized run rate for this business. The anticipated sequential profit decline was driven by the non-operating release of credit loss reserves and higher borrowing costs. Let me now walk through our impairment of Argo. As Jim highlighted, it\u2019s become clear that the technology required to achieve profitable commercialization of L4 autonomy at scale is going to take much longer than we previously expected. L2+ and L3 driver assist technologies have a larger addressable customer base, which will allow it to scale more quickly and profitably, and that\u2019s going to provide accretive annuity-like revenue streams. During the third quarter, we made the strategic decision to shift our capital spending from the L4 technology being developed by Argo to internally develop L2+/L3 technology. And as a result, in the third quarter, we recorded a $2.7 billion noncash pretax impairment as a special item. Now, let me share with you our current outlook. For the year, we expect to earn about $11.5 billion in adjusted EBIT, up about 15% from 2021 with about a 10% increase in wholesales. We\u2019re now projecting to generate adjusted free cash flow of $9.5 billion to $10 billion. Our year-over-year basis for our \u201822 adjusted EBIT target assumes significantly higher earnings in North America; aggregate profitability in the rest of the world; Ford Credit EBT at about $2.7 billion, with strong, though lower, auction values in the fourth quarter as the supply of new vehicles improves and higher borrowing costs; continued strong pent-up demand in orders for Ford\u2019s newest products; continued strength in pricing; higher commodity and broad-based inflationary costs of about $9 billion; no further deterioration in supply chain; and continuation of a strong dollar. So finally, before getting to your questions, let me provide a quick update on our new financial reporting. Last quarter, we mentioned our plan to host a teach-in event early next year to help you prepare for this change to a radically new strategic organization ahead of our first quarter 2023 reporting. So, we\u2019ve now fixed the date for March. At the teach-in, we will share both, 2021 and 2022 revised results to reflect our new segmentation, which we will start using for reporting purposes in Q1 of 2023. But because this is far more than an accounting exercise, we\u2019ll also reiterate and illustrate the business rationale for the change along with the reporting mechanics and implications for our earnings disclosures and SEC filings, and we\u2019ll furnish you with a full toolkit to help you transition your models. So, that wraps up our prepared remarks. We\u2019ll use the balance of the time to address what\u2019s on your minds. And thank you. Operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from John Murphy with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJohn Murphy: Good evening, guys. Thanks for all the detail. There\u2019s a lot of questions. I\u2019ll try to keep it to one here. On the pivot from AV to ADAS or semiautonomous, Jim, there\u2019s a lot of moving pieces here. But there are some out there that believe they have a solution to this that\u2019s close to working. And I think some of us thought that Argo might be not that far behind. So, I\u2019m curious what changed. And if you think those folks may be misguided in their assumption that they actually have a solution? And sort of the corollary to that is, are you going to take this capital, and it sounds like you are going to, and accelerate your EV and your connectivity efforts that will generate profits much more quickly in the near term? And how much profit opportunity are there, or is there, around these connected vehicles that you\u2019re seeing with Pro that might spill over into the consumer side?\nJim Farley: Thank you, John. The decision we made to reallocate our capital is a strategic one. It\u2019s some combination of the margins we\u2019re starting to see on our software, like Ford Pro, that\u2019s really the first large shippable software. The usage patterns we\u2019re seeing in BlueCruise, how much people use it and how passionate they are, and that\u2019s before ICE off, the confidence we now have in delivering L2 -- Level 3; the access to public markets for Level 4 funding; the opaqueness, as John said, of the view to return capital, the invested capital in Level 4 and Level 5. And it\u2019s some combination of that and a few other factors. But the biggest factor is our growing confidence in our talent, both the Argo talent and the team at Ford that Doug is building. And I\u2019m sure in the investment conference that will be a big focus of his comments. It\u2019s that combination, more than are we behind or we ahead, that informed us of this decision. And I think it\u2019s one of the bigger moments for us as a leadership team. And we are so excited about the software we can ship to our vehicles. We see it in BlueCruise now. We see in a Ford Pro. And we see other software that we\u2019re in the midst of. And the other key enabler is our growing confidence in landing a fully software-updatable vehicle as we launch our second cycle EVs. John, maybe it\u2019s best for you to talk about the reallocation of capital.\nJohn Lawler: Yes. So, first off, we\u2019re not capital constrained. We\u2019re investing our $50 billion, and we\u2019re investing on top of that in connectivity and software. So, we ended the quarter with $32 billion of cash and $49 billion of liquidity. So, it\u2019s taking that investment and putting it towards a business where we think we will have a sizable return in the near term relative to one that\u2019s going to have a long arc. And that\u2019s the business decision behind it. So, I think we need to be very clear about that. We\u2019re going to invest in L2 and L3, and some of the savings that we have will go into that.\nJohn Murphy: If I could just maybe just follow up on that. I mean there\u2019s got to be a high level of confidence that you\u2019re not going to be left behind as autonomy may develop over time. So I mean, a skeptic would say you\u2019re throwing in the towel and you can\u2019t keep up. An optimist would say you actually have confidence that you\u2019ll be able to keep up and maybe surpass the competition over time. I mean, how would you couch it in that range?\nJim Farley: Well, I think it\u2019s best, John, for us to hear from Doug. But before we do that, I want to emphasize that a winning L4 business is as much about the go-to-market investment of a consumer-facing service. And all the depots, all the HD mapping of all the ODs across this enormous geography, all the enormous fleet, and because it\u2019s still weather-constrained, you have to have a driven fleet to complement it. So, aside from the -- handicapping the technology, the enormous investment that will have to be made in the nontechnology pieces is a big factor in our thinking. And Doug, maybe you could talk about how we\u2019re -- because we\u2019re still very excited about Level 4, how you see it as a technologist on the technology portion?\nDoug Field: Sure, Jim. As you mentioned, this is going to be a really tough problem to solve. It\u2019s the toughest problem of our generation. And I don\u2019t think about it as capital constraints nearly as much as talent constraints. In the kind of projects that we are diving into at Ford and the kind of work that we\u2019re doing, the constraint really becomes how many of the world\u2019s best people can you get working on a problem. And that\u2019s really the decision, in many ways, that is driving what we\u2019re doing here at Argo is we are deeply passionate about the L3 mission. We have ideas of how it can work and how customers can interact with it that are really exciting, particularly when you add them to our next-generation EVs. So, this is the way we want to use that talent. And we think it\u2019s the most meaningful way for them to impact the world.\nOperator: Next question is from Colin Langan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nColin Langan: Just a follow-up on the Argo, just to be clear. I mean, did you look for acquirers for the business? I mean, obviously, rather than taking a big impairment. And maybe a follow-up a little bit. What is your kind of time line for Level 4 that you\u2019re looking at? I mean, do you think this is 20 years out at this point? I mean, I guess you had a comment with some sort of assessment before you made the decision.\nJim Farley: Absolutely. As I mentioned, Colin, we looked at many variables, and one of them is access to public markets. We were very clear that the Argo journey would include access to public markets over the last year. And we feel like that\u2019s a lot more challenged. So yes, we looked at possible partnerships and funding. But it was 1 of maybe 10 factors that we looked at in making this decision. John, maybe -- why don\u2019t you hear your -- our discussion as a leadership team on the time frame?\nJohn Lawler: Yes. So Colin, when we looked at this, as Jim said, not only does it require the technology breakthroughs and the capital invested in the technology, but then in all the services and fleets, scaling across the country that would be required to get to a profitable business. We saw that five years plus the horizon being that far out before you could actually get to something that started to generate a meaningful business. And we see a much greater opportunity to impact more customers immediately with the L2, L3 technology and impact our business in a positive way in the more near-term time frame. So, that was part of the business discussion that we had with the team.\nColin Langan: Got it. And if I just have a quick follow-up. In terms of the guidance change, you lowered guidance at the midpoint by $500 million. But you did indicate raw materials look like about a $2 billion worse headwind. You lowered forward credit, volume guidance came down. So any color on the offset to the headwinds that you outlined in the release?\nJohn Lawler: Yes. I think it\u2019s really two things. It\u2019s the mix that we can see, vehicle line mix coming out of the supply base and then sterling. The exposure we have, as you know, we\u2019re the largest commercial vehicle player in Europe from a brand standpoint, and we have a very strong presence in the UK. And so that currency change did hit us quite hard after the quarter closed. And so, when we look at that, one of the things that we\u2019ve done, Colin, that I\u2019ve done, is I spent a lot of time -- the team has -- the last couple of weeks, doing deep dive on-site reviews of the supply base. In fact, we\u2019re approaching a deep review of almost 300 of those suppliers. And what we\u2019re finding is that there\u2019s a number of non-chip suppliers that are struggling to ramp production as the chip crisis eases. And it\u2019s not easing tremendously, it\u2019s easing slightly. We\u2019re starting to see that. But then we\u2019re seeing issues in non-chip suppliers. It has to do with the tight labor market, but it also has to do refining with many of the suppliers during the COVID time frame had not invested in maintenance or in their facilities and tooling, and so they\u2019re not able to ramp as we expected. And that\u2019s hit us in the fourth quarter on mix versus what we had expected. And so, it\u2019s really the mix in the currency that\u2019s getting to us and brought us down to the low end of our range.\nColin Langan: Okay. And the offset to that $2 billion in results, is that pricing and possible vehicle mix? Sorry.\nJim Farley: Yes, pricing. Net pricing continues to remain strong. Exactly, pricing continues to remain strong.\nOperator: The next question is from Ryan Brinkman with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nRyan Brinkman: Are you able to dimension for us how much of the $1 billion of higher-than-expected supplier-related inflation costs incurred in 3Q actually relate to in-period expenses incurred by suppliers versus how much might represent a catch-up of prior period cost? To know that I think would help with understanding what portion of this headwind in 3Q that we should model as continuing into 2023 versus how much might be more onetime in nature?\nJim Farley: Yes. So, one of the things that we\u2019re doing is, as we\u2019re taking settlements with the supply base, we\u2019re looking to do that more in a lump-sum fashion, so that it\u2019s not baked into the piece price. And we\u2019ll share more about what that means on a go-forward basis as we talk about \u201823 in Q4. So, what we\u2019ve provided for the year is it\u2019s $9 billion, up from $7 billion last quarter when we reported. The amount of $1 billion in the third quarter was part of the third quarter, but it was also a settlement for the first half as well. And it largely reflects a lot of ways, a confluence of factors that led to that. One of the things we are having better clarity around is schedule and stability. And combining that with labor shortages and our high complexity, that had a larger impact on the supply base\u2019s ability to deliver cost efficiencies this year and much higher than we expected, and quite frankly, higher than we were initially willing to accept. And so, we spent a lot of time with our supplier partners. And we came to the conclusion, and that included conversations all the way up with June with supplier CEOs. And our conclusion coming out of that was that it became evident that we needed to increase the settlement amount, support our supplier partners, and we made the call in the third quarter. And then, we told all of you as soon as we made that call. So that we got out in front of it and knew what we knew.\nRyan Brinkman: Okay. Very helpful. And lastly, I think at the time of the 2Q call, you considered it a bit too early to say whether commodity costs are likely to be a tailwind or a headwind next year. But with the subsequent decline now in spot prices, are you more confident that commodities are likely to be a tailwind? And are you able to dimension at all that tailwind or maybe compare it directionally in magnitude to the headwinds that you\u2019re likely to face when it comes to non-commodity supply chain costs which do not seem to be deflating similar to commodities?\nJim Farley: Yes. So, we are seeing the commodity spot prices come off a bit, but quite honestly, it\u2019s not meaningful enough at this point to make a significant impact. I think we\u2019re all trying to work through the macroeconomic environment how far are things going to slow down, how quickly will that drive easing of commodity prices? Will that also drive ease in the whole logistics chain? We know that logistic prices are up significantly. Ocean freight is up significantly. And so, right now, we\u2019re trying to make that call on 2023, with a quarter left to go, is a really difficult thing to do. So, we\u2019re going to hold off on doing any of that today. And we\u2019ll be able to talk about more of that with our Q4 earnings at the beginning of next year.\nOperator: The next question is from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nRod Lache: I wanted to just ask about vehicle pricing. Jim, you\u2019ve always had a pretty good read on seeing the market through the consumers\u2019 lens. And obviously, average transaction prices are up a lot, and now rates are going up, and trade-in values are starting to come off the peak. Can you maybe just give us your thoughts about affordability and this interplay between price and volume and inventory starts to normalize? It\u2019d be helpful if you had any thoughts on kind of the magnitude of price normalization that we might see over the next year or two?\nJim Farley: Thank you, Rob. The early signs are coming in. It\u2019s interesting. It\u2019s lumpy. The commercial vehicle and EV demand is through the roof. We\u2019ve seen literally no -- no change, if not an increase. And that includes commercial vehicles in Europe, which is interesting. Our order bank continues to grow. It\u2019s multi, multi month. We continue to have to close out order windows for our commercial vehicles because of the demand. Same for EVs, as we\u2019ve taken prices up. On the retail side in the U.S., what I see that\u2019s different from last quarter is slight uptick on 84-month customer financing, and Marion, if you want to go into that, that\u2019s fine. We\u2019re seeing, obviously, an easing of used cars, which makes trade-ins, and those transactions that include trade-ins a little more challenging for customers for higher payments. We\u2019re seeing -- the one that I watch the most is our turn rates for F-150. It\u2019s our highest volume vehicle. And we\u2019re starting to see some differences in turn rates between XLT and Lariat. It\u2019s small right now, but it\u2019s different. In the past, Lariat\u2019s turned faster than XLT, and that\u2019s reversed compared to the quarter. It\u2019s really subtle right now. So, what I\u2019d expect on pricing -- and you see some of our competitors come in with higher spending now on incentives. So, we\u2019ve already accounted for some of that, as John has said in the past. What I would be looking for and what I think is important to watch for is the mix changes. The mixes of series and specifications within a profitable nameplate, like Super Duty or F-150 or mix shifts, obviously, between models. Rod, our lineup is so fresh right now. It\u2019s very opaque for us. So, the only mix shift we\u2019re seeing is within spec. Marion, do you want to mention anything about payments?\nMarion Harris: Yes. We\u2019re seeing some customers extending terms for vehicle affordability trying to stay at the same payment level, but with higher transaction prices and higher interest rates, customers are going longer term. And we\u2019ve seen vehicle payment, even with that, move out quite a bit this year. And it\u2019s -- that\u2019s starting to have a bit of an effect. And it\u2019s in pockets around the country as well. So, many areas are still very, very strong. In other areas, you hear about deals not going through because of changes in payment quality.\nRod Lache: Thanks for that. And maybe just switching gears, Marion, I\u2019m trying to understand your implicit guidance for Ford Credit. You brought the full year down a little bit, at least it optically looks that way from around $3 billion to $2.7 billion, but now Q4 looks like it\u2019s quite low. I was wondering if you might be able to give us some color on where you expect to end the year in terms of loss reserves. At one point, you had, I think, post-COVID, taken the reserves up to 1.2% of managed receivables. Is that sort of something that you\u2019re -- that\u2019s implicit in these numbers, or is there anything else in there that\u2019s driving that level of profitability?\nMarion Harris: Yes. Let me just give you the key takeaways here. First of all, our balance sheet is significantly smaller than it was a few years ago, right off the top. Second, we\u2019re no longer releasing COVID-related credit loss reserves. We\u2019re back at what we would consider normal reserve levels. Third, our lease depreciation tailwinds are mostly behind us, and we have lower used car values as we look forward. And fourth, our borrowing costs are higher, which we haven\u2019t been able to fully pass on to customers as rates have risen rapidly. That\u2019s something, though that over time, we do expect the balance sheet to grow, and we would expect some continued borrowing cost headwinds, but those will moderate and ease over time as the portfolio returns.\nOperator: Your next question is from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMark Delaney: So maybe you could share more on the timing to bring L3 products to market? And is that something you think Ford will be developing in-house perhaps with some benefit from Argo capabilities? I was just thinking something you perhaps leverage from some of the suppliers in some of their potential input or maybe some combination?\nJim Farley: Thank you, Mark. I think, Doug, is best suited to answer this. All I would say is that we\u2019re timing the arrival in line with our second cycle of EVs and a fully updatable -- software-updatable vehicle. So kind of think of that \u201823 to \u201825 time frame is Ford completely refreshing its EV lineup globally, introducing fully updatable electrical architectures and in-house software development for controlling the vehicle, leveraging all of our experience of now we\u2019ve done 5 million OTAs and on enhanced Level 2+ and Level 3 system. Over to you, Doug.\nDoug Field: Thanks, Jim. We are not going to ignore the capabilities of suppliers that can provide value in our L3 solution. They are great manufacturers of components of systems, such as imaging sensors and radar, and we\u2019ll take advantage of that. But we will have a core team that can integrate a system, understand its performance at the system level, and we will own the software. It is really important that we also own the connection to these vehicles. L3 is a connected technology. So, the ability to have a pipeline that collects data and makes the system better and better, we must own that. Finally, the customer experience, how the customer moves in and out of autonomous operation, that\u2019s a problem that actually doesn\u2019t exist in L4 and is a huge opportunity for us to create a Ford experience that\u2019s really unique. So, those are the areas that we will absolutely develop great capability in-house and focus on in the L3 development.\nJim Farley: And we\u2019re really excited about the Argo team helping us with that internal effort.\nDoug Field: Yes, we have just incredible talent.\nMark Delaney: That\u2019s quite helpful. Thank you. And one more on EVs, if I could, please. You mentioned the myriad of ways that the IRA could potentially benefit Ford. And you reiterated the capacity ramp targets through 2026, I believe. But do you think over the longer term and perhaps out over the next 10 years or so, does the IRA change the gross amount of investment you want to make into EVs and how quickly Ford may shift toward EVs, especially in the latter part of this decade? Thanks.\nJim Farley: It only accelerates what we\u2019re going to do, for sure. And what\u2019s exciting for us is being a 40% player in the U.S. and the top brand in Europe of commercial vehicles in the U.S. I mean, we never had this before. And to give you a sense of the EV tax credit for commercial, how evocative that is for Ford, the people who buy a police vehicle, so people who buy ambulances for communities, the emergency responders, they never had tax credits. They are going to have -- this is not just a $7,500 tax credit for consumers. This is for businesses, including local municipalities. So, I think this will have a dramatic impact on the adoption of EV, which we\u2019re already 90% market share in the e-van business. We think we\u2019ll really accelerate the demand for these commercial EVs, and that\u2019s only going to accelerate our speed to market and our scaling of those vehicles. We can\u2019t wait to show you the vehicles themselves because they\u2019re second-generation commercial EVs. So, this is going to accelerate. What\u2019s not clear yet, I said, is will the consumer demand side of this legislation be the largest benefit to our customers in the company, or it would be more like the industrialization of vehicles? That\u2019s something to play out in the marketplace. And it\u2019s hard to handicap that, honestly.\nOperator: The next question is from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJoseph Spak: Maybe, Jim, just picking up there on the IRA side, you mentioned the $7 billion between Ford and the partners. I believe that is sort of that full $45. Can we just drill down a little bit because it would seem to me like you should at least be able to get the 10 for the pack starting next year? And then, where are you in sort of negotiating maybe how much of that 35 you can get from some of your partners? And then, just on the commercial side, like, should we really think -- how should we think about, I guess, the mix of EVs next year between commercial and retail? Because it seems like it\u2019s, to your point, pretty skewed in one direction.\nJim Farley: Yes. Well, I wish we could go into the commercial negotiation with our battery partners, but I\u2019m not going to go into it now. But you can imagine there\u2019s lots of interesting discussions going on right now between, because we\u2019re obviously in the middle -- I mean, some -- we\u2019ve already inked a deal on our DAs, others are still in the mix. So, I wish I could cover that with you right now, but I don\u2019t think that would be fair to our battery partners to go public with -- with how that\u2019s going to benefit both of us. But you can imagine. I mean, I just think of it, generally speaking, as proportional to our investments. On the commercial EV, I have to say, the demand for the move to electric on our commercial customers is, in many ways, more robust than the retail side, even though we\u2019re completely sold out in both, for the three products, the turn rates are just enormous, the order rates. But the profitability is different between a commercial EV and a retail EV. And we\u2019re going to be breaking out our EV business and profitability soon. So this is going to be quite interesting for all of you and for us as we do that. So -- but I will tell you, this is a big help. This will really help the profitability of our commercial vehicle that are EV. And I think it will really stimulate the demand. The tricky part for us is, operationally, what do we do between now and the end of the year. That\u2019s the tricky part for us operationally, is we have a lot of customers who are going to wait until next year to order a Lightning Pro or an E-Transit. But, I think for sure, this is just going to upset that equilibrium. We have to -- by the way, we have to -- we have this discussion inside the Company every day. How many Lighting Pros do we want to make and how many Lightning retail F-150 EVs do we want to make? So, it\u2019s already quite spirited discussion. But I think this will help our profitability quite a bit even next year, which you will see. And we\u2019re really excited about this change. I mean, having almost 65% of our customers qualify, including local municipalities, it\u2019s a game-changer for our demand. John, anything you want to divulge about the negotiations?\nJohn Lawler: Not about the negotiations. Thanks, Jim.\nJim Farley: Okay.\nJoseph Spak: Maybe just -- Jim, you\u2019ve clearly shown since you\u2019ve -- since you\u2019ve been CEO that you\u2019ve been willing to adapt and change to new information and circumstances, like the Argo announcements today, I think, and the other example would be, I guess, the LFP strategy you talked about earlier this summer. But I guess that has even maybe potentially changed a little bit again since, I guess, geopolitically, the U.S. relationship with China might have turned south. So, any update on that? And is there a backup plan? Is there any risk to any of those time lines?\nJim Farley: That is a very good question. So, obviously, we have this unique profile as a commercial company in EV, and we now have, I mean, literally all the commercial pickup truck business that\u2019s EV, and we\u2019re 90% plus on the van side. So, it\u2019s a very important question for us. And we also think for affordability, back to Rod\u2019s point, LFP is a very important technology, and all the IP is in China. So, this is a really dynamic situation. I think what you\u2019ll see is that the tariff rules of the importing LFP batteries into the U.S. is still very favorable, so. And we have a really great contract with a particular LFP supplier to incorporate those batteries next year. So, I think, we\u2019re in really good shape. The real billion-dollar question is when do you localize production of LFP in North America? And is that in the U.S. and Mexico? And where do you build the cells versus pack? And whose name is on the front of the building and all that. And we\u2019re not going to go into that. But I will tell you that just given the reality of the tariff structure, we can import LFP from China economically now.\nOperator: This concludes the Ford Motor Company third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jim Farley",
            "content": "Thank you, Lynn. Hi, everyone. We really appreciate you being with us today. We introduced the Ford+ Plan for growth and value creation two years ago, and the investment thesis had three drivers: leveraging our iconic vehicles, our strengths, both geographically and nameplates; number two, add to that, integrated hardware, software and connectivity into those vehicles; and then expand the total addressable market and unlocking value with Conquest EVs, new commercial vehicles, connected services and physical services as well as mobility. So today, I'd like to share a progress report on Ford's transformation, of course, update you on our autonomy strategy and our announcement and, of course, recap the quarter. Our ambition to be the leader in EV is already taking shape. In our home market, Ford Model e is now -- has now had incredible successful launch of three products. They're now in scaling F-150 Lightning, Mach-E and E-Transit, and each are attracting, interesting for us, almost all new customers. So, this is growth. We're now the number two electric brand in the U.S., and we're just beginning with our scaling. Our decision to create Blue for both ICE and hybrid vehicles has focused and energized our team to leverage what we do best at Ford. We have launched a string of hits that our products -- our customers not only love, but have lined up to buy, and we have so many more exciting products to come. We have made tough capital allocation and restructuring decisions like the one today, particularly in South America and our international market groups like India and our results and cash flow, you could see in our results, have improved dramatically. Our balance sheet remains strong. We ended the quarter with nearly $50 billion in liquidity, even as we accelerate investments in connectivity and electrification. And what is perhaps the biggest untold story at Ford, we've successfully recruited a roster of an incredible talent from some of the world's best technology companies who are here to ship product and are supercharging our ability to design that software-defined vehicle and, of course, the software and services that go into those vehicles for the future. At the same token and at the same time, we have still so much work ahead. Clearly, we need to continue to improve our competitiveness, not just on quality, but on cost and supply chain management. And our performance in China and Europe is not nearly as healthy as we'd like it to be. I can't overstate the sense of urgency we have to address these critical operating areas. I look forward to updating you on future calls. Now, I'd like to share an important strategic shift in our autonomous vehicle strategy. Five years ago, we committed to invest $1 billion in Argo AI to develop autonomous Level 4 technology. In 2020, we completed the transaction that resulted in Ford and VW both owning the majority of Argo at equal levels. We still believe in Level 4 autonomy that it will have a big impact on our business of moving people. We've learned though in our partnership with Argo and after our own internal investments, that we will have a very long road. It's estimated that more than $100 billion has been invested in the promise of Level 4 autonomy. And yet no one has defined a profitable business model at scale. Based on the change in this outlook and our increasing promise and focus on Level 2+ and Level 3 autonomy, we've decided to wind down the Argo business and impair the investment. We're working closely with Argo and VW on all the details. But here's what I want to focus on. Advancing Level 2 hardware and software beyond what BlueCruise can do today and ultimately enabling our customers to travel in very large ODDs, or operating domains, with their eyes off the road will give them back the single most valuable commodity in our modern lives, time. This has become mission-critical for us at Ford. Ford has deployed BlueCruise on many vehicles across hundreds of thousands of Blue zone miles. We have strong technology partners working alongside us. And now, we're going to bring in several hundred people from Argo, a brilliant collection of minds, who've done a great job, who have done wonderful work in the L4 space, but their job and mission now is to help us create a differentiated Level 4 BlueCruise system. Yes, there are huge -- this is a huge addressable market and the potential for highly accretive new revenue streams tied to Level 3, but at the end of the day, this is about giving millions of people that time and eliminating the monotony of highway miles and stop-and-go traffic. And as for the future of true L4 autonomy, we don't expect there to be a sudden aha moment like we used to. Deploying L4 broadly, perhaps the toughest technical problem of our time, will require significant breakthroughs going forward in many areas: reliable and low-cost sensing, it's not the case today; algorithms that can operate on limited compute resources without constraining the operating time and domain of an electric vehicle; breakthroughs in neural networks that can learn to operate a car more safely than a human, even in very complex urban environments. The muscles we have built with our new talent in broadly deploying a transformative Blue Cruise L3 system will ultimately be essential to the future of accessible driverless vehicles in everyday life. What's so exciting for me is that we are on the cusp of a transformational moment for Ford. We will introduce a lineup of not first, but second cycle EVs that are not only fully software updatable and constantly improving, but they will generate an 8% plus margin, an amazing array of software-enabled services, not just BlueCruise L3, but many others, video services for software -- for safety and security, and we're already shipping a broad range of Ford Pro productivity tools and 100% uptime services for our commercial customers. That is a transformation for us. Let me now switch to the quarter. With Ford Model e, we're on track to reach our annual production rate of 600,000 EVs by the end of next year and 2 million by 2026. I'll say that carefully. There is no change to our target. We're adding shifts to the Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightings as we speak, and we're scaling production of E-Transit. In Europe, our all-new EV manufacturing center in Cologne will finish complete -- will be complete in turning out vehicles midway through next year. Our Ford Otosan JV in Turkey is not only scaling the 2-ton E-Transit, but they're also going to be launching a brand-new product, a 1-ton E-Transit custom electric while breaking ground on a new battery plant that will supply those for those transits. And in September, we're starting production -- we've already started construction of Blue Oval City in Tennessee, where we will build a new generation EV truck and batteries. And at the same time, we've already broken ground as well on the new BlueOval SK battery plants, plural, in Kentucky. We're also further strengthening Model e's EV supply chain. Our team is making great progress in securing raw materials, importantly the processing of those raw materials and the battery capacity that we need. We expect the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act to have a wide range of positive impacts for both our customers and for Ford. What's not yet clear is the degree to which the IRA will drive customer demand versus offsetting our EV investments in growth. So, let me touch on some of the potential benefits of the IRA. The first opportunity is our largest, the battery production tax credit of about $45 per kilowatt hour. From \u201823 to \u201826, we estimate a combined available tax credit for Ford and our battery partners could total more than $7 billion with large step-up in annual credits in \u201827 as our JV battery plants ramp up to full production. The second benefit is often overlooked. I haven't actually read any one of the media covering this, but it's super important for Ford. And that's the commercial EV credit. You know that Ford is the number one commercial vehicle brand in the U.S., and our commercial customers can now claim next year $7,500 per EV vehicle they buy with no restrictions on battery sourcing or manufacturing. Our preliminary estimate is that between 55% and 65% of all of our commercial vehicle customers will qualify. The third opportunity is retail. Ford EVs and our PHEVs remain eligible for the $7,500 tax credit until guidance is issued at the end of this year. Next year, we believe we'll meet the $3,750 critical materials credit requirement on certain Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning models. In \u201824, the rules will further restrict this critical materials credit. So, we believe it's playing -- a fairly level playing field right now for all the OEMs as our supply chains of critical material extraction and course processing in the U.S. and FTA develops. The fourth benefit centers on the funding growth in our investments, such as geothermal energy credit critical for Blue Oval City, the Department of Energy loans, grants to convert our domestic facilities to produce electric vehicles, battery plants and other EV components. We're exploring all these capabilities and possibilities as you can imagine. Now, as you know, we shared the new electric customer standards with all of our North America dealers last month in Vegas. That means a single, simple e-commerce platform, ultra-low vehicle-finished inventory, non-negotiated pricing and fast charges at all of our dealerships. Now early response from the dealers have been very favorable. Many are poised to invest to meet these new standards for electric vehicle customers, while other dealers will opt to specialize Ford Blue Oval or Ford Pro. And there's real rewards for going first. Turning to Ford Blue. We view this business Ford Blue as growth. Last month, we unveiled the seventh generation Mustang. We showed the all-new amazing Super Duty in Churchill Downs in Kentucky. And there -- these are all very well-executed products with incredible technology and upgraded electrical architectures with advanced powertrains, and they really set them apart from the competition. What you can't see is what we see. Our design studio is filled with new products and derivatives that will expand our hit franchises like F-150 and Bronco and Mustang and the new Maverick and the Explorer and the Ranger, all segments that we're a leader among the leaders. And I can't wait to show you these new derivatives based on ICE and hybrid powertrains. Finally, let's talk about Pro. In the U.S., customers trust us more than -- with more than 40% of the market for full-sized commercial trucks and vans. In Europe, we're also the number one commercial vehicle brand. That's for 7 years now, soon to be 8. Businesses of all sizes and types are using Ford Pro's vehicles as well as the suite of our services to lower their cost and improve their productivity. Now, that includes multi-mix fleets, and fleets that are a mix of ICE and EVs. Ford Pro has a real opportunity to grow service and parts sales by offering better experiences like mobile service. We expect to have more than 1,200 mobile service units in operation globally by the end of this year, and they're driving significant dealer parts and service revenue. Actually, more than $10,000 per global -- per unit, service unit, per month. But the real game changer for us in the Pro business, in parts and service growth, is software, software centered on productivity, telematics, security and predictive failure of all components. In the third quarter, we saw our paid telematics for Pro grow by over 40% sequentially for the third straight quarter. Our suite of Ford Pro software solutions keeps getting stronger and stronger, as we launch new offerings like Ford Pro fleet and the VIIZR field service management software. But before I hand it over to John, let me end with this. We have many challenges as a company, and we're tackling them head-on. That's clear from our third quarter results. At the same time, I'm so excited about the future we're creating with Ford+. We're building completely new businesses with the best of Ford talent and incredibly -- incredible new talent across not just Model e, but Ford Blue and Ford Pro. We're strengthening our product portfolio across the board, building on what we think is the strongest portfolio we've ever had. And we're tracking the scale to a global run rate of 2 million EVs a year by 2026, and we're investing in growth. Taken together, this work statement is nothing short of refounding one of the world's most iconic companies to compete and win in a brand-new era. There's no holding back. There's no looking back. There's no slowing down. In fact, we're accelerating our transformation. John? Thank you, John. The decision we made to reallocate our capital is a strategic one. It's some combination of the margins we're starting to see on our software, like Ford Pro, that's really the first large shippable software. The usage patterns we're seeing in BlueCruise, how much people use it and how passionate they are, and that's before ICE off, the confidence we now have in delivering L2 -- Level 3; the access to public markets for Level 4 funding; the opaqueness, as John said, of the view to return capital, the invested capital in Level 4 and Level 5. And it's some combination of that and a few other factors. But the biggest factor is our growing confidence in our talent, both the Argo talent and the team at Ford that Doug is building. And I'm sure in the investment conference that will be a big focus of his comments. It's that combination, more than are we behind or we ahead, that informed us of this decision. And I think it's one of the bigger moments for us as a leadership team. And we are so excited about the software we can ship to our vehicles. We see it in BlueCruise now. We see in a Ford Pro. And we see other software that we're in the midst of. And the other key enabler is our growing confidence in landing a fully software-updatable vehicle as we launch our second cycle EVs. John, maybe it's best for you to talk about the reallocation of capital. Well, I think it's best, John, for us to hear from Doug. But before we do that, I want to emphasize that a winning L4 business is as much about the go-to-market investment of a consumer-facing service. And all the depots, all the HD mapping of all the ODs across this enormous geography, all the enormous fleet, and because it's still weather-constrained, you have to have a driven fleet to complement it. So, aside from the -- handicapping the technology, the enormous investment that will have to be made in the nontechnology pieces is a big factor in our thinking. And Doug, maybe you could talk about how we're -- because we're still very excited about Level 4, how you see it as a technologist on the technology portion? Absolutely. As I mentioned, Colin, we looked at many variables, and one of them is access to public markets. We were very clear that the Argo journey would include access to public markets over the last year. And we feel like that's a lot more challenged. So yes, we looked at possible partnerships and funding. But it was 1 of maybe 10 factors that we looked at in making this decision. John, maybe -- why don't you hear your -- our discussion as a leadership team on the time frame? Yes, pricing. Net pricing continues to remain strong. Exactly, pricing continues to remain strong. Yes. So, one of the things that we're doing is, as we're taking settlements with the supply base, we're looking to do that more in a lump-sum fashion, so that it's not baked into the piece price. And we'll share more about what that means on a go-forward basis as we talk about \u201823 in Q4. So, what we've provided for the year is it's $9 billion, up from $7 billion last quarter when we reported. The amount of $1 billion in the third quarter was part of the third quarter, but it was also a settlement for the first half as well. And it largely reflects a lot of ways, a confluence of factors that led to that. One of the things we are having better clarity around is schedule and stability. And combining that with labor shortages and our high complexity, that had a larger impact on the supply base's ability to deliver cost efficiencies this year and much higher than we expected, and quite frankly, higher than we were initially willing to accept. And so, we spent a lot of time with our supplier partners. And we came to the conclusion, and that included conversations all the way up with June with supplier CEOs. And our conclusion coming out of that was that it became evident that we needed to increase the settlement amount, support our supplier partners, and we made the call in the third quarter. And then, we told all of you as soon as we made that call. So that we got out in front of it and knew what we knew. Yes. So, we are seeing the commodity spot prices come off a bit, but quite honestly, it's not meaningful enough at this point to make a significant impact. I think we're all trying to work through the macroeconomic environment how far are things going to slow down, how quickly will that drive easing of commodity prices? Will that also drive ease in the whole logistics chain? We know that logistic prices are up significantly. Ocean freight is up significantly. And so, right now, we're trying to make that call on 2023, with a quarter left to go, is a really difficult thing to do. So, we're going to hold off on doing any of that today. And we'll be able to talk about more of that with our Q4 earnings at the beginning of next year. Thank you, Rob. The early signs are coming in. It's interesting. It's lumpy. The commercial vehicle and EV demand is through the roof. We've seen literally no -- no change, if not an increase. And that includes commercial vehicles in Europe, which is interesting. Our order bank continues to grow. It's multi, multi month. We continue to have to close out order windows for our commercial vehicles because of the demand. Same for EVs, as we've taken prices up. On the retail side in the U.S., what I see that's different from last quarter is slight uptick on 84-month customer financing, and Marion, if you want to go into that, that's fine. We're seeing, obviously, an easing of used cars, which makes trade-ins, and those transactions that include trade-ins a little more challenging for customers for higher payments. We're seeing -- the one that I watch the most is our turn rates for F-150. It's our highest volume vehicle. And we're starting to see some differences in turn rates between XLT and Lariat. It's small right now, but it's different. In the past, Lariat's turned faster than XLT, and that's reversed compared to the quarter. It's really subtle right now. So, what I'd expect on pricing -- and you see some of our competitors come in with higher spending now on incentives. So, we've already accounted for some of that, as John has said in the past. What I would be looking for and what I think is important to watch for is the mix changes. The mixes of series and specifications within a profitable nameplate, like Super Duty or F-150 or mix shifts, obviously, between models. Rod, our lineup is so fresh right now. It's very opaque for us. So, the only mix shift we're seeing is within spec. Marion, do you want to mention anything about payments? Thank you, Mark. I think, Doug, is best suited to answer this. All I would say is that we're timing the arrival in line with our second cycle of EVs and a fully updatable -- software-updatable vehicle. So kind of think of that \u201823 to \u201825 time frame is Ford completely refreshing its EV lineup globally, introducing fully updatable electrical architectures and in-house software development for controlling the vehicle, leveraging all of our experience of now we've done 5 million OTAs and on enhanced Level 2+ and Level 3 system. Over to you, Doug. And we're really excited about the Argo team helping us with that internal effort. It only accelerates what we're going to do, for sure. And what's exciting for us is being a 40% player in the U.S. and the top brand in Europe of commercial vehicles in the U.S. I mean, we never had this before. And to give you a sense of the EV tax credit for commercial, how evocative that is for Ford, the people who buy a police vehicle, so people who buy ambulances for communities, the emergency responders, they never had tax credits. They are going to have -- this is not just a $7,500 tax credit for consumers. This is for businesses, including local municipalities. So, I think this will have a dramatic impact on the adoption of EV, which we're already 90% market share in the e-van business. We think we'll really accelerate the demand for these commercial EVs, and that's only going to accelerate our speed to market and our scaling of those vehicles. We can't wait to show you the vehicles themselves because they're second-generation commercial EVs. So, this is going to accelerate. What's not clear yet, I said, is will the consumer demand side of this legislation be the largest benefit to our customers in the company, or it would be more like the industrialization of vehicles? That's something to play out in the marketplace. And it's hard to handicap that, honestly. Yes. Well, I wish we could go into the commercial negotiation with our battery partners, but I'm not going to go into it now. But you can imagine there's lots of interesting discussions going on right now between, because we're obviously in the middle -- I mean, some -- we've already inked a deal on our DAs, others are still in the mix. So, I wish I could cover that with you right now, but I don't think that would be fair to our battery partners to go public with -- with how that's going to benefit both of us. But you can imagine. I mean, I just think of it, generally speaking, as proportional to our investments. On the commercial EV, I have to say, the demand for the move to electric on our commercial customers is, in many ways, more robust than the retail side, even though we're completely sold out in both, for the three products, the turn rates are just enormous, the order rates. But the profitability is different between a commercial EV and a retail EV. And we're going to be breaking out our EV business and profitability soon. So this is going to be quite interesting for all of you and for us as we do that. So -- but I will tell you, this is a big help. This will really help the profitability of our commercial vehicle that are EV. And I think it will really stimulate the demand. The tricky part for us is, operationally, what do we do between now and the end of the year. That's the tricky part for us operationally, is we have a lot of customers who are going to wait until next year to order a Lightning Pro or an E-Transit. But, I think for sure, this is just going to upset that equilibrium. We have to -- by the way, we have to -- we have this discussion inside the Company every day. How many Lighting Pros do we want to make and how many Lightning retail F-150 EVs do we want to make? So, it's already quite spirited discussion. But I think this will help our profitability quite a bit even next year, which you will see. And we're really excited about this change. I mean, having almost 65% of our customers qualify, including local municipalities, it's a game-changer for our demand. John, anything you want to divulge about the negotiations? Okay. That is a very good question. So, obviously, we have this unique profile as a commercial company in EV, and we now have, I mean, literally all the commercial pickup truck business that's EV, and we're 90% plus on the van side. So, it's a very important question for us. And we also think for affordability, back to Rod's point, LFP is a very important technology, and all the IP is in China. So, this is a really dynamic situation. I think what you'll see is that the tariff rules of the importing LFP batteries into the U.S. is still very favorable, so. And we have a really great contract with a particular LFP supplier to incorporate those batteries next year. So, I think, we're in really good shape. The real billion-dollar question is when do you localize production of LFP in North America? And is that in the U.S. and Mexico? And where do you build the cells versus pack? And whose name is on the front of the building and all that. And we're not going to go into that. But I will tell you that just given the reality of the tariff structure, we can import LFP from China economically now."

            "name": "Marion Harris",
            "content": "Yes. We're seeing some customers extending terms for vehicle affordability trying to stay at the same payment level, but with higher transaction prices and higher interest rates, customers are going longer term. And we've seen vehicle payment, even with that, move out quite a bit this year. And it's -- that's starting to have a bit of an effect. And it's in pockets around the country as well. So, many areas are still very, very strong. In other areas, you hear about deals not going through because of changes in payment quality. Yes. Let me just give you the key takeaways here. First of all, our balance sheet is significantly smaller than it was a few years ago, right off the top. Second, we're no longer releasing COVID-related credit loss reserves. We're back at what we would consider normal reserve levels. Third, our lease depreciation tailwinds are mostly behind us, and we have lower used car values as we look forward. And fourth, our borrowing costs are higher, which we haven't been able to fully pass on to customers as rates have risen rapidly. That's something, though that over time, we do expect the balance sheet to grow, and we would expect some continued borrowing cost headwinds, but those will moderate and ease over time as the portfolio returns."
        },
        "speaker3": {
            "name": "John Lawler",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim. So, when I look at the quarter and our performance year-to-date, I actually see some real promises. First, our strategic actions to segment and stand out three distinct businesses, Ford Model e, Ford Blue and Ford Pro, while complete yet, is truly transformational and is already changing how we manage the business. So, it's about more than just accelerating profitable growth, it's also about how we are going to do that by orienting everything around our different types of customers. The separation of these businesses is revealing to the entire organization how deeply rooted complexity is in our legacy business and how this disadvantages us in quality, innovation, customer satisfaction and ultimately, cost and efficiency. And we see it everywhere, from design, to engineering, to manufacturing and how we interact with each other and our suppliers. And so, to me, this is really exciting. We understand the magnitude of opportunity and leverage that this will provide across the entire business. Now, we just need to deliver. Second, our product portfolio has never been stronger. Starting with our top-selling first-generation EVs like Mustang Mach-E, F-150 Lightning and E-Transit to our new models of category-leading vehicles like Mustang and Super Duty as well as popular derivatives like Raptor and Tremor. These are all inspiring products that our customers love. And finally, our capital allocation choices are really paying off. Our sustainable free cash flow generation from our automotive business is improving significantly, even as we accelerate investments in electrification and connectivity. And this improvement reflects the tough choices that we have made to focus on our strengths, hone our footprint and our product portfolio, especially outside of North America. So, with that as a backdrop, let me turn to our financial results for the quarter. We delivered $1.8 billion in adjusted EBIT, above the $1.4 billion to $1.7 billion guidance range we provided last month. In automotive, wholesales were up 7% year-over-year. However, EBIT was weighed down by the rich mix of 40,000 vehicles on wheels we had in inventory at the end of the quarter and about $1 billion in lump-sum supplier settlements. The settlements offset costs incurred by our suppliers, partially due to inflationary impacts on labor, freight and commodities as well as higher costs because of our inconsistent production schedule, which has been disruptive for our partners. So, providing greater certainty and schedule stability to our supply base is just one example of the many opportunities we have in front of us as we transform our global supply chain. So, we're very grateful for our suppliers' ongoing support and the collaborative approach they are taking to address production shortfalls, while also focusing on improving the quality of the parts they ship to us. In the quarter, we delivered $3.6 billion in free cash flow with strong cash generation by our automotive business, despite the adverse effects of the 40,000 vehicles on wheels. We expect the negative working capital impact of those units to reverse in the fourth quarter when the vehicles are completed and shipped to dealers. Our balance sheet continues to be very healthy. And we ended the quarter with strong cash and liquidity of $32 billion and $49 billion, respectively. And these numbers include our remaining stake in Rivian, which was valued at less than $1 billion at the end of the quarter. Now, I'll touch on the performance of our business units. North America delivered $1.3 billion of EBIT and a margin of 5%. Both of those measures were driven down year-over-year by higher commodity costs, inflationary pressures and a diverse mix, reflecting the buildup of vehicles on wheels and inventory. Our brand strength and order banks remain very strong, and we expect the North American margin to return to double digits in the fourth quarter. South America continues to benefit from our global redesign efforts, delivering strong margins in its fifth consecutive profitable quarter. In Europe, we posted a profit of $200 million. And supply chain constraints began to ease, resulting in sequential wholesale growth of 23%. Our commercial vehicle business continues to fortify its leadership position ending the quarter with a 15.2% share year-to-date. And in China, we posted a loss of $200 million, driven by the investments we are making in electric vehicles. Lincoln continues to be a bright spot for the region with share improving again sequentially. Our International Markets Group continues to be solidly profitable. EBIT margins were over 8%, driven by the launch of our exciting all-new Ranger. And then finally, Ford Credit delivered another strong quarter with EBT of $600 million that reflected a more normalized run rate for this business. The anticipated sequential profit decline was driven by the non-operating release of credit loss reserves and higher borrowing costs. Let me now walk through our impairment of Argo. As Jim highlighted, it's become clear that the technology required to achieve profitable commercialization of L4 autonomy at scale is going to take much longer than we previously expected. L2+ and L3 driver assist technologies have a larger addressable customer base, which will allow it to scale more quickly and profitably, and that's going to provide accretive annuity-like revenue streams. During the third quarter, we made the strategic decision to shift our capital spending from the L4 technology being developed by Argo to internally develop L2+/L3 technology. And as a result, in the third quarter, we recorded a $2.7 billion noncash pretax impairment as a special item. Now, let me share with you our current outlook. For the year, we expect to earn about $11.5 billion in adjusted EBIT, up about 15% from 2021 with about a 10% increase in wholesales. We're now projecting to generate adjusted free cash flow of $9.5 billion to $10 billion. Our year-over-year basis for our \u201822 adjusted EBIT target assumes significantly higher earnings in North America; aggregate profitability in the rest of the world; Ford Credit EBT at about $2.7 billion, with strong, though lower, auction values in the fourth quarter as the supply of new vehicles improves and higher borrowing costs; continued strong pent-up demand in orders for Ford's newest products; continued strength in pricing; higher commodity and broad-based inflationary costs of about $9 billion; no further deterioration in supply chain; and continuation of a strong dollar. So finally, before getting to your questions, let me provide a quick update on our new financial reporting. Last quarter, we mentioned our plan to host a teach-in event early next year to help you prepare for this change to a radically new strategic organization ahead of our first quarter 2023 reporting. So, we've now fixed the date for March. At the teach-in, we will share both, 2021 and 2022 revised results to reflect our new segmentation, which we will start using for reporting purposes in Q1 of 2023. But because this is far more than an accounting exercise, we'll also reiterate and illustrate the business rationale for the change along with the reporting mechanics and implications for our earnings disclosures and SEC filings, and we'll furnish you with a full toolkit to help you transition your models. So, that wraps up our prepared remarks. We'll use the balance of the time to address what's on your minds. And thank you. Operator, please open the line for questions. Yes. So, first off, we're not capital constrained. We're investing our $50 billion, and we're investing on top of that in connectivity and software. So, we ended the quarter with $32 billion of cash and $49 billion of liquidity. So, it's taking that investment and putting it towards a business where we think we will have a sizable return in the near term relative to one that's going to have a long arc. And that's the business decision behind it. So, I think we need to be very clear about that. We're going to invest in L2 and L3, and some of the savings that we have will go into that. Yes. So Colin, when we looked at this, as Jim said, not only does it require the technology breakthroughs and the capital invested in the technology, but then in all the services and fleets, scaling across the country that would be required to get to a profitable business. We saw that five years plus the horizon being that far out before you could actually get to something that started to generate a meaningful business. And we see a much greater opportunity to impact more customers immediately with the L2, L3 technology and impact our business in a positive way in the more near-term time frame. So, that was part of the business discussion that we had with the team. Yes. I think it's really two things. It's the mix that we can see, vehicle line mix coming out of the supply base and then sterling. The exposure we have, as you know, we're the largest commercial vehicle player in Europe from a brand standpoint, and we have a very strong presence in the UK. And so that currency change did hit us quite hard after the quarter closed. And so, when we look at that, one of the things that we've done, Colin, that I've done, is I spent a lot of time -- the team has -- the last couple of weeks, doing deep dive on-site reviews of the supply base. In fact, we're approaching a deep review of almost 300 of those suppliers. And what we're finding is that there's a number of non-chip suppliers that are struggling to ramp production as the chip crisis eases. And it's not easing tremendously, it's easing slightly. We're starting to see that. But then we're seeing issues in non-chip suppliers. It has to do with the tight labor market, but it also has to do refining with many of the suppliers during the COVID time frame had not invested in maintenance or in their facilities and tooling, and so they're not able to ramp as we expected. And that's hit us in the fourth quarter on mix versus what we had expected. And so, it's really the mix in the currency that's getting to us and brought us down to the low end of our range. Not about the negotiations. Thanks, Jim."

            "content": "Sure, Jim. As you mentioned, this is going to be a really tough problem to solve. It's the toughest problem of our generation. And I don't think about it as capital constraints nearly as much as talent constraints. In the kind of projects that we are diving into at Ford and the kind of work that we're doing, the constraint really becomes how many of the world's best people can you get working on a problem. And that's really the decision, in many ways, that is driving what we're doing here at Argo is we are deeply passionate about the L3 mission. We have ideas of how it can work and how customers can interact with it that are really exciting, particularly when you add them to our next-generation EVs. So, this is the way we want to use that talent. And we think it's the most meaningful way for them to impact the world. Thanks, Jim. We are not going to ignore the capabilities of suppliers that can provide value in our L3 solution. They are great manufacturers of components of systems, such as imaging sensors and radar, and we'll take advantage of that. But we will have a core team that can integrate a system, understand its performance at the system level, and we will own the software. It is really important that we also own the connection to these vehicles. L3 is a connected technology. So, the ability to have a pipeline that collects data and makes the system better and better, we must own that. Finally, the customer experience, how the customer moves in and out of autonomous operation, that's a problem that actually doesn't exist in L4 and is a huge opportunity for us to create a Ford experience that's really unique. So, those are the areas that we will absolutely develop great capability in-house and focus on in the L3 development. Yes, we have just incredible talent."

Tomorrow, BNP Paribas will host a fireside chat with John Lawler and Kumar Galhotra, President of Ford Blue; and on August 10, at their Auto Conference in New York, JPMorgan will host a fireside chat with Ted Cannis, CEO of Ford Pro.  Now I'll turn the call over to Jim Farley.\nJames Farley: Thanks, Lynn. Hello, everyone. The Ford team delivered a very solid second quarter in a challenging environment where we saw supply chain disruptions, a lot of new economic headwinds and uncertainty as a whole. Importantly, we achieved these results as we advance the Ford+ plan, which is the biggest opportunity to create value at Ford since we scaled the Model T. And at the core of Ford+ are 3 fundamental promises to our customers: distinctive and breakthrough products and experiences; and always on relationship with Ford every day, every hour, every minute; and ever-improving post-purchase user experiences powered by software.  Today, I'll give you an update on Ford+ and the early results of our decisions to reorganize the company into 3 distinct segments Model E, Ford Blue and Ford Pro.  Now let me start with the progress we're making to lead the electric vehicle and digital revolution. What's lost in the industry's arm race of claims regarding capital invested, the number of top hats we all have, the promises of future leadership is one fundamental question: who is and will be the best positioned to design truly distinctive and appealing products that people actually love? That's the question.  Now we've been overwhelmed with the demand for our first-generation EVs, the Mustang Mach-E, the Lightning and the E-Transit. These products are in the market now, and we have strong multiyear order banks. We're selling them as fast as we can make them.  And you can't say that about many of the EVs coming to market now. We believe that these great new products will enable us to grab an outsized share of the rapidly growing EV market, combined with our healthy and vibrant shares of our ICE and growing hybrid markets.  This month, we expect to produce 14,000 EVs globally. That's significantly higher than just a few months ago, and we have a clear path to reach a run rate of 60,000 EVs by the end of next year. And that will lead to a foundation to 2 million by late 2026. In fact, our anticipated growth rate in EVs through 2026 is more than twice what we expect for the global EV industry in total.  Now securing the raw materials to produce batteries at scale is critical to our plan. It's estimated that at best, 50% of all raw materials required to meet the combined announced targets for all EV OEMs is actually available, 50%. And this is why speed to securing supply is so critical and strategic, so is diversifying our battery chemistries to increase our flexibility, supply and profit and to support different customer use cases.  Last week, we announced a series of MOUs and agreements to fulfill our ambition -- ambitious needs that I covered, and we are working to complete definitive agreements where necessary. Our Model E team moved quickly to capture these opportunities. To summarize, we've added battery chemistries and secure contracts, delivering 60-gigawatt hours of annual battery capacity, which will help us support fully the 600,000 units of that 2023 run rate of capacity. We now have lithium-ion phosphate, or LFP, battery packs coming for the Mach-E sold in North America next year and for Lightning in early 2024, creating more capacity for these high-demand products. We secured 70% of the battery capacity needed to support 2 million units by the end of 2026, and we struck a new deal with CATL on strategic cooperation for global battery supplies as well as deals for direct sourcing of critical battery raw materials in the U.S., Australia, Indonesia and more locations. And we have a plan to localize 40-gigawatt hours per year LFP capacity in North America by 2026. These deals are a strong start as we fortify our EV supply chain that's aligned with our sustainability and human rights principles.  Now let's talk about the progress we're making in building out an always on relationship with customers and that ever-improving user experience enabled by software after the customer buys a vehicle. Now along with product execution, these are really the relevant sustainable advantages we see to create, in today's hypercompetitive market, a difference where the real competition is not legacy OEMs, but pure-play EV companies, including emerging Chinese players.  For example, more than 55,000 Ford customers have already driven nearly 10 million miles with BlueCruise, our hands-free L2 system. That's just one year after the capacity was launched, and we started OTA-ing this to our vehicles. We're using the data we get through BlueCruise to continue to improve the customer experience. And as it happens, you can imagine a significant ADAS revenue and profit stream being created by giving customers the ability to work, watch a film or even take a nap during a long trip in their Ford. While the financial benefits of ADAS are clear, as is our Ford Pro services stack, they're relatively small now, but we're rapidly increasing the number of digital vehicles on the road as well as attach rates of the enabling services. And over time, much of the SaaS revenue will be deferred on our balance sheet, providing an annuity-like revenue stream that is highly accretive, something this company and this industry has never seen.  Now before I turn to Ford Blue, let me talk briefly about our connected EV dealer model in the U.S. Changes in the market have compelled Ford and our dealers to revisit how customers shop, buy and own, and how they will do this going forward. We're moving fast as the transition to these digital EV platforms allows us to help our dealers provide better customer ownership experience post purchase, and in turn, enables them to expand the revenue and profit pools, expanding and improving their returns. We're working with our dealers to create a retail model better than what's offered by any traditional OEM and better than the startups who are now scrambling to develop sales and service networks to support customers in an attempt to sustain and grow share in UIL.  In the U.S. alone, if we can help our dealers increase service loyalty by just 20 points, that's $2.4 billion incremental revenue for them every year. Now since March, we've conducted more than 30 workshops in the U.S. and Canada, reaching hundreds of our dealers. I have personally been involved in many of these meetings. What is clear to me but not yet visible to the market is that our dealers are embracing this change. They know the competitive threat is real, and they want Ford and their dealership to lead and win. And we have more to share as this develops.  Now turning to Ford Blue. The team is motivated by this sharpening focus on our ICE and hybrid products. We've added new talent and leadership to drive performance and focus in our trucks, our great family lineup and our enthusiast vehicles we're so proud of. We've revealed new vehicles like the Bronco Raptor, the Bronco Everglades, the F-150 Raptor R, which my kids think sounds great. In the third quarter, we'll unveil an all new seventh generation Mustang at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. It is a stunning car, and I'm so excited to share it with the world. And also this fall, we'll be introducing an all-new Super Duty pickup, the workhorse at Ford, and it sets a standard in our industry.  There's much more to come. Our design center is filled with new products and derivatives that will further strengthen our hit vehicles in the ICE and hybrid franchises like F-150 and Bronco and Maverick, the brand-new global Ranger that\u2019s launching in Thailand and our new Everest. In short, our hottest and freshest lineup in recent history is getting even better.  Now in commercial vehicle market, Ford Pro, our industry-leading global business, is leading the change into an electric software-driven world. Other OEMs are talking about large numbers of future electric orders. We're actually taking orders for manufacturing and selling commercial vehicles now.  Through the second quarter, we've sold more than 3,000 E-Transit in the U.S. That's a market share of 95% in the full-sized electric van market, 95%. In fact, our next 2 competitors combined sold just 159 vehicles.  Beyond the vehicles, we're also rolling out our Ford Pro charging commercial solutions and the very exciting and fast-growing e-telematics software solutions. And boy, are they paying off.  And in Europe, where we continue to be the leading commercial vehicle brand, we're already received 8,000 orders for our 2-tonne E-Transit, and our new one-tonne E-Transit custom goes on sale next year.  Now our Ford Pro software business is growing quickly. Telematics subscriptions globally have grown over 40% sequentially for the last two quarters.  Turning to quality. We made solid progress in initial quality, as you've seen in the recent J.D. Power's IQS study, and our launches have improved. However, we continue to be hampered by recalls and customer satisfaction actions. Yes, this affects our cost, but more importantly, it falls short on our most fundamental commitment to our customers. Quality is our #1 priority. In fact, we recently brought on Josh Halliburton from J.D. Powers to head quality. Now the team is focused on 3 critical areas: prevention, detection and remediation.  We've instituted more robust engineering sign-off processes for the vehicles that are in the product development factory as we speak. We're driving much more frequent alignment with our supply base on quality. And when identified issues, we take actions quickly to resolve them, to protect our customer's experience, including by making much more frequent use of over their updates. And boy, has that work for us. We have more work to do in this space, and we will keep you updated.  Overall, we're pleased with the progress this year, but we are not nearly satisfied. We remain clear-eyed and determined to move with speed and determination on a Ford+ transformation. The underlying strength of our business supports our 2022 adjusted EBIT guidance range of $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion, unchanged from April.  Before I turn it over to John, I want to end with this. There's context that's critical to how we think about implementing our Ford+ plan. Traditionally, the auto industry has cut costs, often indiscriminately. As an effect, of course, from lower auto demands through economic softness and shift for customer preferences.  What we're undertaking forward is totally different than that. We're reshaping virtually every aspect of the way we've done business for a century. And we're doing that for a new industry based on new technology, new skills and new promise for customer value. And yet, cost reduction will happen in our ICE business because that's primarily what is made up of Ford today. But we're modernizing to take out unnecessary costs, redesigning work and strategically investing across all of our auto businesses, ICE and hybrid, then EVs and then Ford Pro, while at the same time, transforming every function that supports them.  Sweeping strategic change generates interest and speculation in the media, which we understand. However, we're going to comment on Ford+ actions we're taking and how they're going to strengthen our company on our own schedule. John?\nJohn Lawler: Thanks, Jim. During the quarter, on an adjusted basis, we delivered EBIT of $3.7 billion, an EBIT margin of 9.3% and free cash flow of $3.6 billion. Our cash conversion in the quarter was very strong and lifting our first half to 50%, with the target range of 50% to 60% that we set out at Capital Markets Day.  We ended the quarter with strong cash and liquidity of $29 billion and $45 billion, respectively. And now these numbers include our stake in Rivian, which was valued at $2 billion at the end of the quarter. In Q2, we also successfully renewed our $17.2 billion sustainability-linked global credit facilities, which include a new $1.75 billion 364-day revolver, which provides for additional working capital flexibility. Our strong balance sheet is a solid foundation for continuing to invest in our Ford+ priorities.  Our results this quarter reflect the improved earnings and cash flow potential of our business, along with leverage created from disciplined capital allocation and a much more focused business model, including our industrial footprint. The tough choices we made during the global redesign to de-risk our business and exit unprofitable markets and products is paying off.  From 2018 to 2021, our markets outside North America consumed nearly $9 billion of free cash flow. This year, these markets are collectively expected to be free cash flow positive.  We are confident in the underlying strength of our business and our ability to fund all the calls of capital -- all the calls that we have on capital, especially those fundamental to growth and value creation. We can achieve this while maintaining the financial flexibility to navigate external uncertainties. And as a result, we're increasing our regular quarterly dividend to $0.15 a share beginning this quarter. This returns us to the prepandemic dividend levels.  Now let me touch on the performance of our business units. North America delivered $3.3 billion of EBIT and a margin of 11.3%. Both of those measures were up year-over-year as an 89% increase in wholesales and strong net pricing and mix more than offset higher commodity costs and inflationary pressures.  South America continues to benefit from our global redesign efforts, delivering its fourth consecutive profitable quarter. In Europe, we posted a modest profit as a large increase in wholesales helped us reach just above breakeven EBIT. The underlying trajectory of the region continues to improve. However, the adverse effects of the near-term supply chain disruption are dampening its overall results. In China, we posted a loss as the local economy and auto industry were significantly disrupted by pandemic-related restrictions and lockdowns. Now Lincoln continues to be a profit pillar for the region, gaining share in the quarter, along with commercial vehicles.  Our International Markets Group continues to be sustainably profitable as a result of its restructuring efforts. In mobility, we are progressing our in-market pilots for moving goods and moving people and remain committed to autonomous driving.  And finally, Ford Credit delivered another strong quarter, with EBT of $900 million reflecting strong lease residuals and credit loss performance.  Now let me share with you our current thinking for the remainder of 2022. For the full year, our guidance is unchanged. We expect to earn between $11.5 billion and $12.5 billion in adjusted EBIT, which is up 15% to 25% from 2021. This reflects 10% to 15% year-over-year growth in wholesales and assumes that semiconductor availability continues to improve.  We're projecting to generate adjusted free cash flow of $5.5 billion to $6.5 billion, with a significant portion of that coming from automotive operations.  Relative to adjusted EBIT on a year-over-year basis, our range assumes significantly higher profits in North America, collective profitability in the rest of the world, strong but lower Ford Credit EBT. They'll be in the $3 billion range, and modest improvements in Mobility and Corporate Other.  Other key assumptions include strong order banks and pent-up demand for our new and iconic products, continued strength in pricing, which includes the benefits of pricing actions taken during the year, commodity headwinds of about $4 billion, which we expect to offset with improvements in net pricing and mix, a continuation of other broad-based inflationary pressures, and we now expect the full effect to be about $3 billion, which is up $1 billion from our estimate last quarter. And of course, we're aggressively working on offsets to these increases.  And finally, at Ford Credit, auction values will remain strong but decline in the second half as the supply of new vehicles improve. EBT will be strong but lower, reflecting primarily lower credit loss reserve release, fewer return off-lease vehicles and more normalized credit losses.  Our results in the quarter, full year outlook and commitment to medium-term targets together demonstrate the power of Ford+ as we invest aggressively to drive growth and value creation.  But before we turn it to Q&A, let me provide a quick update on our new financial reporting. As we shared in March, starting in the first quarter of 2023, we will have 3 new business segments: Ford Model E, Ford Blue and Ford Pro, and will no longer report a combined automotive segment. With Ford Next, which is formerly Mobility and Ford Credit, this will bring our total reportable operating segments to 5. Now this change will not be a simple pro forma exercise. It's much more fundamental. These are true segments with both operating and financial accountability, giving you added transparency on our business.  So to help you prepare for this change, we plan to hold a teach-in early next year prior to releasing our 2022 results. We will use our revised 2021 results as a template to reflect the new segments. As part of the teach-in, we also plan to cover business rationale, mechanics of the new reporting structure and how our earnings disclosure and our SEC filings will change. When we report our fourth quarter and our full year results for 2022, they will be based on our existing reportable segments, and we are targeting to also share at the same time results that are revised to reflect the new segments.  And so if you have any questions about this, please don't hesitate to reach out to Lynn and the rest of the IR team.  So that wraps up our prepared remarks. We'll use the balance of the time to address what's on your minds. Thank you. Operator, please open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And the first question will come from John Murphy from Bank of America.\nJohn Murphy: I wanted to ask a somewhat mundane question first on the outlook and then get into some pricing secondarily. But first, John, when you look at it, the seasonality of Ford's earnings traditionally is higher in the first half, lower in the second half. There's timing of cost and volume that usually drive that. Why do you think it's going to be different this year? And I guess maybe one of the big things that might be developing as we get later this year into early next year is that raw mats seem like they may be easing and fading, but the price/mix opportunities seems like it will be pretty strong. So that might help late this year and early next year. But just curious if you can comment if there's some of that change in a seasonal pattern so we can be comfortable with our estimates in the second half or your outlook in the second half.\nJohn Lawler: Yes. So John, it is different, right? Ever since we've had COVID and coming out of COVID, the patterns just haven't held. When you look at the second half versus the first half, I think that would be the best way to help kind of frame this up. We do see continued volume, mix and pricing being strong on a half-over-half basis. And of course, we do expect to see commodities improve a bit as well in the second half on a half-over-half basis. And so volume, pricing and mix, let's say, in the $3 billion range. Commodities could be as much as $0.5 billion. But the inflation that we're seeing, that's going to continue to run through. And we're seeing that across the board from material costs, freight, fuel costs, et cetera. So we see that continuing, and that's up, as I said in my remarks, versus what we had talked about at the end of the last quarter.  And then, of course, FMCC is going to be down slightly half over half, let's say, eight-tenths to $1 billion as they approach $3 billion for the year.  We're also seeing headwinds in the second half, John, from currency, the dollar strengthening. And we have more revenue exposure overseas than we do costs. So we're going to see some of that happen as well. And then we're going to continue to invest in our growth, and that'll be an area of engineering. We'll also see increasing investments in connectivity and spending.  And then, I guess, the last thing I would talk about just to make the half over half complete. We did have some onetime items come to us in the second quarter, roughly an insurance claim and a contract we renegotiated, which roughly would be maybe three-tenths, four-tenths headwinds. So that's basically how we frame up the half over half. And basically, what we're saying is that there'll be some headwinds and some tailwinds, but we're confident in our guidance of 11.5 to 12.5.\nJohn Murphy: That's very helpful. And then, Jim, just on these higher trim levels or pseudo special additions, I mean it's Ford Raptor, I mean, the F-150 Raptor are pretty great looking trucks. You guys put in the slide deck there, looking forward to driving that, hopefully, sometime soon. But it seems like there's a real opportunity for Blue, but there might be a Model E for these high-trim level special -- sort of special editions. I mean how much of an opportunity is there on mix go forward maybe in both divisions? And how do you think about going after that? Because that seems like that's something you could be a lot more sustainable than maybe just the supply/demand imbalance we have right now that's helping price.\nJames Farley: Thank you, John. We've always been really good on the truck side for those derivatives, but now our chances to expand that capability across all of our lineup. Ranger is a good example. We're launching it in Thailand. We just launched Raptor, Tremor. There's a lot we can do. Of course, Mustang is coming out. Maverick is our most affordable vehicle. You can only imagine the kind of things that we're cooking up in our design studio with Maverick. And then, of course, on what we really do well, Broncos, you can imagine high-end versions, all sorts of things. Everglade came out, very popular.  And we do agree our E side -- we don't have to change the body to refresh Mach-E, for example. We are actually completely redoing in a good way our HMI and OTA-ing that to all of our EVs. But you can imagine with Mustang Mach-E all the cool things we could do. So -- and it is a sustainable advantage, and we're good at it.  The tension point for us, though, is complexity. Ford is way too complex. So as we do this, we have to bring our complexity down to get our bill of materials kind of in line with competition. It's great that we have all this pricing power forward. We do have a fresh lineup. We have lots of cool ideas. But we're not satisfied with that because we cannot just continue to build this complexity in our business. So as we add those derivatives, we're going to have to -- we are planning much less complexity in our Blue business. And that is a theme that will run through Blue for years to come.\nJohn Murphy: Jim, if I could just follow up real quick on the Model E side to create a performance version of like the Mustang Mach-E might theoretically cost a lot less, but you might still be able to charge as much as you might on that delta on a Blue vehicle. Is that correct? And could we see sort of these specials or trim levels potentially garner even higher variable margin as we move into the Model E world? Is that a fair statement or not?\nJames Farley: I think the way we look at -- yes. Good question. The way we look at this, John, is the days are kind of over where you have to change the upper body to build a supercar or to build an off-road car like kind of days are over, like, we don't have to do that anymore with these digital products, with EV propulsion, with the motors, the software. We can - we can really take our vehicles and make very different kind of vehicles off of the same body engineering. And that is a complete game changer for us in terms of capital intensity, i.e., lower.  And I'm really glad you brought that up because I try to emphasize this. Like we have to be really careful in our industry, and I'm constantly -- we are constantly talking about this as a leadership team. We cannot have the complexity of top hats that we do on our ICE business.  We have an opportunity as we go digital with these EVs to simplify our body engineering and put the engineer where customers really care. And it's not a different [fender] (ph). It's software. It's a digital display technology. It's a self-driving system and the AV tech. And of course, it's going to be, some cases, more powerful motors.\nOperator: And the next question is from Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Jonas: Jim, the Bronco Raptor, so badass. I don't know if I put an order and now if I'll get it by the end of the decade, but maybe I'll try. Jim, this is one of the most positive Ford calls I can remember in a long, long time. Does Ford have too many people?\nJames Farley: As I said in my comments, Adam, we absolutely have too many people in certain places, no doubt about it. And we have skills that don't work anymore. We -- and we have jobs that need to change. And we have lots of new work statements that we've never had before.  We are literally virtually -- we are reshaping our company, like every part of our company. And on our ICE business, we want to simplify it. We want to make sure the skills we have and the work statements we have are as lean as possible. We know our costs are not competitive at Ford. We are -- that's what I mean by we are not satisfied. But I just want to emphasize that in the past, at least in my career for 40 years, we kind of often and discriminately just taking the costs out. That's not what's happening at Ford now. This is a different kind of change where we're reshaping the company, reshaping skills, investing in new technologies and simplifying investments in others, i.e., spending less.  So do we have too many -- is kind of the old adage. Yes, I think every company probably has too many people. I just -- we have to go do the workflows and decide how this works now going forward.\nAdam Jonas: All right. Appreciate that, Jim. Just one follow-up on the dealers. They're having an amazing time. Their new gross margins have more than tripled, and they're making dealer grosses that are, in many cases, higher than what you're making on selling the product, right? Like they're making more money selling the product that you -- the margin you're making on actually making the product. And all they're doing is just watching the things come off a truck, and they're presold. So I know you guys spent a huge amount of time on pricing at Ford. Is there anything you can do to help even the score a bit on price? Because when I ask the dealers, why isn't Ford raising -- or your peers are raising some of the invoice more, even they don't have a reason like we don't know why they're not doing it. And then they often say things that I don't believe, which is that you can't or you're not moving fast enough or the systems aren't there. So what are we missing?\nJames Farley: Sure. So bottom line is we've taken a lot of pricing. You could see it in our numbers. And actually, we all watch this very carefully at Ford. What is the dealers retained margin versus MSRP? And I have to tell you that ours is one of the best in the industry, i.e., our pricing and the retained margin at MSRP are as close at Ford versus any other brand. There are others that are in different places.  I think your question is actually bigger than that, which is we have ups and downs in our industry. And how is this going to -- how is our retailers going to shape as we change this company? And so -- and again, on the electric vehicles, dynamic pricing is very important for us because we went to an ordering system. And with an ordering system, you have the certainty of orders, but you have to also be responsive on price. I'm not going to get into the details, but we think we have a way out of that tension point or conundrum.  On overall, how I see dealer margins, as we talk to our dealers and roll up our sleeves, is we need -- because I said our competitors are pure-play EVs and the Chinese that are absolutely coming. And that means we have to get this $2,000 out of our distribution cost to be competitive with them. And we think 1/3 of it is going to a low inventory model, not -- I'm not saying like 30-day supply or 50. I don't mean that kind of -- like the customer orders a vehicle, and then we ship the vehicle to the customer. That's what I mean by a low inventory model. We have to go to that. We think that's about -- worth maybe $600, $700 in our system.  Another one is all the selling, SG&A and advertising costs. We have 3 tiers of marketing. We think that's another $600 a vehicle. We're going to simplify that. And we're going to just shift where the e-commerce platform that we don't have today -- all of our e-customers have a very predictable experience, whether they're in a dealership or in their bunny slippers, and they'll have a very simple, transparent, very easy purchase process. And we're going to invest. Our marketing model is going to be post purchase. That will be our differentiator, and that's where we'll invest. And I think that's a different play than the pure EV companies. So I see dealer margins still being very competitive, but they are going to shift. The makeup of those margins going to change. Does that make sense, Adam?\nAdam Jonas: Makes a lot of sense.\nOperator: The next question will come from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research.\nRod Lache: So pricing has been a massive tailwind, and it looks like mix is becoming pretty powerful now, too. Can you just talk to us a little bit about the interplay between affordability and volume? Just especially in the environment that we're in right now and with still a lot of inflation on the horizon, do you think demand can return at this level of price? And are you willing to forgo volume to sustain contribution margins?\nJohn Lawler: Yes. Thanks, Rod. So we have seen strength in volume -- pricing due to the volume that we can produce as an industry and us at Ford relative to the demand that we're seeing out there. So that has been a tailwind. In the quarter, we did see quite a bit of a tailwind from mix as well.  Affordability is something that we keep in front of us all the time with the credit company, and we're very thoughtful about where it's headed from the standpoint to the consumer, what's affordable, et cetera. But we have not seen demand come off at this point. But we have -- as we increase volumes through the second half of the year as some of the chip constraints ease and we see a better rate and flow, we do have provisioned in our second half incentives increasing as volumes come back. And we've always said that the relationship between volume and pricing is going to remain dynamic.  And so I think what you'll see is as volume comes back, you will see some pricing get back. You will see prices come down some. Question for all of us is how are we going to manage stocks? How are we going to move to the build-to-order process? How are we going to change the dynamics and not have as much of a push system and have more of a natural demand system and fulfilling that demand on a timely basis? So I think that's the question for all of us, and we need to maintain discipline as we head into an environment where we could potentially see demand come off and/or we start to have higher supply, and therefore, prices will come well.  But remember, following up on what Adam just said in the dealer margins, we still have -- across the industry, dealer margins need to come down first from a pricing standpoint, right? We did -- as we've talked about in the past, we took an action, which reduced floor plan for the dealers, which was a form of pricing for us. But overall, it's still inflated. And I'd estimate somewhere between $1,300 to $1,700 of dealer margin compression is to come off first from a pricing standpoint.\nRod Lache: That makes sense. And then just secondly, can you just provide any color you can on what's happening from a supply chain perspective? Any thoughts on whether this Europe natural gas situation is something that is a major concern for you? And then lastly, any detail on the $3 billion of cost inflation in North America? It looked like a large number. Was there anything unusual in that number?\nJohn Lawler: No, there wasn't anything unusual, Rod. I'll start with that. It's across the board. It's in the areas you would expect, material cost going up. We're seeing increases in freight. It's just across the board, and it's driven by the inflationary pressures we're seeing across the board in the economy. Nothing unusual.\nJames Farley: And on the supply chain, I'd to characterize it, I mean, chips are still an issue. Transparency is still an issue in the second quarter specifically. You know we had quite an issue in China with the Shanghai shutdown. And that affects -- that could have affected our North America manufacturing system. The team did a great job. We had a daily call. We worked every issue. We built a digital model of all our supply chain down to supply chain in, and it was really helpful. And we got through it. Like Rosana Rosana Dana said, if it's not one thing, it's another.  It just feels like what's next. As far as we're planning everything we know could happen. The next possibility of the energy crisis in Europe, we played this out already. We've done our homework. We have about 550 active suppliers in what I would call the high-risk countries like Czech, Germany, Hungary, Austria and Slovakia. We think that the risk is between now and mid-'23 when they can manage through the energy issues. We have about 130 suppliers for our North America vehicle production in that 550 list, and we now have a 30-day buffer stock. So we are doing everything we can with the things we know. On the supply chain outside of -- we have labor shortages and all sorts of moving. The suppliers have been working nonstop during COVID, so machine maintenance and a lot of other things. We see the output of the stress in the supply chain. And obviously, their costs have gone up, too. And we're working through all of that with our suppliers. So I think we're well prepared for the things we can predict, but it's always a new day.\nOperator: The next question will be from Emmanuel Rosner from Deutsche Bank.\nEmmanuel Rosner: My first question, I was hoping to ask you about the topic of EV profitability. So Jim, during the quarter at an investor conference, I think you essentially gave some pretty good color on where Ford is standing right now. And I think you spoke about the cost of the Mach-E being a disadvantage of $25,000 to $27,000 versus a similarly [indiscernible]. So I guess my questions would be, how do you plan on offsetting this over time? I guess what is the strategy going forward? And should we worry about large losses from EVs in the near term over the next few years as the EV volumes increase materially over the next few years?\nJames Farley: Well, thank you, Emmanuel. I will say there's not going to be a lot of guess work at Ford because we will financially report our businesses independently of each other. So it will be all out there for everyone to see. I don't know about others. But at Ford, it will be extremely transparent. I'm not going to get into specifics because I think this is such a material topic. We need to spend time on it. We can't rush to this.  I will tell you that in the quarter, our announcement for LFP bringing that to North America is a big deal from a profit standpoint. That is a very important chemistry on our road map for profitability. We're going to be installing 60 -- 40-gigawatt hours in North America. That's a lot. And we are not going to wait until that installed capacity is here. We're going to be bringing those batteries to our highest volume vehicles like next year. So that's one, but there's distribution. There's the size of your battery. You're engineering for low labor content. And I just don't think we're going to do justice such as series and important topic in the earnings call. But you can expect a lot of engagement with Ford on this, and this is an incredibly important focus. This is one of the reasons why we created Model E, to be laser-focused on profitable electric vehicles. And again, you'll see it all.  John, do you want to add any comments on the segmentation reporting?\nJohn Lawler: No. In segmentation reporting, you'll see exactly where we're at between the 5 businesses. And Emmanuel, we know how important that is. So when we have our Capital Markets Day early next year, we'll unpack that in more detail, as Jim said, where we can spend some time on it and go through it and give it to do justice.\nEmmanuel Rosner: Okay. That's fair. So let me ask you a separate topic then. So I think one of the hardest things for investors here is to try to performance sensitivity for a downturn scenario as consumer comes under more pressure, risk of recession increase. What could that do for not so much volume because, obviously, we've been -- auto has been operating at low volume for a while, supply-driven, but pricing. Any thoughts you could share with us either based on history or in the current context on how would you go about flexing down vehicle pricing in a downturn scenario?\nJohn Lawler: Yes. So Emmanuel, we spent a lot of time on this, as you would expect us to be doing, modeling scenarios, looking at what that means for the business, looking at what we should be doing today to get out in front of any these types of issues if a recession were to come. But the way we're thinking about it is if you step back and look at where we're at today relative to where we've been as a company, heading into any -- what could be a potential downturn, right, we're in much better shape. You mentioned it from a demand standpoint. We have 3 years of pent-up demand, and we have a very strong product lineup. And so that's a positive.  We're also at a point right now where incentives are low, right? They're in the single digits versus what normally, at this point in the cycle, we'd probably be in high teens. And so of course, as volume or demand comes off, there will be some pricing that will need to be given back. And that's a bit of a release valve, if you will. But it's really important for us to be thoughtful about that, not only Ford, but as an industry.  And then the other thing I would say, and I mentioned it in my remarks, our business is very different than what it was in the past. Our ICE product, clearly, it's more -- our lineup is more profitable as we've exited unprofitable vehicles. But we've de-risked the overall business. We restructured our markets overseas. And I think a great proof point for that is the fact that between '18 and '21, we burned through $9 billion of free cash flow overseas. We're not in that position now. And we do expect this year, we're projecting that our overseas markets will be free cash flow positive. So we're just in a completely different position. We're modeling it. We're looking at it. We're getting out in front of things, as Jim said, that we can today. But it's a new day every day. But that's how we're thinking about it. We're clear-eyed. We understand what we're facing. We understand what could potentially be in front of us, and now we need to work it.\nOperator: And the next question will be from Colin Langan from Wells Fargo. .\nColin Langan: I just wanted to circle back to the first question going from the first half to second half. The outlook dividend point is about flat. You highlighted, I think, [indiscernible] volume. I think the commodities is over $1 billion in [indiscernible] Q1 and Q2. You highlighted about $1 billion of Ford Credit sort of -- that's about $3 billion is good news. You didn't quantify the bad news. [indiscernible], it doesn't seem like [indiscernible] be that material. Any sort of framing it, is that $3 billion inflationary cost predominantly in the second half? Is that [indiscernible]?\nJohn Lawler: Yes. So Colin, let me clarify. It's really hard to hear you. It's quite static-y. But Ford Credit will be about $3 billion in total profits for the year. So that'll be down half over half. So that's a headwind. And the inflationary costs on a half over half are a headwind. And so when you walk through it, yes, there will be some volume. We said that volumes in the second half will be up roughly in the low 20 percentage range versus the first half. And so you've got some mix improvement as well. So volume and pricing and mix are the tailwinds. A little bit of a tailwind on commodities, but the headwinds are FMCC profits. They'll be down. We've got the inflationary pressures we talked about, will be an increase in the second half. We also have exchange that's hitting us in the second half relative to the first half. So that's a headwind as well. And then we had some onetimers in the second quarter that aren't going to repeat.  And of course, we're going to continue to invest in the business. So there's going to be spending-related costs. There's going to be connectivity costs that will be increasing as well as we invest. So those are the puts and takes. Those are the tailwinds and the headwinds as you look at it from a half-over-half basis. And I hope that helps clarify things.\nColin Langan: Okay. And to follow up, I know you clearly are going to give more details on the E perspective and how you're going to assess things. But you're talking a pretty dramatic increase in raw material costs. I think even in your comments, you indicated that only about 50% of the materials are going to be available to produce all the EV targets, which kind of would imply that prices of the raw materials would actually remain high. Should you be thinking about pulling back on some of the EV investments if the economics at this point are unclear?\nJames Farley: No. No. We don't plan on pulling back. If anything, the first generation of products has aspired us to go faster. I think I would just emphasize that how we look at this change in our industry, it's not a change in propulsion. It's much bigger than that. It's a change to a vehicle whose differentiation will increasingly be software that you ship to the vehicle. We now have real experience on the first shippable software to these cars. The first is ADAS for sure. And the second one for us is Ford Pro. We're shipping telematics to the customer, driver coaching, energy management. Our attach rate for charging now on our E-Transits, we're 95% share. It's like 30-plus percent. So there are a lot of services connected to these vehicles because of the software. And that's a really big revenue opportunity for us.  When you talk about the base walk to 8%, we're not going to -- as John said, we're not going to go through that here, but I will tell you that LFP has a dramatically different exposure to raw materials than an NCM sell. Like there's no nickel in it.  So the chemistry strategy for the company and diversifying that is a very key part of our profitability walk. But I think the most important thing to think about is not that we're investing or not in electric cars. We're investing in digital products, and we can keep them longer because we don't have to upgrade the upper bodies because they're software-enabled vehicles. There's so much we can do to change the profit profile of these vehicles. The biggest thing we have to solve for in all of that is the battery cost, and we can't wait to take you through all of that.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets.\nJoseph Spak: I just want to -- John, can we just go over -- so $3 billion of other inflationary costs, it's $2 billion higher than before. Are you -- I know you're working to offset it. Are you assuming you offset that delta in the guide? And maybe you could just let us know how much of that was already incurred in the first half.\nJohn Lawler: So we had -- it's $1 billion higher than what we had talked about previously, Joe. So we're looking at about $3 billion for the year, and that's part of what we're doing. We're working to offset those inflationary costs, and that's something that we need to continue to work through. We're not all the way there, of course, but we're working on it, and we do have the rest of the year to go, and it is a significant focus of our team, as we've talked about. But the cost efforts are a significant focus of the team as we remake the company in Ford+. So that's a really important part of what we're doing. And so it's $3 billion for the year. We had said $2 billion. We've seen about another $1 billion come through, and it's across the board.\nJoseph Spak: Okay. The second question is just on Ford Credit. So you're pointing to a lower second half, which, if you annualize that, would get you to something in the low 2s. Is that a good base to think about next year and go forward? Because if we look at the pretax ROE in this business, it's been well above average, and I think we understand why there's been some unusual circumstances. But is that the right way that you're thinking about it that to return to sort of more normal or historical returns? Or is there anything structural under effect Ford Credit that's changed the profitability profile?\nMarion Harris: Joe, this is Marion here. Thanks for the question. You're thinking about it correctly. So if you go back to pre-COVID, and balance sheet was quite a bit larger, we were at about $145 billion at that time. We were at a run rate of about $2.5 billion, $2.6 billion of EBT. And so that was the normal level. Our balance sheet is somewhat smaller now. And so I think what you're seeing is a more normalized level of profits. We're back at our pre-COVID reserve level. We're not releasing reserves and the related to lease residuals, that's pretty much worked its way through its book. So you're seeing that more normal performance.\nOperator: And our final question of today will come from James Picariello from Exane PNB Paribas.\nJames Picariello: Just for commodities, at current spot rates, just as a theoretical exercise, right, if we take into account the lagging effect to your P&L, can you just think about maybe directionally just what commodities -- what the commodities impact would look like for next year at current spot rates?\nJohn Lawler: Yes. I think we do see it coming off some. Part of what complicates the commodity situation is as we go through in a year, we lock into contracts, and they roll. That protects us on the [indiscernible] when prices are increasing some, but it also has a lag effect when prices are coming down some. And so we'll have to deal with that as we run through the year as well.  And so I think, really, it's going to depend on what happens with the overall macroeconomic environment. If we do see us tripping into more of a recessionary period, we should see those fall quicker like we have in the past. If not, I think that they'll come down more moderately. So we're planning and looking at both of those scenarios from a spot standpoint. It is good news as we roll through next year, but you can't just take that spot good news and roll it through everything because we do have contracts that were locked into on a rolling basis through the year.\nJames Picariello: Okay. Understood. And then just with respect to the cadence for the second half, I mean, how should we be thinking about the quarterly volume -- the volume ramp in the back half? And can you provide color on Ford's progress in shipping the [indiscernible] inventory, I think, totaled 53,000 entering the quarter?\nJohn Lawler: Yes. So 53,000 entering the quarter. The team did a good job on the drawdown. We're down to 18,000 at the end of the quarter, and we'll work to get those out over the second half of the year as we can free up the chips that impacted us.  I think when you look at the volumes, in the second quarter, we saw an increase in volumes in North America, which helped drive the strong performance for North America. When you look at the second half, as we said, volumes would be up in the low 20% range compared with the first half. But that volume growth -- there's greater volume growth in the overseas markets in the second half than in North America. We have the Ranger launching in IMG. We have volume in the second half growing at a quicker rate in Europe. And then, of course, China was significantly depressed from a volume standpoint in the second quarter due to the shutdown. And so that's what will be happening from a standpoint.  But when you look at the volumes for Q3, they'll be lower than they will be in Q4 because in Q4, we should see the rate fall, the chips improve as we go through the third quarter into the fourth quarter. So that's how the volume is framing up in the second half relative to the first half, and then the walk from Q2 into Q3. So volume and mix in Q3 -- Q3 is going to be less than Q2, right? It's not going to be as strong as Q2. We have a couple of things hitting us in Q3. Volume and mix, most of the volume growth in Q3 relative to Q2 is going to be in Europe and China. And then we still have commodity costs hitting us, and we're investing in connectivity. And our spending will -- in the third quarter, Ford Credit, of course, as the second half is lower than the first half. You see that come through in the third quarter. And then we have the nonrepeat of the onetimers I talked about in the second quarter. So third quarter will be down compared to the second quarter. Volume increases will be overseas. And then as we get to the fourth quarter, volume in the fourth quarter on a sequential basis will be better than the third quarter.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Ford Motor Company Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Take care.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "James Farley",
            "content": "Thanks, Lynn. Hello, everyone. The Ford team delivered a very solid second quarter in a challenging environment where we saw supply chain disruptions, a lot of new economic headwinds and uncertainty as a whole. Importantly, we achieved these results as we advance the Ford+ plan, which is the biggest opportunity to create value at Ford since we scaled the Model T. And at the core of Ford+ are 3 fundamental promises to our customers: distinctive and breakthrough products and experiences; and always on relationship with Ford every day, every hour, every minute; and ever-improving post-purchase user experiences powered by software.  Today, I'll give you an update on Ford+ and the early results of our decisions to reorganize the company into 3 distinct segments Model E, Ford Blue and Ford Pro.  Now let me start with the progress we're making to lead the electric vehicle and digital revolution. What's lost in the industry's arm race of claims regarding capital invested, the number of top hats we all have, the promises of future leadership is one fundamental question: who is and will be the best positioned to design truly distinctive and appealing products that people actually love? That's the question.  Now we've been overwhelmed with the demand for our first-generation EVs, the Mustang Mach-E, the Lightning and the E-Transit. These products are in the market now, and we have strong multiyear order banks. We're selling them as fast as we can make them.  And you can't say that about many of the EVs coming to market now. We believe that these great new products will enable us to grab an outsized share of the rapidly growing EV market, combined with our healthy and vibrant shares of our ICE and growing hybrid markets.  This month, we expect to produce 14,000 EVs globally. That's significantly higher than just a few months ago, and we have a clear path to reach a run rate of 60,000 EVs by the end of next year. And that will lead to a foundation to 2 million by late 2026. In fact, our anticipated growth rate in EVs through 2026 is more than twice what we expect for the global EV industry in total.  Now securing the raw materials to produce batteries at scale is critical to our plan. It's estimated that at best, 50% of all raw materials required to meet the combined announced targets for all EV OEMs is actually available, 50%. And this is why speed to securing supply is so critical and strategic, so is diversifying our battery chemistries to increase our flexibility, supply and profit and to support different customer use cases.  Last week, we announced a series of MOUs and agreements to fulfill our ambition -- ambitious needs that I covered, and we are working to complete definitive agreements where necessary. Our Model E team moved quickly to capture these opportunities. To summarize, we've added battery chemistries and secure contracts, delivering 60-gigawatt hours of annual battery capacity, which will help us support fully the 600,000 units of that 2023 run rate of capacity. We now have lithium-ion phosphate, or LFP, battery packs coming for the Mach-E sold in North America next year and for Lightning in early 2024, creating more capacity for these high-demand products. We secured 70% of the battery capacity needed to support 2 million units by the end of 2026, and we struck a new deal with CATL on strategic cooperation for global battery supplies as well as deals for direct sourcing of critical battery raw materials in the U.S., Australia, Indonesia and more locations. And we have a plan to localize 40-gigawatt hours per year LFP capacity in North America by 2026. These deals are a strong start as we fortify our EV supply chain that's aligned with our sustainability and human rights principles.  Now let's talk about the progress we're making in building out an always on relationship with customers and that ever-improving user experience enabled by software after the customer buys a vehicle. Now along with product execution, these are really the relevant sustainable advantages we see to create, in today's hypercompetitive market, a difference where the real competition is not legacy OEMs, but pure-play EV companies, including emerging Chinese players.  For example, more than 55,000 Ford customers have already driven nearly 10 million miles with BlueCruise, our hands-free L2 system. That's just one year after the capacity was launched, and we started OTA-ing this to our vehicles. We're using the data we get through BlueCruise to continue to improve the customer experience. And as it happens, you can imagine a significant ADAS revenue and profit stream being created by giving customers the ability to work, watch a film or even take a nap during a long trip in their Ford. While the financial benefits of ADAS are clear, as is our Ford Pro services stack, they're relatively small now, but we're rapidly increasing the number of digital vehicles on the road as well as attach rates of the enabling services. And over time, much of the SaaS revenue will be deferred on our balance sheet, providing an annuity-like revenue stream that is highly accretive, something this company and this industry has never seen.  Now before I turn to Ford Blue, let me talk briefly about our connected EV dealer model in the U.S. Changes in the market have compelled Ford and our dealers to revisit how customers shop, buy and own, and how they will do this going forward. We're moving fast as the transition to these digital EV platforms allows us to help our dealers provide better customer ownership experience post purchase, and in turn, enables them to expand the revenue and profit pools, expanding and improving their returns. We're working with our dealers to create a retail model better than what's offered by any traditional OEM and better than the startups who are now scrambling to develop sales and service networks to support customers in an attempt to sustain and grow share in UIL.  In the U.S. alone, if we can help our dealers increase service loyalty by just 20 points, that's $2.4 billion incremental revenue for them every year. Now since March, we've conducted more than 30 workshops in the U.S. and Canada, reaching hundreds of our dealers. I have personally been involved in many of these meetings. What is clear to me but not yet visible to the market is that our dealers are embracing this change. They know the competitive threat is real, and they want Ford and their dealership to lead and win. And we have more to share as this develops.  Now turning to Ford Blue. The team is motivated by this sharpening focus on our ICE and hybrid products. We've added new talent and leadership to drive performance and focus in our trucks, our great family lineup and our enthusiast vehicles we're so proud of. We've revealed new vehicles like the Bronco Raptor, the Bronco Everglades, the F-150 Raptor R, which my kids think sounds great. In the third quarter, we'll unveil an all new seventh generation Mustang at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. It is a stunning car, and I'm so excited to share it with the world. And also this fall, we'll be introducing an all-new Super Duty pickup, the workhorse at Ford, and it sets a standard in our industry.  There's much more to come. Our design center is filled with new products and derivatives that will further strengthen our hit vehicles in the ICE and hybrid franchises like F-150 and Bronco and Maverick, the brand-new global Ranger that's launching in Thailand and our new Everest. In short, our hottest and freshest lineup in recent history is getting even better.  Now in commercial vehicle market, Ford Pro, our industry-leading global business, is leading the change into an electric software-driven world. Other OEMs are talking about large numbers of future electric orders. We're actually taking orders for manufacturing and selling commercial vehicles now.  Through the second quarter, we've sold more than 3,000 E-Transit in the U.S. That's a market share of 95% in the full-sized electric van market, 95%. In fact, our next 2 competitors combined sold just 159 vehicles.  Beyond the vehicles, we're also rolling out our Ford Pro charging commercial solutions and the very exciting and fast-growing e-telematics software solutions. And boy, are they paying off.  And in Europe, where we continue to be the leading commercial vehicle brand, we're already received 8,000 orders for our 2-tonne E-Transit, and our new one-tonne E-Transit custom goes on sale next year.  Now our Ford Pro software business is growing quickly. Telematics subscriptions globally have grown over 40% sequentially for the last two quarters.  Turning to quality. We made solid progress in initial quality, as you've seen in the recent J.D. Power's IQS study, and our launches have improved. However, we continue to be hampered by recalls and customer satisfaction actions. Yes, this affects our cost, but more importantly, it falls short on our most fundamental commitment to our customers. Quality is our #1 priority. In fact, we recently brought on Josh Halliburton from J.D. Powers to head quality. Now the team is focused on 3 critical areas: prevention, detection and remediation.  We've instituted more robust engineering sign-off processes for the vehicles that are in the product development factory as we speak. We're driving much more frequent alignment with our supply base on quality. And when identified issues, we take actions quickly to resolve them, to protect our customer's experience, including by making much more frequent use of over their updates. And boy, has that work for us. We have more work to do in this space, and we will keep you updated.  Overall, we're pleased with the progress this year, but we are not nearly satisfied. We remain clear-eyed and determined to move with speed and determination on a Ford+ transformation. The underlying strength of our business supports our 2022 adjusted EBIT guidance range of $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion, unchanged from April.  Before I turn it over to John, I want to end with this. There's context that's critical to how we think about implementing our Ford+ plan. Traditionally, the auto industry has cut costs, often indiscriminately. As an effect, of course, from lower auto demands through economic softness and shift for customer preferences.  What we're undertaking forward is totally different than that. We're reshaping virtually every aspect of the way we've done business for a century. And we're doing that for a new industry based on new technology, new skills and new promise for customer value. And yet, cost reduction will happen in our ICE business because that's primarily what is made up of Ford today. But we're modernizing to take out unnecessary costs, redesigning work and strategically investing across all of our auto businesses, ICE and hybrid, then EVs and then Ford Pro, while at the same time, transforming every function that supports them.  Sweeping strategic change generates interest and speculation in the media, which we understand. However, we're going to comment on Ford+ actions we're taking and how they're going to strengthen our company on our own schedule. John? Thank you, John. We've always been really good on the truck side for those derivatives, but now our chances to expand that capability across all of our lineup. Ranger is a good example. We're launching it in Thailand. We just launched Raptor, Tremor. There's a lot we can do. Of course, Mustang is coming out. Maverick is our most affordable vehicle. You can only imagine the kind of things that we're cooking up in our design studio with Maverick. And then, of course, on what we really do well, Broncos, you can imagine high-end versions, all sorts of things. Everglade came out, very popular.  And we do agree our E side -- we don't have to change the body to refresh Mach-E, for example. We are actually completely redoing in a good way our HMI and OTA-ing that to all of our EVs. But you can imagine with Mustang Mach-E all the cool things we could do. So -- and it is a sustainable advantage, and we're good at it.  The tension point for us, though, is complexity. Ford is way too complex. So as we do this, we have to bring our complexity down to get our bill of materials kind of in line with competition. It's great that we have all this pricing power forward. We do have a fresh lineup. We have lots of cool ideas. But we're not satisfied with that because we cannot just continue to build this complexity in our business. So as we add those derivatives, we're going to have to -- we are planning much less complexity in our Blue business. And that is a theme that will run through Blue for years to come. I think the way we look at -- yes. Good question. The way we look at this, John, is the days are kind of over where you have to change the upper body to build a supercar or to build an off-road car like kind of days are over, like, we don't have to do that anymore with these digital products, with EV propulsion, with the motors, the software. We can - we can really take our vehicles and make very different kind of vehicles off of the same body engineering. And that is a complete game changer for us in terms of capital intensity, i.e., lower.  And I'm really glad you brought that up because I try to emphasize this. Like we have to be really careful in our industry, and I'm constantly -- we are constantly talking about this as a leadership team. We cannot have the complexity of top hats that we do on our ICE business.  We have an opportunity as we go digital with these EVs to simplify our body engineering and put the engineer where customers really care. And it's not a different [fender] (ph). It's software. It's a digital display technology. It's a self-driving system and the AV tech. And of course, it's going to be, some cases, more powerful motors. As I said in my comments, Adam, we absolutely have too many people in certain places, no doubt about it. And we have skills that don't work anymore. We -- and we have jobs that need to change. And we have lots of new work statements that we've never had before.  We are literally virtually -- we are reshaping our company, like every part of our company. And on our ICE business, we want to simplify it. We want to make sure the skills we have and the work statements we have are as lean as possible. We know our costs are not competitive at Ford. We are -- that's what I mean by we are not satisfied. But I just want to emphasize that in the past, at least in my career for 40 years, we kind of often and discriminately just taking the costs out. That's not what's happening at Ford now. This is a different kind of change where we're reshaping the company, reshaping skills, investing in new technologies and simplifying investments in others, i.e., spending less.  So do we have too many -- is kind of the old adage. Yes, I think every company probably has too many people. I just -- we have to go do the workflows and decide how this works now going forward. Sure. So bottom line is we've taken a lot of pricing. You could see it in our numbers. And actually, we all watch this very carefully at Ford. What is the dealers retained margin versus MSRP? And I have to tell you that ours is one of the best in the industry, i.e., our pricing and the retained margin at MSRP are as close at Ford versus any other brand. There are others that are in different places.  I think your question is actually bigger than that, which is we have ups and downs in our industry. And how is this going to -- how is our retailers going to shape as we change this company? And so -- and again, on the electric vehicles, dynamic pricing is very important for us because we went to an ordering system. And with an ordering system, you have the certainty of orders, but you have to also be responsive on price. I'm not going to get into the details, but we think we have a way out of that tension point or conundrum.  On overall, how I see dealer margins, as we talk to our dealers and roll up our sleeves, is we need -- because I said our competitors are pure-play EVs and the Chinese that are absolutely coming. And that means we have to get this $2,000 out of our distribution cost to be competitive with them. And we think 1/3 of it is going to a low inventory model, not -- I'm not saying like 30-day supply or 50. I don't mean that kind of -- like the customer orders a vehicle, and then we ship the vehicle to the customer. That's what I mean by a low inventory model. We have to go to that. We think that's about -- worth maybe $600, $700 in our system.  Another one is all the selling, SG&A and advertising costs. We have 3 tiers of marketing. We think that's another $600 a vehicle. We're going to simplify that. And we're going to just shift where the e-commerce platform that we don't have today -- all of our e-customers have a very predictable experience, whether they're in a dealership or in their bunny slippers, and they'll have a very simple, transparent, very easy purchase process. And we're going to invest. Our marketing model is going to be post purchase. That will be our differentiator, and that's where we'll invest. And I think that's a different play than the pure EV companies. So I see dealer margins still being very competitive, but they are going to shift. The makeup of those margins going to change. Does that make sense, Adam? And on the supply chain, I'd to characterize it, I mean, chips are still an issue. Transparency is still an issue in the second quarter specifically. You know we had quite an issue in China with the Shanghai shutdown. And that affects -- that could have affected our North America manufacturing system. The team did a great job. We had a daily call. We worked every issue. We built a digital model of all our supply chain down to supply chain in, and it was really helpful. And we got through it. Like Rosana Rosana Dana said, if it's not one thing, it's another.  It just feels like what's next. As far as we're planning everything we know could happen. The next possibility of the energy crisis in Europe, we played this out already. We've done our homework. We have about 550 active suppliers in what I would call the high-risk countries like Czech, Germany, Hungary, Austria and Slovakia. We think that the risk is between now and mid-'23 when they can manage through the energy issues. We have about 130 suppliers for our North America vehicle production in that 550 list, and we now have a 30-day buffer stock. So we are doing everything we can with the things we know. On the supply chain outside of -- we have labor shortages and all sorts of moving. The suppliers have been working nonstop during COVID, so machine maintenance and a lot of other things. We see the output of the stress in the supply chain. And obviously, their costs have gone up, too. And we're working through all of that with our suppliers. So I think we're well prepared for the things we can predict, but it's always a new day. Well, thank you, Emmanuel. I will say there's not going to be a lot of guess work at Ford because we will financially report our businesses independently of each other. So it will be all out there for everyone to see. I don't know about others. But at Ford, it will be extremely transparent. I'm not going to get into specifics because I think this is such a material topic. We need to spend time on it. We can't rush to this.  I will tell you that in the quarter, our announcement for LFP bringing that to North America is a big deal from a profit standpoint. That is a very important chemistry on our road map for profitability. We're going to be installing 60 -- 40-gigawatt hours in North America. That's a lot. And we are not going to wait until that installed capacity is here. We're going to be bringing those batteries to our highest volume vehicles like next year. So that's one, but there's distribution. There's the size of your battery. You're engineering for low labor content. And I just don't think we're going to do justice such as series and important topic in the earnings call. But you can expect a lot of engagement with Ford on this, and this is an incredibly important focus. This is one of the reasons why we created Model E, to be laser-focused on profitable electric vehicles. And again, you'll see it all.  John, do you want to add any comments on the segmentation reporting? No. No. We don't plan on pulling back. If anything, the first generation of products has aspired us to go faster. I think I would just emphasize that how we look at this change in our industry, it's not a change in propulsion. It's much bigger than that. It's a change to a vehicle whose differentiation will increasingly be software that you ship to the vehicle. We now have real experience on the first shippable software to these cars. The first is ADAS for sure. And the second one for us is Ford Pro. We're shipping telematics to the customer, driver coaching, energy management. Our attach rate for charging now on our E-Transits, we're 95% share. It's like 30-plus percent. So there are a lot of services connected to these vehicles because of the software. And that's a really big revenue opportunity for us.  When you talk about the base walk to 8%, we're not going to -- as John said, we're not going to go through that here, but I will tell you that LFP has a dramatically different exposure to raw materials than an NCM sell. Like there's no nickel in it.  So the chemistry strategy for the company and diversifying that is a very key part of our profitability walk. But I think the most important thing to think about is not that we're investing or not in electric cars. We're investing in digital products, and we can keep them longer because we don't have to upgrade the upper bodies because they're software-enabled vehicles. There's so much we can do to change the profit profile of these vehicles. The biggest thing we have to solve for in all of that is the battery cost, and we can't wait to take you through all of that."

            "content": "Joe, this is Marion here. Thanks for the question. You're thinking about it correctly. So if you go back to pre-COVID, and balance sheet was quite a bit larger, we were at about $145 billion at that time. We were at a run rate of about $2.5 billion, $2.6 billion of EBT. And so that was the normal level. Our balance sheet is somewhat smaller now. And so I think what you're seeing is a more normalized level of profits. We're back at our pre-COVID reserve level. We're not releasing reserves and the related to lease residuals, that's pretty much worked its way through its book. So you're seeing that more normal performance."

            "name": "John Lawler",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim. During the quarter, on an adjusted basis, we delivered EBIT of $3.7 billion, an EBIT margin of 9.3% and free cash flow of $3.6 billion. Our cash conversion in the quarter was very strong and lifting our first half to 50%, with the target range of 50% to 60% that we set out at Capital Markets Day.  We ended the quarter with strong cash and liquidity of $29 billion and $45 billion, respectively. And now these numbers include our stake in Rivian, which was valued at $2 billion at the end of the quarter. In Q2, we also successfully renewed our $17.2 billion sustainability-linked global credit facilities, which include a new $1.75 billion 364-day revolver, which provides for additional working capital flexibility. Our strong balance sheet is a solid foundation for continuing to invest in our Ford+ priorities.  Our results this quarter reflect the improved earnings and cash flow potential of our business, along with leverage created from disciplined capital allocation and a much more focused business model, including our industrial footprint. The tough choices we made during the global redesign to de-risk our business and exit unprofitable markets and products is paying off.  From 2018 to 2021, our markets outside North America consumed nearly $9 billion of free cash flow. This year, these markets are collectively expected to be free cash flow positive.  We are confident in the underlying strength of our business and our ability to fund all the calls of capital -- all the calls that we have on capital, especially those fundamental to growth and value creation. We can achieve this while maintaining the financial flexibility to navigate external uncertainties. And as a result, we're increasing our regular quarterly dividend to $0.15 a share beginning this quarter. This returns us to the prepandemic dividend levels.  Now let me touch on the performance of our business units. North America delivered $3.3 billion of EBIT and a margin of 11.3%. Both of those measures were up year-over-year as an 89% increase in wholesales and strong net pricing and mix more than offset higher commodity costs and inflationary pressures.  South America continues to benefit from our global redesign efforts, delivering its fourth consecutive profitable quarter. In Europe, we posted a modest profit as a large increase in wholesales helped us reach just above breakeven EBIT. The underlying trajectory of the region continues to improve. However, the adverse effects of the near-term supply chain disruption are dampening its overall results. In China, we posted a loss as the local economy and auto industry were significantly disrupted by pandemic-related restrictions and lockdowns. Now Lincoln continues to be a profit pillar for the region, gaining share in the quarter, along with commercial vehicles.  Our International Markets Group continues to be sustainably profitable as a result of its restructuring efforts. In mobility, we are progressing our in-market pilots for moving goods and moving people and remain committed to autonomous driving.  And finally, Ford Credit delivered another strong quarter, with EBT of $900 million reflecting strong lease residuals and credit loss performance.  Now let me share with you our current thinking for the remainder of 2022. For the full year, our guidance is unchanged. We expect to earn between $11.5 billion and $12.5 billion in adjusted EBIT, which is up 15% to 25% from 2021. This reflects 10% to 15% year-over-year growth in wholesales and assumes that semiconductor availability continues to improve.  We're projecting to generate adjusted free cash flow of $5.5 billion to $6.5 billion, with a significant portion of that coming from automotive operations.  Relative to adjusted EBIT on a year-over-year basis, our range assumes significantly higher profits in North America, collective profitability in the rest of the world, strong but lower Ford Credit EBT. They'll be in the $3 billion range, and modest improvements in Mobility and Corporate Other.  Other key assumptions include strong order banks and pent-up demand for our new and iconic products, continued strength in pricing, which includes the benefits of pricing actions taken during the year, commodity headwinds of about $4 billion, which we expect to offset with improvements in net pricing and mix, a continuation of other broad-based inflationary pressures, and we now expect the full effect to be about $3 billion, which is up $1 billion from our estimate last quarter. And of course, we're aggressively working on offsets to these increases.  And finally, at Ford Credit, auction values will remain strong but decline in the second half as the supply of new vehicles improve. EBT will be strong but lower, reflecting primarily lower credit loss reserve release, fewer return off-lease vehicles and more normalized credit losses.  Our results in the quarter, full year outlook and commitment to medium-term targets together demonstrate the power of Ford+ as we invest aggressively to drive growth and value creation.  But before we turn it to Q&A, let me provide a quick update on our new financial reporting. As we shared in March, starting in the first quarter of 2023, we will have 3 new business segments: Ford Model E, Ford Blue and Ford Pro, and will no longer report a combined automotive segment. With Ford Next, which is formerly Mobility and Ford Credit, this will bring our total reportable operating segments to 5. Now this change will not be a simple pro forma exercise. It's much more fundamental. These are true segments with both operating and financial accountability, giving you added transparency on our business.  So to help you prepare for this change, we plan to hold a teach-in early next year prior to releasing our 2022 results. We will use our revised 2021 results as a template to reflect the new segments. As part of the teach-in, we also plan to cover business rationale, mechanics of the new reporting structure and how our earnings disclosure and our SEC filings will change. When we report our fourth quarter and our full year results for 2022, they will be based on our existing reportable segments, and we are targeting to also share at the same time results that are revised to reflect the new segments.  And so if you have any questions about this, please don't hesitate to reach out to Lynn and the rest of the IR team.  So that wraps up our prepared remarks. We'll use the balance of the time to address what's on your minds. Thank you. Operator, please open it up for questions. Yes. So John, it is different, right? Ever since we've had COVID and coming out of COVID, the patterns just haven't held. When you look at the second half versus the first half, I think that would be the best way to help kind of frame this up. We do see continued volume, mix and pricing being strong on a half-over-half basis. And of course, we do expect to see commodities improve a bit as well in the second half on a half-over-half basis. And so volume, pricing and mix, let's say, in the $3 billion range. Commodities could be as much as $0.5 billion. But the inflation that we're seeing, that's going to continue to run through. And we're seeing that across the board from material costs, freight, fuel costs, et cetera. So we see that continuing, and that's up, as I said in my remarks, versus what we had talked about at the end of the last quarter.  And then, of course, FMCC is going to be down slightly half over half, let's say, eight-tenths to $1 billion as they approach $3 billion for the year.  We're also seeing headwinds in the second half, John, from currency, the dollar strengthening. And we have more revenue exposure overseas than we do costs. So we're going to see some of that happen as well. And then we're going to continue to invest in our growth, and that'll be an area of engineering. We'll also see increasing investments in connectivity and spending.  And then, I guess, the last thing I would talk about just to make the half over half complete. We did have some onetime items come to us in the second quarter, roughly an insurance claim and a contract we renegotiated, which roughly would be maybe three-tenths, four-tenths headwinds. So that's basically how we frame up the half over half. And basically, what we're saying is that there'll be some headwinds and some tailwinds, but we're confident in our guidance of 11.5 to 12.5. Yes. Thanks, Rod. So we have seen strength in volume -- pricing due to the volume that we can produce as an industry and us at Ford relative to the demand that we're seeing out there. So that has been a tailwind. In the quarter, we did see quite a bit of a tailwind from mix as well.  Affordability is something that we keep in front of us all the time with the credit company, and we're very thoughtful about where it's headed from the standpoint to the consumer, what's affordable, et cetera. But we have not seen demand come off at this point. But we have -- as we increase volumes through the second half of the year as some of the chip constraints ease and we see a better rate and flow, we do have provisioned in our second half incentives increasing as volumes come back. And we've always said that the relationship between volume and pricing is going to remain dynamic.  And so I think what you'll see is as volume comes back, you will see some pricing get back. You will see prices come down some. Question for all of us is how are we going to manage stocks? How are we going to move to the build-to-order process? How are we going to change the dynamics and not have as much of a push system and have more of a natural demand system and fulfilling that demand on a timely basis? So I think that's the question for all of us, and we need to maintain discipline as we head into an environment where we could potentially see demand come off and/or we start to have higher supply, and therefore, prices will come well.  But remember, following up on what Adam just said in the dealer margins, we still have -- across the industry, dealer margins need to come down first from a pricing standpoint, right? We did -- as we've talked about in the past, we took an action, which reduced floor plan for the dealers, which was a form of pricing for us. But overall, it's still inflated. And I'd estimate somewhere between $1,300 to $1,700 of dealer margin compression is to come off first from a pricing standpoint. No, there wasn't anything unusual, Rod. I'll start with that. It's across the board. It's in the areas you would expect, material cost going up. We're seeing increases in freight. It's just across the board, and it's driven by the inflationary pressures we're seeing across the board in the economy. Nothing unusual. No. In segmentation reporting, you'll see exactly where we're at between the 5 businesses. And Emmanuel, we know how important that is. So when we have our Capital Markets Day early next year, we'll unpack that in more detail, as Jim said, where we can spend some time on it and go through it and give it to do justice. Yes. So Emmanuel, we spent a lot of time on this, as you would expect us to be doing, modeling scenarios, looking at what that means for the business, looking at what we should be doing today to get out in front of any these types of issues if a recession were to come. But the way we're thinking about it is if you step back and look at where we're at today relative to where we've been as a company, heading into any -- what could be a potential downturn, right, we're in much better shape. You mentioned it from a demand standpoint. We have 3 years of pent-up demand, and we have a very strong product lineup. And so that's a positive.  We're also at a point right now where incentives are low, right? They're in the single digits versus what normally, at this point in the cycle, we'd probably be in high teens. And so of course, as volume or demand comes off, there will be some pricing that will need to be given back. And that's a bit of a release valve, if you will. But it's really important for us to be thoughtful about that, not only Ford, but as an industry.  And then the other thing I would say, and I mentioned it in my remarks, our business is very different than what it was in the past. Our ICE product, clearly, it's more -- our lineup is more profitable as we've exited unprofitable vehicles. But we've de-risked the overall business. We restructured our markets overseas. And I think a great proof point for that is the fact that between '18 and '21, we burned through $9 billion of free cash flow overseas. We're not in that position now. And we do expect this year, we're projecting that our overseas markets will be free cash flow positive. So we're just in a completely different position. We're modeling it. We're looking at it. We're getting out in front of things, as Jim said, that we can today. But it's a new day every day. But that's how we're thinking about it. We're clear-eyed. We understand what we're facing. We understand what could potentially be in front of us, and now we need to work it. Yes. So Colin, let me clarify. It's really hard to hear you. It's quite static-y. But Ford Credit will be about $3 billion in total profits for the year. So that'll be down half over half. So that's a headwind. And the inflationary costs on a half over half are a headwind. And so when you walk through it, yes, there will be some volume. We said that volumes in the second half will be up roughly in the low 20 percentage range versus the first half. And so you've got some mix improvement as well. So volume and pricing and mix are the tailwinds. A little bit of a tailwind on commodities, but the headwinds are FMCC profits. They'll be down. We've got the inflationary pressures we talked about, will be an increase in the second half. We also have exchange that's hitting us in the second half relative to the first half. So that's a headwind as well. And then we had some onetimers in the second quarter that aren't going to repeat.  And of course, we're going to continue to invest in the business. So there's going to be spending-related costs. There's going to be connectivity costs that will be increasing as well as we invest. So those are the puts and takes. Those are the tailwinds and the headwinds as you look at it from a half-over-half basis. And I hope that helps clarify things. So we had -- it's $1 billion higher than what we had talked about previously, Joe. So we're looking at about $3 billion for the year, and that's part of what we're doing. We're working to offset those inflationary costs, and that's something that we need to continue to work through. We're not all the way there, of course, but we're working on it, and we do have the rest of the year to go, and it is a significant focus of our team, as we've talked about. But the cost efforts are a significant focus of the team as we remake the company in Ford+. So that's a really important part of what we're doing. And so it's $3 billion for the year. We had said $2 billion. We've seen about another $1 billion come through, and it's across the board. Yes. I think we do see it coming off some. Part of what complicates the commodity situation is as we go through in a year, we lock into contracts, and they roll. That protects us on the [indiscernible] when prices are increasing some, but it also has a lag effect when prices are coming down some. And so we'll have to deal with that as we run through the year as well.  And so I think, really, it's going to depend on what happens with the overall macroeconomic environment. If we do see us tripping into more of a recessionary period, we should see those fall quicker like we have in the past. If not, I think that they'll come down more moderately. So we're planning and looking at both of those scenarios from a spot standpoint. It is good news as we roll through next year, but you can't just take that spot good news and roll it through everything because we do have contracts that were locked into on a rolling basis through the year. Yes. So 53,000 entering the quarter. The team did a good job on the drawdown. We're down to 18,000 at the end of the quarter, and we'll work to get those out over the second half of the year as we can free up the chips that impacted us.  I think when you look at the volumes, in the second quarter, we saw an increase in volumes in North America, which helped drive the strong performance for North America. When you look at the second half, as we said, volumes would be up in the low 20% range compared with the first half. But that volume growth -- there's greater volume growth in the overseas markets in the second half than in North America. We have the Ranger launching in IMG. We have volume in the second half growing at a quicker rate in Europe. And then, of course, China was significantly depressed from a volume standpoint in the second quarter due to the shutdown. And so that's what will be happening from a standpoint.  But when you look at the volumes for Q3, they'll be lower than they will be in Q4 because in Q4, we should see the rate fall, the chips improve as we go through the third quarter into the fourth quarter. So that's how the volume is framing up in the second half relative to the first half, and then the walk from Q2 into Q3. So volume and mix in Q3 -- Q3 is going to be less than Q2, right? It's not going to be as strong as Q2. We have a couple of things hitting us in Q3. Volume and mix, most of the volume growth in Q3 relative to Q2 is going to be in Europe and China. And then we still have commodity costs hitting us, and we're investing in connectivity. And our spending will -- in the third quarter, Ford Credit, of course, as the second half is lower than the first half. You see that come through in the third quarter. And then we have the nonrepeat of the onetimers I talked about in the second quarter. So third quarter will be down compared to the second quarter. Volume increases will be overseas. And then as we get to the fourth quarter, volume in the fourth quarter on a sequential basis will be better than the third quarter."

At this time, I would like to welcome you to the Ford Motor Company First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the call over to Lynn Antipas Tyson, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Please, go ahead. \nLynn Antipas Tyson: Thank you, Andrea. Welcome to Ford Motor Company's first quarter 2022 earnings call. With me today are Jim Farley, our President and CEO; and John Lawler, our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us for Q&A is Marion Harris, CEO of Ford Credit; Hau Thai-Tang, Chief Industrial Platform Officer; and Doug Field, Chief EV and Digital Systems Officer, Ford Model e. Today's discussions include some non-GAAP references. These are reconciled to the most comparable US GAAP measures in the appendix of our earnings deck. You can find the deck along with the rest of our earnings materials and other important content at shareholder.ford.com. Today's discussions also include forward-looking statements about our expectations. Actual results may differ from those stated. The most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ are included on page 28. Unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year-over-year. Company EBIT, EPS and free cash flow are on an adjusted basis and product mix is volume weighted. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim.\nJim Farley: Hello, everyone. Thank you, Lynn, and thanks for joining our first quarter 2022 earnings call. Yesterday, I was with Bill Ford and our incredible team at the Rouge factory, where my grandfather worked, to celebrate Job One for the F-150 Lightning. We were also proud as a team for delivering a truly breakthrough electric truck and delivering it on time as a launch. The excitement around the truck is like nothing I've ever seen in my career. In fact the power went out in the facility and we ran most of the presentation with F-150 Pro Power Onboard. While we have work ahead to fully scale production and fill an extraordinary order bank, both for our retail Lightning customers and Ford Pro, make no mistake, this is a very important moment for us at Ford. We're accelerating our significant transformation. We have the right plan called Ford+. We are putting in place the right organization. As you know on March 2, we announced our plan to form two distinct, but interdependent business units called Ford Model e and Ford Blue. Together with Ford Pro, these three automotive businesses allow us to clearly define and assign priorities, make the most of our existing strengths, but also build new strategic muscles and most importantly capabilities. Ford Model e is responsible for delivering clean sheet breakthrough EV designs, software advanced electric architectures, partial autonomy. And Ford Blue's mission is to deliver a more vibrant and profitable ICE business, a business that's going to serve in the short term as our profit and cash engine for the entire enterprise. So what have we learned since March 2? And what are we working on at Ford? In terms of Model e, first, it's very clear to us that battery capacity is the key unlock to our EV aspirations and propel our growth in the future. We're in good shape in the near term. In the medium and long term, securing raw materials, processing precursor and refinement and setting up battery production here in the US and around the world is a big work statement for us. Expect a lot of news from Ford in the future related to the vertical integration of our EV business. Second, we're getting after our talent gap in key areas, EV engineering, software and autonomous driving technology. We have a very good start already and we will continually be very aggressive on recruiting talent. Third, we're now deep into discussions with our dealer partners around the globe, but especially in North America on brand new standards that are required to launch a completely different customer experience that is leaner and better for our customers that we believe will not only be competitive, but superior to a solely direct model. We're drifting standards as we speak and plan to roll this out this year. Finally, we're crafting our EV future product pipeline and are focused on a small number of highly compelling, highly volume models in key segments where we already lead. I want to make this very clear. Some companies seem to be pursuing a strategy of trying to match model-wise volume with eight or nine top hats. That's not a winning plan in our view. We will focus on key volume nameplates, constrained capital, because we have it, but really to leverage scale and efficiency to reach and eventually exceed our 8% EBIT target for EVs. I want to be clear here that as we move forward, our EV designs will be progressive and they're going to be aimed at bringing new customers to Ford and Lincoln. They will not be electric versions of our existing lineup. Now in terms of Ford Blue, we will accelerate our restructuring and address our uncompetitive cost structure. We're going to attack complexity in areas such as powertrain. We can't wait. This work starts now. We will continue to invest in our ICE business, but in targeted ways to build our most popular and profitable vehicle lines, F-Series, Bronco, Super Duty and a few others. Another focus is quality. We made good progress on initial quality and launches. However, we continue to be hampered by recalls and customer satisfaction actions. This has to change. We must do more to aggressively address our engineering process and improve our robustness. Now, our Ford Pro business is on track. We see healthy growth in parts sales, mechanic repairs, growth in subscriptions for both charging and telematics and CV financing. Most importantly, we're making our customers' lives and businesses better. They're using data. They're improving their uptime and their bottom line. Supply chain constraints continue to impact our business, including some of our key profit pillars. That said, we're making progress on launching and scaling new products as you can see with Lighting. That said, our major focus now is accelerating a more fundamental change in our supply chain management to improve visibility through our entire value chain and secure supply, especially in places like semis and batteries. We're absolutely committed to unlocking value by improving our growth profile, our profitability and ability to generate sustainable cash flows from our automotive-related businesses. Our new targets include producing more than 2 million EVs in four short years by the end of 2026. That's about 70-plus CAGR. And we expect that by 2030 EVs will account for about 50% of our global sales. We have also reset our profit ambition. We are now targeting 10% company-adjusted EBIT margins by 2026. Now in terms of the first quarter, I would describe our performance as mixed. The appeal of our new products is really clear and customers demand is extremely strong, beyond the supply constraint of our industry. However, we are still grappling with persistent supply chain issues that prevent us from posting even stronger quarter. We're working to break constraints, whenever they exist to take full advantage of this incredibly hot product lineup. Both new EVs like the F-150 Lightning, but our iconic ICE vehicles as well. We remain committed to delivering our targets quarter-after-quarter, year-after-year earning your confidence along the way. And now, I'd like to turn it to John to take you through the quarter and our outlook this year.\nJohn Lawler: Thank you, Jim. In face of ongoing industry-wide supply chain disruption, and unremitting pandemic hurdles, we continued to execute against our Ford+ plan, including strengthening our product portfolio, investing in electrification, and other new and exciting opportunities fundamental to growth and value creation. In the first quarter, we generated $2.3 billion in adjusted EBIT, resulting in a margin of 6.7%. The year-over-year decline in total company profits was driven by higher commodity prices and lower volume and mix, partially offset by higher net pricing as we take top line pricing, while remaining disciplined with our incentive spend. Importantly, our operations outside of North America were profitable. Global wholesales were down 9%, consistent with our guidance and reflecting the continued supply chain issues. However, our run rate of vehicle production in North America improved significantly during the month of March, and we ended the quarter with an extremely healthy order bank. In fact, in the US alone, our order bank is primed to deliver about $17 billion in revenue. Ford Credit delivered another strong quarter. EBT was $900 million, reflecting strong lease residuals, and credit loss performance. Free cash flow was $600 million negative more than explained by unfavorable timing differences, and working capital deterioration due to the higher inventory levels, which included about 53,000 vehicles on wheels completed, but awaiting installation of components affected by the semiconductor supply shortage. We ended the quarter with strong cash and liquidity nearly $29 billion and $45 billion respectively. This includes our stake in Rivian, which was valued at $5.1 billion at the end of the quarter. Our strong balance sheet provides a solid foundation to continue investing in our Ford+ priorities. Now let me briefly touch on business unit performance for the quarter. North America delivered $1.6 billion of EBIT with a margin of 7.1%. Now this is down year-over-year as net pricing improvements were more than offset by higher commodity costs, higher warranty expense, unfavorable mix and lower volume. The volume and mix impact primarily reflects supply constraints unique to full-size pickups in large utilities. South America continues to benefit from our global redesign efforts delivering its third consecutive profitable quarter and its highest quarterly EBIT margin in over 10 years. The region continues to focus on scaling its business for growth, especially, pickup trucks and commercial vehicles. In Europe, our operations delivered an EBIT margin of 3% despite a 9% decline in volumes. The underlying trajectory of our business continues to improve. However, the adverse impact of the near-term supply chain disruption is dampening our overall results. Importantly, we continue to be the number one commercial vehicle brand in Europe. The transit has an extremely healthy order bank and we recently launched the all-electric E-Transit in Turkey. FORDLive continues to grow helping our commercial customers improve vehicle uptime and ultimately their bottom-line. And finally Mustang Mach-E is now being sold online in most major markets. Europe is building momentum towards a fully electric future expecting to reach 600,000 vehicles by the end of 2026. In China, we posted a moderate loss in the quarter. However, our cost performance improved on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. Lincoln continues to be a bright spot and profit pillar for the region. Market share improved 20 basis points year-over-year and the all-new Zephyr is off to a fast start. In the first quarter China also continued to make progress towards our electrification strategy. We opened 10 more customer experience centers now 35 in total and made other investments to modernize our direct-to-consumer network. Our International Markets Group performed well in the first quarter continuing to be solidly profitable despite supply constraints and suspension of our joint venture operations in Russia. The upcoming launch of the next-generation Ranger remains on track. And in March, we unveiled the next-generation Ranger Raptor and Everest. And finally in Mobility, we continue to make steady progress towards scale commercialization of moving people and moving goods. In the first quarter, we divested our investments in both TransLoc and Spin further rationalizing our portfolio with a focus on autonomous development. And now I'll share with you our current thinking about the remainder of 2022. For the full year our guidance is unchanged. We expect to earn between $11.5 billion and $12.5 billion in adjusted EBIT which is up 15% to 25% from 2021 with adjusted free cash flow of $5.5 billion to $6.5 billion. This reflects year-over-year growth in wholesales of 10% to 15% and assumes that semiconductor availability will improve in the second half including the constraints that adversely impacted our full-size pickups and large utilities in North America in Q1. We also assumed in our guidance that disruptions in the supply chain and local vehicle manufacturing operations resulting from the renewed COVID-related health concerns and lockdowns in China do not further deteriorate our supply chains. Now relative to adjusted EBIT. On a year-over-year basis, our range assumes significantly higher profits in North America and collective profitability outside of North America. We also expect Ford Credit EBT to be strong, but lower than 2021 and mobility and corporate other EBIT to be roughly flat. Other assumptions factored into our guidance include; first, we have a very strong order bank as Jim mentioned for our new iconic products such as Bronco, Bronco Sport, Maverick along with a robust EV lineup Mustang Mach-E, E-Transit, F-150 Lightning now in production as well; second, pent-up demand beyond our order bank, a continued strong pricing environment including the benefit of pricing actions taken in the first quarter and improved mix. The interplay role between volume and pricing will remain dynamic. And third, we expect commodity headwinds of about $4 billion, which we expect to offset by improvements in net pricing and mix. Fourth, we anticipate other inflationary pressures to continue impacting a broad range of costs. We are aggressively looking at all opportunities to offset this reality including aggressively ramping up our efforts on additional cost reductions. And fifth, at Ford Credit, we expect auction values to remain strong as supply constraints persist. However, as I mentioned we anticipate strong but lower EBT reflecting primarily the non-recurrence of reserve release, fewer return off-lease vehicles and more normalized credit losses. Our results in the quarter, our balance-of-year outlook and commitment to our medium-term targets demonstrate the power of our Ford+ plan as we continue to invest aggressively to drive growth and value creation. This includes devoting resources to customer facing technology, connectivity, our always on relationships with customers, and electrification. We are confident the long-term payback from these investments will be substantial. So that wraps up our prepared remarks. We'll use the balance of the time to hear your questions and address what's on your mind. And so thank you. Operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: We\u2019ll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Rod Lache of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nRod Lache: Hi everybody. Thanks for taking my question. First, I wanted to ask you about inflation. Price versus cost is, obviously, a pretty big drag here and I assume that you would expect inflation to stick around for a while. I was hoping you might talk a little bit about how that's influencing your decision-making, your internal messaging. What is in your view going to be the interplay between price and volume as volume and inventory starts to normalize? Is there still pricing power after everything you've achieved over the past couple of years? And does this affect your margin targets?\nJim Farley: Hi, Rod, thank you for your question. Obviously we're seeing on the commodity side steel, aluminum, copper, lithium, nickel. On the logistics side a lot of premium freight. We're seeing pressures on inflation from suppliers. So it's really across the board. I'll let John answer the pricing question, but I would say, we really have quite a bit of pricing we've recently put in the market. It's stuck. And in addition, we feel like we have a lot of cost upside as well in the company. I know that's not your question, but that's an opportunity. John?\nJohn Lawler: Yeah. So, hi, Rod. From a pricing standpoint, so far we have seen pricing just about offset the inflationary pressures that we've seen. And so, we've been aggressive with top line. We've been balanced with the incentives. We do expect the commodity inflation, as Jim said, to continue through the year. So the pricing that we've taken reflects that. And so I would say that, we've been aggressive so far starting last year from a pricing standpoint. I would also say that the dynamic between the volumes and the pricing is going to remain influx. And as we go through the rest of this year and volumes improve, we have assumed that in the second half you would see increased pressure on your incentives and that's assumed in our guidance. I would also say Rod that, right now, many of the dealers are transacting near or above MSRP across the industry. So that has to be a compression that's going to happen first on the pricing front. And we're watching that very closely. We've also taken actions where we can improve our pricing by work we've done with our dealers. So one of the things we did in the quarter is we adjusted our floor plan adjustment to the dealers. In the past we had paid them 1.5% of MSRP to cover the floor plan the carrying cost. And we've adjust that to about 75 days with the actual cost. So the actually cost of 75 day. So that's been a benefit that\u2019s flowing through our pricing as well. So, we see it as dynamic. We do agree that as volumes increase, it will be dynamic relative to incentives. We're not pollyannish about that. We've reflected what we think is appropriate in the second half relative to incentives to adjust for the volume that we see coming in, but we'll also be aggressive on pricing. If commodity -- if commodities keep going up, we'll be aggressive as we can. So I think it's going to be a dynamic play as we go through the rest of the year. I would say though that when we step back and we look at the pricing relative to 2020 model year -- what we've taken since 2020 model year, we'd have to increase incentives considerably to offset that pricing. On a run rate basis, they'd have to move from -- I think we're in single-digits -- today low-single-digits. They have to move up into like 16% -- 15%, 16% to offset that pricing. So -- and that's back at a time when we had extremely high inventories and we had a very push-through process and we're not going to go back to that. We're going to be very disciplined with our inventory. So... \nJim Farley: Percent of revenue.\nJohn Lawler: Yeah, as a percent of revenue. And so, we're working costs. We're working all the angles.\nRod Lache: Thanks for that. And any color on the outlook for Europe for the rest of this year just given all of the macro pressures there? It looks, you've been posting pretty solid results there recently.\nJohn Lawler: Yeah. We expect those results to continue. We were in Europe hampered by the supply chain reductions. But, it was nice to see that even though we were hit by that, Europe did post a better than expected quarter for us. So, we're continuing to do well in commercial vehicles. We launched the E-Transit, which has been very well received. Mustang Mach-E has been very well received as well. So, we do expect the business in Europe to continue to improve in the second half as the rate and flow of supply improves for them as well.\nRod Lache: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from John Murphy of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nJohn Murphy: Good evening, everybody. I just wanted to ask a question sort of on the growth side Jim. I mean the F-150 Lightning orders it sounds like they're mostly incremental buyers folks that haven't been Ford or F-150 buyers before. I'm just curious if you think that is just sort of a surge here at the launch of the truck or is this sort of 15% to 20% sort of incremental orders relative to the base F-150 something you think will stick around? I mean because obviously that's very powerful potentially to your earnings. And do you expect the profitability of this truck over time to have a variable margin that would be similar to the F-150? I think sort of being even a little bit more verbose do you expect the same kind of thing with the 250 350 which you'll launch in two or three years? \nJim Farley: Well, I didn't know we announced that but thank you very much for your question. I'd like to maybe ask Doug to come in here and talk about the levers we have on the profit side. But so far it's very clear to us that the Lightning customers are incremental. And as you said it's early days. We capacitized in the end of the day the facility that we were in is about 80,000 units. We'll almost double that by the end of next year. And I would say at this point the customer profile is dramatically younger. It's in states like California and New York that we normally don't sell full-size trucks. We do have some \u2013 lots of orders in Texas. It's a higher education that we see. And what they're interested in is different about the truck. So I think it's very clearly so far incremental. Now when we get into volume production 150,000 units that may change. And we'll see that with the order as we order \u2013 open the order bank again for the next model year this summer. Doug, do you want to highlight the opportunities you see maybe on F-150 Lightning but more generically on our next product? \nDoug Field: Sure. To start with I'm really excited about what we're building off of in Ford strength. These are cost bases that I'm drooling over in terms of the future products. But when we talk about EV specifically, the first thing we have to do is really control the battery materials and the chemistry there the single largest build materials opportunity of course but the next is really obsessing over how we use those materials and chemistries. Energy efficiency is a religion and the team is really stepping up to this. Every single watt of consumption is now being tracked and optimized. And on the new programs changes in aerodynamics and drive unit optimization we're seeing dozens of miles of improvement in range. That's hundreds and even in some cases thousands of dollars of battery that we can take out. Finally I think really going after a true ground-up approach to how we build EVs. They're different than internal combustion vehicles. And you could take advantage of that and really change the number of \u2013 in our next F-Series EV factory we're going to have on the main line half the stations that we use today to build a Lightning. So I'm very optimistic with this journey that we have some really good ground to make up on margin.\nJim Farley: John...\nJohn Murphy: Actually can I just ask one follow...\nJim Farley: Go ahead. Go ahead John.\nJohn Murphy: No. Keep going Jim. Sorry I had a follow-up on...\nJim Farley: I just want to say on the Super Duty obviously that's a quarter of profitability as a company globally. And when we look at the customer usage, we just don't feel at this point that an electric solution is going to be ideal for most of those customers. So our vehicles will be really focused on light duty and the lower end of Super Duty for sure, but not 250s 350s 450s. That's a whole different ball of wax. They require a lot of [indiscernible]. Heavy batteries that doesn't make sense.\nJohn Murphy: Got it. And I'm sorry, a follow-up on the 53,000 units that are in inventory on wheels. Is that what we're seeing in this 21% increase in inventory on the balance sheet from the fourth quarter to the first quarter? And presumably, the cost has not been accounted for at all here and we'll see those vehicles flush out to the system in the second or third quarter when the chips become available. I'm just trying to understand John Lawler, the economics and what profitability boost may be from these vehicles flowing out. Could you just kind of explain sort of how you're accounting for this and what the benefit might be in the second and third or fourth quarter when they actually are finished?\nJohn Lawler: Yes. So John, that's exactly right. That's what's hitting us from a cash standpoint. And the inventory increases is for the most part the vehicles on wheels at 53,000 units. We have a cost for those in our results, but we have no revenue for them. And as they build out and we complete them in this quarter and into the third quarter, we'll start to get results for that to the bottom line. And then we're primarily are more profitable vehicles and it's primarily F-Series and Explorer. So, there's definitely an opportunity there that will start to roll through the bottom line once we start shipping those out. And the reason why -- one of the reasons why we built those John, because the modifications we need to make, we're very confident, we can do that without compromising quality. But our production is fully subscribed. So we would have lost these units if we hadn't built them and set them aside until the chips are available.\nJohn Murphy: I'm sorry John, the costs are recognized in the first quarter results, but obviously the revenue is not? I'm just trying to understand this because, it sounds like it might have a big impact in sort of people's understanding of the cadence of earnings through the course of the year.\nJohn Lawler: No. The profits aren't recognized in the quarter, right? But the costs, we backed out like for labor et cetera that's been all backed out. That's an inventory.\nJohn Murphy: Okay. Got it. Okay. Thank you, very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Colin Langan of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nColin Langan: Great. Thanks for taking my question. As you mentioned, the EV battery costs have really dramatically increased. Has that changed your EV strategy at all? Do you think, you're going to need to maybe raise the pricing of the Lightning and the Mach-E? And what can you do about it or maybe switch to different chemistries, all out more hybrid? How can you address it if raw materials stay at these very high levels for that -- those battery materials?\nJim Farley: Thank you for your question. Well, first of all, the demand for EVs right now is extremely robust at Ford. So, we have the opportunity we believe for pricing. We're not going to get into those details now. But Doug said something very important, Colin, I want to emphasize, which is battery chemistry. We believe very strongly at Ford. The chemistry we have really key part of our protection against commodity price increases, and frankly, the benefits to the customer. Doug, do you want to add anything? \nDoug Field: No. Ford, a number of years ago started Ion Park, which is a team of experts really focusing on chemistry. Lithium-ion phosphate, of course, we know from the industry is something that takes you away from the dependence on nickel. That will be a part of our battery, and we're also looking chemistries that give us an opportunity to be less dependent on the specific materials that everyone seems to be fighting over in the market.\nJim Farley: So in the short-term, we\u2026\nColin Langan: Can you which two tells us please?\nJim Farley: Go ahead with your question. Sorry, Colin. \nColin Langan: Yes. I was just going to say you mentioned you're able to do LFP or that's in the plan. I mean, how quickly can you switch because nickel is spiked now? I mean, I'm just kind of wondering how flexible and how quick you could adapt to that $2 million target by 2025?\nJim Farley: Yes. We've been working on LFP for quite some time, so let's just leave it at that. What I mean by that is, engineering LFP solutions in our first generation of products something that we see is a big opportunity and to move quickly.\nColin Langan: Got it. And just second question, you mentioned in your comments about warranty costs and that was going to be a big driver of margins. It does look like it was up year-over-year. Is that just sort of a temporary blip in the quarter, or is there a structural issue that we're going to see some higher elevated warranty through the rest of the year? Hello.\nJohn Lawler : Yes. Colin, thanks for the question. When we had our Capital Markets Day event, we signaled that we were targeting $1 billion to $2 billion of warranty opportunity by the mid-decade. In 2021, we delivered $1.4 billion of that. So, roughly 70% of that total opportunity. When you look at Q1 of this year, we had a deterioration. Some of that was just a non-repeat of items that we recognized in 2021 that didn't flow through. This is still a huge opportunity for us. It's the number one priority for us as -- for my team, as a skill team is really focusing on improving quality warranty as well as recall performance not only because of the drag on the business, but more importantly, because of the impact on our customers. So this is something that we're really focused on. And as Jim and others highlighted earlier, it's a huge opportunity for us to eliminate waste within the company and offset some of those commodity and headwind costs that we discussed earlier. \nColin Langan: Got it. Thanks for taking my question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nAdam Jonas: Hey, everybody. Is Lisa Drake on the call?\nJim Farley: No. No. But Doug is here. Okay. I'll pass it on to her.\nAdam Jonas: We've got great people on the call. We're good. First, I noted the Lilac Solutions partnership that's a really, really good call here and a lot of really great things. So we had great job there. If you could imagine that the entire metal and mining industry were listening to this call right now and they really should be. What would your message right now, Jim?\nJim Farley: The message would be we need to work together and find good deals. That's what the message would be that we know what we're looking for. We're focused on lithium and nickel those two. We want to do smart deals that work for them and for us. And number two we want to move some of the processing in North America. And we're willing to invest capital to move the processing precursor work from overseas to North America for a variety of reasons. Doug, would you edit that list? \nDoug Field: No. I think that's the right list. \nAdam Jonas: The right list. And just my follow-up Ford Credit side. You guys are massive extraordinarily well-managed portfolio in a market that at least historically can react to oil shocks and economic pressures of course over time. And we're seeing some pretty crazy changes in the market. Just for the record, any sign of pressure in the portfolio in terms of delinquencies, loan losses basically the strength in the consumer that you so very credibly and powerfully can comment on as an economic indicator for this audience? Thanks.\nMarion Harris: Hi, Adam it's Marion Harris here. The short answer is, no. We're seeing strength in delinquencies. They're up marginally versus last year but still well below anything we've seen. And a lot of that's on the back of strong used car values which we expect to remain strong for some period of time. And you're even getting into the gas price piece of this. One of the things we've been looking at is whether or not there is a change in auction values by segment. And we're not seeing any differences in prices or price movements for large SUVs versus smaller sedans. So the trends continue and we still feel very good about the Credit business. \nAdam Jonas: Thanks, Marion.\nOperator: The next question comes from Dan Levy of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. \nDan Levy: Hi. Good evening. Thank you for taking the question. First question is just on the guidance. So we know you're maintaining the guide of $12.5 billion, but you've also said you're guiding to now $2 billion to $2.5 billion of higher raw mat. Europe is a choppier environment. China is a choppier environment. And then there is also other inflationary pressures that aren't in that raw mat guide. So I just want to understand what is the full set of offset to that. You've talked about price but maybe you could just talk how that compares to maybe other cost offsets that will allow you to maintain your guide despite those incremental headwinds. \nJohn Lawler: Yes. Dan, thanks. So price is the main offset there for the full year pricing offsetting the inflationary pressures that we're seeing. We are being very aggressive in ramping up additional cost efforts because we know that this is not going to -- we don't believe that the pressure on cost due to inflationary pressures is going to ease anytime soon. So we need to find more efficiencies. We need to improve productivity. And Jim and the team and we are working very hard on that. It's a priority for us. So the other thing that we have is in the second half of the year we do have volumes improving based on the better availability of someway as we see that through the system. So that's another big driver for us in the year. And we'll see that in the second half over the first half as that comes online. So Hau, do you want to talk a little bit about how you're seeing that and what we've been doing to manage that?\nHau Thai-Tang: Yeah. Thanks John. So as John mentioned in his remarks in March, we had the highest production run rate that, we've seen frankly in the last couple of quarters. That's the result of a lot of hard work, with all of our suppliers at every level of the value chain to break constraints, ensure that we're getting our fair allocation, as well as expediting freight to pull ahead some of the available supply. In parallel, the design actions that we've taken over the past year to design our way out of some of these constraints are coming online. And if you guys reflect on last year many of our wafer and chip suppliers started implementing capacity actions, and those are also coming on in the back end of the year. So that's what's giving us the increased confidence around the guidance that John highlighted.\nJohn Lawler: And the other thing I would add is that, the demand, as Jim said earlier is very strong for our new products and that's encouraging for us. We just can't build enough of them and we see that demand continuing. Q - Dan Levy And the mix assumption within this?\nJohn Lawler: The mix assumption is that, we'll revert back to a normal run rate mix that we would expect to see. We were disproportionately hit in the first quarter by a commodity module and Hau can talk more about that. He's better to talk about it than I \u2013 than me than I can. And his \u2013 the team has worked through that. So we believe we have that resolved. So we should see a more normal run rate of our mix as we move forward.\nJim Farley: Hau, do you want to comment on that specific comment because I \u2013 commodity, because I think it is really material.\nHau Thai-Tang: Yeah. So we had a wiper module that was deployed on our most profitable vehicle lines as John mentioned our large pickup trucks and utilities in North America. So we had limited ability to do any mix management and flex, with other lower-profit vehicle lines. That issue has been resolved. We've designed our way out of it. And again, we have a line of sight to not only support the back half of the year production, but also address some of vehicle on wheels with that commodity.\nDan Levy: Great. And then my second question is just as we think about the costs that are coming online, I think you've discussed in the past that really in your re-org that Blue is going to be what fund Model E. So in a good market, it's very easy to see how incremental profits from the core combustion business are funding your EV growth. But now that we have more costs that are coming into the system maybe you can give us a sense how you're looking at your growth investments. EV, I assume you're going to invest in that regardless of what the underlying market environment is, but maybe you can give us a sense of are there other growth investments that are maybe more discretionary that you can \u2013 if you need to pull back on or delay. How do you think about other growth investments?\nJim Farley: Our opportunity is really around our cost in our Blue business. That's how we look at it. In terms of investing, we need to invest in a fully networked advanced electric architecture. We need to advance \u2013 we need to invest in Level 2 and Level 3 autonomy. We need to invest in a new portfolio and changing our industrial system over to these electric digital products. We need to invest in our OS software that supports all of that. And we need -- we believe very strongly we need to invest in Level 4 autonomy.  So at this point in time, I don't personally see any discretionary -- our Ford+ plan is so specific about where to invest. That -- at this point in time, our real work that we need to do is to get after these inefficiencies and improve the productivity of our base business. That's really where we're focused. And of course, it's implied that as a management team we need to make these investments as efficiently as we can for all this new technology and growth. I hope that makes sense to you. \nDan Levy: That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. \nOperator: The next question comes from Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. \nMark Delaney: Yes. And good afternoon and thank you very much for taking the question. The first is on the new structure Jim, about two months now since Ford announced the split into the different segments including Ford Blue and Model e. I'm hoping to better understand how employee reception has been. And for Doug Field perhaps specifically maybe you can talk about what is meant for your ability to get the right engineering talent. And are there any anecdotes or data points you can share? \nJim Farley: I think reception has been terrific. We worked hard on this and we were prepared. We know -- we knew kind of what we needed to communicate to the employees and why this is necessary and why it makes sense. So, I think the reception has been good. The proof in the pudding is going to be how this executes. And we're -- that's why I wanted to give an update actually in my comments on what we've done since March 2 and a lot has changed. Doug over to you. \nDoug Field: Thanks. Yes. We did think a lot about this and I had a great partner in Hau to figure out how we were going to take best advantage of Ford's deep capabilities that I have not access to in my prior roles. So, the organization is set up, where Ford Model e can't and doesn't build cars by themselves. We rely on an industrial platform that does great [Technical Difficulty] and Ford Model e contribute software [Technical Difficulty] systems back to Ford Blue. So, there's an interdependency that really helps the team work, I think.  As far as attracting talent, I've been really delighted and surprised by the kind of talent that we can attract from tech. I think there's a certain amount of fatigue in the tech world and a lot of mature products out there. The opportunity to work on high technology, but do it in a brand that is so iconic in the United States and something that is so -- such a rich product like a vehicle is really attracting some great people.  Finally, I think from a talent perspective, Ford Model e is also helping us really dig into the internal team and find great people who can step up take on different kinds of roles, be put in positions of authority and really help drive us forward. There are great people here. \nMark Delaney: That's really helpful. My second question was on the volume outlook for 10% to 15% wholesale growth which the company has maintained even though we've had unfortunately the war and also the new COVID restrictions pop up in China. I'm hoping to better understand how Ford is still managing to that 10% to 15% growth? And to what extent is the company taking incremental actions to find different suppliers that perhaps you hadn't been expecting to have to do? And is it more that you're doing those sorts of things to still do 10% to 15% growth, or is it perhaps more about Ford's suppliers not being overly impacted by these recent events? Thank you.\nJim Farley: Thank you. It really comes down to the commodities -- semiconductor-related commodities that have been hamstringing us. We, obviously, are spending a lot of money on premium freight and other things to work around COVID escalations in China. But really the second half of the year's production increase relates to those. So Hau I don't know if you want to add anything specifically.\nHau Thai-Tang: Yeah. Mark so the two hotspots that you highlighted Ukraine, Russia I think we've done a really good job of managing that and minimizing any large significant production risk mostly because of our global sourcing patterns and we were able to get parts from other areas of the world. In terms of China, we're scaling the Shanghai area. We have about 50 Tier 1 suppliers there. Our focus is on our profit pillar vehicles, and as Jim mentioned really leveraging expedited freight. We've secured fast maritime shipment as well as airlift capacity to protect our suppliers. And then they're just starting to have a white list process to allow suppliers to resume production. So we're working with our teams on the ground in China to help those suppliers get partially operational. So those actions we think will really help us. And as Jim mentioned what's going to be gating us is semiconductors. A lot of these constraints are nested within that. So it comes down to the work that we're doing on the semiconductor supply.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ryan Brinkman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRyan Brinkman: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. As we near the -- I think 180-day lockup expiry on your investment in Rivian, how are you thinking about the options available to you in terms of this investment going forward? Are you maybe more inclined to retain some or all of the stake given the recent decline in Rivian shares? And if you were to monetize it, how are you thinking about the use of any potential proceeds? Could you maybe use them to accelerate your own electrification efforts, or are you maybe already devoting all the resources necessary there? And so would perhaps look to prioritize other opportunities? I don't know maybe shareholder friendly actions. How are you thinking about these options?\nJim Farley: Yeah. Unfortunately at this point, we're not going to comment on Rivian.\nRyan Brinkman: Okay, great. Let me try one on Argo then. I recall you saying on an earlier call that your supportive of Argo AI's potential tapping of public equity. Is there any update you can provide there in terms of where Argo may be with that process, or just what is the latest you're thinking about in terms of their overall strategy and trajectory what has been maybe the early results of some of your trials of robo taxis on the Lyft network or in various cities beyond Miami?\nJim Farley: Thank you. Well, first of all Argo, and Ryan continue to make great progress technically on the SDS for Level 4 autonomy. We're very happy with the technical progress. Number two, we really see maybe different than others Level 2, Level 3 and Level 4 as two distinct products. Yes, Argo could help us with our semi-autonomous capability, but we feel like that would be a big distraction for them, which we do not want them distracted at all. And number three it's taking time. And this is expensive stuff. And so from our standpoint getting access to the capital markets is very critical to give us the flexibility to continue to fund this for many years to come. One thing I would say is we're very focused on partners that would be aligned strategically with Argo, use cases that would be very material in the deployment of Argo's technology. And we're getting more and more interested as a company maybe a bit of a strategic shift on goods movement. It's aligned with our commercial vehicle business and our customers feel they're getting more and more interested in middle mile specifically. I think that's a material update for Argo and hopefully that helps you.\nRyan Brinkman\\: Yes, very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Joseph Spak of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJoseph Spak: Thanks so much. A couple of questions on cash. I noticed CapEx is now $7 billion was -- I think it was $7 billion to $8 billion. Free cash flow the same. EBIT still the same. So, is the delta to maintain the free cash flow working capital? And then while we're on cash, it looks like redesign cash is now $1 billion lower this year versus prior. And I think given the total amount you expect to spend on that is lower now. So, can you just talk about what's going on there?\nJohn Lawler: Sure. On the redesign, there's efficiencies that we're seeing as we work through the redesign across each of the markets that we've restructured. And so you're starting to see that show up. There's also some timing differences in there as well where the work we're doing is let's say taking a bit longer to get to a solution or a final position with some of the counterparties we're working with. And we also announced the fact that we will be selling our [indiscernible] facility to AutoZone and that's going to allow to bring cash into that restructuring that we have there as well for global redesign. So, that's the short of it from that standpoint. The other point I think the question was around -- remind me what it was?\nJoseph Spak: The lower CapEx versus prior.\nJohn Lawler: Yes. Right. So, the lower CapEx--\nJoseph Spak: Lower CapEx versus prior--\nJohn Lawler: Yes. So, the lower CapEx that reflects no change in our intended investment in electrification or our fully networked architecture et cetera. It's just timing differences in this year relative to what we saw at the beginning of the year. So, you can still expect us to continually invest. We have the capital to do that. The balance sheet's strong. So, it doesn't reflect anything on where we see the business heading. It's just timing differences for the most part.\nJoseph Spak: Got it. And then just the follow-up the free cash flow remains the same is a little bit more of a working capital drag then? \nJohn Lawler: Yes, it's more of working capital. Yes. Absolutely.\nJoseph Spak: Okay. And then I think you sort of made it quite clear that the primary driver here of covering some of the higher cost is more advantageous pricing. Can you just parse some of the Ford Credit commentary a little bit? Because I think before you said it was going to be about $1.5 billion lower. And now there's some -- its strong but lower, so some of that also coming from -- some of that makeup, if you will, also coming from Ford Credit?\nMarion Harris: Yes. Joe, its Marion. Let me -- I'll just cover the guidance piece on Ford Credit. We said that the profits will be strong but lower. And that's reflected in the fact that we had large -- larger reserve releases in 2021 than we would expect in 2022. In addition to that, we had a lot more supplemental depreciation releases in 2021 than we would in 2022 related to the lease portfolio.\nJoseph Spak: Did your expectations changed versus what you communicated three months ago there, or this year?\nMarion Harris: No, no. No.\nJoseph Spak: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner of Deutsche Bank. Please, go ahead.\nEmmanuel Rosner: Thank you very much. So John, last quarter you provided a very helpful walk towards the 2022 adjusted EBIT with some of the largest puts and takes. And so, I was hoping you could maybe update some of the buckets here. So, obviously, commodities was expected to be $1.5 billion to $2 billion drag. Now it's $4 billion. What is now the market factors versus the $6 billion from last time? Ford Credit was going to be $1.5 billion balance drag. I seem to understand from the last question that this hasn't changed. Any other changes besides market factors? And can you just quantify that?\nJohn Lawler: Yes. So I think what you see there is exactly that. There's no change to Ford Credit. We are seeing higher inflationary pressures. We are seeing higher top line pricing that's coming through, but we're also working on cost offsets as well. So I think it largely remains what we had talked about last time. We're just seeing higher inflationary pressures and higher pricing flow through.\nEmmanuel Rosner: Okay. So versus the $5.5 billion to $6.5 billion in the volume mix price benefit from last time, we could basically add $2 billion to $2.5 billion to that, which was the pricing offset -- the cost offset?\nJohn Lawler: No. I don't think that it's as high as $2.5 billion, Emmanuel. It's -- there's growth in there, but it's not as high as that. I think that when you look at the walk relative to what we had provided last time, most of the inflationary pressures that we're seeing are being offset by a combination of additional cost reductions, pricing and mix that's flowing through, but it's not as large as that as what you had just indicated.\nEmmanuel Rosner: Okay. On the cost piece of it, the -- are you dialing back or sort of like prioritizing some of the modernization investments, or is that largely left as is for this year?\nJim Farley: No. I mean, our -- absolutely not. I try to make that -- I'll say it twice. We are really excited about our growth opportunity in EVs. We have electric architectures to invest in, shop for OS, we have partial autonomy to invest in, full autonomy to invest in. That's all part of our Ford+ plan. It's essential to our move to always on. We obviously have lots of investments in building out our service portfolio for Ford Pro. We're not holding back on any of that. The cost drivers that we see are things like obviously manufacturing, as we simplify our ICE lineup. And as Doug said, really completely redesign our manufacturing process for EV. We have opportunities in sales and -- marketing and sales opportunity in engineering, as we simplify our lineup and of course warranty and other areas. So I think we're \u2013 we know exactly what we need to do.\nEmmanuel Rosner: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Itay Michaeli of Citi. Please go ahead.\nItay Michaeli: Hi, great. Thanks. Good evening, everybody. Just two quick ones for me and thanks for squeezing me in. First, you did talk about the cadence of earnings before but just hoping we can revisit it in terms of kind of how to think about the adjusted EBIT for the rest of the year and whether there is any bias at this point towards the low end or high end of your full year guidance range. And second more housekeeping question is whether you can provide what you anticipate the Ford Motor Credit dividends to be back up to the parent?\nJim Farley: Yes. I mean we're not going to parse out the guidance. It's 11.5 to 12.5. It's a dynamic environment. We're working to offset all the headwinds and maintain the guidance. But as far as passing out where we sit within the guidance of 11.5 to 12.5.\nJohn Lawler: And then on the dividends the dividends are a function of overall profits and balance sheet size and leverage. And in this case you heard the guidance on profits and into the balance sheet. We don't expect much growth this year just given where we are in the vehicle constraints. So the majority of profits \u2013 we don't have a specific number.\nJim Farley: And I'll just make it really clear on the overall company's automotive performance financial performance. The second half is very critical for us. It's just a very critical time for the company. We have the opportunity to build in volumes we haven't for a while. And we have a lot of great fresh products, a lot of costs coming in the business but second half is really critical for the company.\nItay Michaeli: That\u2019s all very helpful.\nOperator: This concludes the Ford Motor Company First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call.

            "content": "Hi, Adam it's Marion Harris here. The short answer is, no. We're seeing strength in delinquencies. They're up marginally versus last year but still well below anything we've seen. And a lot of that's on the back of strong used car values which we expect to remain strong for some period of time. And you're even getting into the gas price piece of this. One of the things we've been looking at is whether or not there is a change in auction values by segment. And we're not seeing any differences in prices or price movements for large SUVs versus smaller sedans. So the trends continue and we still feel very good about the Credit business. Yes. Joe, its Marion. Let me -- I'll just cover the guidance piece on Ford Credit. We said that the profits will be strong but lower.

            "name": "John Lawler",
            "content": "Thank you, Jim. In face of ongoing industry-wide supply chain disruption, and unremitting pandemic hurdles, we continued to execute against our Ford+ plan, including strengthening our product portfolio, investing in electrification, and other new and exciting opportunities fundamental to growth and value creation. In the first quarter, we generated $2.3 billion in adjusted EBIT, resulting in a margin of 6.7%. The year-over-year decline in total company profits was driven by higher commodity prices and lower volume and mix, partially offset by higher net pricing as we take top line pricing, while remaining disciplined with our incentive spend. Importantly, our operations outside of North America were profitable. Global wholesales were down 9%, consistent with our guidance and reflecting the continued supply chain issues. However, our run rate of vehicle production in North America improved significantly during the month of March, and we ended the quarter with an extremely healthy order bank. In fact, in the US alone, our order bank is primed to deliver about $17 billion in revenue. Ford Credit delivered another strong quarter. EBT was $900 million, reflecting strong lease residuals, and credit loss performance. Free cash flow was $600 million negative more than explained by unfavorable timing differences, and working capital deterioration due to the higher inventory levels, which included about 53,000 vehicles on wheels completed, but awaiting installation of components affected by the semiconductor supply shortage. We ended the quarter with strong cash and liquidity nearly $29 billion and $45 billion respectively. This includes our stake in Rivian, which was valued at $5.1 billion at the end of the quarter. Our strong balance sheet provides a solid foundation to continue investing in our Ford+ priorities. Now let me briefly touch on business unit performance for the quarter. North America delivered $1.6 billion of EBIT with a margin of 7.1%. Now this is down year-over-year as net pricing improvements were more than offset by higher commodity costs, higher warranty expense, unfavorable mix and lower volume. The volume and mix impact primarily reflects supply constraints unique to full-size pickups in large utilities. South America continues to benefit from our global redesign efforts delivering its third consecutive profitable quarter and its highest quarterly EBIT margin in over 10 years. The region continues to focus on scaling its business for growth, especially, pickup trucks and commercial vehicles. In Europe, our operations delivered an EBIT margin of 3% despite a 9% decline in volumes. The underlying trajectory of our business continues to improve. However, the adverse impact of the near-term supply chain disruption is dampening our overall results. Importantly, we continue to be the number one commercial vehicle brand in Europe. The transit has an extremely healthy order bank and we recently launched the all-electric E-Transit in Turkey. FORDLive continues to grow helping our commercial customers improve vehicle uptime and ultimately their bottom-line. And finally Mustang Mach-E is now being sold online in most major markets. Europe is building momentum towards a fully electric future expecting to reach 600,000 vehicles by the end of 2026. In China, we posted a moderate loss in the quarter. However, our cost performance improved on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. Lincoln continues to be a bright spot and profit pillar for the region. Market share improved 20 basis points year-over-year and the all-new Zephyr is off to a fast start. In the first quarter China also continued to make progress towards our electrification strategy. We opened 10 more customer experience centers now 35 in total and made other investments to modernize our direct-to-consumer network. Our International Markets Group performed well in the first quarter continuing to be solidly profitable despite supply constraints and suspension of our joint venture operations in Russia. The upcoming launch of the next-generation Ranger remains on track. And in March, we unveiled the next-generation Ranger Raptor and Everest. And finally in Mobility, we continue to make steady progress towards scale commercialization of moving people and moving goods. In the first quarter, we divested our investments in both TransLoc and Spin further rationalizing our portfolio with a focus on autonomous development. And now I'll share with you our current thinking about the remainder of 2022. For the full year our guidance is unchanged. We expect to earn between $11.5 billion and $12.5 billion in adjusted EBIT which is up 15% to 25% from 2021 with adjusted free cash flow of $5.5 billion to $6.5 billion. This reflects year-over-year growth in wholesales of 10% to 15% and assumes that semiconductor availability will improve in the second half including the constraints that adversely impacted our full-size pickups and large utilities in North America in Q1. We also assumed in our guidance that disruptions in the supply chain and local vehicle manufacturing operations resulting from the renewed COVID-related health concerns and lockdowns in China do not further deteriorate our supply chains. Now relative to adjusted EBIT. On a year-over-year basis, our range assumes significantly higher profits in North America and collective profitability outside of North America. We also expect Ford Credit EBT to be strong, but lower than 2021 and mobility and corporate other EBIT to be roughly flat. Other assumptions factored into our guidance include; first, we have a very strong order bank as Jim mentioned for our new iconic products such as Bronco, Bronco Sport, Maverick along with a robust EV lineup Mustang Mach-E, E-Transit, F-150 Lightning now in production as well; second, pent-up demand beyond our order bank, a continued strong pricing environment including the benefit of pricing actions taken in the first quarter and improved mix. The interplay role between volume and pricing will remain dynamic. And third, we expect commodity headwinds of about $4 billion, which we expect to offset by improvements in net pricing and mix. Fourth, we anticipate other inflationary pressures to continue impacting a broad range of costs. We are aggressively looking at all opportunities to offset this reality including aggressively ramping up our efforts on additional cost reductions. And fifth, at Ford Credit, we expect auction values to remain strong as supply constraints persist. However, as I mentioned we anticipate strong but lower EBT reflecting primarily the non-recurrence of reserve release, fewer return off-lease vehicles and more normalized credit losses. Our results in the quarter, our balance-of-year outlook and commitment to our medium-term targets demonstrate the power of our Ford+ plan as we continue to invest aggressively to drive growth and value creation. This includes devoting resources to customer facing technology, connectivity, our always on relationships with customers, and electrification. We are confident the long-term payback from these investments will be substantial. So that wraps up our prepared remarks. We'll use the balance of the time to hear your questions and address what's on your mind. And so thank you. Operator, please open the line for questions. Yeah. So, hi, Rod. From a pricing standpoint, so far we have seen pricing just about offset the inflationary pressures that we've seen. And so, we've been aggressive with top line. We've been balanced with the incentives. We do expect the commodity inflation, as Jim said, to continue through the year. So the pricing that we've taken reflects that. And so I would say that, we've been aggressive so far starting last year from a pricing standpoint. I would also say that the dynamic between the volumes and the pricing is going to remain influx. And as we go through the rest of this year and volumes improve, we have assumed that in the second half you would see increased pressure on your incentives and that's assumed in our guidance. I would also say Rod that, right now, many of the dealers are transacting near or above MSRP across the industry. So that has to be a compression that's going to happen first on the pricing front. And we're watching that very closely. We've also taken actions where we can improve our pricing by work we've done with our dealers. So one of the things we did in the quarter is we adjusted our floor plan adjustment to the dealers. In the past we had paid them 1.5% of MSRP to cover the floor plan the carrying cost. And we've adjust that to about 75 days with the actual cost. So the actually cost of 75 day. So that's been a benefit that's flowing through our pricing as well. So, we see it as dynamic. We do agree that as volumes increase, it will be dynamic relative to incentives. We're not pollyannish about that. We've reflected what we think is appropriate in the second half relative to incentives to adjust for the volume that we see coming in, but we'll also be aggressive on pricing. If commodity -- if commodities keep going up, we'll be aggressive as we can. So I think it's going to be a dynamic play as we go through the rest of the year. I would say though that when we step back and we look at the pricing relative to 2020 model year -- what we've taken since 2020 model year, we'd have to increase incentives considerably to offset that pricing. On a run rate basis, they'd have to move from -- I think we're in single-digits -- today low-single-digits. They have to move up into like 16% -- 15%, 16% to offset that pricing. So -- and that's back at a time when we had extremely high inventories and we had a very push-through process and we're not going to go back to that. We're going to be very disciplined with our inventory. So... Yeah, as a percent of revenue. And so, we're working costs. We're working all the angles. Yeah. We expect those results to continue. We were in Europe hampered by the supply chain reductions. But, it was nice to see that even though we were hit by that, Europe did post a better than expected quarter for us. So, we're continuing to do well in commercial vehicles. We launched the E-Transit, which has been very well received. Mustang Mach-E has been very well received as well. So, we do expect the business in Europe to continue to improve in the second half as the rate and flow of supply improves for them as well. Yes. So John, that's exactly right. That's what's hitting us from a cash standpoint. And the inventory increases is for the most part the vehicles on wheels at 53,000 units. We have a cost for those in our results, but we have no revenue for them. And as they build out and we complete them in this quarter and into the third quarter, we'll start to get results for that to the bottom line. And then we're primarily are more profitable vehicles and it's primarily F-Series and Explorer. So, there's definitely an opportunity there that will start to roll through the bottom line once we start shipping those out. And the reason why -- one of the reasons why we built those John, because the modifications we need to make, we're very confident, we can do that without compromising quality. But our production is fully subscribed. So we would have lost these units if we hadn't built them and set them aside until the chips are available. No. The profits aren't recognized in the quarter, right? But the costs, we backed out like for labor et cetera that's been all backed out. That's an inventory. Yes. Colin, thanks for the question. When we had our Capital Markets Day event, we signaled that we were targeting $1 billion to $2 billion of warranty opportunity by the mid-decade. In 2021, we delivered $1.4 billion of that. So, roughly 70% of that total opportunity. When you look at Q1 of this year, we had a deterioration. Some of that was just a non-repeat of items that we recognized in 2021 that didn't flow through. This is still a huge opportunity for us. It's the number one priority for us as -- for my team, as a skill team is really focusing on improving quality warranty as well as recall performance not only because of the drag on the business, but more importantly, because of the impact on our customers. So this is something that we're really focused on. And as Jim and others highlighted earlier, it's a huge opportunity for us to eliminate waste within the company and offset some of those commodity and headwind costs that we discussed earlier. Yes. Dan, thanks. So price is the main offset there for the full year pricing offsetting the inflationary pressures that we're seeing. We are being very aggressive in ramping up additional cost efforts because we know that this is not going to -- we don't believe that the pressure on cost due to inflationary pressures is going to ease anytime soon. So we need to find more efficiencies. We need to improve productivity. And Jim and the team and we are working very hard on that. It's a priority for us. So the other thing that we have is in the second half of the year we do have volumes improving based on the better availability of someway as we see that through the system. So that's another big driver for us in the year. And we'll see that in the second half over the first half as that comes online. So Hau, do you want to talk a little bit about how you're seeing that and what we've been doing to manage that? And the other thing I would add is that, the demand, as Jim said earlier is very strong for our new products and that's encouraging for us. We just can't build enough of them and we see that demand continuing. Q - Dan Levy And the mix assumption within this? The mix assumption is that, we'll revert back to a normal run rate mix that we would expect to see. We were disproportionately hit in the first quarter by a commodity module and Hau can talk more about that. He's better to talk about it than I \u2013 than me than I can. And his \u2013 the team has worked through that. So we believe we have that resolved. So we should see a more normal run rate of our mix as we move forward. Sure. On the redesign, there's efficiencies that we're seeing as we work through the redesign across each of the markets that we've restructured. And so you're starting to see that show up. There's also some timing differences in there as well where the work we're doing is let's say taking a bit longer to get to a solution or a final position with some of the counterparties we're working with. And we also announced the fact that we will be selling our [indiscernible] facility to AutoZone and that's going to allow to bring cash into that restructuring that we have there as well for global redesign. So, that's the short of it from that standpoint. The other point I think the question was around -- remind me what it was? Yes. Right. So, the lower CapEx-- Yes. So, the lower CapEx that reflects no change in our intended investment in electrification or our fully networked architecture et cetera. It's just timing differences in this year relative to what we saw at the beginning of the year. So, you can still expect us to continually invest. We have the capital to do that. The balance sheet's strong. So, it doesn't reflect anything on where we see the business heading. It's just timing differences for the most part. Yes, it's more of working capital. Yes. Absolutely. Yes. So I think what you see there is exactly that. There's no change to Ford Credit. We are seeing higher inflationary pressures. We are seeing higher top line pricing that's coming through, but we're also working on cost offsets as well. So I think it largely remains what we had talked about last time. We're just seeing higher inflationary pressures and higher pricing flow through. No. I don't think that it's as high as $2.5 billion, Emmanuel. It's -- there's growth in there, but it's not as high as that. I think that when you look at the walk relative to what we had provided last time, most of the inflationary pressures that we're seeing are being offset by a combination of additional cost reductions, pricing and mix that's flowing through, but it's not as large as that as what you had just indicated. And then on the dividends the dividends are a function of overall profits and balance sheet size and leverage. And in this case you heard the guidance on profits and into the balance sheet. We don't expect much growth this year just given where we are in the vehicle constraints. So the majority of profits \u2013 we don't have a specific number."

            "name": "Doug Field",
            "content": "Sure. To start with I'm really excited about what we're building off of in Ford strength. These are cost bases that I'm drooling over in terms of the future products. But when we talk about EV specifically, the first thing we have to do is really control the battery materials and the chemistry there the single largest build materials opportunity of course but the next is really obsessing over how we use those materials and chemistries. Energy efficiency is a religion and the team is really stepping up to this. Every single watt of consumption is now being tracked and optimized. And on the new programs changes in aerodynamics and drive unit optimization we're seeing dozens of miles of improvement in range. That's hundreds and even in some cases thousands of dollars of battery that we can take out. Finally I think really going after a true ground-up approach to how we build EVs. They're different than internal combustion vehicles. And you could take advantage of that and really change the number of \u2013 in our next F-Series EV factory we're going to have on the main line half the stations that we use today to build a Lightning. So I'm very optimistic with this journey that we have some really good ground to make up on margin. No. Ford, a number of years ago started Ion Park, which is a team of experts really focusing on chemistry. Lithium-ion phosphate, of course, we know from the industry is something that takes you away from the dependence on nickel. That will be a part of our battery, and we're also looking chemistries that give us an opportunity to be less dependent on the specific materials that everyone seems to be fighting over in the market. No. I think that's the right list. Thanks. Yes. We did think a lot about this and I had a great partner in Hau to figure out how we were going to take best advantage of Ford's deep capabilities that I have not access to in my prior roles. So, the organization is set up, where Ford Model e can't and doesn't build cars by themselves. We rely on an industrial platform that does great [Technical Difficulty] and Ford Model e contribute software [Technical Difficulty] systems back to Ford Blue. So, there's an interdependency that really helps the team work, I think.  As far as attracting talent, I've been really delighted and surprised by the kind of talent that we can attract from tech. I think there's a certain amount of fatigue in the tech world and a lot of mature products out there. The opportunity to work on high technology, but do it in a brand that is so iconic in the United States and something that is so -- such a rich product like a vehicle is really attracting some great people.  Finally, I think from a talent perspective, Ford Model e is also helping us really dig into the internal team and find great people who can step up take on different kinds of roles, be put in positions of authority and really help drive us forward. There are great people here."

            "name": "Jim Farley",
            "content": "Hello, everyone. Thank you, Lynn, and thanks for joining our first quarter 2022 earnings call. Yesterday, I was with Bill Ford and our incredible team at the Rouge factory, where my grandfather worked, to celebrate Job One for the F-150 Lightning. We were also proud as a team for delivering a truly breakthrough electric truck and delivering it on time as a launch. The excitement around the truck is like nothing I've ever seen in my career. In fact the power went out in the facility and we ran most of the presentation with F-150 Pro Power Onboard. While we have work ahead to fully scale production and fill an extraordinary order bank, both for our retail Lightning customers and Ford Pro, make no mistake, this is a very important moment for us at Ford. We're accelerating our significant transformation. We have the right plan called Ford+. We are putting in place the right organization. As you know on March 2, we announced our plan to form two distinct, but interdependent business units called Ford Model e and Ford Blue. Together with Ford Pro, these three automotive businesses allow us to clearly define and assign priorities, make the most of our existing strengths, but also build new strategic muscles and most importantly capabilities. Ford Model e is responsible for delivering clean sheet breakthrough EV designs, software advanced electric architectures, partial autonomy. And Ford Blue's mission is to deliver a more vibrant and profitable ICE business, a business that's going to serve in the short term as our profit and cash engine for the entire enterprise. So what have we learned since March 2? And what are we working on at Ford? In terms of Model e, first, it's very clear to us that battery capacity is the key unlock to our EV aspirations and propel our growth in the future. We're in good shape in the near term. In the medium and long term, securing raw materials, processing precursor and refinement and setting up battery production here in the US and around the world is a big work statement for us. Expect a lot of news from Ford in the future related to the vertical integration of our EV business. Second, we're getting after our talent gap in key areas, EV engineering, software and autonomous driving technology. We have a very good start already and we will continually be very aggressive on recruiting talent. Third, we're now deep into discussions with our dealer partners around the globe, but especially in North America on brand new standards that are required to launch a completely different customer experience that is leaner and better for our customers that we believe will not only be competitive, but superior to a solely direct model. We're drifting standards as we speak and plan to roll this out this year. Finally, we're crafting our EV future product pipeline and are focused on a small number of highly compelling, highly volume models in key segments where we already lead. I want to make this very clear. Some companies seem to be pursuing a strategy of trying to match model-wise volume with eight or nine top hats. That's not a winning plan in our view. We will focus on key volume nameplates, constrained capital, because we have it, but really to leverage scale and efficiency to reach and eventually exceed our 8% EBIT target for EVs. I want to be clear here that as we move forward, our EV designs will be progressive and they're going to be aimed at bringing new customers to Ford and Lincoln. They will not be electric versions of our existing lineup. Now in terms of Ford Blue, we will accelerate our restructuring and address our uncompetitive cost structure. We're going to attack complexity in areas such as powertrain. We can't wait. This work starts now. We will continue to invest in our ICE business, but in targeted ways to build our most popular and profitable vehicle lines, F-Series, Bronco, Super Duty and a few others. Another focus is quality. We made good progress on initial quality and launches. However, we continue to be hampered by recalls and customer satisfaction actions. This has to change. We must do more to aggressively address our engineering process and improve our robustness. Now, our Ford Pro business is on track. We see healthy growth in parts sales, mechanic repairs, growth in subscriptions for both charging and telematics and CV financing. Most importantly, we're making our customers' lives and businesses better. They're using data. They're improving their uptime and their bottom line. Supply chain constraints continue to impact our business, including some of our key profit pillars. That said, we're making progress on launching and scaling new products as you can see with Lighting. That said, our major focus now is accelerating a more fundamental change in our supply chain management to improve visibility through our entire value chain and secure supply, especially in places like semis and batteries. We're absolutely committed to unlocking value by improving our growth profile, our profitability and ability to generate sustainable cash flows from our automotive-related businesses. Our new targets include producing more than 2 million EVs in four short years by the end of 2026. That's about 70-plus CAGR. And we expect that by 2030 EVs will account for about 50% of our global sales. We have also reset our profit ambition. We are now targeting 10% company-adjusted EBIT margins by 2026. Now in terms of the first quarter, I would describe our performance as mixed. The appeal of our new products is really clear and customers demand is extremely strong, beyond the supply constraint of our industry. However, we are still grappling with persistent supply chain issues that prevent us from posting even stronger quarter. We're working to break constraints, whenever they exist to take full advantage of this incredibly hot product lineup. Both new EVs like the F-150 Lightning, but our iconic ICE vehicles as well. We remain committed to delivering our targets quarter-after-quarter, year-after-year earning your confidence along the way. And now, I'd like to turn it to John to take you through the quarter and our outlook this year. Hi, Rod, thank you for your question. Obviously we're seeing on the commodity side steel, aluminum, copper, lithium, nickel. On the logistics side a lot of premium freight. We're seeing pressures on inflation from suppliers. So it's really across the board. I'll let John answer the pricing question, but I would say, we really have quite a bit of pricing we've recently put in the market. It's stuck. And in addition, we feel like we have a lot of cost upside as well in the company. I know that's not your question, but that's an opportunity. John? Percent of revenue. Well, I didn't know we announced that but thank you very much for your question. I'd like to maybe ask Doug to come in here and talk about the levers we have on the profit side. But so far it's very clear to us that the Lightning customers are incremental. And as you said it's early days. We capacitized in the end of the day the facility that we were in is about 80,000 units. We'll almost double that by the end of next year. And I would say at this point the customer profile is dramatically younger. It's in states like California and New York that we normally don't sell full-size trucks. We do have some \u2013 lots of orders in Texas. It's a higher education that we see. And what they're interested in is different about the truck. So I think it's very clearly so far incremental. Now when we get into volume production 150,000 units that may change. And we'll see that with the order as we order \u2013 open the order bank again for the next model year this summer. Doug, do you want to highlight the opportunities you see maybe on F-150 Lightning but more generically on our next product? John... Go ahead. Go ahead John. I just want to say on the Super Duty obviously that's a quarter of profitability as a company globally. And when we look at the customer usage, we just don't feel at this point that an electric solution is going to be ideal for most of those customers. So our vehicles will be really focused on light duty and the lower end of Super Duty for sure, but not 250s 350s 450s. That's a whole different ball of wax. They require a lot of [indiscernible]. Heavy batteries that doesn't make sense. Thank you for your question. Well, first of all, the demand for EVs right now is extremely robust at Ford. So, we have the opportunity we believe for pricing. We're not going to get into those details now. But Doug said something very important, Colin, I want to emphasize, which is battery chemistry. We believe very strongly at Ford. The chemistry we have really key part of our protection against commodity price increases, and frankly, the benefits to the customer. Doug, do you want to add anything? So in the short-term, we... Go ahead with your question. Sorry, Colin. Yes. We've been working on LFP for quite some time, so let's just leave it at that. What I mean by that is, engineering LFP solutions in our first generation of products something that we see is a big opportunity and to move quickly. No. No. But Doug is here. Okay. I'll pass it on to her. The message would be we need to work together and find good deals. That's what the message would be that we know what we're looking for. We're focused on lithium and nickel those two. We want to do smart deals that work for them and for us. And number two we want to move some of the processing in North America. And we're willing to invest capital to move the processing precursor work from overseas to North America for a variety of reasons. Doug, would you edit that list? Hau, do you want to comment on that specific comment because I \u2013 commodity, because I think it is really material. Our opportunity is really around our cost in our Blue business. That's how we look at it. In terms of investing, we need to invest in a fully networked advanced electric architecture. We need to advance \u2013 we need to invest in Level 2 and Level 3 autonomy. We need to invest in a new portfolio and changing our industrial system over to these electric digital products. We need to invest in our OS software that supports all of that. And we need -- we believe very strongly we need to invest in Level 4 autonomy.  So at this point in time, I don't personally see any discretionary -- our Ford+ plan is so specific about where to invest. That -- at this point in time, our real work that we need to do is to get after these inefficiencies and improve the productivity of our base business. That's really where we're focused. And of course, it's implied that as a management team we need to make these investments as efficiently as we can for all this new technology and growth. I hope that makes sense to you. I think reception has been terrific. We worked hard on this and we were prepared. We know -- we knew kind of what we needed to communicate to the employees and why this is necessary and why it makes sense. So, I think the reception has been good. The proof in the pudding is going to be how this executes. And we're -- that's why I wanted to give an update actually in my comments on what we've done since March 2 and a lot has changed. Doug over to you. Thank you. It really comes down to the commodities -- semiconductor-related commodities that have been hamstringing us. We, obviously, are spending a lot of money on premium freight and other things to work around COVID escalations in China. But really the second half of the year's production increase relates to those. So Hau I don't know if you want to add anything specifically. Yeah. Unfortunately at this point, we're not going to comment on Rivian. Thank you. Well, first of all Argo, and Ryan continue to make great progress technically on the SDS for Level 4 autonomy. We're very happy with the technical progress. Number two, we really see maybe different than others Level 2, Level 3 and Level 4 as two distinct products. Yes, Argo could help us with our semi-autonomous capability, but we feel like that would be a big distraction for them, which we do not want them distracted at all. And number three it's taking time. And this is expensive stuff. And so from our standpoint getting access to the capital markets is very critical to give us the flexibility to continue to fund this for many years to come. One thing I would say is we're very focused on partners that would be aligned strategically with Argo, use cases that would be very material in the deployment of Argo's technology. And we're getting more and more interested as a company maybe a bit of a strategic shift on goods movement. It's aligned with our commercial vehicle business and our customers feel they're getting more and more interested in middle mile specifically. I think that's a material update for Argo and hopefully that helps you. No. I mean, our -- absolutely not. I try to make that -- I'll say it twice. We are really excited about our growth opportunity in EVs. We have electric architectures to invest in, shop for OS, we have partial autonomy to invest in, full autonomy to invest in. That's all part of our Ford+ plan. It's essential to our move to always on. We obviously have lots of investments in building out our service portfolio for Ford Pro. We're not holding back on any of that. The cost drivers that we see are things like obviously manufacturing, as we simplify our ICE lineup. And as Doug said, really completely redesign our manufacturing process for EV. We have opportunities in sales and -- marketing and sales opportunity in engineering, as we simplify our lineup and of course warranty and other areas. So I think we're \u2013 we know exactly what we need to do. Yes. I mean we're not going to parse out the guidance. It's 11.5 to 12.5. It's a dynamic environment. We're working to offset all the headwinds and maintain the guidance. But as far as passing out where we sit within the guidance of 11.5 to 12.5. And I'll just make it really clear on the overall company's automotive performance financial performance. The second half is very critical for us. It's just a very critical time for the company. We have the opportunity to build in volumes we haven't for a while. And we have a lot of great fresh products, a lot of costs coming in the business but second half is really critical for the company."

            "name": "Hau Thai-Tang",
            "content": "Yeah. Thanks John. So as John mentioned in his remarks in March, we had the highest production run rate that, we've seen frankly in the last couple of quarters. That's the result of a lot of hard work, with all of our suppliers at every level of the value chain to break constraints, ensure that we're getting our fair allocation, as well as expediting freight to pull ahead some of the available supply. In parallel, the design actions that we've taken over the past year to design our way out of some of these constraints are coming online. And if you guys reflect on last year many of our wafer and chip suppliers started implementing capacity actions, and those are also coming on in the back end of the year. So that's what's giving us the increased confidence around the guidance that John highlighted. Yeah. So we had a wiper module that was deployed on our most profitable vehicle lines as John mentioned our large pickup trucks and utilities in North America. So we had limited ability to do any mix management and flex, with other lower-profit vehicle lines. That issue has been resolved. We've designed our way out of it. And again, we have a line of sight to not only support the back half of the year production, but also address some of vehicle on wheels with that commodity. Yeah. Mark so the two hotspots that you highlighted Ukraine, Russia I think we've done a really good job of managing that and minimizing any large significant production risk mostly because of our global sourcing patterns and we were able to get parts from other areas of the world. In terms of China, we're scaling the Shanghai area. We have about 50 Tier 1 suppliers there. Our focus is on our profit pillar vehicles, and as Jim mentioned really leveraging expedited freight. We've secured fast maritime shipment as well as airlift capacity to protect our suppliers. And then they're just starting to have a white list process to allow suppliers to resume production. So we're working with our teams on the ground in China to help those suppliers get partially operational. So those actions we think will really help us. And as Jim mentioned what's going to be gating us is semiconductors. A lot of these constraints are nested within that. So it comes down to the work that we're doing on the semiconductor supply."

Jim, I'll turn the call over to you.\nJim Farley: Thank you, Lynn. And hi, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Last year turned out to be a fundamental year, a foundational year for our company. We launched some amazing [Technical Difficulty]\nOperator: Pardon me, this is the conference operator. We've seen that we've lost audio from the speakers location. Please stand by as we regain the signal. Pardon me, this is the conference operator. We have rejoined the audio with the main speaker location. Sir please continue.\nJim Farley: Hi, everyone. I'm not sure where we got cut off but I want to just highlight how important last year was not only financially but a foundational year for our team. Our power choice and our powertrains really came through, and you can really see that on the F-Series, which I'll talk about in a second. Our global hybrid sales were up 20% last year and we expect them to be up 40% this year. We're now the number one and number two best-selling hybrid trucks in the U.S. Maverick is number one and we're the number three hybrid brand in the U.S. behind Toyota and Honda. But unlike them, our hybrids really sell best on trucks for our side. We launched some awesome tech. BlueCruise just passed 150 million miles of hand-free use, but more importantly, the growth is up 25% quarter-over-quarter and the gross margins for BlueCruise are at 70%-plus, the same for Ford Pro Intelligence. And boy, can Ford do work vehicles. The new Super Duty and Transit are off to great starts as is the new Ranger. We are really focused as a team on the segmentation. You can see the speed, the accountability for results and focus within the company. And our underlying business is getting better, as John will show. Despite the UAW strike, our auto profits were up year-over-year. We returned to investment grade, we have higher ROIC, and we have really solid conversion from profits to cash. We're returning capital to shareholders, we're declaring a regular and a special dividend, and we're getting much more disciplined on capital not just where we allocate, but more importantly, how much we spend and when. Our Integrated Services are really accelerating under Peter Stern. These are high-growth, high margin, as I said, and much less cyclical profits for us. We have one single leader, Kumar Galhotra on our industrial system and he is laser focused on quality and cost. And our international operations have made a remarkable turnaround after a lot of difficult restructuring. It's the second year we made profit. It's about a $3 billion turnaround compared to just three or four years ago. And what would surprise people is what a juggernaut Ranger has become. It's a global franchise and it's our second best-selling nameplate globally, just behind F-Series and ahead of Super Duty. Now John is going to go into last year's results. It was a solid year, but I want to be really clear, we are nowhere near our earnings potential for Ford Motor Company. And we are really positioned well this year for growth and profitability, for revenues as well. I'm going to cover four key areas. The first area is Ford Pro. It's nearly a $60 billion high-margin hardware, software and physical services business and most of that revenue is reoccurring. I believe Ford Pro is where the industry is going, an integrated business between all three of those factors. And we're seeing it first there because the customers use the vehicle more intensely and are more willing to pay for software. And we believe the attributes of Ford Pro are undervalued, but the performance will reveal that over time and look at the performance last year. Ford Pro doubled its EBIT to $7 billion despite a significant slowdown on Super Duty during the launch in the name of quality. And we're now on track for mid-teen EBIT margins at Pro. And you're going to see top and bottom line growth this year in Pro. We have the freshest product lineup in Ford's work history in two decades. Our order banks are exceeding our supply. And the reason why that order bank is so strong is fundamentally different economic factors than our retail business. What I mean by that is, look at North America. We're really dominant. We do really well on state and local government Pro sales. These are very profitable. And last year, state and local governments increased their spending by $75 billion or 16%, and a sizable portion of that is in infrastructure and people need Super Duties and Transits. Look at the build-out of telecom and 5G, directly correlates to our robust revenues. And the same is happening in the manufacturing sector in the U.S. with reshoring or onshoring manufacturing. Dealers are clamoring for more Pro allocation. They normally get only 50% to 75% of the volume they want. And in Europe, it's the ninth straight year of Ford being the best-selling CV brand, and we're just in the middle of launching the Super Duty of Europe, the Transit Custom and the new Ranger is now ramping up. Why do we think we're undervalued in Pro? Well, there's a couple of reasons. The first is our market leadership is a little bit opaque. We don't just lead in Pro, we dominate. We're 40% of the market share of Class 1 through 7 full-sized trucks and vans. In fact, many months, our second-place competitor isn't even half our size. Now commercial -- commanding that share means that we are dominant in vocations like service construction, utility and, as I said, government. But our biggest success is in TAMs where the market is biggest, small and medium-sized businesses and tradespeople. That's the backbone of the U.S. economy, and boy, does Ford have a reputation with those customers. Our second big moat is upfitters. Again, very difficult for investors to see but this is really significant. Every one of our landscapers, plumbers, electricians, they all upfit their Transits and Super Duties and Rangers specific to their vocation. So these upfitters being really important. We now have already developed a digital upfit integration system, and we share engineering specs with all those upfitters. We've been working with them for decades and they really trust Ford. They're even able to move their upfit equipment from old Fords to new Fords. The third big moat is a growing one. It's software and our physical repair business. Example of that is last year, we already have 0.5 million active software paid subscriptions at Pro. It's up 46% and the margins are over 50%. In two years, we expect software and services to drive 20% of the Pro EBIT. And that's supported by two things: getting to 60% mix on our connected vehicles and a threefold increase in our attach rates for those paid subscriptions that I mentioned, which are only at about 12% today. One of the biggest advantages we have in Pro that's hard for people to see is our physical repair network. It costs a lot of money to create, costs decades of time and there's a lot of expertise. In the U.S., we have 23,000 service bays that are busy seven days a week, 24 hours a day, and we're pressing on that advantage. Every day, we have new, very large service elite repair centers launching in the U.S. We haven't waited for brick-and-mortar. We now have 1,200 vans and Super Duties that are outfitted for remote service to our fleet customers. The Net Promoter Score is 10 points higher because they don't have to come on with the dealership. And this has effectively added 10% more capacity for our service. The bottom line is, we have these amazing vehicles. We have a leading market share position. We're now adding long-term durability of those products. We have a highly profitable alternative revenue streams in repair and software now. Ford Pro is really a magical breakthrough for our customers and our company and, I believe, the industry. Quality, we don't have to go into the negative effects about quality, but we've been addressing it for three years now and we're starting to see progress. Our vision is that we want to give customers, who buy our trucks and vans and our passion products, off-road, Bronco, all of it, the long-term durability from companies like Toyota and Honda, but in the segments we compete in. We already have world-class quality in many parts of our company, and now we're seeing green shoots in North America. Kumar is leading this and he's here for Q&A to answer any questions. But there are two aspects of quality I want to highlight. The first is launch quality. That Super Duty launch I mentioned, it was a line in the sand for this management team. We intensified all of our testing, our real-world problem-solving on the plant with our suppliers and engineers. We slowed down the launch and boy, did it cost us. $1 billion of EBIT we forego last year, but it was the right trade-off for our company and our customers. The result is the launch spike that every launch has we think on Super Duty is now similar to best-in-class in our industry, and we're seeing the benefits in the F-150 launch. That launch is underway right now and it's a really important one for our company. The second area of quality we're seeing progress on is initial quality. Now we measure that in three months in service. And that is highly correlated to long-term quality, and yes, warranty costs. And we saw last year a 10% increase. That is the largest improvement in the similar quality that we saw last time in 2016. It's the best in a long time and we are committing to a similar improvement this year. Quality now factors into 70% of the short-term incentives for our management at Ford. In the long-term, it's even more important, because we're measuring total shareholder return. We will share those KPIs on quality with you every quarter. Next thing I'd like to highlight is EVs. Now someone portrayed the change in the EV market as Darwinian. That could be a slow evolutionary change, but we think this has been a seismic change in the last six months of last year. That will rapidly sort out winners and losers in our industry. Now the catalyst for that seismic change is a combination of EV manufacturers cutting their price by 20% across all major geographies and a tremendous amount of capital flowing and a ton of new capacity into one single segment, two-row crossovers. Our overall EV strategy has never been more relevant as the seismic change happens, and we want to share with you our targets. Our next Gen 2 products will be profitable in the first 12 months of their launch. And that will mean that we'll get to mid to high single-digit EBIT profit margins over their life cycle, and that's going to deliver profits above Model e's cost of capital. And here are our big bets and adjustments. We're going to spend less capital on larger EVs. And as we've always said, we'll have a very small number of those. We're going to focus those large EVs on geographies and product segments where we have a dominant advantage like trucks and vans. And those products will have breakthrough efficiency compared to our Gen 1 products, and they're going to be packed with innovations that customers are going to be excited to pay for. We're also adjusting our capital switching more focused on to smaller EV products. Now this is important because we made a bet in silence two years ago. We developed a super-talented skunkworks team to create a low-cost EV platform. It was a small group, small team, some of the best EV engineers in the world, and it was separate from the Ford mothership. It was a startup. And they've developed a flexible platform that will not only deploy to several types of vehicles but will be a large installed base for software and services that we're now seeing at Pro. All of our EV teams are ruthlessly focused on cost and efficiency in our EV products because the ultimate competition is going to be the affordable Tesla and the Chinese OEMs. And that bet and all of the rightsizing of capital and even delays to some of our products, given the market realities, better balance growth, profits and returns for us. But one of the things we're taking advantage of and taking some timing delays is rationalizing the level and timing of our battery capacity to match demand and actually reassessing the vertical integration that we're relying on and betting on new chemistries and capacities. Our overall EV business will grow this year because we have the Explorer launching in Europe and really exciting, many of our commercial vehicles launched with electric this year as we refresh the lineup. We will also align production and inventory for customer demand. EV customers are also helping us in a very critical area of software quality. They really, really are teaching us a lot. And this is a critical place where I think we're ahead as a company. Why are we making these changes in our EV business and capital allocation? Well, because we learned as an early leader as we scale the EVs and hybrids simultaneously. The demand curve turns out to be for EV is very different than ICE. We've seen an explosive growth in EVs in 2021 and 2022, and we realize very quickly that our first three Gen 1 products, we didn't have enough capacity. With EV growth, but as well importantly, the COVID supply shocks and the chip crisis itself and Tesla's ability to make vehicles despite the chip crisis in \u201821 and \u201822 and the zero cost of capital gave us too optimistic of a demand signal at that time, and it drove a temporary spike in supply. As the COVID shock retreated, we learned that as you scale EVs to 5,000 to 7,000 units a month and you move into the early majority customer, they are not willing to pay a significant premium for EVs. This is a huge moment for us. What we've seen, because we offer everything, is pricing quickly converged to hybrids after any benefit from subsidies. Now Tesla found out this first but we were right behind that, and they were very exposed to early majority. But we learned very quickly, and I want to say that no one will be immune to this reality. The most obvious indicator of this reality is looking at total revenue, not units for EVs. Look at the U.S. market. EV total revenue was down in the second-half of last year versus Q2. If you look at unit volumes, they were up. That is a really important insight we learned in being a first mover. The same thing happened in China, same thing happened in Europe. Our data shows that EVs are a clear destination for many customers based on their unique duty cycle. It's going to take time more than we expected 18-months ago. But we are seeing big adoption variances by geography, and that's why the power of choice at Ford is so important and a big advantage for us. We're betting that choice and flexible manufacturing is going to get us successfully through this transition. Look at the best-selling vehicle in the United States, the F-150. We have a lightning, we have a hybrid and high volume and a nice choice. In Q4, in California, our mix was 50% hybrid and EV F-150 and 50% ICE. 1,000 miles away in Dallas, it was only 15% hybrid and EV, 85% ICE. You go around the world, you'll see same variations. Hybrids will play an increasingly important role in our industry's transition and will be here for the long run. Hybrid just hit specific customer use cases. On a Maverick pickup truck, our hybrid is focused on mileage and efficiency and they do the math very clearly, and they don't have to change their behaviors. On F-150 Hybrid, they get the same benefits even when they're toeing on fuel efficiency, but we throw in Pro Power on board on top of that to displace a very expensive generator cost. And margins on hybrids are closer to ICE, much higher than EV margins. The journey on EVs is inevitable in our eyes and we have a bright future of EVs. We're adjusting our capital and we're giving customers choice. Last thing I want to mention is talent. None of these breakthroughs in our company operationally or financially or in technical excellent innovation are going to happen without the right talent. And we've learned that the right talent is not sufficient. Over the last two years, it's been imperative that we go to a right performance management system. It's a fundamental change in the way we're running the company. We now truly differentiate and reward excellence at Ford, and that matches our operation and our business delivery. It's a massive culture change. Evolving to a compensation and benefit structure weighed more towards variable compensation that is tied to our delivery business results is fantastic. You can't bring in and retain the best talent without making this change. And now our long-term incentives and our short-term incentives are tied specifically to shareholder value creation. Over to you, John.\nJohn Lawler: Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. So 2023 was an important year as we continued to execute our Ford+ plan. Our strong global product line, which is clearly resonating with our customers, delivered revenue of $176 billion, which was up 11%, marking our second consecutive year of double-digit growth. We delivered $10.4 billion in adjusted EBIT, at the high end of our guidance, driven by continued strength in both Blue and Pro. Now to provide some perspective, compared to last year collectively, our core business units, Pro, Model e, and Blue grew, improved EBIT by $2 billion or 26%, and this is after fully absorbing roughly $1.7 billion impact of the UAW strike. Free cash flow was $6.8 billion, generating a free cash flow conversion rate of 65%. And this is above the top end of our target range and was driven by underlying strength in both Pro and Blue. Now both of these metrics provide a good litmus test for the effectiveness of our Ford+ strategy. Our balance sheet remains strong with nearly $29 billion in cash and more than $46 billion in liquidity. And this provides considerable flexibility to manage our business as the industry continues to transform. With the improving trajectory of our business and strong free cash flow, we announced a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share plus a supplemental dividend of $0.18 per share. This brings our payout ratio to 50% for the year, in line with our target to consistently return 40% to 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. Now let's take a closer look at our performance. Revenue for the quarter was $46 billion, up 4% despite the impact of the strike, which cost us roughly 90,000 units of production. Adjusted EBIT came in at $1.1 billion with an EBIT margin of 2.3%, which again included the impact of the strike. Now let's look at our segments. Ford Pro delivered another strong quarter with revenue up 11%, EBIT of $1.8 billion was up 25% with a margin of 11.8%. Full year results clearly demonstrated the potential earnings power of this growth business. Revenue jumped 19% and EBIT more than doubled year-over-year to $7.2 billion, an improvement of $4 billion. And with a margin of 12.4%, we're just shy of our mid-teen target. The strengths Jim highlighted for Ford Pro are differentiated and drove strong results this year and have Pro poised for another strong year in 2024. Ford Model E drove a 14% increase in wholesales in the quarter, a 2% increase in revenue and EBIT loss of $1.6 billion. For the year, wholesales were up 20%, revenue was up 12% and EBIT was a loss of $4.7 billion. Both the quarter and year were impacted by challenging market dynamics and investments in next-generation vehicles, both of which Jim addressed in his remarks. In the quarter, Ford Blue revenue was flat despite the loss of roughly 60,000 units due to the strike. EBIT was $113 million with a margin of 3.1%. For the year, Ford Blue grew again with revenue up 8%. All of our regions are now profitable and contributing significantly to Blue's bottom line results. EBIT of $7.5 billion was up year-over-year with a margin of 7.3%. The improvement in EBIT reflects the underlying strength of our product portfolio, dampened by higher warranty and the UAW-related costs. Turning to Ford Credit. Ford Credit generated EBT of $280 million in the quarter and $1.3 billion for the year. As expected, full-year results were down year-over-year. Credit loss performance continues to normalize but remains below our historical average. Now before I turn to guidance, I wanted to touch briefly on capital allocation. One of the benefits of our segmentation, in addition to increased transparency and accountability, is that we are now allocating capital based on the growth opportunities in different risk and return profile of our segments. This allows us to assign specific risk-adjusted hurdle rates for each of our businesses, driving greater accountability to returns on the capital we invest. So here's how we're thinking about 2024 guidance. For the full year, we expect to earn between $10 billion to $12 billion in adjusted EBIT. The high end of the range would be a record for Ford. Adjusted free cash flow of $6 billion to $7 billion and capital expenditures of $8 billion to $9.5 billion, flat to moderately up year-over-year. So let me double click on capital expenditures. We expect EVs to be about 40% of the total, and this reflects products already in flight, including investments in EV powertrain supporting our next generation of products in our LFP battery plant here in Michigan. As we continue to adjust to market dynamics, we are scrutinizing every dollar and will continue to drive efficiencies, targeting to land at the lower end of our CapEx range. For example, in 2023, we already started to take action. We delayed our second JV battery plant. We reduced the size of our new LFP plant in Michigan, and we did not proceed with our JV battery plant in Turkey. And now we are further adjusting installed capacity to match demand, reassessing vertical integration in new battery chemistries, adjusting Gen 2 products and potentially their launch timing to ensure they meet our criteria for profitability, given the new market reality. Our 2024 outlook also assumes -- a flat to slightly higher SAAR in both the U.S. and Europe, and our planning assumption for the U.S. is 16 million to 16.5 million units, Nonrecurrence of the UAW strike, full year of our all-new Super Duty driving both positive pricing and mix in Ford Pro, industry supply and demand normalizing. Now from a planning perspective, we are assuming lower industry pricing of roughly 2%, driven by higher incentive spending as we move through the year. We expect this to be partially offset by top line growth from the launch of our new products. In addition, we're assuming a $2 billion benefit from cost reduction initiatives that offset higher labor and product refresh costs. Within the segments, we expect Ford Pro's strength will continue unabated. With continued strong demand for our leading products, we are targeting EBIT between $8 billion to $9 billion, driven by continued growth and favorable mix, partially offset by moderated pricing. For Model E, we expect losses to widen to a range of $5 billion to $5.5 billion, driven by continued pricing pressure and investments in our next-generation vehicles. We expect our first-generation vehicles to improve their profits throughout the year. Ford Blue, EBIT to be about equal to last year at $7 billion to $7.5 billion, reflecting a balanced market equation, including the impact of our all-new F-150. We also expect costs to be flat as we offset higher labor and product cost with efficiencies. And we expect Ford Credit's EBT to be up slightly year-over-year to about $1.5 billion. Now taking a step back, our performance last year reflects the positive momentum of our Ford+ plan. Capital discipline is driving the right global footprint, portfolio of products and consistent cash generation. We continue to see growth opportunities and remain focused on delivering improvements in both quality and cost. Now that wraps our prepared remarks. We'll use the balance of the time to address what's on your mind. Thank you. Operator, please open up the line for questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nAdam Jonas: Hi, everybody. Jim, I want to talk to you about Ford versus Ferrari, which is way, a great movie, by the way, and I think the good guys won. I remember a time when Fiat owned Ferrari, and I had a valuation of about $4 billion on it. Now Ferrari is worth $80 billion today, and the business was totally ignored by investors when it was part of Fiat. Now Ford's Ferrari, it's called Ford Pro? And I think we agree, people are ignoring the cash cow but I disagree with you, Jim. You said it's because of opaque kind of transparency or opaque kind of metrics. I don't agree. I think it's because almost all the profits are funding this EV science project. Am I being unfair, Jim, with that kind of assessment or what can your team do about this? I have a follow-up.\nJim Farley: [Technical Difficulty] enthusiasm towards it. But relative to EVs, there's a lot we can do, and there's a lot we're doing. I think you're going to see a lot of seismic changes in the industry because of this pricing power reality that we've all faced. More OEM relationships, different shifting to a buy versus a build or vertical integration, shifting in capital and generally more focus on smaller vehicles. The EV customers are very robust. They really like the vehicles. They do not repurchase ICE or hybrid vehicles. They're very loyal and they love the vehicles, so it's on us to get the cost right. That is the issue with the transition. The good news is Ford has a high-volume hybrid business, and the timing of our second cycle product gives us a chance to make a lot of adjustments in capital, bringing it down, including and it allows us to execute them with a cost approach that's very different than our first generation. And I think all of our commitments to make money in the first 12-months of all of our launches, to have that kind of profitability in Model e, to return its cost of capital, I wouldn't be saying it if I didn't believe it. And it's also got a lot of other benefits, which I want the team to explain and that are really important to understand. Marin, maybe you want to go over those, or John?\nMarin Gjaja: Sure. Thanks, Jim. If we just think about what the Gen 1 vehicles can do for us, we're building the EV business and, at the same time, we need the compliance value. We mentioned before the value of the credits that generated allow us to sell these high-margin ICE vehicles. Each EV sold allows us to sell multiple high-margin vehicles. A Lightning can offset roughly...\nJim Farley: Including Pro.\nMarin Gjaja: Including Pro. We're also building new customer-facing capabilities. We are satisfying demand that is out there where there's high levels of adoption. We've got new dealer standards, changing experience for the customer for shop and buy ownership and service so that we're learning what's required to serve these customers, both us and our dealers. We're developing a charging network through our dealers and together with Tesla. Now the adoption varies tremendously by geography. As Jim mentioned, across the West Coast, we're seeing 30% of the market in F-150 being in EVs. That volume is giving us a feedback loop for engineering. We're developing these electric powertrains. We've got better handle on thermal propagation, and the software and services that these customers demand much more intensely than a typical ICE customer, we're learning how to deliver those much better, much more efficiently and with higher quality. I would be remiss if we ignore the lifetime value of both the customer and the vehicle. We've got a 60% conquest rate on Gen 1 and the integrated services like BlueCruise that we can sell in these vehicles goes through the whole life of the vehicle.\nJim Farley: Anything else, John?\nJohn Lawler: Yes. I mean, the only thing I would say is, Adam, one of the important things, just on top of that, is that the segmentation is really important here. And we know that the EV business needs to stand on its own, right? We're very clear about that. And it needs to generate a profit and a return on the capital we're investing. Now we're not there yet but that's what we're working towards. The compliance benefit that we get, that's important. We can sell up to a dozen ICE F-150s or other ICE profitable vehicles for every Lightning we sell. But that -- we don't do anything with wooden nickels. We don't do any credit into EV, into Model e or anything like that because eventually, this business has to stand on its own sooner rather than later. And that's a really important point. It's clean.\nAdam Jonas: Thanks, John.\nJim Farley: By the way, Pro includes electric. And although electric is going slower for Pro customers, it's actually they do the math quicker than retail customers. And so actually, our January EV sales in Pro were higher than December, which would ever make sense. But we're seeing more and more Pro customers go electric if their duty cycle makes sense. So even for Pro, it's important for our success.\nAdam Jonas: I appreciate that, Jim. I just have just a brief follow-up on China. You guys come across as very sophisticated in terms of having sophisticated insight into China. You got Ambassador Huntsman on the Board, been there for years. You have a JV partner with Changan that's really kicking [Indiscernible] lately with EVs. So how can Ford work -- potentially work with Chinese partners to help Ford achieve its EV objectives in a more capital-efficient way? Thanks.\nJim Farley: Thank you. Well, person right next to me, John was the head of Ford at China and knows the Changan leadership really well. John and I went to a trip last spring and it was really eye-opening for us. I mean, as two leaders who look to each other said, holy cow. I think, first of all, China as an export for our very profitable overseas markets is really important now. And actually, we shouldn't overlook the importance of JMC now. We have really profitable export business in China, ICE and EV. We're going to actually a very different strategy, I think our competitors in China with a very low capital approach to EVs. So we don't -- we see the kind of bloodbath reality now in China on EVs, and we're watching that really carefully. We don't think it's a good time to jump in with both feet in China with EVs, but we're allowing our partners' platforms to lead our electrification. And in doing that, we are learning a lot about their capability and the local IP there in China. And it's pretty breathtaking to see what we're learning. I think our approach of very low capital, profitable business is appropriate at this moment in time for this kind of EV explosion, but also bloodbath and profitability. And I think we're also building a global capability team for digital experience, battery and sensing tech and product concepting in China that we'll use globally. I think even though that's not a profit or loss thing, we see that as a real capability globally. So our strategy is quite different but I think it works for our company.\nAdam Jonas: Thanks, Jim.\nOperator: The next question is from John Murphy with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJohn Murphy: Good evening, guys. Just a first question here, Jim, on EVs. Obviously, it's a hot topic here. As you look at sort of the slowdown here, we're hearing from dealers, particularly I spent some time in NATO last week, that they're seeing EVs traded in and folks buying ICE and EV. So they're actually swapping out EVs and buying ICE and hybrids? And then you're seeing Hertz dumping 20,000 EVs and canceling or postponing orders. So both on the retail side and the commercial side, you're getting these stories. It's following up with data that folks are really not happy with the product sort of near-term? What do you think is happening, because the customers are not happy? I mean, it sounds like on the Pro side, some folks might be with the product that they have right now. And if you think about sort of your planning assumptions maybe near term, I don't -- just for argument's sake, say you have 100,000 less EVs? Do you think if you sell 100,000 less EVs at Ford, that you have the ICE and hybrids to backfill for that so you actually don't lose sales and you actually might be a little bit more profitable in the short-term? It's kind of a lot in that question, but just trying to understand what you're seeing in the market, why things are failing here both on the retail side and on the commercial side to some degree? And do you have the product to backfill if those volumes are lower?\nJim Farley: You can imagine -- John, you can -- thank you for your question. You can imagine with our choice portfolio being big on scaled hybrids, ICE, of course, and EV, this is a very fundamental question for us because we have to plan our capacity years out. Here's what we found. Customers are doing the quick showroom math on hybrids. They can quickly evaluate the breakeven between ICE and a hybrid on the showroom floor. For an F-150, they can -- they know how much a Honda generator cost versus Pro Power on board, and they don't have to change their behavior. A lot of the operating cost efficiencies in EV for a mainstream customer require change like installing a charger at home, or they're uncertain. How much will I save on repair cost? How much will I save on electrons versus gasoline? It's harder to compare. And so we're just seeing the cost of ownership, which is interesting, because the success of EVs and Pro is a customer that does that math more brutally and they use the vehicle at a higher utilization. So they're looking at cost of ownership in a much clearer lens. And therefore, some of them are doing the math and going to EV. I think that math has always been there for HEV, but now more customers are interested in doing that. And we believe that customers are smart and some people would do these cycles for EVs. So going to do that math over time and it's worth investing because it's a really good business. But it's on us to get the cost right. So I just think we're seeing the math for an EV customer, mainstream EV customer is a little bit more opaque than what we see on hybrid. We're hearing -- Marin, do you want to say anything quickly about dealers?\nMarin Gjaja: Yes. I think what we're seeing with our dealers is they've been making margins comparable to their ICE vehicles in the last year. And in '21 and '22, we're actually doing better than their ICE vehicles when pricing was really strong. So we feel really good about making sure our dealers are making money on this and are making investments for the long-term. But I think that's something that we monitor closely. I think just building on Jim's point quickly, I would just say the big difference for consumers is they make that 1 choice every few years, whereas the Pro customer is changing their fleet, consistently buying lots of vehicles, and they test and they learn what the TCO difference is that total cost of operation.\nJim Farley: And as far as the manufacturing capacity, we planned that 40% growth in HEVs years ago, so that is our capacity. We may have some pricing room above that. And we've seen actually HEV pricing become more robust as we hit these capacity limits. But 40% growth is a big increase for us. We think we got it about right. That means like on an F-150, America's best-selling vehicle, we think 25% of the sales or America's best-selling vehicles can be hybrid. And I think we're going to get close to some of the all-hybrid nameplates out there that people think of when they think of hybrids with F-150. So we have a lot of flexibility. I think we're in good shape.\nJohn Murphy: Jim, just one follow-up. I mean, you reported to a rumor to be doing a two-week tour to your dealers, around your different dealers. I'm just curious, I mean, some of them are happy, some of them are annoyed at the EV stuff. What is the general message going to be as you're going around to the all-important channel and trying to get the troops in line and everything moving in the right direction in the distribution channel?\nJim Farley: A couple of key messages. First of all, I mentioned Ford Pro and what a profit juggernaut that is. We continue to need our dealers to invest in the brick-and-mortar in those remote service van and accelerate that because that is the upside. We want to get to -- if we want to get to 20% of the profit for Pro being attached services, it's going to have to come on the back of capacity in our dealers and vans. So invest in Pro. The second thing is we have manufacturing flexibility between ICE and EV and hybrid. So we want to make sure that they understand that we're in probably better shape than any other brand in this transition. The third message is we want them to understand our progress on quality, and we are going to press to be among the leaders in retailing. They should keep for our customer, remote pickup and service, doing more repairs for our retail customers remote, and that takes investment in their side. We really want to step on the gas on customer experience, both ownership and purchase. And I think that has to come from the top. Jim Farley has to say to all these dealers who are private investors, we need your partnership right now. That's why I'm going on the tour.\nJohn Murphy: Sounds good. Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question is from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nRod Lache: Hi, everybody. Jim, you said that you're discovering that the adoption curve for EVs is a bit shallower, but we're still seeing $5 billion to $5.5 billion of losses in Model e, which implies that structural costs are probably higher in 2024 than 2023. So it sounds like you're committed because you see the ultimate benefit and maybe also a little bit because there isn't much choice. So ultimately, the question is, can you control and commit to when that business reaches breakeven, either through stronger demand or lower spending? Because from here, $5 billion improvement is pretty meaningful. Or do you have to do that because of the trajectory of ZEV and EPA and all the other things possibly exceeding where consumers are?\nJim Farley: Well, we're not going to go to market with the vehicle unless we completely convinced ourselves that it's going to be profitable. And that takes some adjustments on timing actually. And we see opportunity in the short term to make some adjustments. But yes, I know it's a huge turnaround and it's a big number. John, maybe you want to go into the actual losses in Model e just to pick them apart a little bit. And then I think you'll see a little bit more about the opportunity we have at Gen 2.\nJohn Lawler: Yes, the biggest issue we have in our Gen 1 vehicles, of course, is that the revenue collapsed and they're not optimized from a cost standpoint. We put them through very quickly to get to market and you're seeing that flow through. But I think, Rod, part of what you were getting at is that we have no choice. And we will continue to work on improving the cost structure of the Gen 1 vehicles. And as Jim said, our Gen 2 vehicles we won't launch unless we can get to a profit and a return on that capital that we're investing there at the pricing environment that we now understand is reality. So yes, it is very much the mother of all optimization modeling and work around the balance between how many EVs we sell because we talked about the compliance benefit of that. For every Lightning, we can sell 12 ICE vehicles. We can sell a number of ICE vehicles with every Mach-E we sell, and so there's that balance. And then there's the balance of what we need to sell from the ICE standpoint and how we can improve with HEVs there, and that's a benefit, too. But there's also, and you'll see that in our K tomorrow, we are buying credits as they're available. So we have to optimize across all three of those frontiers and that's what we're working on right now. But we know that we have to have this electric vehicle business stand on its own and be profitable because we know that there are competitors out there. We talked about that the Chinese as well as Tesla that are profitable, and we have to cross that fulcrum and get there. And that's what our goal is. So it needs to be a benefit of profitable business, return on the capital plus the compliance benefit that we get from those.\nJim Farley: And Rod, we have a lot of stakeholders at Ford so we're not going to go in a lot of details, but we have optionality even this year in capital spending. I mean, a lot of that guide is EVs. John, I don't know if you want to be specific but...\nJohn Lawler: It's about 40% last year and 40% of our CapEx this year and is EV.\nJim Farley: And we're driving as a team to be on the low end of that range.\nJohn Lawler: Absolutely.\nJim Farley: Because we are working hard on our EV spend. And I just want to make sure we don't want to leave this call with the fact that this is totally baked. We are working really hard to be on the low end of that range because we think it's appropriate to run the business.\nRod Lache: Can you commit to breakeven at a certain point that you said before that the Gen 2 vehicles come out in 2026, is that kind of the time line for closing that $5 billion? And then just as a follow-up, I think you're saying that you've got line of sight on warranty coming down. Will we see the variable cost disadvantage that you've highlighted in warranty and material starting to come down this year?\nJim Farley: We have the leader of our EV business here, Marin, so I think that question goes to you on timing and warranty.\nMarin Gjaja: Yes, I don't think we're prepared right now to commit to a specific timing on when we're going to be positive EBIT. We are going to expect to see improving gross margin quarter-over-quarter over the course of the year. John mentioned some of the levers we're starting to pull, and we will continue to adjust to the market realities. We've changed our production. We have increased C&I as need be to address our inventory issues. And we're going to keep working on our cost. We've taken 4,000 to 5,000 out of the BOM on Mustang Mach-E since it was launched and 2,000 to 3,000 out of Lightning and the team continues to work. But the market is turned and it's going to be a challenge. And I don't know that we can commit because we don't know exactly what's going to happen in the market. In terms of warranty costs, our Generation 1 vehicles, as we mentioned earlier, have been incredibly valuable for us to learn about a set of the issues around batteries and thermal obligation. And we will continue to work on that to lower our warranty costs dramatically for Generation 2, but we've got to deliver that in partnership with Kumar and the industrial platform.\nJohn Lawler: So Rod, I think the last part of your question was around, are we going to start to see costs turn? I would say that from a warranty standpoint, costs are probably going to be about flat this year. We're starting to see green shoots in the quality improvements. But as you know, the way that works, there's a lag. And Kumar can touch upon this a little bit more, but this year, we expect to see $2 billion of efficiencies flow through. And those efficiencies are in the material cost in the industrial system, pretty much offsetting the impact of the UAW. But also remember, 60% of our global portfolio this year will be refreshed. And coming with that will be incremental costs that we have for new features, compliance, et cetera. And so what we should see this year is the efficiencies of $2 billion offsetting the UAW labor contract plus the refresh costs of our 60% of our products being refreshed this year.\nRod Lache: Got it. Okay, thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question is from Dan Levy with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nDan Levy: Hi, good evening. Thank you for taking the questions. I want to go back to Pro and your -- the guide that you have for this year is already in line with the mid-teen margin guide you provided at your CMD last spring. So really the question is, how sustainable is this earnings stream? And specifically, I think you've had something like $7 billion of price tailwind. Last year, I think $11 billion if you aggregate over a two-year stretch. I know this is partially driven by new product, but what is the sustainability of these very robust price tailwinds you experienced?\nJim Farley: Well, first of all, I tried to explain the fundamental factors for our vehicle profitability in Pro that's driving that demand will be here for a while. It's basic infrastructure, government state, 5G, onshoring, manufacturing, manufacturing sector. We believe that, that's very durable. And by the way in Europe, we've been the top-selling brand there for nine years and we have very old products. So we haven't even seen the effect of Transit Custom and Ranger that's all coming our way. We feel that this is a pretty robust profitability because we've never had the 20% attach rates. We've never had 0.5 million units of software with 50% margins. We've never really focused on Pro aftersales like we are now. We're just getting started with this 20% of the profitability coming from attached services. And I think that totally changes the risk portfolio of our commercial business. And we -- this is a real opportunity for our company that we never had. I also believe that attach rates are the kind of things that we'll start to see on the retail side of our business. Blue's software is now 70% margin and it's high volume now. And we're just getting started with that optionality. So what it will be five years from now? I'm not sure the time frame of your question, hard to predict. But for the next couple of years, we're in a really good spot because the shovels are in the ground or about to get in the ground. The one other thing about Pro that we have to watch really carefully, which would be even more upside is a return to a robust construction housing market, which has been really slow in the last couple of years. If that starts to fire up, we're going to even have more capacity issues on Pro.\nDan Levy: Great. And then as a follow-up, John, I want to go back to your comments that you just mentioned a second ago on the industrial costs. And specifically, I think at the CMD, talked about a $7 billion cost disadvantage versus your competitors in Blue. So how do we contextualize the cost improvements that you're adding now versus the $7 billion? I mean, is it safe to say that now this journey on sort of narrowing that gap is starting? Or is it still just still a lot more work to do? Just help us understand the path to narrowing that cost gap versus your competitors' inflow?\nJohn Lawler: Yes. What I would say is that it is now we're starting to gain the traction and that gap should start to narrow. And your -- that's part of the $2 billion. And so it's going to be across the industrial system, both in material and in labor. And I think Kumar can share some more details on how he's leading that and driving that.\nKumar Galhotra: Yes. Thanks, John. Well, this year, we're starting very differently than '24 than '23, for example. A couple of fundamental different things. Last year, we had a lot of inflationary pressures and claims from our suppliers. Those have eased very substantially and are going to help us deliver the $2 billion that John talked about. The second thing is the supply chain is much more stable. That allows us to run our entire system much more smoothly and helps us remove a lot of waste. It also reduces a lot of our freight cost because we've been doing a lot of premium freight last couple of years so that will help as well. And in terms of material, we're attacking it in like 3 different ways. One is where our designs are not efficient, so I want to give you a bit of color on what those are, a couple of examples. In one of our vehicle lines, we were using certain aero shields for fuel economy and the fresh eyes Kaizen review internally and some benchmarking, the team came up with a different way of delivering the same aero and save $40 per vehicle. So that's equivalent to about $10 million per year. Another category is where we are providing certain features to our customers where they're not finding a lot of value. And connected vehicle data here is very important because it helps us see what we're providing, whether the customers are using it or not. So one example is an auto part feature that lets the customer parallel park automatically. Very, very few people are using it. So we can remove that feature. It's about $60 per vehicle, another $10 million per year. We're doing very extensive benchmarking for our manufacturing, both internally because we have lots of good ideas within our system and externally at a station-by-station level. So just recently, one of the teams completed analysis of about 50 stations and saved about $8 million. And I already mentioned the freight. So these are the kinds of very robust ideas we have in the hopper, along with less inflationary claims, along with a stable supply chain that's going to help us close that gap that John mentioned and save $2 billion this year.\nDan Levy: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nEmmanuel Rosner: Thanks so much. I was actually hoping to pick it up just where you left off on all that good color on the cost side. Are there any green shoots that you can sort of point us to, to give us increased conviction around some of these costs? Obviously, in 2023, cost was still a fairly major drag and that includes even in the fourth quarter. So like any in your reporting, any of these markets that we should be watching in terms of what will actually provide the tailwind, the $2 billion-plus in 2024?\nKumar Galhotra: It's just fundamentally the things I talked about. We have a very robust hopper of ideas that we're very busy executing. Stability in supply chain, removing a lot of waste, and freight cost. So we spent a lot of money, all of us did, in premium freight. We're starting to see in fourth -- third quarter and fourth quarter a much more stable supply chain that allows us not to spend that premium and bring those costs down in 2024.\nJohn Lawler: Emmanuel, the other thing I would add to that is that when you look at '22 and '23, we were very much behind the curve of supply base, catching up to where they were and understanding what was driving their inefficiencies in claims. And we spent a lot of time in 2023 getting out in front of that. And I would say that we ended '23 with a great work that Liz has done to be at a very different place with our supply base. And now we're working together with them very proactively across industrial system to identify efficiencies, things that we can change to help them and, as Kumar said, design actions, et cetera, things like that, that will make them more efficient as well. So that's another bit of color to add to that.\nEmmanuel Rosner: Thanks so much. Just a quick follow-up on this. The -- should we -- will these things take time to play out? I guess I'm looking at your fourth quarter walk and mid-teen freight was still like a $1 billion headwind. So curious if you would need a number of quarters and then it would be a bit more back-end loaded? Or if we could sort of like turn on the switch and see some of these benefits in 2024? And then secondly, curious about your thoughts about the volume outlook for this year, especially for Ford Blue. I think some of the inventory days are sort of like towards the higher end of what you've historically been comfortable with it. So I'm wondering where you see volume growth for this year.\nJohn Lawler: Yes, so a lot in there. What I think you should see from a calendarization standpoint on the cost for 2024 is that you'll see, as Kumar said, a lot of these are the design actions we've been working to identify in 2023 that have built up this cadre of actions we call the hopper. And those will start coming through on the model year turnover. So more towards the middle of the year, you'll start to see a lot more traction there on those. Some of the manufacturing improvements, you'll see throughout the quarters, probably a little bit more of an even flow of those, I would say, right, Kumar? And so that's where we're at. When you look at our day\u2019s supply, when you look at our Blue day\u2019s supply, retail deal day\u2019s supply is in the low to mid-50s, so it's at about the limit of where we expect it to be. So leaning back that into volume, we expect the industry to be -- for the year, we expect it to be about 16 to 16.5 so maybe up 3% to 4% for us from a wholesale standpoint about that. From a planning perspective, that's where we're at. From a pricing perspective, we're planning to see about a 2% decline, negative pricing. And then when you step back and you look at that from an affordability standpoint, we think 2024 is the year where affordability is going to get back to pre-pandemic levels, where the monthly disposable income it takes to buy a vehicle should be back to about that 13% to 13.5%, which is what we saw before pandemic. So we're going to continue to see some top line pressure on Blue. We've got new product coming in Blue, which is going to give us some mix and some tailwind there. So that's going to be a positive for Blue. And then I think Jim covered off Pro. We're seeing incredible demand on Pro. And as you know, Emmanuel, those commercial orders come in two tranches. Half of them came in last year so they're all set. The other half are coming through now and we're continuing to see strength there.\nMarin Gjaja: And that portfolio is going to be freshened or new by the year-end.\nEmmanuel Rosner: Great. I appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question is from James Picariello with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nJames Picariello: Hey, good evening, everyone. Just wondering if you could help dimension EV volumes for this year associated with the $5 billion-plus in Model e losses. And then with respect to Ford Pro's mid-teens margins this year, just curious on the impact tied to the fleet demand for EVs beyond companies, of course. Like do you foresee a step-up in Pro EV volumes for year, no Model e losses get more difficult. So just how are you thinking about the EV dynamic for Pro profitability as well?\nJim Farley: On the retail side, I'll ask Marin to answer that. On Pro, absolutely, our EV sales will grow not only because we're seeing more interest because the cost of ownership is advantageous for some, but we're also expanding in Europe quite a bit our electric offering with our two Transit vans coming online. And so that will definitely -- and there are a lot of city closures and other kind of regulations in Europe that's driving adoption for electric vehicles, especially vans specifically. So yes, we'll have very robust growth in our EVs for Pro.\nMarin Gjaja: Yes. We expect growth in sales on the retail side as well. Remember, we had times where we were out of production last year on Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning. So we'll be overlapping those, we'll see growth. And then more importantly, we're launching Explorer in Europe in the second half of this year so that's going to be a new offering that will help us grow. So we expect to see substantial unit volume growth.\nJames Picariello: And John, I know you touched on this already but are supplier cost reductions a core component of the $2 billion in savings for the year? Just wondering how commercial negotiations have progressed? And are there any areas that stand out in terms of opportunity?\nJohn Lawler: Yes. A lot of the $2 billion is, again, through the manufacturing system so it's the industrial efficiencies that we've been working on. And then from a design and material standpoint, it's mostly design reductions that are part of the $2 billion on a year-over-year basis. So it's those actions that we've been benchmarking and working on similar to the ideas that Kumar had described, pretty much design-related.\nJim Farley: So design, labor and freight, yes primarily.\nJames Picariello: Thanks.\nOperator: And the final question today comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRyan Brinkman: Thanks for taking my questions. I mean, obviously, a strong guide in aggregate. Digging into, though, the higher anticipated Model e losses of $5 billion to $5.5 billion, what is embedded within that from like a variable contribution margin perspective? How do you expect that to progress throughout '24? And then could we also check in a little bit longer term on how you're feeling about that Model e margin target of, I think it's 8% by the end of '26 annualized, right? Including after GM recently lowered their '25 EV margin target. And given that I think you rolled out that 8% before Tesla cut their prices and saw their overall margin actually like decline to be basically in line with yours. If you're still targeting 8% with the '24 guide out there now, it's really only '25 is the mystery. So it seems like quite a step-up then over the course of '25 to '26. I know you do expect a big boost from those second-generation EVs you discussed earlier but in comparison to the mixed fuel models. But is that just -- is that enough to get you to the 8% or are there other sources of improvement that need to layer in over '25 and '26? I don't know, vertical integration or what are those sources of savings? And how are you feeling about that target?\nJohn Lawler: Yes. So I think it's clear, given the dynamics in the marketplace and the way the top line come down significantly since we had put that out there that the 8% is not on in the 2026 time period. So I think that's clear. I don't think anybody believes that by '26, we can bridge from here to 8%. It's going to come down to launching our next generation of vehicles and improving the contribution margin, gross margin, as Marin has said, on the first generation as we go through the year. But Marin, do you want to add more color to that?\nMarin Gjaja: John, I think that's right. I think it's really the levers we're pulling this year to improve gross margin over time on Gen 1 and then really sticking to the capital discipline and the operating discipline around launching Gen 2 only when they can be profitable and deliver the kind of returns we want. And over time, that will build a stand-alone profitable EV business. Thanks.\nRyan Brinkman: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session, and the conference has also now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Sure. Thanks, Jim. If we just think about what the Gen 1 vehicles can do for us, we're building the EV business and, at the same time, we need the compliance value. We mentioned before the value of the credits that generated allow us to sell these high-margin ICE vehicles. Each EV sold allows us to sell multiple high-margin vehicles. A Lightning can offset roughly... Including Pro. We're also building new customer-facing capabilities. We are satisfying demand that is out there where there's high levels of adoption. We've got new dealer standards, changing experience for the customer for shop and buy ownership and service so that we're learning what's required to serve these customers, both us and our dealers. We're developing a charging network through our dealers and together with Tesla. Now the adoption varies tremendously by geography. As Jim mentioned, across the West Coast, we're seeing 30% of the market in F-150 being in EVs. That volume is giving us a feedback loop for engineering. We're developing these electric powertrains. We've got better handle on thermal propagation, and the software and services that these customers demand much more intensely than a typical ICE customer, we're learning how to deliver those much better, much more efficiently and with higher quality. I would be remiss if we ignore the lifetime value of both the customer and the vehicle. We've got a 60% conquest rate on Gen 1 and the integrated services like BlueCruise that we can sell in these vehicles goes through the whole life of the vehicle. Yes. I think what we're seeing with our dealers is they've been making margins comparable to their ICE vehicles in the last year. And in '21 and '22, we're actually doing better than their ICE vehicles when pricing was really strong. So we feel really good about making sure our dealers are making money on this and are making investments for the long-term. But I think that's something that we monitor closely. I think just building on Jim's point quickly, I would just say the big difference for consumers is they make that 1 choice every few years, whereas the Pro customer is changing their fleet, consistently buying lots of vehicles, and they test and they learn what the TCO difference is that total cost of operation. Yes, I don't think we're prepared right now to commit to a specific timing on when we're going to be positive EBIT. We are going to expect to see improving gross margin quarter-over-quarter over the course of the year. John mentioned some of the levers we're starting to pull, and we will continue to adjust to the market realities. We've changed our production. We have increased C&I as need be to address our inventory issues. And we're going to keep working on our cost. We've taken 4,000 to 5,000 out of the BOM on Mustang Mach-E since it was launched and 2,000 to 3,000 out of Lightning and the team continues to work. But the market is turned and it's going to be a challenge. And I don't know that we can commit because we don't know exactly what's going to happen in the market. In terms of warranty costs, our Generation 1 vehicles, as we mentioned earlier, have been incredibly valuable for us to learn about a set of the issues around batteries and thermal obligation. And we will continue to work on that to lower our warranty costs dramatically for Generation 2, but we've got to deliver that in partnership with Kumar and the industrial platform. And that portfolio is going to be freshened or new by the year-end. Yes. We expect growth in sales on the retail side as well. Remember, we had times where we were out of production last year on Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning. So we'll be overlapping those, we'll see growth. And then more importantly, we're launching Explorer in Europe in the second half of this year so that's going to be a new offering that will help us grow. So we expect to see substantial unit volume growth. John, I think that's right. I think it's really the levers we're pulling this year to improve gross margin over time on Gen 1 and then really sticking to the capital discipline and the operating discipline around launching Gen 2 only when they can be profitable and deliver the kind of returns we want. And over time, that will build a stand-alone profitable EV business. Thanks."

            "name": "Jim Farley",
            "content": "Thank you, Lynn. And hi, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Last year turned out to be a fundamental year, a foundational year for our company. We launched some amazing [Technical Difficulty] Hi, everyone. I'm not sure where we got cut off but I want to just highlight how important last year was not only financially but a foundational year for our team. Our power choice and our powertrains really came through, and you can really see that on the F-Series, which I'll talk about in a second. Our global hybrid sales were up 20% last year and we expect them to be up 40% this year. We're now the number one and number two best-selling hybrid trucks in the U.S. Maverick is number one and we're the number three hybrid brand in the U.S. behind Toyota and Honda. But unlike them, our hybrids really sell best on trucks for our side. We launched some awesome tech. BlueCruise just passed 150 million miles of hand-free use, but more importantly, the growth is up 25% quarter-over-quarter and the gross margins for BlueCruise are at 70%-plus, the same for Ford Pro Intelligence. And boy, can Ford do work vehicles. The new Super Duty and Transit are off to great starts as is the new Ranger. We are really focused as a team on the segmentation. You can see the speed, the accountability for results and focus within the company. And our underlying business is getting better, as John will show. Despite the UAW strike, our auto profits were up year-over-year. We returned to investment grade, we have higher ROIC, and we have really solid conversion from profits to cash. We're returning capital to shareholders, we're declaring a regular and a special dividend, and we're getting much more disciplined on capital not just where we allocate, but more importantly, how much we spend and when. Our Integrated Services are really accelerating under Peter Stern. These are high-growth, high margin, as I said, and much less cyclical profits for us. We have one single leader, Kumar Galhotra on our industrial system and he is laser focused on quality and cost. And our international operations have made a remarkable turnaround after a lot of difficult restructuring. It's the second year we made profit. It's about a $3 billion turnaround compared to just three or four years ago. And what would surprise people is what a juggernaut Ranger has become. It's a global franchise and it's our second best-selling nameplate globally, just behind F-Series and ahead of Super Duty. Now John is going to go into last year's results. It was a solid year, but I want to be really clear, we are nowhere near our earnings potential for Ford Motor Company. And we are really positioned well this year for growth and profitability, for revenues as well. I'm going to cover four key areas. The first area is Ford Pro. It's nearly a $60 billion high-margin hardware, software and physical services business and most of that revenue is reoccurring. I believe Ford Pro is where the industry is going, an integrated business between all three of those factors. And we're seeing it first there because the customers use the vehicle more intensely and are more willing to pay for software. And we believe the attributes of Ford Pro are undervalued, but the performance will reveal that over time and look at the performance last year. Ford Pro doubled its EBIT to $7 billion despite a significant slowdown on Super Duty during the launch in the name of quality. And we're now on track for mid-teen EBIT margins at Pro. And you're going to see top and bottom line growth this year in Pro. We have the freshest product lineup in Ford's work history in two decades. Our order banks are exceeding our supply. And the reason why that order bank is so strong is fundamentally different economic factors than our retail business. What I mean by that is, look at North America. We're really dominant. We do really well on state and local government Pro sales. These are very profitable. And last year, state and local governments increased their spending by $75 billion or 16%, and a sizable portion of that is in infrastructure and people need Super Duties and Transits. Look at the build-out of telecom and 5G, directly correlates to our robust revenues. And the same is happening in the manufacturing sector in the U.S. with reshoring or onshoring manufacturing. Dealers are clamoring for more Pro allocation. They normally get only 50% to 75% of the volume they want. And in Europe, it's the ninth straight year of Ford being the best-selling CV brand, and we're just in the middle of launching the Super Duty of Europe, the Transit Custom and the new Ranger is now ramping up. Why do we think we're undervalued in Pro? Well, there's a couple of reasons. The first is our market leadership is a little bit opaque. We don't just lead in Pro, we dominate. We're 40% of the market share of Class 1 through 7 full-sized trucks and vans. In fact, many months, our second-place competitor isn't even half our size. Now commercial -- commanding that share means that we are dominant in vocations like service construction, utility and, as I said, government. But our biggest success is in TAMs where the market is biggest, small and medium-sized businesses and tradespeople. That's the backbone of the U.S. economy, and boy, does Ford have a reputation with those customers. Our second big moat is upfitters. Again, very difficult for investors to see but this is really significant. Every one of our landscapers, plumbers, electricians, they all upfit their Transits and Super Duties and Rangers specific to their vocation. So these upfitters being really important. We now have already developed a digital upfit integration system, and we share engineering specs with all those upfitters. We've been working with them for decades and they really trust Ford. They're even able to move their upfit equipment from old Fords to new Fords. The third big moat is a growing one. It's software and our physical repair business. Example of that is last year, we already have 0.5 million active software paid subscriptions at Pro. It's up 46% and the margins are over 50%. In two years, we expect software and services to drive 20% of the Pro EBIT. And that's supported by two things: getting to 60% mix on our connected vehicles and a threefold increase in our attach rates for those paid subscriptions that I mentioned, which are only at about 12% today. One of the biggest advantages we have in Pro that's hard for people to see is our physical repair network. It costs a lot of money to create, costs decades of time and there's a lot of expertise. In the U.S., we have 23,000 service bays that are busy seven days a week, 24 hours a day, and we're pressing on that advantage. Every day, we have new, very large service elite repair centers launching in the U.S. We haven't waited for brick-and-mortar. We now have 1,200 vans and Super Duties that are outfitted for remote service to our fleet customers. The Net Promoter Score is 10 points higher because they don't have to come on with the dealership. And this has effectively added 10% more capacity for our service. The bottom line is, we have these amazing vehicles. We have a leading market share position. We're now adding long-term durability of those products. We have a highly profitable alternative revenue streams in repair and software now. Ford Pro is really a magical breakthrough for our customers and our company and, I believe, the industry. Quality, we don't have to go into the negative effects about quality, but we've been addressing it for three years now and we're starting to see progress. Our vision is that we want to give customers, who buy our trucks and vans and our passion products, off-road, Bronco, all of it, the long-term durability from companies like Toyota and Honda, but in the segments we compete in. We already have world-class quality in many parts of our company, and now we're seeing green shoots in North America. Kumar is leading this and he's here for Q&A to answer any questions. But there are two aspects of quality I want to highlight. The first is launch quality. That Super Duty launch I mentioned, it was a line in the sand for this management team. We intensified all of our testing, our real-world problem-solving on the plant with our suppliers and engineers. We slowed down the launch and boy, did it cost us. $1 billion of EBIT we forego last year, but it was the right trade-off for our company and our customers. The result is the launch spike that every launch has we think on Super Duty is now similar to best-in-class in our industry, and we're seeing the benefits in the F-150 launch. That launch is underway right now and it's a really important one for our company. The second area of quality we're seeing progress on is initial quality. Now we measure that in three months in service. And that is highly correlated to long-term quality, and yes, warranty costs. And we saw last year a 10% increase. That is the largest improvement in the similar quality that we saw last time in 2016. It's the best in a long time and we are committing to a similar improvement this year. Quality now factors into 70% of the short-term incentives for our management at Ford. In the long-term, it's even more important, because we're measuring total shareholder return. We will share those KPIs on quality with you every quarter. Next thing I'd like to highlight is EVs. Now someone portrayed the change in the EV market as Darwinian. That could be a slow evolutionary change, but we think this has been a seismic change in the last six months of last year. That will rapidly sort out winners and losers in our industry. Now the catalyst for that seismic change is a combination of EV manufacturers cutting their price by 20% across all major geographies and a tremendous amount of capital flowing and a ton of new capacity into one single segment, two-row crossovers. Our overall EV strategy has never been more relevant as the seismic change happens, and we want to share with you our targets. Our next Gen 2 products will be profitable in the first 12 months of their launch. And that will mean that we'll get to mid to high single-digit EBIT profit margins over their life cycle, and that's going to deliver profits above Model e's cost of capital. And here are our big bets and adjustments. We're going to spend less capital on larger EVs. And as we've always said, we'll have a very small number of those. We're going to focus those large EVs on geographies and product segments where we have a dominant advantage like trucks and vans. And those products will have breakthrough efficiency compared to our Gen 1 products, and they're going to be packed with innovations that customers are going to be excited to pay for. We're also adjusting our capital switching more focused on to smaller EV products. Now this is important because we made a bet in silence two years ago. We developed a super-talented skunkworks team to create a low-cost EV platform. It was a small group, small team, some of the best EV engineers in the world, and it was separate from the Ford mothership. It was a startup. And they've developed a flexible platform that will not only deploy to several types of vehicles but will be a large installed base for software and services that we're now seeing at Pro. All of our EV teams are ruthlessly focused on cost and efficiency in our EV products because the ultimate competition is going to be the affordable Tesla and the Chinese OEMs. And that bet and all of the rightsizing of capital and even delays to some of our products, given the market realities, better balance growth, profits and returns for us. But one of the things we're taking advantage of and taking some timing delays is rationalizing the level and timing of our battery capacity to match demand and actually reassessing the vertical integration that we're relying on and betting on new chemistries and capacities. Our overall EV business will grow this year because we have the Explorer launching in Europe and really exciting, many of our commercial vehicles launched with electric this year as we refresh the lineup. We will also align production and inventory for customer demand. EV customers are also helping us in a very critical area of software quality. They really, really are teaching us a lot. And this is a critical place where I think we're ahead as a company. Why are we making these changes in our EV business and capital allocation? Well, because we learned as an early leader as we scale the EVs and hybrids simultaneously. The demand curve turns out to be for EV is very different than ICE. We've seen an explosive growth in EVs in 2021 and 2022, and we realize very quickly that our first three Gen 1 products, we didn't have enough capacity. With EV growth, but as well importantly, the COVID supply shocks and the chip crisis itself and Tesla's ability to make vehicles despite the chip crisis in \u201821 and \u201822 and the zero cost of capital gave us too optimistic of a demand signal at that time, and it drove a temporary spike in supply. As the COVID shock retreated, we learned that as you scale EVs to 5,000 to 7,000 units a month and you move into the early majority customer, they are not willing to pay a significant premium for EVs. This is a huge moment for us. What we've seen, because we offer everything, is pricing quickly converged to hybrids after any benefit from subsidies. Now Tesla found out this first but we were right behind that, and they were very exposed to early majority. But we learned very quickly, and I want to say that no one will be immune to this reality. The most obvious indicator of this reality is looking at total revenue, not units for EVs. Look at the U.S. market. EV total revenue was down in the second-half of last year versus Q2. If you look at unit volumes, they were up. That is a really important insight we learned in being a first mover. The same thing happened in China, same thing happened in Europe. Our data shows that EVs are a clear destination for many customers based on their unique duty cycle. It's going to take time more than we expected 18-months ago. But we are seeing big adoption variances by geography, and that's why the power of choice at Ford is so important and a big advantage for us. We're betting that choice and flexible manufacturing is going to get us successfully through this transition. Look at the best-selling vehicle in the United States, the F-150. We have a lightning, we have a hybrid and high volume and a nice choice. In Q4, in California, our mix was 50% hybrid and EV F-150 and 50% ICE. 1,000 miles away in Dallas, it was only 15% hybrid and EV, 85% ICE. You go around the world, you'll see same variations. Hybrids will play an increasingly important role in our industry's transition and will be here for the long run. Hybrid just hit specific customer use cases. On a Maverick pickup truck, our hybrid is focused on mileage and efficiency and they do the math very clearly, and they don't have to change their behaviors. On F-150 Hybrid, they get the same benefits even when they're toeing on fuel efficiency, but we throw in Pro Power on board on top of that to displace a very expensive generator cost. And margins on hybrids are closer to ICE, much higher than EV margins. The journey on EVs is inevitable in our eyes and we have a bright future of EVs. We're adjusting our capital and we're giving customers choice. Last thing I want to mention is talent. None of these breakthroughs in our company operationally or financially or in technical excellent innovation are going to happen without the right talent. And we've learned that the right talent is not sufficient. Over the last two years, it's been imperative that we go to a right performance management system. It's a fundamental change in the way we're running the company. We now truly differentiate and reward excellence at Ford, and that matches our operation and our business delivery. It's a massive culture change. Evolving to a compensation and benefit structure weighed more towards variable compensation that is tied to our delivery business results is fantastic. You can't bring in and retain the best talent without making this change. And now our long-term incentives and our short-term incentives are tied specifically to shareholder value creation. Over to you, John. [Technical Difficulty] enthusiasm towards it. But relative to EVs, there's a lot we can do, and there's a lot we're doing. I think you're going to see a lot of seismic changes in the industry because of this pricing power reality that we've all faced. More OEM relationships, different shifting to a buy versus a build or vertical integration, shifting in capital and generally more focus on smaller vehicles. The EV customers are very robust. They really like the vehicles. They do not repurchase ICE or hybrid vehicles. They're very loyal and they love the vehicles, so it's on us to get the cost right. That is the issue with the transition. The good news is Ford has a high-volume hybrid business, and the timing of our second cycle product gives us a chance to make a lot of adjustments in capital, bringing it down, including and it allows us to execute them with a cost approach that's very different than our first generation. And I think all of our commitments to make money in the first 12-months of all of our launches, to have that kind of profitability in Model e, to return its cost of capital, I wouldn't be saying it if I didn't believe it. And it's also got a lot of other benefits, which I want the team to explain and that are really important to understand. Marin, maybe you want to go over those, or John? Including Pro. Anything else, John? By the way, Pro includes electric. And although electric is going slower for Pro customers, it's actually they do the math quicker than retail customers. And so actually, our January EV sales in Pro were higher than December, which would ever make sense. But we're seeing more and more Pro customers go electric if their duty cycle makes sense. So even for Pro, it's important for our success. Thank you. Well, person right next to me, John was the head of Ford at China and knows the Changan leadership really well. John and I went to a trip last spring and it was really eye-opening for us. I mean, as two leaders who look to each other said, holy cow. I think, first of all, China as an export for our very profitable overseas markets is really important now. And actually, we shouldn't overlook the importance of JMC now. We have really profitable export business in China, ICE and EV. We're going to actually a very different strategy, I think our competitors in China with a very low capital approach to EVs. So we don't -- we see the kind of bloodbath reality now in China on EVs, and we're watching that really carefully. We don't think it's a good time to jump in with both feet in China with EVs, but we're allowing our partners' platforms to lead our electrification. And in doing that, we are learning a lot about their capability and the local IP there in China. And it's pretty breathtaking to see what we're learning. I think our approach of very low capital, profitable business is appropriate at this moment in time for this kind of EV explosion, but also bloodbath and profitability. And I think we're also building a global capability team for digital experience, battery and sensing tech and product concepting in China that we'll use globally. I think even though that's not a profit or loss thing, we see that as a real capability globally. So our strategy is quite different but I think it works for our company. You can imagine -- John, you can -- thank you for your question. You can imagine with our choice portfolio being big on scaled hybrids, ICE, of course, and EV, this is a very fundamental question for us because we have to plan our capacity years out. Here's what we found. Customers are doing the quick showroom math on hybrids. They can quickly evaluate the breakeven between ICE and a hybrid on the showroom floor. For an F-150, they can -- they know how much a Honda generator cost versus Pro Power on board, and they don't have to change their behavior. A lot of the operating cost efficiencies in EV for a mainstream customer require change like installing a charger at home, or they're uncertain. How much will I save on repair cost? How much will I save on electrons versus gasoline? It's harder to compare. And so we're just seeing the cost of ownership, which is interesting, because the success of EVs and Pro is a customer that does that math more brutally and they use the vehicle at a higher utilization. So they're looking at cost of ownership in a much clearer lens. And therefore, some of them are doing the math and going to EV. I think that math has always been there for HEV, but now more customers are interested in doing that. And we believe that customers are smart and some people would do these cycles for EVs. So going to do that math over time and it's worth investing because it's a really good business. But it's on us to get the cost right. So I just think we're seeing the math for an EV customer, mainstream EV customer is a little bit more opaque than what we see on hybrid. We're hearing -- Marin, do you want to say anything quickly about dealers? And as far as the manufacturing capacity, we planned that 40% growth in HEVs years ago, so that is our capacity. We may have some pricing room above that. And we've seen actually HEV pricing become more robust as we hit these capacity limits. But 40% growth is a big increase for us. We think we got it about right. That means like on an F-150, America's best-selling vehicle, we think 25% of the sales or America's best-selling vehicles can be hybrid. And I think we're going to get close to some of the all-hybrid nameplates out there that people think of when they think of hybrids with F-150. So we have a lot of flexibility. I think we're in good shape. A couple of key messages. First of all, I mentioned Ford Pro and what a profit juggernaut that is. We continue to need our dealers to invest in the brick-and-mortar in those remote service van and accelerate that because that is the upside. We want to get to -- if we want to get to 20% of the profit for Pro being attached services, it's going to have to come on the back of capacity in our dealers and vans. So invest in Pro. The second thing is we have manufacturing flexibility between ICE and EV and hybrid. So we want to make sure that they understand that we're in probably better shape than any other brand in this transition. The third message is we want them to understand our progress on quality, and we are going to press to be among the leaders in retailing. They should keep for our customer, remote pickup and service, doing more repairs for our retail customers remote, and that takes investment in their side. We really want to step on the gas on customer experience, both ownership and purchase. And I think that has to come from the top. Jim Farley has to say to all these dealers who are private investors, we need your partnership right now. That's why I'm going on the tour. Well, we're not going to go to market with the vehicle unless we completely convinced ourselves that it's going to be profitable. And that takes some adjustments on timing actually. And we see opportunity in the short term to make some adjustments. But yes, I know it's a huge turnaround and it's a big number. John, maybe you want to go into the actual losses in Model e just to pick them apart a little bit. And then I think you'll see a little bit more about the opportunity we have at Gen 2. And Rod, we have a lot of stakeholders at Ford so we're not going to go in a lot of details, but we have optionality even this year in capital spending. I mean, a lot of that guide is EVs. John, I don't know if you want to be specific but... And we're driving as a team to be on the low end of that range. Because we are working hard on our EV spend. And I just want to make sure we don't want to leave this call with the fact that this is totally baked. We are working really hard to be on the low end of that range because we think it's appropriate to run the business. We have the leader of our EV business here, Marin, so I think that question goes to you on timing and warranty. Well, first of all, I tried to explain the fundamental factors for our vehicle profitability in Pro that's driving that demand will be here for a while. It's basic infrastructure, government state, 5G, onshoring, manufacturing, manufacturing sector. We believe that, that's very durable. And by the way in Europe, we've been the top-selling brand there for nine years and we have very old products. So we haven't even seen the effect of Transit Custom and Ranger that's all coming our way. We feel that this is a pretty robust profitability because we've never had the 20% attach rates. We've never had 0.5 million units of software with 50% margins. We've never really focused on Pro aftersales like we are now. We're just getting started with this 20% of the profitability coming from attached services. And I think that totally changes the risk portfolio of our commercial business. And we -- this is a real opportunity for our company that we never had. I also believe that attach rates are the kind of things that we'll start to see on the retail side of our business. Blue's software is now 70% margin and it's high volume now. And we're just getting started with that optionality. So what it will be five years from now? I'm not sure the time frame of your question, hard to predict. But for the next couple of years, we're in a really good spot because the shovels are in the ground or about to get in the ground. The one other thing about Pro that we have to watch really carefully, which would be even more upside is a return to a robust construction housing market, which has been really slow in the last couple of years. If that starts to fire up, we're going to even have more capacity issues on Pro. On the retail side, I'll ask Marin to answer that. On Pro, absolutely, our EV sales will grow not only because we're seeing more interest because the cost of ownership is advantageous for some, but we're also expanding in Europe quite a bit our electric offering with our two Transit vans coming online. And so that will definitely -- and there are a lot of city closures and other kind of regulations in Europe that's driving adoption for electric vehicles, especially vans specifically. So yes, we'll have very robust growth in our EVs for Pro. So design, labor and freight, yes primarily."

            "name": "John Lawler",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. So 2023 was an important year as we continued to execute our Ford+ plan. Our strong global product line, which is clearly resonating with our customers, delivered revenue of $176 billion, which was up 11%, marking our second consecutive year of double-digit growth. We delivered $10.4 billion in adjusted EBIT, at the high end of our guidance, driven by continued strength in both Blue and Pro. Now to provide some perspective, compared to last year collectively, our core business units, Pro, Model e, and Blue grew, improved EBIT by $2 billion or 26%, and this is after fully absorbing roughly $1.7 billion impact of the UAW strike. Free cash flow was $6.8 billion, generating a free cash flow conversion rate of 65%. And this is above the top end of our target range and was driven by underlying strength in both Pro and Blue. Now both of these metrics provide a good litmus test for the effectiveness of our Ford+ strategy. Our balance sheet remains strong with nearly $29 billion in cash and more than $46 billion in liquidity. And this provides considerable flexibility to manage our business as the industry continues to transform. With the improving trajectory of our business and strong free cash flow, we announced a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share plus a supplemental dividend of $0.18 per share. This brings our payout ratio to 50% for the year, in line with our target to consistently return 40% to 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. Now let's take a closer look at our performance. Revenue for the quarter was $46 billion, up 4% despite the impact of the strike, which cost us roughly 90,000 units of production. Adjusted EBIT came in at $1.1 billion with an EBIT margin of 2.3%, which again included the impact of the strike. Now let's look at our segments. Ford Pro delivered another strong quarter with revenue up 11%, EBIT of $1.8 billion was up 25% with a margin of 11.8%. Full year results clearly demonstrated the potential earnings power of this growth business. Revenue jumped 19% and EBIT more than doubled year-over-year to $7.2 billion, an improvement of $4 billion. And with a margin of 12.4%, we're just shy of our mid-teen target. The strengths Jim highlighted for Ford Pro are differentiated and drove strong results this year and have Pro poised for another strong year in 2024. Ford Model E drove a 14% increase in wholesales in the quarter, a 2% increase in revenue and EBIT loss of $1.6 billion. For the year, wholesales were up 20%, revenue was up 12% and EBIT was a loss of $4.7 billion. Both the quarter and year were impacted by challenging market dynamics and investments in next-generation vehicles, both of which Jim addressed in his remarks. In the quarter, Ford Blue revenue was flat despite the loss of roughly 60,000 units due to the strike. EBIT was $113 million with a margin of 3.1%. For the year, Ford Blue grew again with revenue up 8%. All of our regions are now profitable and contributing significantly to Blue's bottom line results. EBIT of $7.5 billion was up year-over-year with a margin of 7.3%. The improvement in EBIT reflects the underlying strength of our product portfolio, dampened by higher warranty and the UAW-related costs. Turning to Ford Credit. Ford Credit generated EBT of $280 million in the quarter and $1.3 billion for the year. As expected, full-year results were down year-over-year. Credit loss performance continues to normalize but remains below our historical average. Now before I turn to guidance, I wanted to touch briefly on capital allocation. One of the benefits of our segmentation, in addition to increased transparency and accountability, is that we are now allocating capital based on the growth opportunities in different risk and return profile of our segments. This allows us to assign specific risk-adjusted hurdle rates for each of our businesses, driving greater accountability to returns on the capital we invest. So here's how we're thinking about 2024 guidance. For the full year, we expect to earn between $10 billion to $12 billion in adjusted EBIT. The high end of the range would be a record for Ford. Adjusted free cash flow of $6 billion to $7 billion and capital expenditures of $8 billion to $9.5 billion, flat to moderately up year-over-year. So let me double click on capital expenditures. We expect EVs to be about 40% of the total, and this reflects products already in flight, including investments in EV powertrain supporting our next generation of products in our LFP battery plant here in Michigan. As we continue to adjust to market dynamics, we are scrutinizing every dollar and will continue to drive efficiencies, targeting to land at the lower end of our CapEx range. For example, in 2023, we already started to take action. We delayed our second JV battery plant. We reduced the size of our new LFP plant in Michigan, and we did not proceed with our JV battery plant in Turkey. And now we are further adjusting installed capacity to match demand, reassessing vertical integration in new battery chemistries, adjusting Gen 2 products and potentially their launch timing to ensure they meet our criteria for profitability, given the new market reality. Our 2024 outlook also assumes -- a flat to slightly higher SAAR in both the U.S. and Europe, and our planning assumption for the U.S. is 16 million to 16.5 million units, Nonrecurrence of the UAW strike, full year of our all-new Super Duty driving both positive pricing and mix in Ford Pro, industry supply and demand normalizing. Now from a planning perspective, we are assuming lower industry pricing of roughly 2%, driven by higher incentive spending as we move through the year. We expect this to be partially offset by top line growth from the launch of our new products. In addition, we're assuming a $2 billion benefit from cost reduction initiatives that offset higher labor and product refresh costs. Within the segments, we expect Ford Pro's strength will continue unabated. With continued strong demand for our leading products, we are targeting EBIT between $8 billion to $9 billion, driven by continued growth and favorable mix, partially offset by moderated pricing. For Model E, we expect losses to widen to a range of $5 billion to $5.5 billion, driven by continued pricing pressure and investments in our next-generation vehicles. We expect our first-generation vehicles to improve their profits throughout the year. Ford Blue, EBIT to be about equal to last year at $7 billion to $7.5 billion, reflecting a balanced market equation, including the impact of our all-new F-150. We also expect costs to be flat as we offset higher labor and product cost with efficiencies. And we expect Ford Credit's EBT to be up slightly year-over-year to about $1.5 billion. Now taking a step back, our performance last year reflects the positive momentum of our Ford+ plan. Capital discipline is driving the right global footprint, portfolio of products and consistent cash generation. We continue to see growth opportunities and remain focused on delivering improvements in both quality and cost. Now that wraps our prepared remarks. We'll use the balance of the time to address what's on your mind. Thank you. Operator, please open up the line for questions. Yes. I mean, the only thing I would say is, Adam, one of the important things, just on top of that, is that the segmentation is really important here. And we know that the EV business needs to stand on its own, right? We're very clear about that. And it needs to generate a profit and a return on the capital we're investing. Now we're not there yet but that's what we're working towards. The compliance benefit that we get, that's important. We can sell up to a dozen ICE F-150s or other ICE profitable vehicles for every Lightning we sell. But that -- we don't do anything with wooden nickels. We don't do any credit into EV, into Model e or anything like that because eventually, this business has to stand on its own sooner rather than later. And that's a really important point. It's clean. Yes, the biggest issue we have in our Gen 1 vehicles, of course, is that the revenue collapsed and they're not optimized from a cost standpoint. We put them through very quickly to get to market and you're seeing that flow through. But I think, Rod, part of what you were getting at is that we have no choice. And we will continue to work on improving the cost structure of the Gen 1 vehicles. And as Jim said, our Gen 2 vehicles we won't launch unless we can get to a profit and a return on that capital that we're investing there at the pricing environment that we now understand is reality. So yes, it is very much the mother of all optimization modeling and work around the balance between how many EVs we sell because we talked about the compliance benefit of that. For every Lightning, we can sell 12 ICE vehicles. We can sell a number of ICE vehicles with every Mach-E we sell, and so there's that balance. And then there's the balance of what we need to sell from the ICE standpoint and how we can improve with HEVs there, and that's a benefit, too. But there's also, and you'll see that in our K tomorrow, we are buying credits as they're available. So we have to optimize across all three of those frontiers and that's what we're working on right now. But we know that we have to have this electric vehicle business stand on its own and be profitable because we know that there are competitors out there. We talked about that the Chinese as well as Tesla that are profitable, and we have to cross that fulcrum and get there. And that's what our goal is. So it needs to be a benefit of profitable business, return on the capital plus the compliance benefit that we get from those. It's about 40% last year and 40% of our CapEx this year and is EV. Absolutely. So Rod, I think the last part of your question was around, are we going to start to see costs turn? I would say that from a warranty standpoint, costs are probably going to be about flat this year. We're starting to see green shoots in the quality improvements. But as you know, the way that works, there's a lag. And Kumar can touch upon this a little bit more, but this year, we expect to see $2 billion of efficiencies flow through. And those efficiencies are in the material cost in the industrial system, pretty much offsetting the impact of the UAW. But also remember, 60% of our global portfolio this year will be refreshed. And coming with that will be incremental costs that we have for new features, compliance, et cetera. And so what we should see this year is the efficiencies of $2 billion offsetting the UAW labor contract plus the refresh costs of our 60% of our products being refreshed this year. Yes. What I would say is that it is now we're starting to gain the traction and that gap should start to narrow. And your -- that's part of the $2 billion. And so it's going to be across the industrial system, both in material and in labor. And I think Kumar can share some more details on how he's leading that and driving that. Emmanuel, the other thing I would add to that is that when you look at '22 and '23, we were very much behind the curve of supply base, catching up to where they were and understanding what was driving their inefficiencies in claims. And we spent a lot of time in 2023 getting out in front of that. And I would say that we ended '23 with a great work that Liz has done to be at a very different place with our supply base. And now we're working together with them very proactively across industrial system to identify efficiencies, things that we can change to help them and, as Kumar said, design actions, et cetera, things like that, that will make them more efficient as well. So that's another bit of color to add to that. Yes, so a lot in there. What I think you should see from a calendarization standpoint on the cost for 2024 is that you'll see, as Kumar said, a lot of these are the design actions we've been working to identify in 2023 that have built up this cadre of actions we call the hopper. And those will start coming through on the model year turnover. So more towards the middle of the year, you'll start to see a lot more traction there on those. Some of the manufacturing improvements, you'll see throughout the quarters, probably a little bit more of an even flow of those, I would say, right, Kumar? And so that's where we're at. When you look at our day's supply, when you look at our Blue day's supply, retail deal day's supply is in the low to mid-50s, so it's at about the limit of where we expect it to be. So leaning back that into volume, we expect the industry to be -- for the year, we expect it to be about 16 to 16.5 so maybe up 3% to 4% for us from a wholesale standpoint about that. From a planning perspective, that's where we're at. From a pricing perspective, we're planning to see about a 2% decline, negative pricing. And then when you step back and you look at that from an affordability standpoint, we think 2024 is the year where affordability is going to get back to pre-pandemic levels, where the monthly disposable income it takes to buy a vehicle should be back to about that 13% to 13.5%, which is what we saw before pandemic. So we're going to continue to see some top line pressure on Blue. We've got new product coming in Blue, which is going to give us some mix and some tailwind there. So that's going to be a positive for Blue. And then I think Jim covered off Pro. We're seeing incredible demand on Pro. And as you know, Emmanuel, those commercial orders come in two tranches. Half of them came in last year so they're all set. The other half are coming through now and we're continuing to see strength there. Yes. A lot of the $2 billion is, again, through the manufacturing system so it's the industrial efficiencies that we've been working on. And then from a design and material standpoint, it's mostly design reductions that are part of the $2 billion on a year-over-year basis. So it's those actions that we've been benchmarking and working on similar to the ideas that Kumar had described, pretty much design-related. Yes. So I think it's clear, given the dynamics in the marketplace and the way the top line come down significantly since we had put that out there that the 8% is not on in the 2026 time period. So I think that's clear. I don't think anybody believes that by '26, we can bridge from here to 8%. It's going to come down to launching our next generation of vehicles and improving the contribution margin, gross margin, as Marin has said, on the first generation as we go through the year. But Marin, do you want to add more color to that?"

            "name": "Kumar Galhotra",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, John. Well, this year, we're starting very differently than '24 than '23, for example. A couple of fundamental different things. Last year, we had a lot of inflationary pressures and claims from our suppliers. Those have eased very substantially and are going to help us deliver the $2 billion that John talked about. The second thing is the supply chain is much more stable. That allows us to run our entire system much more smoothly and helps us remove a lot of waste. It also reduces a lot of our freight cost because we've been doing a lot of premium freight last couple of years so that will help as well. And in terms of material, we're attacking it in like 3 different ways. One is where our designs are not efficient, so I want to give you a bit of color on what those are, a couple of examples. In one of our vehicle lines, we were using certain aero shields for fuel economy and the fresh eyes Kaizen review internally and some benchmarking, the team came up with a different way of delivering the same aero and save $40 per vehicle. So that's equivalent to about $10 million per year. Another category is where we are providing certain features to our customers where they're not finding a lot of value. And connected vehicle data here is very important because it helps us see what we're providing, whether the customers are using it or not. So one example is an auto part feature that lets the customer parallel park automatically. Very, very few people are using it. So we can remove that feature. It's about $60 per vehicle, another $10 million per year. We're doing very extensive benchmarking for our manufacturing, both internally because we have lots of good ideas within our system and externally at a station-by-station level. So just recently, one of the teams completed analysis of about 50 stations and saved about $8 million. And I already mentioned the freight. So these are the kinds of very robust ideas we have in the hopper, along with less inflationary claims, along with a stable supply chain that's going to help us close that gap that John mentioned and save $2 billion this year. It's just fundamentally the things I talked about. We have a very robust hopper of ideas that we're very busy executing. Stability in supply chain, removing a lot of waste, and freight cost. So we spent a lot of money, all of us did, in premium freight. We're starting to see in fourth -- third quarter and fourth quarter a much more stable supply chain that allows us not to spend that premium and bring those costs down in 2024."

I wanted to start by thanking the Ford team who worked tirelessly and creatively over the past several months to reach a tentative agreement with the United Auto Workers. I\u2019m so pleased for our employees. This week, I was able to visit each of the struck plants. I was impressed by their preparation for start-up, and the feeling I got is people just want to get back to work. Once the deal is ratified, we will provide all of you a deeper look at the contract and its impact on our business. Right now, we\u2019re focused on restarting three important assembly plants, calling back more than 20,000 Ford employees to work, supporting our suppliers as they restart, and shipping lots of Super Duties, Explorers, and Broncos to our customers. It\u2019s been a challenging situation, for sure. Matter of fact, our business is never short of challenges, especially right now with the evolution of the EV market and new global competitors from China, as well as the technology disruptions. But I am more excited and motivated than ever. Our team is making tremendous progress every day toward building a Ford that thrives at the intersection of fantastic and iconic vehicles, terrific brands, and especially software and services. We are deep into the development of our future software platforms, which provide the foundation for rapid innovation and a profitable new software and services business and constantly improving experiences for our customers. We believe Ford+ is the right strategy to win in this constantly evolving industry transformation. We\u2019re building a more dynamic and less cyclical company, and we are nowhere near peak profitability. We have the right team and talent, and we are in the process of building a culture of excellence and execution. In a moment, John will detail the quarter, which I would call mixed. The strength of our products and revenues and businesses defined definitely came through in our results. But at the same time, we were never negatively impacted by the strike, and our cost and quality remain a drag on our business. Now, last week, we made some important leadership changes. Kumar Galhotra as COO will now control the key levers for transformative change in our industrial system, powertrain, ICE, and hybrid products, vehicle hardware engineering, cycle plan, quality, supply chain, and manufacturing, and work in tandem, of course, with Doug Field, chief EV, digital, and design officer, to move us forward. I believe this will accelerate our progress on cost and quality, and I hope we get into that in the Q&A. These are my top two priorities. Overall, we see \u2013 we are seeing the clear benefits of creating three distinct growth businesses now with Ford Blue, Model e, and Pro. The story of Ford Blue comes down to product strength. Incredibly strong brands like Mustang and Bronco and Raptor, they have durable pricing power and real choice between gas and hybrid. Ford is America\u2019s best-selling brand now through three quarters, even with the effects of the strike, and we have a wave of new products coming in the next few months, the new F-150, the Ranger, a brand-new Explorer, and Expedition and Navigator. In fact, close to 60% of our volume and revenues in the U.S. will be new and refreshed next year. I am so thankful we have kept our foot on the gas to freshen our ICE and HEV products as we enter a changing market. In Europe, we bring out new versions of Puma and Kuga or high-volume gas and hybrid SUVs, and the Ranger pickup and our Everest SUV that\u2019s based on it continued to gain share in international markets. So, bottom line, Ford Blue will be strong and a growing business for years to come. We also remain bullish on Model e and our EV future, but clearly, the market is moving \u2013 is a moving target. I\u2019m optimistic because customers are smart and are rational, and for many of them, EVs are a great choice. I\u2019ve been spending a ton of time in our product development center with both Doug Field and Alan Clarke, and you should see the Gen 2 and Gen 3 EVs we\u2019re working on. Our Gen 2 all-new full-size pickup truck, for example, is one of the most thrilling vehicles I have ever seen in my career. Let me be specific. Stunning performance like no truck has ever performed, building unexpected innovation for truck customers far beyond the normal truck attributes, a super flexible cabin that feels like a lounge or a tiny office. Take the wheels off this truck, and it\u2019s still a mind-blowing product and a digital experience that totally is immersive and personalized. I\u2019d take this truck seven days of the week over a Cybertruck. A great product is not enough in the EV business anymore. We have to be totally competitive on cost. Tesla actually gave us a huge gift with a laser-focus on cost and scaling the Model Y. They set the standard, and we are now making real progress on our second- and third-cycle EVs that are in the midst of being developed today as we get closer to the introduction. While our Gen 2 EVs were targeting to deliver an EBIT margin comparable to ICE by 2026, the dynamic changes in the market, pricing, adoption rates, regulations are forcing us to further reduce the cost of our EVs. The key levers to deliver this competitive cost structure are scaling, vertical integration, and batteries. So, let\u2019s double-click on each of these three. On scaling, this is much more than building new facilities or scaling high-quality batteries or thermal propagation. We\u2019re leveraging digital prognostic capabilities in our manufacturing lines to improve quality. We are also reducing complexity, and we are optimizing our vehicle design and engineering for manufacturability. Yep, we\u2019re designing these vehicles for our manufacturing team. On vertical integration, this is the most fundamental change. We are insourcing batteries, inverters, scaling production of our drive units and gearboxes, and designing and producing unit castings in-house at Ford. In addition, on our next-generation utility vehicles, vertical integration will increase by nearly 50%. This level of integration, along with the new zonal electric architecture and designing in-house modules and battery cell to structure, will allow us to significantly reduce material cost. Now, none of this will be easy, and it has some risk, and you\u2019ve seen our competitors struggle as they build out and ramp up these capabilities. So, we are so glad we started years ago on this journey. And finally, batteries. They\u2019re the single biggest cost component of any EV. Our more energy-efficient Gen 2 products, we use extreme aero to get the very smallest batteries possible for competitive range. And with our LFP batteries, we\u2019ll have the lowest or one of the lowest-cost batteries assembled in the U.S. Our overall EV priorities are very clear, disciplined capital allocation and investment that drives profitable, high-returning and enduring EV business, and we will constantly balance growth, scale, and profitability. These great EVs will be paired with modern shopping and buying experiences that are transparent or have non-negotiated pricing and a streamlined checkout and delivery that will come to life early in 2024. And this is also a significant cost reduction. I saved Ford Pro for the last because it\u2019s a massive driver of Ford\u2019s growth and profitability. Our competitors seem to be trying to cut and paste our strategy, but the reality is the moats we\u2019ve built over many decades for our Pro business won\u2019t be easy to cross. The network of literally thousands of local outfitters across Europe, North America, and China and customer-driven engineering we have for vehicles like F-Series and Transit is formidable across all those regions. Our commercial order banks are healthy. This may be a surprise to everyone. We see a large backlog of infrastructure projects. Thank you, 5G and roadworks. And we have very loyal customers. Fleet orders, for example, for the 2024 Super Duty are coming in faster than last year\u2019s orders, and we expect strong demand to continue as more customers recognize what Ford has to offer in total. In addition to the new Super Duty, we are preparing to launch the new Transit Custom in Europe. Think of this product as a Super Duty for Europe. It\u2019s a best-selling vehicle in the UK, not the best-selling commercial vehicle, the best-selling vehicle and the leading one-ton van in Europe. And it\u2019s a key profit pillar for Europe and one of the reasons why we stayed there. When it comes to software and services, Ford Pro is the tip of our digital spear. Customers know and trust our vehicles, of course. And we\u2019re building on this with software-driven services that provide businesses with data insights, vehicle access, even vehicle control, and functionality. This helps them drive productivity and efficiency in their fleet operations. And I\u2019ve asked Ted Cannis to also lead our large and profitable aftersales business. His focus will increase our post-warranty service business and profitability. He\u2019s already adding mobile service capability and delivering an effortless experience to both commercial and retail customers. There is so much upside in this aftersales, parts, repair, and collision business, especially with Ted leading it and for Ford Pro. I want to briefly touch on China where our strategy to turn our business around is gaining traction. The restructuring of our EV business there is nearly complete, and the internal combustion engine business is now profitable. We are now expanding China\u2019s role to a profitable export hub, including Ford Pro. We\u2019ve already exported a record number of vehicles so far from China to markets like Mexico, South America, and Asia. There is so much more opportunity ahead for us. Yes, the China market is extremely competitive in the middle, but Ford can succeed by staying asset-light, partnering where it makes sense, and competing in very narrow segments where we can clearly win like commercial vehicles, off-road vehicles, large SUVs, and Lincoln. Finally, I\u2019m so pleased to have Peter Stern on today to share more about our newly formed Ford Integrated Services, which will create and market valuable software-enabled customer experiences across Blue, e, and Pro. Now, this is transformational because the cornerstone of Ford+, the plus in our plan, is creating incredible customer services and experiences enabled by not just hardware but software. There\u2019s simply no one in the world better able than Peter, who is the driving force behind services at Apple, to build this strategically vital business for us. Peter, over to you.\nPeter Stern: Thanks, Jim. I\u2019ve spent my career creating new customer experiences and launching businesses at the intersection of hardware, software, and services. And I came to Ford because this company puts that kind of innovation at the center of its long-term strategy. As you said, it\u2019s literally the plus in Ford+. Now, over two months in, I\u2019m even more excited to be here and to be part of this exceptional team that\u2019s working together to bring the Ford+ plan to life for our customers, employees, and shareholders. Our vision for integrated services is to transform every aspect of the Ford customer experience across our three segments. We\u2019re making our vehicles even more connected, convenient, productive, secure, and exhilarating. Over the past couple of months, we\u2019ve identified a portfolio of services that will improve our customers\u2019 lives and businesses by building on our industry-leading early successes with Ford Pro Intelligence and BlueCruise. This portfolio will elevate the Ford brand and introduce us to millions of new customers who may have never considered a Ford before. It will drive new high margin, cyclical recurring revenue streams for Ford and result in stronger relationships with our customers. And we\u2019ll do this while adhering to the values that distinguish Ford from our competitors, like our respect for customer privacy, safety, and very importantly, choice. Whether you choose to add our services or not, you\u2019ll have an amazing vehicle. Our momentum around software and services is building fast. Here are three examples. First, Ford Pro Intelligence builds on Ford\u2019s industry-leading share in the commercial vehicle space by making the people who drive our vehicles even more productive and by reducing total cost of ownership. Adoption of vehicle telematics, fleet management, and charging optimization were up 20% sequentially in the third quarter, and our average revenue per subscription was up nearly 10% over the past six months, both contributing to strong revenue growth. And we\u2019re still in the early stages of our rollout. We ended the quarter with 476,000 paid subscriptions for our commercial solutions, a jump of nearly 50% year over year. And we have an ambitious product road map for Pro. For example, over the next few weeks, we\u2019ll launch the Ford Pro dashcam. This product uses machine vision and in-vehicle intelligence to detect in-cab and on-road events, simplify fleet operations, and encourage safer driving. While we\u2019re still early in our journey, Pro Intelligence is an area that we\u2019ll continue to expand and drive value for both our customers and Ford. Second, in September, we announced that the 2024 F-150 will be the first vehicle available in North America with Ford Stolen Vehicle Services. This is a fully integrated theft prevention and recovery service that provides unique features like inclination and movement alerts. So, you get notified if your truck is jacked up or moved while the engine is off. And third, BlueCruise is one of the most consequential consumer applications of artificial intelligence in the world today. Some of you experienced our last version at Capital Markets Day. If you haven\u2019t felt what it\u2019s like to take your hands off the wheel and your foot off the gas and let BlueCruise take over steering, acceleration, and braking, please visit a Ford dealer, so we can demonstrate it. Launch to date, our vehicles have been driven hands-free for 125 million miles. That\u2019s the equivalent of 500 trips to the moon, which I imagine would be largely hands-free as well. Real-world driving data from Mustang Mach-E vehicles using BlueCruise shows a more than 10 times reduction in lane departures compared with unassisted driving. And for the second time in a row, BlueCruise was just rated the best hands-free system on the market, and this was based on BlueCruise 1.0. BlueCruise 1.3 is rolling out now and adds lane change support and other refinements that keep drivers in hands-free mode, on average, five times longer than version 1.0. Our technology team, led by my partner, Doug Field, is the best in the business, and BlueCruise is the proof. Despite these encouraging successes, what we\u2019re about to do in Integrated Services won\u2019t be easy. Our multi-year playbook depends on our next-generation vehicles that are even more connected. We must also round out our customer-centric portfolio of services and evolve our customer relationship management technologies. Our dealers are a key competitive advantage for Ford, and with them, we need to make it easier to become and stay a services customer. We need to build a relationship centered around the customer, not the vehicle, because in the services space, the sale of the vehicle should be the beginning of a beautiful long-term relationship with our customers. And that necessitates not only new people, processes, and technologies but also new measures of success. So, as we progress in our services evolution, you\u2019re going to hear us talk about key metrics like addressable units in operation, attach rates, and average revenue per subscription. And as we move each of these levers in the context of a low-variable cost, high-margin service business, it will have a multiplicative effect on profits. There\u2019s incredible value to be unlocked here for our customers and for Ford, and I\u2019m proud to be a part of the team making that happen during this pivotal moment in our history. John, over to you.\nJohn Lawler: Thanks, Peter. Through the first three quarters, we delivered 9.4 billion in adjusted EBIT, a strong result that is indicative of our underlying run rate of the business. Now, given our year-to-date performance, we were on track to comfortably deliver our full-year adjusted EBIT guidance of 11 billion to 12 billion. With that said, the UAW strike created significant uncertainty regarding our full-year results, and even though we have reached a tentative agreement and our employees are starting to return to work, we have withdrawn our guidance for the year. This is in part because of the continued disruption in the industry with the ongoing strikes, the follow-on impact to our shared supply base, the ramp up of production in our plants and at our supplier partners, as well as other ancillary effects. And to provide some context, in the third quarter, the strike had an EBIT impact of roughly $100 million, and so far, the strike has trimmed about 80,000 units from our plant. This would reduce 2023 EBIT by roughly 1.3 billion. Once we have a ratified agreement and begin to ramp operations, we will be in a better position to update you on our full-year guidance. So, let me now turn to our third-quarter results, which was once again \u2013 it once again showed our Ford+ plan in action and the benefits of our diversified portfolio. Our leading Pro business and resilient ICE and hybrid products continue to deliver solid results that more than offset the investments we are making in our EV future. Our revenue remains strong, up 11%, reflecting a product lineup that resonates with customers, driving higher net pricing that remains resilient. Whole sales were flat, dampened by supply constraints affecting both F-Series and Transit production, additional unit holds for quality assurance, and the first UAW work stoppage for Ford in almost 50 years. Adjusted EBIT in the quarter was 2.2 billion with a margin of 5%. Both improved year over year. However, costs increased, underscoring the fact that we still have more work to do, especially on warranty expense and material cost. Adjusted free cash flow was 1.2 billion in the quarter, down year over year, driven by unfavorable working capital. Through the first nine months, we generated 4.8 million of adjusted free cash flow resulting in a conversion rate of 51%, in line with our target range. Our disciplined capital allocation continues to drive strong free cash flow, which will be critical as we adjust our spending to match the pace of EV adoption. We ended the quarter with over 29 billion in cash and 50 billion in liquidity, one of our strongest quarters ever, and this includes the new 4 billion contingent liquidity facility we put in place in August to help withstand uncertainties in the present environment. Now, turning to our customer-focused segments. Ford Pro generated EBIT of 1.7 billion and delivered a strong double-digit margin of 12%. Both metrics improved, driven by our Super Duty and Transit franchises that helped deliver a 16% improvement in revenue that\u2019s reflecting strong demand and continued pricing power. In addition, we are launching a new version of our flagship product in Europe, the Transit Custom, which, along with the new Super Duty and F-150, will give Pro its freshest vehicle lineup in years. We also continue to see strong growth in both our new software subscriptions and mobile repair orders, up roughly 50% and 200%, respectively, for the quarter. Regarding Model e, our EV start-up incurred 1.3 billion of losses in the quarter, reflecting continued investment in our next-generation products and a more challenging market for our Gen 1 products. Given the dynamic EV environment, we are being judicious about our production and adjusting future capacity to better match market demand. For example, we have taken out some Mustang Mach-E production, and we are also slowing down several investments, including making a decision with SK On to delay the second BlueOval SK JV battery plant in Kentucky. And we have also said we are evaluating our BlueOval Battery Park Michigan plant to determine the best path forward. In fact, all told, we have pushed about 12 billion of EV spend, which includes CapEx, direct investment, and expense. The ultimate success of our EV transition will be driven by our Gen 2 and Gen 3 products, which will be cost-optimized and guided by the learnings of our first-generation vehicles that are currently in the market. Turning to Ford Blue. In the third quarter, we delivered EBIT of 1.7 billion, up 300 million, driven by lower commodity costs and higher net pricing that more than offset higher warranty costs. The higher warranty was driven by recalls and higher per unit repair costs due to inflation. Importantly, Blue continues to be profitable in all regions with a strong, fresh portfolio poised for continued global success. Hybrids also continue to be a success, a strategy we\u2019ve had in place now for almost two decades. We are the clear leader of the hybrid pickup truck segment in the U.S, thanks to Maverick and F-150. We expect to extend its lead next year when we introduce our refreshed 2024 F-150 with more advanced technologies. The F-150 Powerboost hybrid not only offers a 25% improvement in CO2 emissions, but on average, they have more \u2013 they are more profitable than our highest-volume gas powertrains. And hybrids aren\u2019t just limited to North America as we are launching a Ranger for Europe and IMG next year. Ford Credit generated EBIT of 358 million. As expected, our results were down year over year, reflecting lower lease residuals and financing margin and the non-reoccurrence of derivatives market valuation gains. Credit loss performance remains strong and below our historical average but continues to normalize. Auction values remain strong but are down sequentially, in line with our expectations. Finally, turning to software and services. We continue to see sustained quarter-over-quarter growth in subscriptions across all our business segments and, most importantly, at gross margins of around 50%. And our next-generation digital platform will enable a step function change in capability, allowing us to scale and deliver value to both our retail and commercial customers even faster. And as Peter highlighted, as we continue to build out our capabilities here, we expect it to be a significant source of future value creation. In closing, there\u2019s obviously a tremendous amount going on in our business, but I\u2019m confident in our Ford+ plan and the underlying run rate of our business. So, that wraps up our prepared remarks. We\u2019ll use the balance of the time to address what\u2019s on your minds. Thank you, and operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question today is from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nAdam Jonas: Thanks, everybody. So, John, I know you pushed out the 12 billion of the direct and capital investment and other expenditure on EVs, but I guess I\u2019m saying \u2013 I\u2019m interpreting that as just temporary, that you still plan on spending it. So, my question is, how long can you keep allocating 10 billion a year, round number, to EVs?\nJohn Lawler: Yes. So, Adam, we\u2019re going to match demand and capital needed to meet that demand. You know, the first step here is given the flatter growth curve that we\u2019re seeing relative to what the industry expected and we expected, we\u2019ve made this decision to push out 12 billion of capital expenditures, but it doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019ll actually go ahead and pull the trigger on it if we don\u2019t need to. And we\u2019re going to look at the overall EV business and be balanced about that. There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s going to change between now, in \u201826, and \u201830, and we\u2019re going to adjust appropriately. So, it\u2019s something that\u2019s going to adjust as we move and how that business develops, and we\u2019ll adjust that capital allocation appropriately. And we\u2019ll change our strategy and make different decisions as well. And one of the other things I\u2019d say is that \u2013 well, I\u2019ll pass it over to Jim because Jim has something he wants to say.\nJim Farley: Hey, Adam, thank you for your question. I just want to emphasize the importance of our Gen 2 and Gen 3 products because they\u2019re very transformation in our profitability in EV. You know, we\u2019ve learned a lot in Gen 1. We\u2019ve reduced the material costs. We\u2019ve got the learning loop on the software. We learned how to scale batteries. We have the LFP battery now. We\u2019re starting to ship to customers, but there\u2019s only so much we can do on Gen 1. On Gen 2, I said \u2013 as I said, we have a totally different approach from aero vertical integration designed for manufacturability. And there\u2019s a lot of other things we can do beyond allocating less capital to battery plants, for example. We\u2019ve learned a lot about derivatives like rally. We\u2019re going to push services a lot more like Level 2+, Level 3 autonomy. And we really plan on even redesign or improving the scale of a components by working with other companies. And the other big breakthrough is going to be which we\u2019re designing in parallel the Gen 3 products where we use the battery as a structural member of the vehicle. We go to low-cost sourcing, go to smaller vehicles. We maximize unit casting even more than we are and radical cost reduction in our distribution. I think the other thing that\u2019s important to understand about Ford\u2019s strategy on EVs is Pro. We actually followed a very different strategy for Pro using a multi-energy platform. So, we didn\u2019t bet on pure electric vehicles for Transit, for example, and we\u2019re now launching the Transit Custom in Europe, and that has diesel gas, and it will have eventually hybrid and pure electric. That\u2019s a very different bet in our Pro. We\u2019re even starting to export Pro vehicles from China to develop markets around the world that are pure electric. And that part won\u2019t change our product strategy.\nAdam Jonas: Appreciate that, Jim. Maybe just a follow-up. On hybrids, you pointed out in the prepared remarks the growth there, and I think you\u2019ve made comments that technology is something you want to lean in on more as a transition. Not that you won\u2019t continue to sell your Gen 1 EVs, but that there is just real demand for hybrids. Can you refresh us as you kind of turn that dial back up on hybrids categorically, how that \u2013 how the margins on those products might compare to your ICE \u2013 your normal ICE margins? Is it accretive? Is it kind of in the ballpark? I didn\u2019t know if there was any kind of sacrifice or gap there between hybrid and the normal pure ICE. Thanks.\nJohn Lawler: Yes. You want me to jump in, Jim?\nJim Farley: Yes.\nJohn Lawler: There\u2019s added costs as you\u2019d expect for the battery and the motors, etc. But if you look at \u2013 let\u2019s just take F-Series, for example. If you take the hybrid on average, they have a higher margin than our highest-volume gas versions because of the mix and what we have in the vehicle and the pricing we can get for the hybrid technology and the fuel efficiency that comes along with that. And one of the things we learned about hybrid, because we\u2019re executing very differently than our first-gen hybrids, is we have Pro power on board. We have a lot of other attributes that people are willing to pay for, like F-150 powering a jobsite or your house as back up energy. That\u2019s another advantage of having those batteries that maybe some of our competitors haven\u2019t had the same pricing power. The F-150 now, a hybrid, is up 40% year over year, and we think the new F-150 new hybrid will be 20% mix, and it may be the best-selling hybrid in the United States. So, our hybrid strategy is a little different than our competitors because the work cycle for our products are different, but hybrid has a really big place. We\u2019re trying to challenge ourselves, Adam, to execute hybrids, so they do more than just propel the vehicle for pricing power.\nAdam Jonas: Thanks, Jim. Thanks, John.\nOperator: The next question is from John Murphy with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJohn Murphy: Good afternoon, guys. Just a first question, Jim, on warranty and an accelerated \u2013 sort of headwind, on a year-over-year basis, accelerated a bit in the quarter. But if I look at the full-year numbers, even if we added back this \u2013 I think it\u2019s Slide 32. If we added back the 1.7 billion on warranty to the 9.4 billion in EBIT you\u2019ve done year to date, you\u2019d already even be in your range in the first three quarters of the 11 billion to 12 billion in EBIT you\u2019d been talking about before. So, I mean, it\u2019s a major issue here for the numbers and results in cash flow. What\u2019s going on, and how are you going to get a handle on this and reverse this hopefully in the next year or two?\nJohn Lawler: Yes. So, Adam, that\u2019s exactly right. One of the things we\u2019re \u2013 sorry, John. One of the things we\u2019re seeing is that it\u2019s not just the quality issues which are an important piece of this, and I think Jim wants to comment on that. But we\u2019re also seeing tremendous inflation from the dealers on the repair costs. And that\u2019s driving quite a bit of it. If you look at the increase that we had in the quarter for the warranty on a year over year, the 1.2 billion, and say that about 300 million of that was inflationary costs and roughly 900 million was the issue with warranties. So, that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing there. And the issue around the quality that\u2019s something that Jim\u2019s going to be going to cover here.\nJim Farley: Hey, John, again, thanks for your question. I want to slow it down a little bit and explain kind of our operational headwinds, not just quality but cost as well, and give a little bit of context and maybe highlight some of the stuff we\u2019ve done but the work we have to do. A couple of years ago, when we started as a management team, the team that\u2019s doing cost and quality is same team, and we have a lot of revenue power in the company. But we also have a lot of technology, and that technology that we rolled out like cameras before our competitors, it puts a huge burden on that electric architecture with a lot of extra modules and software. We definitely had the largest complexity customer-facing of any brand, and we also ran the business on products instead of platforms and systems. Our engineers and supply chain team did not have competitive tools like IT systems and parts release IT. We weren\u2019t cooperating with the suppliers the right way on cost reduction. We kind of negotiated them every year, but we weren\u2019t really getting into redesigning the parts and getting the complexity out of the suppliers\u2019 manufacturing system. We didn\u2019t really use a lot of strategic sourcing. So, we had a lot of concentration, our suppliers, and lack of leverage. We had inconsistent application within our manufacturing system for our QOS. So, some plants were fantastic like in China and Mexico. All the plants were completely uncompetitive and run differently. And we traveled hopefully on a lot of the launches. The gateways, we would have some issues, and the team had, kind of a hero mentality to try to close them out at the end of the launch, and we would get in trouble. I\u2019m really proud of the progress we made like in the last 18 months, but it\u2019s maybe just the tip above the water and the low-lying fruit. We now have to get after that systematic issue and those issues that I mentioned. On complexity, we have reduced the new F-Series from 1.4 billion combinations to less than 1,000. And on our new SUVs, we reduced the customer-facing complexity by over 90%. Our QOS execution is getting better. We\u2019re about 10% improvement in our problems at three months in service, which is a lot of progress for North America. So, the initial quality is getting better. We now have the talent, both the expertise but also the execution talent. We\u2019re now starting to strategically source our EV components, which we now can apply to our ICE business. I\u2019m really proud of the launch progress we made. We\u2019re now seeing launch spikes we\u2019ve never seen in a decade at Ford. We are slowing down those launches, and in the case of Super Duty, its cost is $1 billion, but it was the right trade because it prevents a lot of recalls and issues down the road for the company. And we have made progress on material. We have billions of dollars of opportunity next year, but we have to deliver and release the parts, and I\u2019m very confident that Kumar\u2019s new organization will be able to really get after the part of the iceberg that\u2019s below the water. That\u2019s been a problem at Ford for decades. Thank you for asking your question, and I just wanted to take a little extra time to give the full context.\nJohn Murphy: That\u2019s great. Maybe I\u2019ll just sneak in one follow-up. You know, EV demand is not materializing quite as robustly as we were expecting this year. Pricing is a little bit down. Costs are going to be up with labor. So, I mean, as you mentioned, EVs are going to become more challenging going forward. But when you think about like a program or a product like the Explorer that we have, at least in car, where it\u2019s launching in calendar year \u201825 as a model year \u201826, and you might disagree or agree with that, but that product is coming at some point soon. That was an EV variant and an ICE variant we had and we were expecting, and it would have been sort of an expectation that maybe you would have crossed out that ICE variant and just had an EV six months ago. But now, actually, things have switched in the other direction. You might actually cross out the EV and just keep the ICE. I mean, how are you making these decisions right now with sort of these tectonic shifts going on? I mean, there\u2019s data. There\u2019s consumer groups and all sorts of stuff, but they\u2019re incredibly difficult and impactful decisions that you have to make. What is the process, Jim, that you\u2019re going through on these powertrain decisions as you\u2019re going through the product launches over the coming years in planning?\nJim Farley: Yes, got it. So, things are changing. You know, EVs are still in high demand. It\u2019s just, as you said, the pricing is much lower, and there\u2019s a lot of overcapacity in the middle of the market. For us, I think we\u2019re \u2013 our EV strategy and our ICE strategy is to go after customers we know really well. And so, on our ICE and hybrids, very much of a loyalty target. And in the case of EVs, many of the same segments, but a conquest strategy. And I would say we feel very confident on that strategy because Ford is \u2013 has a great reputation in those segments like full-size truck or pickups or vans, commercial vehicles or three-row crossovers, but our products are not substitutional because the customers who we\u2019re going after are different, but they are the same segment. So, we know the use cycle really well, but the innovation will be pointing in different things. The F-150, I think, is probably the best example at Ford because we have world-class ICE. We have a hybrid that\u2019ll probably be 20% mix. And then we have lightning and the next-generation lightning that we\u2019re working on right now. And when you compare the ICE, the hybrid F-150 to the EV F-150, you will be surprised at how much more conquest the vehicle is executed. And we believe that innovation will give us pricing power for those EV conquest customers. The first generation has helped us there, but I think that\u2019s our strategy. As far as the changeability of that strategy or flexibility, we certainly have choice, but as John mentioned, we\u2019re really flexing the capital and the timing of the capital, especially around battery plants and overall manufacturing capacity. So, we\u2019re not changing the product strategy, but we are flexing, and that\u2019s our bet, is that we will flex the capacity. From a product planning standpoint, we\u2019ve made, I think, really good bets on the ICE and HEV side in case the EV market is not as fast as we thought. We have affordable Mavericks. We have a strong international business now with Ranger and Everest. Those markets won\u2019t go EV anytime soon. And the markets where we\u2019re in, like F-150, Super Duty Pro, they\u2019re not duty cycles that are going to go EV, and we have really fresh product. So, our bet is maybe different than others who just said, look, we\u2019re going to get rid of an ICE Explorer and go to an EV Explorer. That\u2019s not our strategy.\nJohn Murphy: It\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Dan Levy with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nDan Levy: Hi. Good evening. Thank you for taking the questions. I appreciate, Jim, the commentary that you gave on warranty and just cost more broadly, but I wanted to ask the question maybe in a slightly different way. This is, obviously, as you pointed out, a lingering issue. I think you said at the CMD earlier this year, it\u2019s a $7 billion cost gap versus your competitors for Blue. What exactly is the line of sight or how confident are you that these issues can be turned around? Just because these have been issues for some years. And specifically, in the context of your pivoting to new architectures here where there\u2019s obviously going to be some uncertainty on your end, what gives you the confidence or the line of sight to actually turn around these cost headwinds?\nJohn Lawler: Yes. Maybe I\u2019ll start, Jim, and then hand it over to you. What I would say is that there\u2019s a real focus now in the company, and Jim mentioned it in his remarks, around excellence and delivering, right, execution. When you look at the real fundamental issues that we\u2019ve had across the industrial platform, it\u2019s the way we work together, our focus of the work, and the structure of the work, and there have been those that have thought this has been an issue for years and others that haven\u2019t. And I think we\u2019re finally starting \u2013 not finally, as a team, we are coalesced around those root cause issues. We have great new talent in the company, Liz Door, from a supply chain standpoint, her domain expertise is outstanding. Bryce Currie from a manufacturing standpoint, outstanding. And then in addition to having Doug, bringing Kumar back into the fold, who grew up in the system as a design and release engineer and understands the Ford system and understands the air states really well, having them all together now driving this foundational change is important. And as Jim said, it\u2019s the area under the iceberg, right? It\u2019s what\u2019s under the water, and it\u2019s the most important piece of it. And the progress isn\u2019t showing up as quickly as we would like in the part you see above the water, but the change is being driven below the water. And it\u2019s the same root cause issues that are driving the quality problems, as well as the cost structure issues. And it\u2019s the material cost at about 4 billion, and now we have warranties about 2 billion, and then you have manufacturing, etc., in there. And so, it\u2019s the talent. It\u2019s what we\u2019re attacking. It\u2019s the relentless focus on excellence, and it\u2019s the way we\u2019re working together as a team to go after these issues. And having the new team in place and having the new talent in place and watching what they\u2019re going after and how they\u2019re working together as an integrated team is what we need to get this done.\nJim Farley: And I would just complement that in two ways. On quality, our real test for our commitment, talent, all things that John talked about came together in the launches of our most important products like Super Duty. And I am so confident in our tackling these systemic issues because of what happened on our recent launches. The team doubled down on testing. They did the extra work on supplier quality and readiness in the factory and really tested the vehicle for failure. And we did something that Ford maybe hasn\u2019t done in the past. We held the vehicle until it was right. And in the case of Super Duty, that was $1 billion-plus decision. And that was proof to me this team understands that quality is our top priority. That message was sent throughout the company. Everyone got the memo. On cost, on EV, I\u2019m encouraged because we\u2019re designing from scratch, and a lot of the talent we brought in approaches that cost is a pride point for them in designing it in. The real test for us as a leadership team beyond quality is going to be bringing our material cost and negotiated parts price cost down on our carryover ICE vehicles. That is going to be the test, and we believe we have more than $1 billion of ideas already in the hopper for this year, for 2024. And we got to deliver it on those ideas. They\u2019ll test our standards from rust protection and NHV. They\u2019re going to test our standards. They\u2019re going to test our parts release process. It\u2019s going to be \u2013 but it\u2019s us to execute.\nDan Levy: Great. Thank you. Just a follow-up quickly on pricing, which I think has continued to outperform beyond anyone\u2019s expectations. Maybe you can give a little bit of voiceover on what you\u2019re seeing on pricing, especially in light of all the questions out there on affordability and how long you think some of these pricing tailwinds can be sustained into next year.\nJohn Lawler: I think it\u2019s different for each of the business segments, right? We\u2019re continuing to see incredible downward pressure on pricing this year on the EVs, right? But Pro, really strong pricing power right now. As Jim mentioned in his prepared remarks, we\u2019ve got really good strength in the orders coming in for the model year. You know, we\u2019re a good ways through the model year, and the pricing is held. And then when you look at the fresh lineup we have on Blue, we\u2019re continuing to see the pricing hold for the most part. Now, are we starting to see that there\u2019s some pressure on pricing? Sure. And we said there would be, but it\u2019s been more resilient than we thought this year. That\u2019s for sure, especially through the third quarter. But affordability, we\u2019ve talked about this before. Affordability is an issue. Right now, it takes a consumer about 14% of their monthly disposable income for a vehicle. Pre COVID and pre the inflation that we\u2019ve seen, it was about 13%. So, we think it\u2019s going to revert back to that, and then we think it\u2019s going to happen over the next 12 to 18 months. And so, to do that, it would be about a net price reduction of $1,800. But we also believe that part of that\u2019s going to come through the OEMs in lower prices. But it\u2019s also going to come through dealer margins because dealers are still transacting at a much higher percent of MSRP than they have in the past. And so, it\u2019s going to be both of those. Now, we expected some of that to occur throughout the year. So far, it hasn\u2019t much. And so, I think you\u2019re going to start to see that come through as we move into next year.\nOperator: The next question is from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nRod Lache: Hi, everybody. I wanted to ask a couple things on EVs. I think that certainly \u2013 I mean, I don\u2019t think \u2013 you\u2019ve been saying that the deflation that you\u2019re seeing in EVs has been steeper than you assumed. But I \u2013 obviously, your original plan assumed some level of deflation through 2026. I think it was even price parity with ICE in some cases, and yet you assumed 8% margin in that time frame. Am I correct in those assumptions that your ultimate view was that you would get to price parity with ICE? And if that\u2019s the case, why \u2013 what do you need to do in order to push harder? Do you need to actually reduce prices even below ICE in order to achieve your plan? Or do you need to achieve even greater \u2013 a greater price premium?\nJohn Lawler: Yes, Rod, John. Exactly. If you look at our three-row SUV, the way we thought about that, our Gen 2 product was it\u2019s going to have the exterior of size of an Explorer and the interior space of an Expedition. And so, when we looked at that and setting the targets for the team in 2026, we said, well, you should \u2013 we should start out with a revenue assumption that it will be priced on an ICE \u2013as an ICE would be between those two to vehicles. And so, that\u2019s how we set up the affordable targets that we gave the team to design to. And a lot has changed, but the team is working diligently to try to deliver that. And we are continuing to see pricing pressure in the EV segment, but right now, there\u2019s still a premium to gas in many areas. So, I think what you\u2019re going to find is, over time, that premium is going to reduce as we move forward. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying \u2013 we have built into our planning assumptions for our second-generation vehicle and then as well for our third-generation vehicle, that you\u2019re going to see another step down on pricing so that these vehicles are affordable. And that\u2019s all setting up our cost structure that we\u2019re targeting and going after, which was the basis of setting our 8% margin.\nRod Lache: Okay. So, that\u2019s still your expectation, that you would get to an 8% margin and you would have a cost structure that reflects price parity with ICE?\nJohn Lawler: Yes, that is the target that the team is going after. There\u2019s a lot that has changed, as you know, and the team is working through that. The key three elements Jim went over is most importantly, the size of the battery, the efficiencies of watts needed to move the vehicle, the vertical integration, the partnering on what we would say are commodity parts of the business, things that aren\u2019t differentiating for additional opportunity there, the scaling and using the capabilities of the vehicle as we build out the manufacturing facilities to be as lean as efficient as possible. And the team is pushing hard to get every save that we can through there to build out our Gen 2 vehicles that are profitable and deliver ultimately the 8% target that we\u2019ve set for them.\nRod Lache: Okay. And just secondly, I\u2019m assuming that you still view vertical integration and batteries and LFP is critical to achieving your cost targets. Just given all of the issues around that, can you just \u2013 and some of the pauses or delays that you\u2019ve got on some of these plants, can you just give us an update on what the trajectory is to achieving those lower costs in batteries, and how is your plan changing?\nJohn Lawler: Yes. So, we\u2019re continuing to move forward with the vertical integration on the battery itself, working on cell design. We\u2019re working on the chemistries. As we said, we have no real change to what we\u2019ve put out forward before on BlueOval Park battery plant here in Michigan. But LFP is definitely going to be part of our future EVs, and that is a very important cost-reduction step in our path for the Gen 2 vehicles. So, it\u2019s a combination of all of that. It\u2019s a combination of the battery size and the efficiency of the vehicle to get the lowest watts possible to hit the ranges that we\u2019re looking to hit. It\u2019s the vertical integration across the vehicle, the vertical integration across the battery, and then as well as the chemistries. And all of that comes together to drive the cost reductions we need and the team is working toward is that part of the vehicle\u2019s target.\nRod Lache: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And our final question today comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nEmmanuel Rosner: Thank you very much. So, I appreciate your candid assessment of the EV business and as well as all the actions that you detailed in terms of trying to reduce the investment and losses in the near term. At the same time, you rightly acknowledged that impacting change \u2013 affecting change on the first generation is not going to be the easiest. You know, more change would come in Gen 2, Gen 3. So, any way you can just frame for us how much improvement can we expect during this first generation? You\u2019re now running at something like a $5 billion annual loss on Model e. Not that long ago, a few months ago, you still had fairly near-term targets to bring that to EBIT positive. Obviously, a lot has changed. But then you\u2019re addressing these changes with your actions. So, where does it go from here? Does it get worse? Does it get better? Can something be done before Gen 2 and Gen 3 in terms of improving the losses?\nJohn Lawler: So, you\u2019re right, a manual step function change is going to be on the Gen 2s where we\u2019ll have more degrees of freedom to make the types of changes I just talked about. On the Gen 1s, we\u2019ve seen the price come down much quicker than we had expected, of course, and that\u2019s showing up in our results. We\u2019re continuing to work very diligently on additional cost and design reductions on the Gen 1 products, and the team is also working very diligently to minimize the impact of the lower prices in the near term, in the next couple of years before Gen 2 comes out. And so, it\u2019s going to be a battle between managing the top line as best we can, adjusting the supply of products relative to demand so that we can balance the pricing from that standpoint and then working like crazy to put whatever cost reductions we can on that Gen 1 vehicle through to the bottom line. So, I think it\u2019s going to be in the near term, it\u2019s going to continue to be just that. It\u2019s going to continue to be quarter to quarter. And the team working very diligently to hold as much revenue as we can and bring as much cost reduction through the product as we can.\nEmmanuel Rosner: Thank you. And then a quick follow-up on Ford Pro. Obviously, extremely strong business and very solid quarter, but at the same time, there was a little bit of a pullback in both volume and mix and margin in the quarter. So, can you just go over the factors that drove this and the prospects in timing for normalizing back up?\nJohn Lawler: Yes. So, when you look at Pro the volume was down a bit. Part of that was we had some disruptions or hiccups from some suppliers which cost us to lose some F-150 commercial volume in the quarter. We had normal seasonality as well like on motorhomes and things like that. And then when you look at Ranger in Europe, that was down a bit still because of the ramp that we have going on on the new Ranger. And then there was a little bit of improvement with Super Duty. So, I think you saw some seasonality. You saw some fluctuations due to some supplier constraints and some missed volume in the quarter. And then, of course we continue to see the strength of the pricing on Super Duty, which is showing up with the higher revenues, yet the volumes were down a bit. So, overall, I think it\u2019s not that we\u2019re seeing a significant reduction in the demand for our Pro vehicles. We\u2019re not. The order bank is very robust. We have a lot of demand for the model year, and I think Europe Pro is going to continue to be performing at a high level as we move forward here.\nEmmanuel Rosner: Thank you very much.\nOperator: This concludes the Ford Motor Company third quarter 2023 earnings conference call.

            "name": "Jim Farley",
            "content": "Thank you, Lynn. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. I wanted to start by thanking the Ford team who worked tirelessly and creatively over the past several months to reach a tentative agreement with the United Auto Workers. I'm so pleased for our employees. This week, I was able to visit each of the struck plants. I was impressed by their preparation for start-up, and the feeling I got is people just want to get back to work. Once the deal is ratified, we will provide all of you a deeper look at the contract and its impact on our business. Right now, we're focused on restarting three important assembly plants, calling back more than 20,000 Ford employees to work, supporting our suppliers as they restart, and shipping lots of Super Duties, Explorers, and Broncos to our customers. It's been a challenging situation, for sure. Matter of fact, our business is never short of challenges, especially right now with the evolution of the EV market and new global competitors from China, as well as the technology disruptions. But I am more excited and motivated than ever. Our team is making tremendous progress every day toward building a Ford that thrives at the intersection of fantastic and iconic vehicles, terrific brands, and especially software and services. We are deep into the development of our future software platforms, which provide the foundation for rapid innovation and a profitable new software and services business and constantly improving experiences for our customers. We believe Ford+ is the right strategy to win in this constantly evolving industry transformation. We're building a more dynamic and less cyclical company, and we are nowhere near peak profitability. We have the right team and talent, and we are in the process of building a culture of excellence and execution. In a moment, John will detail the quarter, which I would call mixed. The strength of our products and revenues and businesses defined definitely came through in our results. But at the same time, we were never negatively impacted by the strike, and our cost and quality remain a drag on our business. Now, last week, we made some important leadership changes. Kumar Galhotra as COO will now control the key levers for transformative change in our industrial system, powertrain, ICE, and hybrid products, vehicle hardware engineering, cycle plan, quality, supply chain, and manufacturing, and work in tandem, of course, with Doug Field, chief EV, digital, and design officer, to move us forward. I believe this will accelerate our progress on cost and quality, and I hope we get into that in the Q&A. These are my top two priorities. Overall, we see \u2013 we are seeing the clear benefits of creating three distinct growth businesses now with Ford Blue, Model e, and Pro. The story of Ford Blue comes down to product strength. Incredibly strong brands like Mustang and Bronco and Raptor, they have durable pricing power and real choice between gas and hybrid. Ford is America's best-selling brand now through three quarters, even with the effects of the strike, and we have a wave of new products coming in the next few months, the new F-150, the Ranger, a brand-new Explorer, and Expedition and Navigator. In fact, close to 60% of our volume and revenues in the U.S. will be new and refreshed next year. I am so thankful we have kept our foot on the gas to freshen our ICE and HEV products as we enter a changing market. In Europe, we bring out new versions of Puma and Kuga or high-volume gas and hybrid SUVs, and the Ranger pickup and our Everest SUV that's based on it continued to gain share in international markets. So, bottom line, Ford Blue will be strong and a growing business for years to come. We also remain bullish on Model e and our EV future, but clearly, the market is moving \u2013 is a moving target. I'm optimistic because customers are smart and are rational, and for many of them, EVs are a great choice. I've been spending a ton of time in our product development center with both Doug Field and Alan Clarke, and you should see the Gen 2 and Gen 3 EVs we're working on. Our Gen 2 all-new full-size pickup truck, for example, is one of the most thrilling vehicles I have ever seen in my career. Let me be specific. Stunning performance like no truck has ever performed, building unexpected innovation for truck customers far beyond the normal truck attributes, a super flexible cabin that feels like a lounge or a tiny office. Take the wheels off this truck, and it's still a mind-blowing product and a digital experience that totally is immersive and personalized. I'd take this truck seven days of the week over a Cybertruck. A great product is not enough in the EV business anymore. We have to be totally competitive on cost. Tesla actually gave us a huge gift with a laser-focus on cost and scaling the Model Y. They set the standard, and we are now making real progress on our second- and third-cycle EVs that are in the midst of being developed today as we get closer to the introduction. While our Gen 2 EVs were targeting to deliver an EBIT margin comparable to ICE by 2026, the dynamic changes in the market, pricing, adoption rates, regulations are forcing us to further reduce the cost of our EVs. The key levers to deliver this competitive cost structure are scaling, vertical integration, and batteries. So, let's double-click on each of these three. On scaling, this is much more than building new facilities or scaling high-quality batteries or thermal propagation. We're leveraging digital prognostic capabilities in our manufacturing lines to improve quality. We are also reducing complexity, and we are optimizing our vehicle design and engineering for manufacturability. Yep, we're designing these vehicles for our manufacturing team. On vertical integration, this is the most fundamental change. We are insourcing batteries, inverters, scaling production of our drive units and gearboxes, and designing and producing unit castings in-house at Ford. In addition, on our next-generation utility vehicles, vertical integration will increase by nearly 50%. This level of integration, along with the new zonal electric architecture and designing in-house modules and battery cell to structure, will allow us to significantly reduce material cost. Now, none of this will be easy, and it has some risk, and you've seen our competitors struggle as they build out and ramp up these capabilities. So, we are so glad we started years ago on this journey. And finally, batteries. They're the single biggest cost component of any EV. Our more energy-efficient Gen 2 products, we use extreme aero to get the very smallest batteries possible for competitive range. And with our LFP batteries, we'll have the lowest or one of the lowest-cost batteries assembled in the U.S. Our overall EV priorities are very clear, disciplined capital allocation and investment that drives profitable, high-returning and enduring EV business, and we will constantly balance growth, scale, and profitability. These great EVs will be paired with modern shopping and buying experiences that are transparent or have non-negotiated pricing and a streamlined checkout and delivery that will come to life early in 2024. And this is also a significant cost reduction. I saved Ford Pro for the last because it's a massive driver of Ford's growth and profitability. Our competitors seem to be trying to cut and paste our strategy, but the reality is the moats we've built over many decades for our Pro business won't be easy to cross. The network of literally thousands of local outfitters across Europe, North America, and China and customer-driven engineering we have for vehicles like F-Series and Transit is formidable across all those regions. Our commercial order banks are healthy. This may be a surprise to everyone. We see a large backlog of infrastructure projects. Thank you, 5G and roadworks. And we have very loyal customers. Fleet orders, for example, for the 2024 Super Duty are coming in faster than last year's orders, and we expect strong demand to continue as more customers recognize what Ford has to offer in total. In addition to the new Super Duty, we are preparing to launch the new Transit Custom in Europe. Think of this product as a Super Duty for Europe. It's a best-selling vehicle in the UK, not the best-selling commercial vehicle, the best-selling vehicle and the leading one-ton van in Europe. And it's a key profit pillar for Europe and one of the reasons why we stayed there. When it comes to software and services, Ford Pro is the tip of our digital spear. Customers know and trust our vehicles, of course. And we're building on this with software-driven services that provide businesses with data insights, vehicle access, even vehicle control, and functionality. This helps them drive productivity and efficiency in their fleet operations. And I've asked Ted Cannis to also lead our large and profitable aftersales business. His focus will increase our post-warranty service business and profitability. He's already adding mobile service capability and delivering an effortless experience to both commercial and retail customers. There is so much upside in this aftersales, parts, repair, and collision business, especially with Ted leading it and for Ford Pro. I want to briefly touch on China where our strategy to turn our business around is gaining traction. The restructuring of our EV business there is nearly complete, and the internal combustion engine business is now profitable. We are now expanding China's role to a profitable export hub, including Ford Pro. We've already exported a record number of vehicles so far from China to markets like Mexico, South America, and Asia. There is so much more opportunity ahead for us. Yes, the China market is extremely competitive in the middle, but Ford can succeed by staying asset-light, partnering where it makes sense, and competing in very narrow segments where we can clearly win like commercial vehicles, off-road vehicles, large SUVs, and Lincoln. Finally, I'm so pleased to have Peter Stern on today to share more about our newly formed Ford Integrated Services, which will create and market valuable software-enabled customer experiences across Blue, e, and Pro. Now, this is transformational because the cornerstone of Ford+, the plus in our plan, is creating incredible customer services and experiences enabled by not just hardware but software. There's simply no one in the world better able than Peter, who is the driving force behind services at Apple, to build this strategically vital business for us. Peter, over to you. Hey, Adam, thank you for your question. I just want to emphasize the importance of our Gen 2 and Gen 3 products because they're very transformation in our profitability in EV. You know, we've learned a lot in Gen 1. We've reduced the material costs. We've got the learning loop on the software. We learned how to scale batteries. We have the LFP battery now. We're starting to ship to customers, but there's only so much we can do on Gen 1. On Gen 2, I said \u2013 as I said, we have a totally different approach from aero vertical integration designed for manufacturability. And there's a lot of other things we can do beyond allocating less capital to battery plants, for example. We've learned a lot about derivatives like rally. We're going to push services a lot more like Level 2+, Level 3 autonomy. And we really plan on even redesign or improving the scale of a components by working with other companies. And the other big breakthrough is going to be which we're designing in parallel the Gen 3 products where we use the battery as a structural member of the vehicle. We go to low-cost sourcing, go to smaller vehicles. We maximize unit casting even more than we are and radical cost reduction in our distribution. I think the other thing that's important to understand about Ford's strategy on EVs is Pro. We actually followed a very different strategy for Pro using a multi-energy platform. So, we didn't bet on pure electric vehicles for Transit, for example, and we're now launching the Transit Custom in Europe, and that has diesel gas, and it will have eventually hybrid and pure electric. That's a very different bet in our Pro. We're even starting to export Pro vehicles from China to develop markets around the world that are pure electric. And that part won't change our product strategy. Yes. Hey, John, again, thanks for your question. I want to slow it down a little bit and explain kind of our operational headwinds, not just quality but cost as well, and give a little bit of context and maybe highlight some of the stuff we've done but the work we have to do. A couple of years ago, when we started as a management team, the team that's doing cost and quality is same team, and we have a lot of revenue power in the company. But we also have a lot of technology, and that technology that we rolled out like cameras before our competitors, it puts a huge burden on that electric architecture with a lot of extra modules and software. We definitely had the largest complexity customer-facing of any brand, and we also ran the business on products instead of platforms and systems. Our engineers and supply chain team did not have competitive tools like IT systems and parts release IT. We weren't cooperating with the suppliers the right way on cost reduction. We kind of negotiated them every year, but we weren't really getting into redesigning the parts and getting the complexity out of the suppliers' manufacturing system. We didn't really use a lot of strategic sourcing. So, we had a lot of concentration, our suppliers, and lack of leverage. We had inconsistent application within our manufacturing system for our QOS. So, some plants were fantastic like in China and Mexico. All the plants were completely uncompetitive and run differently. And we traveled hopefully on a lot of the launches. The gateways, we would have some issues, and the team had, kind of a hero mentality to try to close them out at the end of the launch, and we would get in trouble. I'm really proud of the progress we made like in the last 18 months, but it's maybe just the tip above the water and the low-lying fruit. We now have to get after that systematic issue and those issues that I mentioned. On complexity, we have reduced the new F-Series from 1.4 billion combinations to less than 1,000. And on our new SUVs, we reduced the customer-facing complexity by over 90%. Our QOS execution is getting better. We're about 10% improvement in our problems at three months in service, which is a lot of progress for North America. So, the initial quality is getting better. We now have the talent, both the expertise but also the execution talent. We're now starting to strategically source our EV components, which we now can apply to our ICE business. I'm really proud of the launch progress we made. We're now seeing launch spikes we've never seen in a decade at Ford. We are slowing down those launches, and in the case of Super Duty, its cost is $1 billion, but it was the right trade because it prevents a lot of recalls and issues down the road for the company. And we have made progress on material. We have billions of dollars of opportunity next year, but we have to deliver and release the parts, and I'm very confident that Kumar's new organization will be able to really get after the part of the iceberg that's below the water. That's been a problem at Ford for decades. Thank you for asking your question, and I just wanted to take a little extra time to give the full context. Yes, got it. So, things are changing. You know, EVs are still in high demand. It's just, as you said, the pricing is much lower, and there's a lot of overcapacity in the middle of the market. For us, I think we're \u2013 our EV strategy and our ICE strategy is to go after customers we know really well. And so, on our ICE and hybrids, very much of a loyalty target. And in the case of EVs, many of the same segments, but a conquest strategy. And I would say we feel very confident on that strategy because Ford is \u2013 has a great reputation in those segments like full-size truck or pickups or vans, commercial vehicles or three-row crossovers, but our products are not substitutional because the customers who we're going after are different, but they are the same segment. So, we know the use cycle really well, but the innovation will be pointing in different things. The F-150, I think, is probably the best example at Ford because we have world-class ICE. We have a hybrid that'll probably be 20% mix. And then we have lightning and the next-generation lightning that we're working on right now. And when you compare the ICE, the hybrid F-150 to the EV F-150, you will be surprised at how much more conquest the vehicle is executed. And we believe that innovation will give us pricing power for those EV conquest customers. The first generation has helped us there, but I think that's our strategy. As far as the changeability of that strategy or flexibility, we certainly have choice, but as John mentioned, we're really flexing the capital and the timing of the capital, especially around battery plants and overall manufacturing capacity. So, we're not changing the product strategy, but we are flexing, and that's our bet, is that we will flex the capacity. From a product planning standpoint, we've made, I think, really good bets on the ICE and HEV side in case the EV market is not as fast as we thought. We have affordable Mavericks. We have a strong international business now with Ranger and Everest. Those markets won't go EV anytime soon. And the markets where we're in, like F-150, Super Duty Pro, they're not duty cycles that are going to go EV, and we have really fresh product. So, our bet is maybe different than others who just said, look, we're going to get rid of an ICE Explorer and go to an EV Explorer. That's not our strategy. And I would just complement that in two ways. On quality, our real test for our commitment, talent, all things that John talked about came together in the launches of our most important products like Super Duty. And I am so confident in our tackling these systemic issues because of what happened on our recent launches. The team doubled down on testing. They did the extra work on supplier quality and readiness in the factory and really tested the vehicle for failure. And we did something that Ford maybe hasn't done in the past. We held the vehicle until it was right. And in the case of Super Duty, that was $1 billion-plus decision. And that was proof to me this team understands that quality is our top priority. That message was sent throughout the company. Everyone got the memo. On cost, on EV, I'm encouraged because we're designing from scratch, and a lot of the talent we brought in approaches that cost is a pride point for them in designing it in. The real test for us as a leadership team beyond quality is going to be bringing our material cost and negotiated parts price cost down on our carryover ICE vehicles. That is going to be the test, and we believe we have more than $1 billion of ideas already in the hopper for this year, for 2024. And we got to deliver it on those ideas. They'll test our standards from rust protection and NHV. They're going to test our standards. They're going to test our parts release process. It's going to be \u2013 but it's us to execute."

            "name": "John Lawler",
            "content": "Thanks, Peter. Through the first three quarters, we delivered 9.4 billion in adjusted EBIT, a strong result that is indicative of our underlying run rate of the business. Now, given our year-to-date performance, we were on track to comfortably deliver our full-year adjusted EBIT guidance of 11 billion to 12 billion. With that said, the UAW strike created significant uncertainty regarding our full-year results, and even though we have reached a tentative agreement and our employees are starting to return to work, we have withdrawn our guidance for the year. This is in part because of the continued disruption in the industry with the ongoing strikes, the follow-on impact to our shared supply base, the ramp up of production in our plants and at our supplier partners, as well as other ancillary effects. And to provide some context, in the third quarter, the strike had an EBIT impact of roughly $100 million, and so far, the strike has trimmed about 80,000 units from our plant. This would reduce 2023 EBIT by roughly 1.3 billion. Once we have a ratified agreement and begin to ramp operations, we will be in a better position to update you on our full-year guidance. So, let me now turn to our third-quarter results, which was once again \u2013 it once again showed our Ford+ plan in action and the benefits of our diversified portfolio. Our leading Pro business and resilient ICE and hybrid products continue to deliver solid results that more than offset the investments we are making in our EV future. Our revenue remains strong, up 11%, reflecting a product lineup that resonates with customers, driving higher net pricing that remains resilient. Whole sales were flat, dampened by supply constraints affecting both F-Series and Transit production, additional unit holds for quality assurance, and the first UAW work stoppage for Ford in almost 50 years. Adjusted EBIT in the quarter was 2.2 billion with a margin of 5%. Both improved year over year. However, costs increased, underscoring the fact that we still have more work to do, especially on warranty expense and material cost. Adjusted free cash flow was 1.2 billion in the quarter, down year over year, driven by unfavorable working capital. Through the first nine months, we generated 4.8 million of adjusted free cash flow resulting in a conversion rate of 51%, in line with our target range. Our disciplined capital allocation continues to drive strong free cash flow, which will be critical as we adjust our spending to match the pace of EV adoption. We ended the quarter with over 29 billion in cash and 50 billion in liquidity, one of our strongest quarters ever, and this includes the new 4 billion contingent liquidity facility we put in place in August to help withstand uncertainties in the present environment. Now, turning to our customer-focused segments. Ford Pro generated EBIT of 1.7 billion and delivered a strong double-digit margin of 12%. Both metrics improved, driven by our Super Duty and Transit franchises that helped deliver a 16% improvement in revenue that's reflecting strong demand and continued pricing power. In addition, we are launching a new version of our flagship product in Europe, the Transit Custom, which, along with the new Super Duty and F-150, will give Pro its freshest vehicle lineup in years. We also continue to see strong growth in both our new software subscriptions and mobile repair orders, up roughly 50% and 200%, respectively, for the quarter. Regarding Model e, our EV start-up incurred 1.3 billion of losses in the quarter, reflecting continued investment in our next-generation products and a more challenging market for our Gen 1 products. Given the dynamic EV environment, we are being judicious about our production and adjusting future capacity to better match market demand. For example, we have taken out some Mustang Mach-E production, and we are also slowing down several investments, including making a decision with SK On to delay the second BlueOval SK JV battery plant in Kentucky. And we have also said we are evaluating our BlueOval Battery Park Michigan plant to determine the best path forward. In fact, all told, we have pushed about 12 billion of EV spend, which includes CapEx, direct investment, and expense. The ultimate success of our EV transition will be driven by our Gen 2 and Gen 3 products, which will be cost-optimized and guided by the learnings of our first-generation vehicles that are currently in the market. Turning to Ford Blue. In the third quarter, we delivered EBIT of 1.7 billion, up 300 million, driven by lower commodity costs and higher net pricing that more than offset higher warranty costs. The higher warranty was driven by recalls and higher per unit repair costs due to inflation. Importantly, Blue continues to be profitable in all regions with a strong, fresh portfolio poised for continued global success. Hybrids also continue to be a success, a strategy we've had in place now for almost two decades. We are the clear leader of the hybrid pickup truck segment in the U.S, thanks to Maverick and F-150. We expect to extend its lead next year when we introduce our refreshed 2024 F-150 with more advanced technologies. The F-150 Powerboost hybrid not only offers a 25% improvement in CO2 emissions, but on average, they have more \u2013 they are more profitable than our highest-volume gas powertrains. And hybrids aren't just limited to North America as we are launching a Ranger for Europe and IMG next year. Ford Credit generated EBIT of 358 million. As expected, our results were down year over year, reflecting lower lease residuals and financing margin and the non-reoccurrence of derivatives market valuation gains. Credit loss performance remains strong and below our historical average but continues to normalize. Auction values remain strong but are down sequentially, in line with our expectations. Finally, turning to software and services. We continue to see sustained quarter-over-quarter growth in subscriptions across all our business segments and, most importantly, at gross margins of around 50%. And our next-generation digital platform will enable a step function change in capability, allowing us to scale and deliver value to both our retail and commercial customers even faster. And as Peter highlighted, as we continue to build out our capabilities here, we expect it to be a significant source of future value creation. In closing, there's obviously a tremendous amount going on in our business, but I'm confident in our Ford+ plan and the underlying run rate of our business. So, that wraps up our prepared remarks. We'll use the balance of the time to address what's on your minds. Thank you, and operator, please open the line for questions. Yes. So, Adam, we're going to match demand and capital needed to meet that demand. You know, the first step here is given the flatter growth curve that we're seeing relative to what the industry expected and we expected, we've made this decision to push out 12 billion of capital expenditures, but it doesn't mean that we'll actually go ahead and pull the trigger on it if we don't need to. And we're going to look at the overall EV business and be balanced about that. There's a lot that's going to change between now, in \u201826, and \u201830, and we're going to adjust appropriately. So, it's something that's going to adjust as we move and how that business develops, and we'll adjust that capital allocation appropriately. And we'll change our strategy and make different decisions as well. And one of the other things I'd say is that \u2013 well, I'll pass it over to Jim because Jim has something he wants to say. Yes. You want me to jump in, Jim? There's added costs as you'd expect for the battery and the motors, etc. But if you look at \u2013 let's just take F-Series, for example. If you take the hybrid on average, they have a higher margin than our highest-volume gas versions because of the mix and what we have in the vehicle and the pricing we can get for the hybrid technology and the fuel efficiency that comes along with that. And one of the things we learned about hybrid, because we're executing very differently than our first-gen hybrids, is we have Pro power on board. We have a lot of other attributes that people are willing to pay for, like F-150 powering a jobsite or your house as back up energy. That's another advantage of having those batteries that maybe some of our competitors haven't had the same pricing power. The F-150 now, a hybrid, is up 40% year over year, and we think the new F-150 new hybrid will be 20% mix, and it may be the best-selling hybrid in the United States. So, our hybrid strategy is a little different than our competitors because the work cycle for our products are different, but hybrid has a really big place. We're trying to challenge ourselves, Adam, to execute hybrids, so they do more than just propel the vehicle for pricing power. Yes. So, Adam, that's exactly right. One of the things we're \u2013 sorry, John. One of the things we're seeing is that it's not just the quality issues which are an important piece of this, and I think Jim wants to comment on that. But we're also seeing tremendous inflation from the dealers on the repair costs. And that's driving quite a bit of it. If you look at the increase that we had in the quarter for the warranty on a year over year, the 1.2 billion, and say that about 300 million of that was inflationary costs and roughly 900 million was the issue with warranties. So, that's what we're seeing there. And the issue around the quality that's something that Jim's going to be going to cover here. Yes. Maybe I'll start, Jim, and then hand it over to you. What I would say is that there's a real focus now in the company, and Jim mentioned it in his remarks, around excellence and delivering, right, execution. When you look at the real fundamental issues that we've had across the industrial platform, it's the way we work together, our focus of the work, and the structure of the work, and there have been those that have thought this has been an issue for years and others that haven't. And I think we're finally starting \u2013 not finally, as a team, we are coalesced around those root cause issues. We have great new talent in the company, Liz Door, from a supply chain standpoint, her domain expertise is outstanding. Bryce Currie from a manufacturing standpoint, outstanding. And then in addition to having Doug, bringing Kumar back into the fold, who grew up in the system as a design and release engineer and understands the Ford system and understands the air states really well, having them all together now driving this foundational change is important. And as Jim said, it's the area under the iceberg, right? It's what's under the water, and it's the most important piece of it. And the progress isn't showing up as quickly as we would like in the part you see above the water, but the change is being driven below the water. And it's the same root cause issues that are driving the quality problems, as well as the cost structure issues. And it's the material cost at about 4 billion, and now we have warranties about 2 billion, and then you have manufacturing, etc., in there. And so, it's the talent. It's what we're attacking. It's the relentless focus on excellence, and it's the way we're working together as a team to go after these issues. And having the new team in place and having the new talent in place and watching what they're going after and how they're working together as an integrated team is what we need to get this done. I think it's different for each of the business segments, right? We're continuing to see incredible downward pressure on pricing this year on the EVs, right? But Pro, really strong pricing power right now. As Jim mentioned in his prepared remarks, we've got really good strength in the orders coming in for the model year. You know, we're a good ways through the model year, and the pricing is held. And then when you look at the fresh lineup we have on Blue, we're continuing to see the pricing hold for the most part. Now, are we starting to see that there's some pressure on pricing? Sure. And we said there would be, but it's been more resilient than we thought this year. That's for sure, especially through the third quarter. But affordability, we've talked about this before. Affordability is an issue. Right now, it takes a consumer about 14% of their monthly disposable income for a vehicle. Pre COVID and pre the inflation that we've seen, it was about 13%. So, we think it's going to revert back to that, and then we think it's going to happen over the next 12 to 18 months. And so, to do that, it would be about a net price reduction of $1,800. But we also believe that part of that's going to come through the OEMs in lower prices. But it's also going to come through dealer margins because dealers are still transacting at a much higher percent of MSRP than they have in the past. And so, it's going to be both of those. Now, we expected some of that to occur throughout the year. So far, it hasn't much. And so, I think you're going to start to see that come through as we move into next year. Yes, Rod, John. Exactly. If you look at our three-row SUV, the way we thought about that, our Gen 2 product was it's going to have the exterior of size of an Explorer and the interior space of an Expedition. And so, when we looked at that and setting the targets for the team in 2026, we said, well, you should \u2013 we should start out with a revenue assumption that it will be priced on an ICE \u2013as an ICE would be between those two to vehicles. And so, that's how we set up the affordable targets that we gave the team to design to. And a lot has changed, but the team is working diligently to try to deliver that. And we are continuing to see pricing pressure in the EV segment, but right now, there's still a premium to gas in many areas. So, I think what you're going to find is, over time, that premium is going to reduce as we move forward. And that's what we're trying \u2013 we have built into our planning assumptions for our second-generation vehicle and then as well for our third-generation vehicle, that you're going to see another step down on pricing so that these vehicles are affordable. And that's all setting up our cost structure that we're targeting and going after, which was the basis of setting our 8% margin. Yes, that is the target that the team is going after. There's a lot that has changed, as you know, and the team is working through that. The key three elements Jim went over is most importantly, the size of the battery, the efficiencies of watts needed to move the vehicle, the vertical integration, the partnering on what we would say are commodity parts of the business, things that aren't differentiating for additional opportunity there, the scaling and using the capabilities of the vehicle as we build out the manufacturing facilities to be as lean as efficient as possible. And the team is pushing hard to get every save that we can through there to build out our Gen 2 vehicles that are profitable and deliver ultimately the 8% target that we've set for them. Yes. So, we're continuing to move forward with the vertical integration on the battery itself, working on cell design. We're working on the chemistries. As we said, we have no real change to what we've put out forward before on BlueOval Park battery plant here in Michigan. But LFP is definitely going to be part of our future EVs, and that is a very important cost-reduction step in our path for the Gen 2 vehicles. So, it's a combination of all of that. It's a combination of the battery size and the efficiency of the vehicle to get the lowest watts possible to hit the ranges that we're looking to hit. It's the vertical integration across the vehicle, the vertical integration across the battery, and then as well as the chemistries. And all of that comes together to drive the cost reductions we need and the team is working toward is that part of the vehicle's target. So, you're right, a manual step function change is going to be on the Gen 2s where we'll have more degrees of freedom to make the types of changes I just talked about. On the Gen 1s, we've seen the price come down much quicker than we had expected, of course, and that's showing up in our results. We're continuing to work very diligently on additional cost and design reductions on the Gen 1 products, and the team is also working very diligently to minimize the impact of the lower prices in the near term, in the next couple of years before Gen 2 comes out. And so, it's going to be a battle between managing the top line as best we can, adjusting the supply of products relative to demand so that we can balance the pricing from that standpoint and then working like crazy to put whatever cost reductions we can on that Gen 1 vehicle through to the bottom line. So, I think it's going to be in the near term, it's going to continue to be just that. It's going to continue to be quarter to quarter. And the team working very diligently to hold as much revenue as we can and bring as much cost reduction through the product as we can. Yes. So, when you look at Pro the volume was down a bit. Part of that was we had some disruptions or hiccups from some suppliers which cost us to lose some F-150 commercial volume in the quarter. We had normal seasonality as well like on motorhomes and things like that. And then when you look at Ranger in Europe, that was down a bit still because of the ramp that we have going on on the new Ranger. And then there was a little bit of improvement with Super Duty. So, I think you saw some seasonality. You saw some fluctuations due to some supplier constraints and some missed volume in the quarter. And then, of course we continue to see the strength of the pricing on Super Duty, which is showing up with the higher revenues, yet the volumes were down a bit. So, overall, I think it's not that we're seeing a significant reduction in the demand for our Pro vehicles. We're not. The order bank is very robust. We have a lot of demand for the model year, and I think Europe Pro is going to continue to be performing at a high level as we move forward here."

            "name": "Peter Stern",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim. I've spent my career creating new customer experiences and launching businesses at the intersection of hardware, software, and services. And I came to Ford because this company puts that kind of innovation at the center of its long-term strategy. As you said, it's literally the plus in Ford+. Now, over two months in, I'm even more excited to be here and to be part of this exceptional team that's working together to bring the Ford+ plan to life for our customers, employees, and shareholders. Our vision for integrated services is to transform every aspect of the Ford customer experience across our three segments. We're making our vehicles even more connected, convenient, productive, secure, and exhilarating. Over the past couple of months, we've identified a portfolio of services that will improve our customers' lives and businesses by building on our industry-leading early successes with Ford Pro Intelligence and BlueCruise. This portfolio will elevate the Ford brand and introduce us to millions of new customers who may have never considered a Ford before. It will drive new high margin, cyclical recurring revenue streams for Ford and result in stronger relationships with our customers. And we'll do this while adhering to the values that distinguish Ford from our competitors, like our respect for customer privacy, safety, and very importantly, choice. Whether you choose to add our services or not, you'll have an amazing vehicle. Our momentum around software and services is building fast. Here are three examples. First, Ford Pro Intelligence builds on Ford's industry-leading share in the commercial vehicle space by making the people who drive our vehicles even more productive and by reducing total cost of ownership. Adoption of vehicle telematics, fleet management, and charging optimization were up 20% sequentially in the third quarter, and our average revenue per subscription was up nearly 10% over the past six months, both contributing to strong revenue growth. And we're still in the early stages of our rollout. We ended the quarter with 476,000 paid subscriptions for our commercial solutions, a jump of nearly 50% year over year. And we have an ambitious product road map for Pro. For example, over the next few weeks, we'll launch the Ford Pro dashcam. This product uses machine vision and in-vehicle intelligence to detect in-cab and on-road events, simplify fleet operations, and encourage safer driving. While we're still early in our journey, Pro Intelligence is an area that we'll continue to expand and drive value for both our customers and Ford. Second, in September, we announced that the 2024 F-150 will be the first vehicle available in North America with Ford Stolen Vehicle Services. This is a fully integrated theft prevention and recovery service that provides unique features like inclination and movement alerts. So, you get notified if your truck is jacked up or moved while the engine is off. And third, BlueCruise is one of the most consequential consumer applications of artificial intelligence in the world today. Some of you experienced our last version at Capital Markets Day. If you haven't felt what it's like to take your hands off the wheel and your foot off the gas and let BlueCruise take over steering, acceleration, and braking, please visit a Ford dealer, so we can demonstrate it. Launch to date, our vehicles have been driven hands-free for 125 million miles. That's the equivalent of 500 trips to the moon, which I imagine would be largely hands-free as well. Real-world driving data from Mustang Mach-E vehicles using BlueCruise shows a more than 10 times reduction in lane departures compared with unassisted driving. And for the second time in a row, BlueCruise was just rated the best hands-free system on the market, and this was based on BlueCruise 1.0. BlueCruise 1.3 is rolling out now and adds lane change support and other refinements that keep drivers in hands-free mode, on average, five times longer than version 1.0. Our technology team, led by my partner, Doug Field, is the best in the business, and BlueCruise is the proof. Despite these encouraging successes, what we're about to do in Integrated Services won't be easy. Our multi-year playbook depends on our next-generation vehicles that are even more connected. We must also round out our customer-centric portfolio of services and evolve our customer relationship management technologies. Our dealers are a key competitive advantage for Ford, and with them, we need to make it easier to become and stay a services customer. We need to build a relationship centered around the customer, not the vehicle, because in the services space, the sale of the vehicle should be the beginning of a beautiful long-term relationship with our customers. And that necessitates not only new people, processes, and technologies but also new measures of success. So, as we progress in our services evolution, you're going to hear us talk about key metrics like addressable units in operation, attach rates, and average revenue per subscription. And as we move each of these levers in the context of a low-variable cost, high-margin service business, it will have a multiplicative effect on profits. There's incredible value to be unlocked here for our customers and for Ford, and I'm proud to be a part of the team making that happen during this pivotal moment in our history. John, over to you."

At this time, I would like to welcome you to the Ford Motor Company Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Lynn Antipas Tyson, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nLynn Tyson: Thank you, MJ, and welcome to Ford Motor Company's second quarter 2023 earnings call. With me today are Jim Farley, President and CEO; and John Lawler, Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us for Q&A is Marion Harris, CEO of Ford Credit and Ted Cannis, CEO of Ford Pro. Today's discussion includes some non-GAAP references. These are reconciled to the most comparable U.S. taxes in the appendix of the earnings deck. You can find the deck along with the rest of our earnings materials and other important content at shareholder.ford.com. Our discussion also includes forward-looking statements about our expectations. Actual results may differ from those stated.

On Thursday, August 10, Ford prone will do a fireside sat at the Safer Automotive Conference in New York with Auto Brinkman. And on Wednesday, September 27, our Treasury, Dave Web, will participate in a green financing panel at the Goldman Sachs Global Sustainability Forum. Before I turn it over to Jim, I just want to recognize one really important individual investor call, and that's my mom, who has listened to every single one of our Ford Investor Relations call since I joined. She is a tough cookie and always gives us a good working over after we do the call. So I just want to say Mom, welcome to being on the call. Jim, I'll turn it over to you.\nJim Farley: Well, first, mom, thank you for Lynn. Thanks to all of you for joining us on the May Capital Markets event, where we shared our vision to refound our 120-year-old American icon and create a Ford that thrives at this exciting intersection between great vehicles and digital experiences. Now the world is changing fast, but I have never been more confident in our Ford+ plan. As you've heard me say, our intention is to match this exciting long-term vision for Ford with boringly predictable execution quarter after quarter, year after year. And that's the biggest takeaway from our second quarter: strong growth, strong earnings, cash flow and progress on the fundamentals of our business, including software. We are very bullish on the potential for Ford Pro, which had an outstanding quarter. It's unique to Ford. It's a true powerhouse. At the same time, Ford Blue is taking advantage of fresh, appealing products to generate healthy revenues, healthy share and profits, while Model E continues to scale with popular, first-generation electric vehicles. We're going to dive more into the electric vehicle market during Q&A. But clearly, this transition to EVs is dynamic and so much more than just a change in propulsion. The number of global entrants is increasing even at the high end and the pricing pressure has dramatically increased in the past 60 days. Despite these puts and takes, we have confidence in the underlying trajectory of Ford's business. Our portfolio of businesses is strong, thanks to businesses like Pro and Blue, and we are raising our estimated EBIT guidance this year to $11 billion to $12 billion. Operationally, we continue to be focused on capital discipline, solid returns even as we face uncertainties in the external environment. Supply chain disruptions are persistent, but they're now easy. And we have more work to do to streamline our industrial system, reducing costs and improving quality. While EV adoption is still growing, the paradigm has shifted. EV price premiums over internal combustion vehicles fell more than $3,000 in the second quarter and nearly $5,000 in first half. We expect the EV market to remain volatile until the winners and losers shake out, and we are confident from a brand, from our incredible product strategy, our software, our scale and our cost position, we will be one of the winners long term. Why do I say that? We moved quickly to establish our EV nameplates in the unique segments, not like others, the Lightning, the Maki, the ETrans. We're building EV brand lowers. It's critical. Many of our EV customers are all new to Ford. This is a significant asset to Ford given our new Gen 2 products and profitability that we'll be launching soon. For Gen 2, we focused on fewer, higher volume models in the right segments to take advantage of our strengths and knowledge of customers, even Conquest customers. For example, work vehicles, pickups for retail customers and spacious seven-passenger SUVs. I am so glad we didn't bet the farm on two row crossovers ICE like EV platforms, like so many have. We moved early on LFP, especially production in the U.S., giving us a diversity of chemistry cost advantage. We are now offering Mach-E with LFP technology for sale in the U.S. With the addition of Tesla Superchargers and the Fast Chargers that our dealers are installed, the Blue Oval charging network will be the single largest integrated fast charge network across the U.S. and Canada, and this blanket coverage from tens of thousands of fast chargers is core to our strategy. It helps us with smaller, lower cost and faster charging batteries. We have the flexibility to offer customers choice of ICE, hybrids and full electrics in the years to come. Our hybrid offerings are extremely popular. F-150 is the best-selling vehicle in the U.S. for 46 years, 10% of all F-150s and 56% of all Mavericks sold in the U.S. are sold as hybrids. We are adding hybrid options across our ICE line-up, and we expect to quadruple our hybrid sales in the next five years, and we're already number two in the market last year. Starting January 01, we moved to a new retail model for Model e, way ahead of our competition, again, a differentiated model that will deliver non-negotiated price, a simple shopping and ownership experience and remote services for all of our customers. This is critical to a conquest digital brand. And finally, with these new models, we are nimble and we can adapt to the market fluctuations real time, and you've seen this with both the Mach-E and the Lightning as we are adding enormous capacity to meet pent-up demand. We are optimizing for the long-term value creation. More than 60% of Mach-E and half of Lightning customers are new to Ford. These new customers have significant lifetime value potential beyond because of the shippable software. But we are disciplined as we grow, and we won't bear an unlimited cost to acquire those customers and build our install base. In line with that, we are now targeting to reach 600,000 annual production units of EVs by next year, and we maintain flexibility on where we reach when we reach two million total EV global capacity because we are balancing growth, profitability and returns. At the same, we believe demand for our internal combustion and our hybrid portfolio will be durable with the window of growth in Ford Blue potentially longer and richer than most expected. We've proven we can design and develop popular vehicles that stand out from the competition irregardless of their propulsion, and we made sure Ford is profitable as we move through this ICE EV transition. So let me cover a few highlights for each of our business segments. The appeal in pricing power of Ford Blues, iconic vehicles, those Mustang lineups, the Maverick, the F-150, the Explorers, all those cool, new derivatives from Ford, boy, these products remain strong. Ford was America's number one brand in the first half of this year. Also in the first half of this year, our best seller, F-150, by the way, 100% built in the U.S. that our competitors can't say, grew almost three times the rate of the overall pickup truck market. We expect our pricing and revenue to continue in the second half as we have new launches at Mustang. And I would add pace of new product introductions for Ford will only accelerate from here. We plan to introduce, for example, an all-new F-150 and F-150 PowerBoost hybrid at the Detroit Show in September. Now outside North America, the Ranger and its sister product, the Everest SUV, are the backbone of a much stronger, more profitable international business. The all-new version of the Ranger and Everest are most popular and profitable than the previous model, and Ranger alone is now the truck leader and eighth large pickup truck market around the globe. Our aftersales business continues to grow, and we are on track to launch over 2,000 mobile service units by the end of this year. That is unique to Ford. Ford Blues, other top priorities are to follow reduce our cost structure. To do that, we've launched a lean, disciplined operating system that reaches into every one of our plants, every part we buy, every engineering decision we make. We're making progress, but this is just the start of our culture change. Turning to Pro, which is proving to be a unique strength to Ford. I mean what one of our competitors would get to have Ford Pro? It's a $50 billion commercial business with the potential to become a high-margin, high-multiple hardware, software and service company akin to John Deere. In the quarter, volume, pricing and software subscriptions continue to accelerate as we capture significant pent-up demand across multiple commercial sectors and locations in both North America and in Europe. We are now realizing the full benefits of our new Super Duty. Super Duty sales in Q2 were up 28%, and the strong demand for our flagship work product is going to fuel our earnings growth for years to come. And our brand business also continued to grow in the quarter. And that's before the launch of the all-new version of Ford Pro's other key profit pillar, the one Transit in Europe. Our share of the U.S. 127 commercial truck and van market is over 40% this year so far. That is twice our nearest competitor and brand, twice. And it's a similar story in Europe, where the Transit franchises help make Ford the top-selling commercial brand for 8 years in a row. Ford Pro has all the attributes of the business that is difficult to disrupt. Our combination of services, software, dominant product, dominant market share, upfitting and large dealer physical repair work will not be easy to match. Accordingly, we will continue to shift more investment to fuel Ford Pro's growth and press our advantage with full flexibility between EV and ICE. So now let's get to the big change in our industry. And it happens to start including with Ford Pro because Ford Pro is at the forefront of this biggest change, the digital transformation, going to software and services as a differentiator. We already have over or about 550,000 subscribers, paid subscribers and service subscribers, and Ford Pro is 80% of those. We are already seeing 50% gross margins on today's software services. For example, telematics, where customers are now paying $20 a month, and that's before we even introduced our fully-networked architecture in the new vehicles that launched just in the year or 2. Moving to the next profitable software segment. Since launch, BlueCruise customers have traveled nearly 1.4 billion hands-free hours across North America, and that is a 44% increase since the end of Q1, 44% increase in three months. In July, we hit our 100 millionth-mile driven, hands-free with BlueCruise. Our Version 1.0 was chosen by consumer reports earlier this year as the number one rated system in the U.S. And since then, we've continued to enhance and accelerate launching two more versions of BlueCruise Cross through over their updates, each significantly improving the driver's experience. And we have now shortened the cycle time between these new versions. As a company, we're investing significantly in software. But the bigger story is the elite talent we have brought into Ford. They are attracted by the opportunity to revolution, the experience of owning and driving a vehicle for millions of customers, driving an iconic brand like Ford. I really believe we have the industry's best minds working on this incredible digital revolution. And with that talent, we are moving from our supplier control firmware to our own fully-networked electric architecture. And this will reach across all vehicles: ICE, hybrids and EVs. This is a key point because it allows us to have far higher installed base than just EVs alone. Think of the F-150. There are three key applications sit on top of this new software platform. The first one is safety and security. We haven't launched it yet. But boy, are we working hard to launch it. It will give customers ability to monitor the surroundings in their vehicle on top sites are at home. It will transform the experience of owning a Ford. The second one, of course, is driver assist technology. BlueCruise is just the beginning of our ambition. And the third one is productivity. Like the telematics that we sell a pro, but we're not going to stop there. Right around the corner, we'll have predictive failure components. Now imagine our productivity gain for our Pro customers who never were off the road because we know something is going to go bad before it does. This is just the beginning of the applications. These services will bring high-margin, reoccurring revenue streams that are less capital-intensive and cyclical than our traditional vehicle sales. To wrap up, there is understandably a lot of in the UAW contract discussions that began two weeks ago. We won't negotiate public, but I would like to share our general approach and our BlueCruise. When it comes to building in America and partnering with UAW, Ford from all the other automakers, most other major industrial companies. We believe, as Sean and Chuck do, the Ford should do our part to support the middle class, create vibrant communities and build a strong American and industrial [ pat ]. Everyone knows or didn't go bankrupt, and we didn't take a bailout, but they may not know that we added a significant amount of UAW manufacturing jobs. In fact, thousands of jobs in the U.S. since The Great Recession. We have actually done more than is required by our contract to add jobs, move employees from temporary to permanent, improve benefits, and we're on our way to spending $1 billion to improve our factory working conditions. It comes with some additional costs. But for us, this is not simply a number-crunching exercise. We believe over time, customers will appreciate and reward our approach and our workforce to be more committed to delivering BlueCruise through our transformation. So although these negotiations promise to be challenging, our goal is to build a bridge to the future with our employees based on mutual trust and a spirit of problem solving with the UAW leadership, and of course, our incredible workforce. Over to you, John.\nJohn Lawler: Thanks, Jim. On the power of our three customer-focused segments really starting this time through. In the quarter, we delivered an 8% increase in wholesale, adjusted EBIT of $3.8 billion and an 8.4% adjusted EBIT margin. The year-over-year improvement in adjusted EBIT was primarily driven by higher net pricing and volume, partially offset by higher as we ramp EVs and expected lower core credit profits. In the quarter, we delivered $2.9 billion of adjusted free cash flow, underscoring the improved performance generated from our industrial footprint. This consistency, combined with disciplined capital allocation, provides significant flexibility to fund our growth while also consistently returning capital to our shareholders. We continue to target returning 40% to 50% of free cash flow to investors. And earlier this morning, we declared our third quarter regular dividend of $0.15 per share. Our balance sheet remains strong. We ended the quarter with $30 billion of cash and over $47 billion of liquidity. We're recently upgraded by both Moody's and DBRS and demonstrating the trajectory of the business. Now turning to our customer-focused business segments. With revenue growth of 5%, Ford Blue delivered $2.3 billion in EBIT with a margin of over 9%. Despite these strong results, EBIT declined modestly year-over-year, including the nonrecurrence of a onetime insurance settlement. That said, costs were flat, and we expect this to continue to improve in the second half of this year. Now importantly, Ford Blue continues to be profitable in every region, reflecting the disciplined capital allocation that has fundamentally derisked our global business. We're now really starting to see the results, a fresh, exciting product line-up that is driving both strong demand and price in key markets across the globe. And perhaps the strongest example of this is F-150, an incredible product, which many don't understand, effectively, our F-150 equivalent outside North America and that drives meaningful bottom line results for both blue and Mach-E. Now turning to Mach-E. Revenue increased 39% year-over-year and more than doubled significantly as we added capacity for both Manati and the F-150 lighting. Contribution margin and EBIT margin were both negative with pricing and volume pressures intensified, and that's impacting all OEMs. Given the rapid and dynamic gain on the pricing environment, we no longer expect to see contribution margin breakeven for our Gen 1 products this year. One of the primary benefits of Ford's industry-leading reporting transparency, product leadership and customer insight is that we can quickly react to market reality. We know that once a customer chooses an AV brand, they stick with that brand over time. So as we make pricing decisions and assess customer acquisition costs, we're not only weighing the immediate impact on profitability but also how this translates to the lifetime value of that customer. Despite the dynamic environment, we remain committed to delivering 8% EBIT margin target in 2026, and we have a real strategic benefit. Our second-generation products are being developed to complete with all new digital architecture. So while the path to sustainable profitability may not look quite the same as we previously thought, we're confident in our ability to deliver through a more efficient product design, cost efficiencies and growth in software and services, which will continue to accelerate. Now as we've demonstrated over the last several years, we will continue to be laser-focused on disciplined capital allocation and ultimately delivering a leading and profitable EV footprint that provides us with the flexibility to scale by based on customer demand. Now Ford Pro. Ford Pro's results, they continue to accelerate, demonstrating the power of our portfolio. For this quarter, Ford Pro delivered a 28% increase in revenue driven by transit in our all-new Super Duty. EBIT more than doubled to $2.4 million, resulting in a margin of 3%. The significant year-over-year improvement EBIT reflects higher pricing and increased volume, both outstanding of the strength in commercial business. And we continue to be encouraged by our leading market position in the U.S. and Europe, our strong order banks, the upcoming launch of our new one Transit and a huge opportunity to grow software and services, and I'll talk more about this in a moment. But with over 450,000 customer subscriptions and with significant growth each quarter, this is a key pillar of our Ford Pro business. Ford Credit generated EBT of $309 million. Results were in line with our expectations, but down $550 million from a year ago, reflecting lower financing margin, nonrecurring credit loss reserve releases, residual value performance, all of which was already reflected in our full year outlook. Credit loss performance remains strong and below our historical average but is expected to increase and auction values remain robust, but are down from their peak in the first half of 2022. Before turning to our outlook, let me provide a little more text regarding some. In my mind, this is the real opportunity for value. We are already seeing sustained double-digit quarter-over-quarter growth in subscriptions across all of our business segments and most importantly, at gross margins of around 50%. And our next-generation digital platform will enable a step function change in capability, allowing us to scale and deliver value to both our retail and commercial customers even faster. Regarding our outlook, we now expect full year total company adjusted EBIT of $11 billion to $12 billion, primarily reflecting stronger net pricing in Ford Pro and Ford Blue with adjusted free cash flow of $6.5 billion to $7 billion and capital expenditures between $8 billion and $9 billion. Our guidance reflects headwinds, which include continued global economic uncertainty and inflationary pressures, higher industry-wide customer incentives and continued EV pricing pressure, increased warranty costs, lower past service exchange and costs associated with union agreements. And tailwinds include improvement in the supply chain and higher invite volume, all-new Super Duty and lower comps. Now turning to the segments. We now expect Ford Blue to deliver full year EBIT of about $8 billion. We expect higher volumes and stronger mix and more than offset any potential pricing headwind. The Model E to report an EBIT loss of around $4.5 billion, largely reflecting the present pricing environment, disciplined investment in new products and capacity and other costs. We also expect Ford Pro's EBIT to approach $8 billion with a significant year-over-year improvement driven by pricing and volume, including the benefit from the alley. And Ford Credit EBT is anticipated to be about $1.3 billion. So that wraps our prepared remarks, and we'll use the balance of time to address what your minds. Thank you. And operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nAdam Jonas: Hey everybody. So first to Lynn's mother, Tony. I've actually never met you before, but I feel like I know you and I've heard so many stories from your daughter, not just about your humour and your amazing Puerto Rican cooking, but also for your values and how you've always stood up for what is right. So I just want to say God bless you, Tony. And just one question, Jim, thank you for showing the losses in Model E when nobody else in this industry has the courage to do so amongst the legacy peers. Losing $40,000 a unit on a model obviously can't continue. So is this something that you feel you can just grow your way out of? Or does something more radical need to change? And I'm thinking Audi and Volkswagen are turning to SAIC and Xing in China. There seems to be something a pivot going on in the industry where there's a willingness to work with competitors, your stuff with Tesla was your -- some of your peers seem to reluctantly follow you and you really showed leadership there. So I'm wondering if you could embrace or more of that collaborative approach to be -- remain relevant in EVs while also being more capital disciplined.\nJim Farley: You're absolutely right. I would say, Adam, when Doug came on board and at the same time, we did a wider, especially Texas. And we really understood the BYD teardowns and even Changan, our partner in China. Our eyes were opened more than a year ago, and so we were fortunate that our new platform that non-semi are coming at a time when our traditional competitors have already designed and made their bets in the EV platforms. And I could tell you that, that moment was one of the biggest eye-opening moment in my personal career, where I realized we had completely changed our approach to platforms. The inverter technology, the efficiency in the system as -- of the vehicle, the massive complexity reduction and cost competitive reduction that we have to make in the second cycle products was just dramatic. The battery pack design that we see from our competitors is completely uncompetitive from what we saw and what we're now executing against. The gearboxes, the motors, how we thought about investment in braking systems and wiring systems, the diversity of battery chemistry like LFP, it was all just a moment when we all looked at each other and said, \"We have to go left to beat the -- and compete with these competitors that make a really on EV.\" And so we're executing that. And as John said, Adam, the other epiphany was for us, and thank God we have Pro because it's come to fruition is the enormous cost but importance of upgrading the electric architecture so we could be a winner in spending software to the vehicle. This decision by Ford and the type of products to bundle new, simpler, more energy-efficient platform that compete in segments where we have a great reputation that we can still conquest with very simple top hat engineering and add to it an advanced electrical architecture where we can win the war of shipping software to the vehicle was our bet, is our bet. And we like our bet, and we think it's competitive. In the meantime, we learned about battery scaling, which is not easy in Georgia. We learned about how to build 10,000, 20,000 unit a month batteries in one facility in high quality. We learned about the thermal propagation that will protect our brands over time, and I'm very optimistic. However, in a place like China, you only have to the local our local JV partners' platforms because they are the best in the world in certain segments. Maybe not for a full-size truck or a large trial cross-sell. But for some segments, it may be perfect for us. So we're not changing strategy at Ford. We've always been on that strategy, including China.\nOperator: The next question comes from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nRod Lache: I wanted to also ask a question about Model E. Just pushing out the EV targets, the volume targets make sense when we see contribution margins from volume being offset to additional price. But I was hoping that you might want to talk to us about kind of the longer term. What does it mean with regard to your 2026 targets? I'm glad to hear that you aren't fixated on two million units. What is your ability to adjust investment in structural costs when you have to make commitments to suppliers or to your infrastructure to be capable of hitting that? And are you still committed to the 8% margin target? A - John Lawler Yes. Rod, it's John. So we're not walking away from the 8% run rate in 2026. We've got several years to work that. It may look a little bit different than we shared at Capital Markets Day, but there's levers that we will. We don't necessarily have to spend at the same rate. Some of the battery factories to be flexible. The transition from components to electrical components is optional from a timing standpoint, so we can make those changes. And as Jim said, we've got the team working on that second generation of products, which is critical, and we have to work this in understanding whether pricing is settling and coming up with the right value equation. So we're not walking away from the 8% in '26, and we're going to continue to work on that.\nJim Farley: As far as the volume trade-off, Rod, is interesting. The elasticity model that we're now building because of our high volume, we're at the middle part of the year this year. We filed about 120,000 EV. We're learning a lot about that elasticity between price and volume. It's actually not as different than ICE than we thought. So we have a lot of information that didn't have a year ago on the volume trade-off profit optimization, plus all the levers that John talked about on the 8%.\nOperator: The next question comes from Dan Levy with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nDan Levy: Dan Levy with Barclays. Wanted to ask, Jim, on a comment you made earlier about plan to quadruple your number of hybrids. I don't remember what the base plan is, but just tying into maybe Rod's question, wondering what part of your push to decarbonize where there may be a little more flexibility and we lever. And how do hybrid factor in? Is the push on hybrids incremental? Was that always part of the plan? How are you looking at simply between hybrid and EVs?\nJim Farley: Great question. I think how -- in general how we think about it is a year ago, two months ago, the industry thought of kind of this extreme hybrid and EV. What we now realize and being in markets like China, that there's an infinite number of decrease of electrification in between both of those. And the customers are very rational about buying an EREV versus a long-range PHAB versus a SERA hybrid for towing, customers are really acting pre rationally based on their duty cycle. So I would say a couple of years ago we decided to continue our hybrid investment in our heavier vehicles. And those hybrid systems are quite different, let's say, to Toyota Japanese OEM. And we have been surprised the popularity of hybrid systems for F-150. It's now north of 10% mix cost, and it's increasing. And what we've learned is that we have to tie. What the customer really likes is when we take a hybrid system that's more efficient in duty cycles, and then we add new capabilities battery like Pro Power Ford. We're seeing a lot in that combination of using the battery or something beyond just moving the vehicle. And that popularity, I mean we never thought we would be at 50% hybrid mix for Maverick. It was far beyond our expectation. And so we're just listening to the market. We believe that ICE customers, Blue customers don't want to be left behind. They want modern powertrains, and decarbonizing with them is just as attractive. That's one of the reasons why we separated the business because we want a Ford Blue and Pro. On Pro side, we're very lucky. We have a lot of great multi-energy platforms. So we have a lot of choices between electrification, partial electrification and ICE and the infinite number in between. The platforms are designed for that flexibility. So all I'm saying is you're going to see a lot more hybrid systems from us, but don't think of them in the traditional sense of an escape hybrid or Prius. They're probably going to come to light differently than the people think, and customers like that.\nDan Levy: Great. And are there other levers in terms of flexibility on the plan where some elements can be deferred, again, just a function of, like you said, listening to the market?\nJim Farley: You mean capital deployment to EVs? Or can you be more specific?\nDan Levy: Capital deployment to EV and program development reuse. I mean one of your competitors earlier this week announced that one of their programs, which expected to cease, was being refreshed and with a function of sort of reuse of capital. So are there things you can do? Yes.\nJim Farley: I see. So we don't -- I want to be really clear about this. You -- all of you haven't yet seen our second cycle EV strategy or even the third cycle that we're working on, and I'm not going to tell our competitors about that right now. But I will tell you that it's very important to know that Ford strategy is not to build compliant vehicles that are very affordable for acquisition cost but lose lots of money. That's not our strategy when it comes to electrification. Our strategy is to make 8% margin irregardless of the price point, and we're going to allocate capital along those lines. So the pressure we're in ourselves is that we -- in future segments, we execute the product with rural efficiency and simplicity, and we upgrade the electric architecture for lots of software revenue and profits with great margins for all of our electric and our hybrid vehicles. And they all have to stand on their own in the segment report, and you will see all those results transparently. We don't create greenhouse grass credits between our businesses. We used to allocate capital. It was like $5,000 a vehicle. We're done. We're done with that. We don't play games like that. That's why we created these segments. And if we have a low-cost vehicle like some of our competitors have, it's not going to be a compliance set. It's on a vehicle that we convince ourselves we can make 8%. Maybe a lot of that is in software because we do need to build this installed base. I hope that's clear what our top-of-the-house strategy is and maybe how it's different than others.\nOperator: The next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJohn Murphy: Just one really quick follow-up there, Jim. When you're talking about hybrids, are you talking about plug-in hybrids or hybrids that will qualify for the $7,500 IRA credit just that they have batteries that are large enough? I just wanted to make sure we understand that.\nJim Farley: Yes. I want to make it really clear. The term hybrid is going to -- in our industry going to get our company. Hybrid could be a serial hybrid. It just means a motor powers batteries. It could be a hybrid in the traditional sense that like the F-150 hybrid or the -- and the hybrids I'm referring to are not plug-in hybrids. They are vehicles without a plug.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRyan Brinkman: My question, which is around the outlook for the bigger loss of Model E segment this year. And I guess the changed guidance reflects greater price competition. But as some portion of the outlook for a bigger loss may be driven in part also by a conscious decision to reinvest some of the higher-than-expected profit that Pro and Blue back into the business, the accelerating electric vehicle development or other EV-related capabilities. And with regard to that breakeven on a contribution margin target for first-generation EDs, can investors now expect that at some point in 2024? And then finally here, just given the reiteration of the 8% EV target in '26, could you maybe help us some more with the factors that continue to give you confidence in that target? Is it related at all to Jim's comments at the start of the call for maybe taking some time for the winners in the EV market to be sorted from the losers, reflecting your expectation that by 2026, the number of market participants could be less. And so therefore, pricing competition more rational? Or is the confidence more -- factors under your control that give you that confidence, leaning more on vertical integration and other levers that you might have identified, et cetera?\nJohn Lawler: Yes, Ryan. I think that in the absence of that question highlights the complexity and all the levers that we have to work with here, and so what I would say is we haven't changed our plan. What changed is that the adoption we're seeing with -- now that we've moved into early majority and the price premium of EVs has come off or normalized more quickly than we expected, and so that's impacting the profitability right now. But we're continuing to work through all of those levers as we build out the second generation of vehicles. And that path, that bridge that we had talked about, we had thought that prices would come down. It's sooner than we had thought. And it might be a little bit deeper than we had thought. But also as we get more and more confidence and gain more and more confidence in the products that Doug is creating and the combination of that product, both the physical hardware and the software and the experience and the ability to execute a completely optimized system of higher vehicle, that's giving us confidence in our ability to move towards a sustainably profitable segment in EV, starting with our second generation. So we're not walking away from that 8% target.\nJim Farley: And I really want to mention something that I'm compelled to mention, which is in the U.S. right now, I don't know, 7% to 8% depending on the month. The intention by still 30% to 50%. There are plenty of consumers. The issue is price to pay has come down, but it's very, very lumpy. It's not consistent across all segments. So one of the most important levers that John is referring to is what segment we compete in with our second-generation products. That's why I said clearly that we are so thankful we did not bet on 2-row crossovers. We have bet on segments that we know deeply, deeply, deeply. And we now know what we know, and we can't unlearn what we learned from the per EV companies on cost and complexity. And now we have touted a company like Doug, where we're shipping almost 0.5 million software, that many software subscribers. So there is real demand for these customers based on duty cycle. It's up to us to get those second site products and doing the cost reductions in the meantime. And I think our strategy, the segments we compete, which is not visible to see yet, I think it's going to really differentiate Ford.\nJohn Lawler: All right. One thing, Jim. One of the other things that we are looking at, this is the future and this is about an installed base, and so we're also looking at these customers today in the acquisition. We know that once you bring them in, they're more loyal. We think about what the retention rates will be over second vehicle or a third vehicle. They come down over time. We also think about it from a modest software attach rate to these vehicles. And we very carefully look at the present value of that. And is it still positive given the acquisition cost of these customers to invest in the row? And so we watch that very closely. And we talked about that with the team. I'm not going to give you the specific numbers, but that's what we're thinking about. And I can tell you, if we get to the point where that lifetime customer value is there an acquisition cost, that's what we said. We won't acquire customers with any cost, and we know where those lines are for. And so that's one of the other things that we're using -- we're looking at this as we invest in our future.\nOperator: The next question comes from Philippe Houchois with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nPhilippe Houchois: I hear what you're saying, Jim, and it's very interesting. It makes perfect sense. But it seems now like compared to a few weeks ago, we saw you in Detroit, this is -- it's not a turnaround. It's not about, but it's quite -- it's like you had relation in BEV. And it seems like the last few weeks, I've shaken that contingents quite a lot. And I'm just trying to understand how much of this is a reaction to a more difficult environment to understand and how much is strategic. And you should have been strategic a while back because I look at competitors, whether it's Toyota or BMW, you have taken a more careful approach about this transition, the complexity and have a bit more flexibility. So just to sense the change of mood. Part of the question, if I do a simple math, the loss per car in Pro was about $32,000. There were 12,000 EVs -- sorry, in E. There were 12,000 EVs in Pro. Does it mean that there's a loss of about $250 million booked in Pro, which means that we've added, the margin will be even higher, something like 18%.\nJohn Lawler: Yes. Just one thing. I understand I appreciate the math and doing the math that way. And you look at it, wow, it's a big number. You have to remember that there's a lot of investment going to ramp and put the footprint in as well that these vehicles are carrying. And we're -- we added quite a bit of capacity to make it work, and so we have to think about it that way as well. We have to break it into what's the contribution margin, what's the gross profit, how much are you investing for the future so that we can scale and grow this business because we know EVs are coming. It's not like it's a question we're not going to have EV. So we can do the math that way, but I'm not sure it's the right way to think about how we're approaching this business because there is a lot of upfront cost to invest in that footprint so that we can grow. And remember, we're working on our second generation and our third-generation vehicles. That has cost as well. So to attach all of it just to these vehicles, I don't think it's quite the right way to be thinking about that as we move forward, respectfully.\nJim Farley: On the -- I'm not sure, but I think you're going referring to the Lighting price decrease, and I want to be really clear. We built about 24,000 electric vehicles at Ford in the first quarter. Our target for the quarter four is $100,000. That's four times. The ramp on F-150 in September is really significant. We always knew that we had to build an order bank that looked nothing like the original F-150 Lightning order bank because our production is tripling. And that's really critical for us strategically because we have a second cycle product coming, and it's going to be really profitable, and so that's really important to understand. We didn't cut the price the F-150 $100,000 to create an order bank for our current production rate. It's for a tripling. And oh, by the way, the F-150 price after the $10,000 decline is still above its launch price.\nOperator: The last question today comes from Jim Picariello with BNP Paribas Exane. Please go ahead.\nJim Picariello: Just looking at the guidance for Blue, now at $8 billion for the year. There's almost a $2 billion step-down, right, first half to second half. Can you just unpack what the key bridge items -- are there to the sequential step-down? I mean I know there's obvious sensitivity around what could be baked in for the UAW contract impact. But beyond this, how should we be thinking about for Blue volumes, pricing? Any other factors that stand out for the second half?\nJohn Lawler: Yes. Thanks. So when you look at that for Blue on a half-over-half basis, we -- pricing held up much better than we thought through the second quarter, but we do have planned in the second half as we continue to increase volumes in Blue that we will see some pricing pressure there. So we see that happening as we walk through. We do have in the second half the ratification, which we see when we get to a new contract. And remember, for us, all of that is in our quarter, in our fourth quarter. We don't amortize that. We take it as a full charge in the quarter. And then we're also seeing some inflationary pressures. And we saw that in the quarter as well, we see that going through the second half, primarily around warranty, and that's with the costs that we're seeing come through the dealers. So they're increasing their costs and warranty for the repairs. Their labor rates, et cetera, have gone up with inflation. And then the other thing we're seeing across the board, we saw it in the second quarter, but we see it through this quarter as well, is the cost we're seeing right freight costs. Although some of the rates are coming down. We're seeing constraints overseas. We're seeing rail constraints. So we're generally seeing constraints around freight, and that's driving up costs as well there. So that's the combination of the puts and takes for Blue as we go our half over half.\nOperator: This concludes the Ford Motor Company Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jim Farley",
            "content": "Well, first, mom, thank you for Lynn. Thanks to all of you for joining us on the May Capital Markets event, where we shared our vision to refound our 120-year-old American icon and create a Ford that thrives at this exciting intersection between great vehicles and digital experiences. Now the world is changing fast, but I have never been more confident in our Ford+ plan. As you've heard me say, our intention is to match this exciting long-term vision for Ford with boringly predictable execution quarter after quarter, year after year. And that's the biggest takeaway from our second quarter: strong growth, strong earnings, cash flow and progress on the fundamentals of our business, including software. We are very bullish on the potential for Ford Pro, which had an outstanding quarter. It's unique to Ford. It's a true powerhouse. At the same time, Ford Blue is taking advantage of fresh, appealing products to generate healthy revenues, healthy share and profits, while Model E continues to scale with popular, first-generation electric vehicles. We're going to dive more into the electric vehicle market during Q&A. But clearly, this transition to EVs is dynamic and so much more than just a change in propulsion. The number of global entrants is increasing even at the high end and the pricing pressure has dramatically increased in the past 60 days. Despite these puts and takes, we have confidence in the underlying trajectory of Ford's business. Our portfolio of businesses is strong, thanks to businesses like Pro and Blue, and we are raising our estimated EBIT guidance this year to $11 billion to $12 billion. Operationally, we continue to be focused on capital discipline, solid returns even as we face uncertainties in the external environment. Supply chain disruptions are persistent, but they're now easy. And we have more work to do to streamline our industrial system, reducing costs and improving quality. While EV adoption is still growing, the paradigm has shifted. EV price premiums over internal combustion vehicles fell more than $3,000 in the second quarter and nearly $5,000 in first half. We expect the EV market to remain volatile until the winners and losers shake out, and we are confident from a brand, from our incredible product strategy, our software, our scale and our cost position, we will be one of the winners long term. Why do I say that? We moved quickly to establish our EV nameplates in the unique segments, not like others, the Lightning, the Maki, the ETrans. We're building EV brand lowers. It's critical. Many of our EV customers are all new to Ford. This is a significant asset to Ford given our new Gen 2 products and profitability that we'll be launching soon. For Gen 2, we focused on fewer, higher volume models in the right segments to take advantage of our strengths and knowledge of customers, even Conquest customers. For example, work vehicles, pickups for retail customers and spacious seven-passenger SUVs. I am so glad we didn't bet the farm on two row crossovers ICE like EV platforms, like so many have. We moved early on LFP, especially production in the U.S., giving us a diversity of chemistry cost advantage. We are now offering Mach-E with LFP technology for sale in the U.S. With the addition of Tesla Superchargers and the Fast Chargers that our dealers are installed, the Blue Oval charging network will be the single largest integrated fast charge network across the U.S. and Canada, and this blanket coverage from tens of thousands of fast chargers is core to our strategy. It helps us with smaller, lower cost and faster charging batteries. We have the flexibility to offer customers choice of ICE, hybrids and full electrics in the years to come. Our hybrid offerings are extremely popular. F-150 is the best-selling vehicle in the U.S. for 46 years, 10% of all F-150s and 56% of all Mavericks sold in the U.S. are sold as hybrids. We are adding hybrid options across our ICE line-up, and we expect to quadruple our hybrid sales in the next five years, and we're already number two in the market last year. Starting January 01, we moved to a new retail model for Model e, way ahead of our competition, again, a differentiated model that will deliver non-negotiated price, a simple shopping and ownership experience and remote services for all of our customers. This is critical to a conquest digital brand. And finally, with these new models, we are nimble and we can adapt to the market fluctuations real time, and you've seen this with both the Mach-E and the Lightning as we are adding enormous capacity to meet pent-up demand. We are optimizing for the long-term value creation. More than 60% of Mach-E and half of Lightning customers are new to Ford. These new customers have significant lifetime value potential beyond because of the shippable software. But we are disciplined as we grow, and we won't bear an unlimited cost to acquire those customers and build our install base. In line with that, we are now targeting to reach 600,000 annual production units of EVs by next year, and we maintain flexibility on where we reach when we reach two million total EV global capacity because we are balancing growth, profitability and returns. At the same, we believe demand for our internal combustion and our hybrid portfolio will be durable with the window of growth in Ford Blue potentially longer and richer than most expected. We've proven we can design and develop popular vehicles that stand out from the competition irregardless of their propulsion, and we made sure Ford is profitable as we move through this ICE EV transition. So let me cover a few highlights for each of our business segments. The appeal in pricing power of Ford Blues, iconic vehicles, those Mustang lineups, the Maverick, the F-150, the Explorers, all those cool, new derivatives from Ford, boy, these products remain strong. Ford was America's number one brand in the first half of this year. Also in the first half of this year, our best seller, F-150, by the way, 100% built in the U.S. that our competitors can't say, grew almost three times the rate of the overall pickup truck market. We expect our pricing and revenue to continue in the second half as we have new launches at Mustang. And I would add pace of new product introductions for Ford will only accelerate from here. We plan to introduce, for example, an all-new F-150 and F-150 PowerBoost hybrid at the Detroit Show in September. Now outside North America, the Ranger and its sister product, the Everest SUV, are the backbone of a much stronger, more profitable international business. The all-new version of the Ranger and Everest are most popular and profitable than the previous model, and Ranger alone is now the truck leader and eighth large pickup truck market around the globe. Our aftersales business continues to grow, and we are on track to launch over 2,000 mobile service units by the end of this year. That is unique to Ford. Ford Blues, other top priorities are to follow reduce our cost structure. To do that, we've launched a lean, disciplined operating system that reaches into every one of our plants, every part we buy, every engineering decision we make. We're making progress, but this is just the start of our culture change. Turning to Pro, which is proving to be a unique strength to Ford. I mean what one of our competitors would get to have Ford Pro? It's a $50 billion commercial business with the potential to become a high-margin, high-multiple hardware, software and service company akin to John Deere. In the quarter, volume, pricing and software subscriptions continue to accelerate as we capture significant pent-up demand across multiple commercial sectors and locations in both North America and in Europe. We are now realizing the full benefits of our new Super Duty. Super Duty sales in Q2 were up 28%, and the strong demand for our flagship work product is going to fuel our earnings growth for years to come. And our brand business also continued to grow in the quarter. And that's before the launch of the all-new version of Ford Pro's other key profit pillar, the one Transit in Europe. Our share of the U.S. 127 commercial truck and van market is over 40% this year so far. That is twice our nearest competitor and brand, twice. And it's a similar story in Europe, where the Transit franchises help make Ford the top-selling commercial brand for 8 years in a row. Ford Pro has all the attributes of the business that is difficult to disrupt. Our combination of services, software, dominant product, dominant market share, upfitting and large dealer physical repair work will not be easy to match. Accordingly, we will continue to shift more investment to fuel Ford Pro's growth and press our advantage with full flexibility between EV and ICE. So now let's get to the big change in our industry. And it happens to start including with Ford Pro because Ford Pro is at the forefront of this biggest change, the digital transformation, going to software and services as a differentiator. We already have over or about 550,000 subscribers, paid subscribers and service subscribers, and Ford Pro is 80% of those. We are already seeing 50% gross margins on today's software services. For example, telematics, where customers are now paying $20 a month, and that's before we even introduced our fully-networked architecture in the new vehicles that launched just in the year or 2. Moving to the next profitable software segment. Since launch, BlueCruise customers have traveled nearly 1.4 billion hands-free hours across North America, and that is a 44% increase since the end of Q1, 44% increase in three months. In July, we hit our 100 millionth-mile driven, hands-free with BlueCruise. Our Version 1.0 was chosen by consumer reports earlier this year as the number one rated system in the U.S. And since then, we've continued to enhance and accelerate launching two more versions of BlueCruise Cross through over their updates, each significantly improving the driver's experience. And we have now shortened the cycle time between these new versions. As a company, we're investing significantly in software. But the bigger story is the elite talent we have brought into Ford. They are attracted by the opportunity to revolution, the experience of owning and driving a vehicle for millions of customers, driving an iconic brand like Ford. I really believe we have the industry's best minds working on this incredible digital revolution. And with that talent, we are moving from our supplier control firmware to our own fully-networked electric architecture. And this will reach across all vehicles: ICE, hybrids and EVs. This is a key point because it allows us to have far higher installed base than just EVs alone. Think of the F-150. There are three key applications sit on top of this new software platform. The first one is safety and security. We haven't launched it yet. But boy, are we working hard to launch it. It will give customers ability to monitor the surroundings in their vehicle on top sites are at home. It will transform the experience of owning a Ford. The second one, of course, is driver assist technology. BlueCruise is just the beginning of our ambition. And the third one is productivity. Like the telematics that we sell a pro, but we're not going to stop there. Right around the corner, we'll have predictive failure components. Now imagine our productivity gain for our Pro customers who never were off the road because we know something is going to go bad before it does. This is just the beginning of the applications. These services will bring high-margin, reoccurring revenue streams that are less capital-intensive and cyclical than our traditional vehicle sales. To wrap up, there is understandably a lot of in the UAW contract discussions that began two weeks ago. We won't negotiate public, but I would like to share our general approach and our BlueCruise. When it comes to building in America and partnering with UAW, Ford from all the other automakers, most other major industrial companies. We believe, as Sean and Chuck do, the Ford should do our part to support the middle class, create vibrant communities and build a strong American and industrial [ pat ]. Everyone knows or didn't go bankrupt, and we didn't take a bailout, but they may not know that we added a significant amount of UAW manufacturing jobs. In fact, thousands of jobs in the U.S. since The Great Recession. We have actually done more than is required by our contract to add jobs, move employees from temporary to permanent, improve benefits, and we're on our way to spending $1 billion to improve our factory working conditions. It comes with some additional costs. But for us, this is not simply a number-crunching exercise. We believe over time, customers will appreciate and reward our approach and our workforce to be more committed to delivering BlueCruise through our transformation. So although these negotiations promise to be challenging, our goal is to build a bridge to the future with our employees based on mutual trust and a spirit of problem solving with the UAW leadership, and of course, our incredible workforce. Over to you, John. You're absolutely right. I would say, Adam, when Doug came on board and at the same time, we did a wider, especially Texas. And we really understood the BYD teardowns and even Changan, our partner in China. Our eyes were opened more than a year ago, and so we were fortunate that our new platform that non-semi are coming at a time when our traditional competitors have already designed and made their bets in the EV platforms. And I could tell you that, that moment was one of the biggest eye-opening moment in my personal career, where I realized we had completely changed our approach to platforms. The inverter technology, the efficiency in the system as -- of the vehicle, the massive complexity reduction and cost competitive reduction that we have to make in the second cycle products was just dramatic. The battery pack design that we see from our competitors is completely uncompetitive from what we saw and what we're now executing against. The gearboxes, the motors, how we thought about investment in braking systems and wiring systems, the diversity of battery chemistry like LFP, it was all just a moment when we all looked at each other and said, \"We have to go left to beat the -- and compete with these competitors that make a really on EV.\" And so we're executing that. And as John said, Adam, the other epiphany was for us, and thank God we have Pro because it's come to fruition is the enormous cost but importance of upgrading the electric architecture so we could be a winner in spending software to the vehicle. This decision by Ford and the type of products to bundle new, simpler, more energy-efficient platform that compete in segments where we have a great reputation that we can still conquest with very simple top hat engineering and add to it an advanced electrical architecture where we can win the war of shipping software to the vehicle was our bet, is our bet. And we like our bet, and we think it's competitive. In the meantime, we learned about battery scaling, which is not easy in Georgia. We learned about how to build 10,000, 20,000 unit a month batteries in one facility in high quality. We learned about the thermal propagation that will protect our brands over time, and I'm very optimistic. However, in a place like China, you only have to the local our local JV partners' platforms because they are the best in the world in certain segments. Maybe not for a full-size truck or a large trial cross-sell. But for some segments, it may be perfect for us. So we're not changing strategy at Ford. We've always been on that strategy, including China. As far as the volume trade-off, Rod, is interesting. The elasticity model that we're now building because of our high volume, we're at the middle part of the year this year. We filed about 120,000 EV. We're learning a lot about that elasticity between price and volume. It's actually not as different than ICE than we thought. So we have a lot of information that didn't have a year ago on the volume trade-off profit optimization, plus all the levers that John talked about on the 8%. Great question. I think how -- in general how we think about it is a year ago, two months ago, the industry thought of kind of this extreme hybrid and EV. What we now realize and being in markets like China, that there's an infinite number of decrease of electrification in between both of those. And the customers are very rational about buying an EREV versus a long-range PHAB versus a SERA hybrid for towing, customers are really acting pre rationally based on their duty cycle. So I would say a couple of years ago we decided to continue our hybrid investment in our heavier vehicles. And those hybrid systems are quite different, let's say, to Toyota Japanese OEM. And we have been surprised the popularity of hybrid systems for F-150. It's now north of 10% mix cost, and it's increasing. And what we've learned is that we have to tie. What the customer really likes is when we take a hybrid system that's more efficient in duty cycles, and then we add new capabilities battery like Pro Power Ford. We're seeing a lot in that combination of using the battery or something beyond just moving the vehicle. And that popularity, I mean we never thought we would be at 50% hybrid mix for Maverick. It was far beyond our expectation. And so we're just listening to the market. We believe that ICE customers, Blue customers don't want to be left behind. They want modern powertrains, and decarbonizing with them is just as attractive. That's one of the reasons why we separated the business because we want a Ford Blue and Pro. On Pro side, we're very lucky. We have a lot of great multi-energy platforms. So we have a lot of choices between electrification, partial electrification and ICE and the infinite number in between. The platforms are designed for that flexibility. So all I'm saying is you're going to see a lot more hybrid systems from us, but don't think of them in the traditional sense of an escape hybrid or Prius. They're probably going to come to light differently than the people think, and customers like that. You mean capital deployment to EVs? Or can you be more specific? I see. So we don't -- I want to be really clear about this. You -- all of you haven't yet seen our second cycle EV strategy or even the third cycle that we're working on, and I'm not going to tell our competitors about that right now. But I will tell you that it's very important to know that Ford strategy is not to build compliant vehicles that are very affordable for acquisition cost but lose lots of money. That's not our strategy when it comes to electrification. Our strategy is to make 8% margin irregardless of the price point, and we're going to allocate capital along those lines. So the pressure we're in ourselves is that we -- in future segments, we execute the product with rural efficiency and simplicity, and we upgrade the electric architecture for lots of software revenue and profits with great margins for all of our electric and our hybrid vehicles. And they all have to stand on their own in the segment report, and you will see all those results transparently. We don't create greenhouse grass credits between our businesses. We used to allocate capital. It was like $5,000 a vehicle. We're done. We're done with that. We don't play games like that. That's why we created these segments. And if we have a low-cost vehicle like some of our competitors have, it's not going to be a compliance set. It's on a vehicle that we convince ourselves we can make 8%. Maybe a lot of that is in software because we do need to build this installed base. I hope that's clear what our top-of-the-house strategy is and maybe how it's different than others. Yes. I want to make it really clear. The term hybrid is going to -- in our industry going to get our company. Hybrid could be a serial hybrid. It just means a motor powers batteries. It could be a hybrid in the traditional sense that like the F-150 hybrid or the -- and the hybrids I'm referring to are not plug-in hybrids. They are vehicles without a plug. And I really want to mention something that I'm compelled to mention, which is in the U.S. right now, I don't know, 7% to 8% depending on the month. The intention by still 30% to 50%. There are plenty of consumers. The issue is price to pay has come down, but it's very, very lumpy. It's not consistent across all segments. So one of the most important levers that John is referring to is what segment we compete in with our second-generation products. That's why I said clearly that we are so thankful we did not bet on 2-row crossovers. We have bet on segments that we know deeply, deeply, deeply. And we now know what we know, and we can't unlearn what we learned from the per EV companies on cost and complexity. And now we have touted a company like Doug, where we're shipping almost 0.5 million software, that many software subscribers. So there is real demand for these customers based on duty cycle. It's up to us to get those second site products and doing the cost reductions in the meantime. And I think our strategy, the segments we compete, which is not visible to see yet, I think it's going to really differentiate Ford. On the -- I'm not sure, but I think you're going referring to the Lighting price decrease, and I want to be really clear. We built about 24,000 electric vehicles at Ford in the first quarter. Our target for the quarter four is $100,000. That's four times. The ramp on F-150 in September is really significant. We always knew that we had to build an order bank that looked nothing like the original F-150 Lightning order bank because our production is tripling. And that's really critical for us strategically because we have a second cycle product coming, and it's going to be really profitable, and so that's really important to understand. We didn't cut the price the F-150 $100,000 to create an order bank for our current production rate. It's for a tripling. And oh, by the way, the F-150 price after the $10,000 decline is still above its launch price."

            "name": "John Lawler",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim. On the power of our three customer-focused segments really starting this time through. In the quarter, we delivered an 8% increase in wholesale, adjusted EBIT of $3.8 billion and an 8.4% adjusted EBIT margin. The year-over-year improvement in adjusted EBIT was primarily driven by higher net pricing and volume, partially offset by higher as we ramp EVs and expected lower core credit profits. In the quarter, we delivered $2.9 billion of adjusted free cash flow, underscoring the improved performance generated from our industrial footprint. This consistency, combined with disciplined capital allocation, provides significant flexibility to fund our growth while also consistently returning capital to our shareholders. We continue to target returning 40% to 50% of free cash flow to investors. And earlier this morning, we declared our third quarter regular dividend of $0.15 per share. Our balance sheet remains strong. We ended the quarter with $30 billion of cash and over $47 billion of liquidity. We're recently upgraded by both Moody's and DBRS and demonstrating the trajectory of the business. Now turning to our customer-focused business segments. With revenue growth of 5%, Ford Blue delivered $2.3 billion in EBIT with a margin of over 9%. Despite these strong results, EBIT declined modestly year-over-year, including the nonrecurrence of a onetime insurance settlement. That said, costs were flat, and we expect this to continue to improve in the second half of this year. Now importantly, Ford Blue continues to be profitable in every region, reflecting the disciplined capital allocation that has fundamentally derisked our global business. We're now really starting to see the results, a fresh, exciting product line-up that is driving both strong demand and price in key markets across the globe. And perhaps the strongest example of this is F-150, an incredible product, which many don't understand, effectively, our F-150 equivalent outside North America and that drives meaningful bottom line results for both blue and Mach-E. Now turning to Mach-E. Revenue increased 39% year-over-year and more than doubled significantly as we added capacity for both Manati and the F-150 lighting. Contribution margin and EBIT margin were both negative with pricing and volume pressures intensified, and that's impacting all OEMs. Given the rapid and dynamic gain on the pricing environment, we no longer expect to see contribution margin breakeven for our Gen 1 products this year. One of the primary benefits of Ford's industry-leading reporting transparency, product leadership and customer insight is that we can quickly react to market reality. We know that once a customer chooses an AV brand, they stick with that brand over time. So as we make pricing decisions and assess customer acquisition costs, we're not only weighing the immediate impact on profitability but also how this translates to the lifetime value of that customer. Despite the dynamic environment, we remain committed to delivering 8% EBIT margin target in 2026, and we have a real strategic benefit. Our second-generation products are being developed to complete with all new digital architecture. So while the path to sustainable profitability may not look quite the same as we previously thought, we're confident in our ability to deliver through a more efficient product design, cost efficiencies and growth in software and services, which will continue to accelerate. Now as we've demonstrated over the last several years, we will continue to be laser-focused on disciplined capital allocation and ultimately delivering a leading and profitable EV footprint that provides us with the flexibility to scale by based on customer demand. Now Ford Pro. Ford Pro's results, they continue to accelerate, demonstrating the power of our portfolio. For this quarter, Ford Pro delivered a 28% increase in revenue driven by transit in our all-new Super Duty. EBIT more than doubled to $2.4 million, resulting in a margin of 3%. The significant year-over-year improvement EBIT reflects higher pricing and increased volume, both outstanding of the strength in commercial business. And we continue to be encouraged by our leading market position in the U.S. and Europe, our strong order banks, the upcoming launch of our new one Transit and a huge opportunity to grow software and services, and I'll talk more about this in a moment. But with over 450,000 customer subscriptions and with significant growth each quarter, this is a key pillar of our Ford Pro business. Ford Credit generated EBT of $309 million. Results were in line with our expectations, but down $550 million from a year ago, reflecting lower financing margin, nonrecurring credit loss reserve releases, residual value performance, all of which was already reflected in our full year outlook. Credit loss performance remains strong and below our historical average but is expected to increase and auction values remain robust, but are down from their peak in the first half of 2022. Before turning to our outlook, let me provide a little more text regarding some. In my mind, this is the real opportunity for value. We are already seeing sustained double-digit quarter-over-quarter growth in subscriptions across all of our business segments and most importantly, at gross margins of around 50%. And our next-generation digital platform will enable a step function change in capability, allowing us to scale and deliver value to both our retail and commercial customers even faster. Regarding our outlook, we now expect full year total company adjusted EBIT of $11 billion to $12 billion, primarily reflecting stronger net pricing in Ford Pro and Ford Blue with adjusted free cash flow of $6.5 billion to $7 billion and capital expenditures between $8 billion and $9 billion. Our guidance reflects headwinds, which include continued global economic uncertainty and inflationary pressures, higher industry-wide customer incentives and continued EV pricing pressure, increased warranty costs, lower past service exchange and costs associated with union agreements. And tailwinds include improvement in the supply chain and higher invite volume, all-new Super Duty and lower comps. Now turning to the segments. We now expect Ford Blue to deliver full year EBIT of about $8 billion. We expect higher volumes and stronger mix and more than offset any potential pricing headwind. The Model E to report an EBIT loss of around $4.5 billion, largely reflecting the present pricing environment, disciplined investment in new products and capacity and other costs. We also expect Ford Pro's EBIT to approach $8 billion with a significant year-over-year improvement driven by pricing and volume, including the benefit from the alley. And Ford Credit EBT is anticipated to be about $1.3 billion. So that wraps our prepared remarks, and we'll use the balance of time to address what your minds. Thank you. And operator, please open the line for questions. Yes, Ryan. I think that in the absence of that question highlights the complexity and all the levers that we have to work with here, and so what I would say is we haven't changed our plan. What changed is that the adoption we're seeing with -- now that we've moved into early majority and the price premium of EVs has come off or normalized more quickly than we expected, and so that's impacting the profitability right now. But we're continuing to work through all of those levers as we build out the second generation of vehicles. And that path, that bridge that we had talked about, we had thought that prices would come down. It's sooner than we had thought. And it might be a little bit deeper than we had thought. But also as we get more and more confidence and gain more and more confidence in the products that Doug is creating and the combination of that product, both the physical hardware and the software and the experience and the ability to execute a completely optimized system of higher vehicle, that's giving us confidence in our ability to move towards a sustainably profitable segment in EV, starting with our second generation. So we're not walking away from that 8% target. All right. One thing, Jim. One of the other things that we are looking at, this is the future and this is about an installed base, and so we're also looking at these customers today in the acquisition. We know that once you bring them in, they're more loyal. We think about what the retention rates will be over second vehicle or a third vehicle. They come down over time. We also think about it from a modest software attach rate to these vehicles. And we very carefully look at the present value of that. And is it still positive given the acquisition cost of these customers to invest in the row? And so we watch that very closely. And we talked about that with the team. I'm not going to give you the specific numbers, but that's what we're thinking about. And I can tell you, if we get to the point where that lifetime customer value is there an acquisition cost, that's what we said. We won't acquire customers with any cost, and we know where those lines are for. And so that's one of the other things that we're using -- we're looking at this as we invest in our future. Yes. Just one thing. I understand I appreciate the math and doing the math that way. And you look at it, wow, it's a big number. You have to remember that there's a lot of investment going to ramp and put the footprint in as well that these vehicles are carrying. And we're -- we added quite a bit of capacity to make it work, and so we have to think about it that way as well. We have to break it into what's the contribution margin, what's the gross profit, how much are you investing for the future so that we can scale and grow this business because we know EVs are coming. It's not like it's a question we're not going to have EV. So we can do the math that way, but I'm not sure it's the right way to think about how we're approaching this business because there is a lot of upfront cost to invest in that footprint so that we can grow. And remember, we're working on our second generation and our third-generation vehicles. That has cost as well. So to attach all of it just to these vehicles, I don't think it's quite the right way to be thinking about that as we move forward, respectfully. Yes. Thanks. So when you look at that for Blue on a half-over-half basis, we -- pricing held up much better than we thought through the second quarter, but we do have planned in the second half as we continue to increase volumes in Blue that we will see some pricing pressure there. So we see that happening as we walk through. We do have in the second half the ratification, which we see when we get to a new contract. And remember, for us, all of that is in our quarter, in our fourth quarter. We don't amortize that. We take it as a full charge in the quarter. And then we're also seeing some inflationary pressures. And we saw that in the quarter as well, we see that going through the second half, primarily around warranty, and that's with the costs that we're seeing come through the dealers. So they're increasing their costs and warranty for the repairs. Their labor rates, et cetera, have gone up with inflation. And then the other thing we're seeing across the board, we saw it in the second quarter, but we see it through this quarter as well, is the cost we're seeing right freight costs. Although some of the rates are coming down. We're seeing constraints overseas. We're seeing rail constraints. So we're generally seeing constraints around freight, and that's driving up costs as well there. So that's the combination of the puts and takes for Blue as we go our half over half."

Now I'll turn the call over to Jim.\nJim Farley: Thank you, Lynn. And hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. I'd bottom line the first quarter like this. Our team delivered a solid quarter while making real progress on our Ford+ growth plan. And I hope that becomes a trend at Ford, boringly predictable when it comes to execution and delivering financials, but extremely ambitious and dynamic in creating the Ford of the future. For the quarter, we saw growth across all of our key metrics. In addition, Ford Pro and Blue were profitable in every region where we operate. Our balance sheet is strong. We ended the quarter with close to $29 billion in cash, even as we invest in growth and return capital to our shareholders. With each quarter that passes, I'm more confident and convinced and thankful we made the decision to create three separate customer-focused businesses. This has unleased clarity, speed and accountability across the company, not to mention a whole new level of discipline on capital allocation. So let me cover a few highlights. I'd like to start with Ford Pro. I know many of you were surprised at the true size of the Pro business in March when we recast our financials. Pro starts with marketing leadership in our vehicles across the world, tremendous scale and customer knowledge. And we're layering on top of that the future of our industry, an ecosystem of software and services and EV charging that we believe will be invaluable to our commercial customers. And this will unlock tremendous loyalty and profitable growth. Our strong order books in North America and Europe as well as all the demand signals we can see for Pro support our target to nearly double Pro's EBIT this year. In March, we launched the all-new Super Duty in Kentucky and Ohio. It has received tremendous reception, and it's going to strengthen a franchise that is already the market leader. Importantly, Super Duty is a platform for software and services that help our customers maximize their uptime, accelerate their productivity and lower total cost of ownership. I would also say the Super Duty launch is a good case study for the disciplined approach we're implementing across our industrial system. Simply put, we slowed the launch down, significantly increased on road and in plant quality testing, we dispatched a large and skilled launch team to our plant. We added test vehicles. We drove millions of miles to prove our durability, and we deployed new technology and artificial intelligence to catch issues. Basically, we put all the pressure in the system to find and then prevent future quality issues rather than speeding up the line to match our launch curve. Short-term patience, we believe that will result in long-term gain for our customers and yes, the company. In the quarter, Ford Pro extended its leadership in true commercial vehicle categories. Our share of the Class 1 through 7 truck and vans in the US increased by one full share point to 41% share. In Europe, we've already been the top commercial brand for eight years now running, and our share grew to more than 15%. We also maintained our EV strength in North America and Europe. In the US, E-Transit has already a 50% market share. In the quarter, we won a contract to deliver more than 9,000 E-Transit vans to the US Postal Service. Ford Pro's paid software subscriptions rose 64% in the quarter including higher revenue per unit software sales, like our telematics and charging software. With these and all the other initiatives, Ford Pro is developing into a resilient business, certainly less cyclical than the broader automotive sector. In Ford Blue, the team is focused on capitalizing on our red-hot product lineup. Our opportunity to smartly grow extends to valuable franchises with great pricing power, like the F-150, the new Maverick, the new Bronco and, of course, the Mustang. We'll grow our leadership position in pickups, in off-road, in performance and in SUVs with all new derivatives. For example, we just introduced the Bronco less than three years ago. And already, it's neck and neck in sales with the Jeep Wrangler, and it has higher transaction prices. We've also recently expanded the Bronco lineup with exciting derivatives, like the Bronco Everglades, the Bronco Raptor and the Bronco Heritage. Derivatives not only continued to contribute to our growth, but importantly, they can also drive higher transaction prices and higher returns. See, these derivatives often have 80% part commonality with the base models, but their contribution margin percents can be 30% higher with a two-fold increase in capital efficiency. We also have one of the strongest product years coming for Ford Blue. So it's just beginning. We have the new Escape, including New Hybrid. It's just arriving in dealerships now. Next week, we will reveal the all-new Ranger in the highly anticipated Ranger Raptor. That will be followed by an all-new Mustang and high-performance Dark Horse Mustang this summer. While I can't get into the details yet, we have more exciting news to share about two of America's best-selling vehicles, the F-150 and the Explorer later this year. And on top of all that, we have the Lincoln Corsair arriving at dealerships now. And of course, we just revealed the Lincoln Nautilus. Now, Ford Model e operates with a start-up intensity to build a profitable EV business with a differentiated portfolio and a differentiated customer experience. US investors now have true visibility into how Ford Model e's profitability strengthens over time, supported by volume-driven operating leverage, improvements in design and efficiency and, of course, lower battery costs. We're on track this year towards a contribution margin approaching breakeven in Model e and for our first-generation products to be EBIT margin positive by the end of next year. Wholesales were down in the quarter, which deleveraged our cost structure. Part of the decline was planned, as we have brought Mustang Mach-E production down for several weeks, so we could almost double the capacity, and we are now hitting that 35 jump per hour run rate in the plant. Volumes were also impacted by the lower output of F-150 Lightning. We did the right thing, and I congratulate my team many times by immediately stopping production and working with our battery supplier finding and then fixing the root cause of the fire that happened on the Ford property. We're now shipping Lightnings, again, taking new orders and increasing production to an annual run rate of 150,000 units, about double what we do now. We are also revealing -- we revealed an all-electric Explorer in Europe, which is now very well received. We made progress on Model e in the quarter, advancing our industrial system to scale EVs. The site preparation is already underway for our LFP battery plant in Michigan. And construction continues at the BlueOval SK Battery Park in Kentucky and, of course, BlueOval City in Tennessee. We now plan to transform our Oakville Assembly Complex into a Canadian hub of electric vehicle and battery pack manufacturing. We also continue to make progress towards locking in all the raw materials that we need to support our capacity targets in \u201826 and beyond. Model e is our center of excellence for technology, including software. A good example of that is BlueCruise, which continues to be hit with our customers. Consumer Reports rated it the top advanced, hands-free driver assist system on the market in the US, and that was just version 1.0. Our latest release, which we're OTA-ing into customers, is version 1.2. It automatically changes lanes with the tap of a turn signal, and it delivers a much more natural driving experience hands-free. We also launched BlueCruise in the UK, our Mustang Mach-E, and became the first OEM to gain approval for hands-free highway driving speed anywhere in Europe with more than -- and now BlueCruise has more than 70 million miles driven to date, and we continue to upgrade BlueCruise for customers with each over-the-air update. Before I turn it over to John, I want to share our thoughts on how the EV market is evolving in our eyes. It's easy to look at the landscape of the EV market as a mono lift. But we plan to be surgical about where we play and how we win with the right products, the right cost structure, and the right price points. We do not subscribe to a win vehicle share at any cost approach. We look at share of vehicles, of course, and share revenue. We also look at share profits and share of the customer lifetime value, and we believe this is the only way to ensure we drive appropriate return on capital over time. By 2025, we now expect there to be 45 EV models to be offered in the US in the small, medium utility segment. It will be a very saturated two-row EV market. Against this backdrop to ensure profitable growth, we know we have to have a fresh, compelling offering with the right cost structure, something we continue to improve with the Mustang Mach-E. We also found that customers are very loyal to full EV powertrains once they enter, but they are not brand-loyal for their first purchase. We capitalize on that by getting to the market early with the Mustang Mach-E and our whole lineup, and it continues to reward us with over 60% of the customers new to Ford. We're seeing that the second EV purchase is much more loyal to the brand in these developed EV markets. So. we're glad that we have all these customers in our digital and physical ecosystem. We are aggressively lowering our product costs for our current and next-generation products. You'll find out a lot more in Capital Markets Day. But in fact, for Mustang Mach-E from launch through the end of this year, we'll have reduced the building materials from Mustang Mach-E by $5,000 per vehicle. Now, in contrast to two-world crossovers that we believe will be a very saturated market, we believe Model e can be highly differentiated in markets where we know the customer well, like the three-row utility space. And as I said, we'll share more about at our Capital Markets event later this month on our product strategy. I had a chance along with John and most of our leadership team, to go to China in the last few weeks and look at the EV market in a gemba, go-and-see activity up close. It's interesting to see how customers are no longer just attracted to traditional luxury brands with EVs or even hardware design anymore. Outstanding hardware styling, performance, quality are just a given in the EV digital marketplace today. The best new brands are offering integrated digital, retail, lifestyle and experience that are software defined. This is firmly in our sights for our second-generation EVs. This software as a differentiator, plus a radically different cost structure, and the ability to attract -- attach value-added software and services, gives us confidence we can compete and win in unit, revenue, profit and vehicle share while delivering appropriate returns. And Ford Pro is already there. I'll wrap up by saying we are pleased, but we are not satisfied. As I said, solid execution and some really thrilling progress advancing our Ford+ plan. I look forward to seeing many of you in-person in three weeks for our capital markets event, where we will go much deeper into our strategy and our progress. John?\nJohn Lawler: Thanks, Jim. First quarter, wholesales were up 9% year-over-year as we delivered $3.4 billion in adjusted EBIT. Margin was 8.1%, up 140 basis points. Ford Blue and Ford Pro profit improved, reflecting favorable mix and higher net pricing. And as expected, those benefits were partially offset with a loss in Model e as we invest in our clean sheet next-generation EVs and scale our leading portfolio of first-generation electric vehicles. For the quarter, we delivered $700 million of adjusted free cash flow, improving consistent free cash flow from our industrial footprint, combined with disciplined capital allocation, provides us with significant flexibility to fund our growth while also consistently returning capital to our shareholders. Our balance sheet remains strong. We ended the quarter with close to $29 billion of cash and over $46 billion of liquidity. In addition, despite the recent market volatility, we successfully completed the renewal of our $17 billion sustainability-linked corporate credit facilities. So turning to our customer focused business segments. With wholesales up 6%, Ford Blue delivered $2.6 billion in EBIT and a 10.4% margin. That was 400 basis points higher than a year ago supported by favorable mix and higher volume. Our fresh and exciting product lineup continues to drive strong demand. Wholesales for Model e declined in the quarter, reflecting planned downtime that allowed us to almost double our production capacity for Mustang Mach-E. Now the profitability of any EV start-up, including Ford Model e is highly levered to volume. Importantly, holding volume constant, our first quarter EBIT margin would have been roughly flat compared to the fourth quarter at around negative 40%. We expect Ford Model e EBIT margin to improve to around negative 20% in the second half of this year, reflecting stronger per unit contribution margin and significantly higher volumes. In fact, we expect Model e contribution margin to approach breakeven this year, and we continue to target positive EBIT margin for our first-generation vehicles by the end of 2024. Ford Pro delivered an 18% increase in wholesales. And EBIT improved $900 million to $1.4 billion for the quarter, delivering a margin of 10. 3%. The improvement in profitability was supported by higher net pricing, increased volume and favorable mix. Importantly, this was achieved during a quarter when wholesales for Super Duty were down, both year-over-year and sequentially as we ramped up production of our all-new version of this highly popular truck. Ford Credit delivered EBT of $300 million, down $600 million from a year ago, reflecting lower financing margin, higher credit losses and lower lease income, all of which has been reflected in our full year outlook. Credit loss performance remains strong and is still below the historical average but beginning to normalize. Auction values remain robust, but down from their peak in the first half of 2022. Ford Credit liquidity remained strong at $26 billion, up $5 billion from year-end. In addition, despite the volatile market conditions, the company has already completed $12 billion of public issuance or roughly 50% of its 2023 funding plan. Turning to our outlook. We continue to expect full year 2023 total company adjusted EBIT of $9 billion to $11 billion, adjusted free cash flow of about $6 billion and capital expenditures between $8 billion to $9 billion. This guidance includes headwinds that reflect global economic uncertainty, higher industry-wide customer incentives as vehicle supply and demand rebalance, lower past service pension income, exchange and investments in growth such as customer service and connected services. And tailwinds driven by improvement in the supply chain, our higher industry volume with SAARs of about $15 million and $13 million in the US and Europe, respectively, launch of our all-new Super Duty and lower cost of goods sold, including materials and commodities. Turning to the segments. Ford Blue to deliver full year EBIT of about $7 billion cost improvements and higher industry volumes will likely be offset partially by pricing headwinds, as inventory stocks continue to normalize and industry incentives rise through the year, along with adverse exchange. Ford Model e to report an EBIT loss of around $3 billion, largely reflecting disciplined investment in new products and capacity. We also anticipate Ford Pro's EBIT to nearly double to around $6 billion compared to our 2022 results. The gain is driven by improved pricing and volume, including the benefits from the launch of our all-new Super Duty. And EBT for Ford Credit is anticipated to be around $1.3 billion. Additionally, I hope that all of you are blocking time for our next capital markets event on May 21 and 22, here on Dearborn. This will be an important couple of days as we update you on Fords strategy, take a deep dive into financial targets and KPIs for each of our customer-centered business segments and talk about our capabilities and expectations for software and services. By the time we're done, I believe you will even be better equipped to value the expected contributions of each of the segments to Ford's overall growth and return. So that wraps up our prepared remarks. We'll use the balance of the time to address what's on your minds. Thank you. Operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nAdam Jonas: Thanks, everybody. So Jim, you've compared the current environment for EVs to the year 1913, saying that no one should really be surprised that Tesla is cutting price so much. And then I think you asked the question maybe rhetorically, who's going to blink on growth? So if I put your own question to you, Jim, will Ford blink on growth?\nJim Farley: Thanks, Adam. It depends -- well, first of all, our first three EVs are all very different in terms of pricing. I think the Lightning's price is up $11,000 since we launched, and E-Transit is up a lot. So -- and of course, we're increasing production to get that scale benefit. So the most important thing we've learned three or four years ago is be careful where you compete, and we have selected where we compete extremely carefully. We want to go after segments where we have a great reputation, but there's a lot of conquest customers. And we want to innovate beyond just the powertrain, like Pro Power Onboard and as well software. We now know the three shippable software stacks: safety and security, productivity for Pro and, of course, partial autonomy. All those are really great hedges against the inevitable overcapacity in certain segments. We could see the overcapacity in the two-row electric utility segment like years ago, Adam. Literally, like before we had finished the Mach-E development. We knew this was coming. That's why we got our team together. We brought down the cost of the bill of material by $5,000. We aren't waiting for a minor change. We're not doing things like we normally do, and we continue to get the data off the vehicle to make the software better and better so the customers' vehicles get better every day. So I would say the message from me as the CEO is that, we are not going to price just to gain market share. We will always balance a healthy profit roadmap in the first generation of products, it's pretty challenging because we didn't know what we didn't know four years ago when we designed them. But now we're two years into designing the second cycle. And in Capital Markets Day, we will take you through why we believe that 8% margin is totally realistic, despite all the pricing pressure that we will absolutely get, because everyone wants to grow. So, I would say, we're quite different than maybe some of the pure EV players that are pricing just for growth. We will always balance that, because we want a profitable EV business, and we're pulling every lever we can in the first-gen products. The second gen is where we can really make hay.\nAdam Jonas: I appreciate that, Jim. And just as a quick follow-up, because what you're saying is really landing well with me. It's resonating. But I just get a little nervous with the 2 million unit capacity target that you have hanging out there for the second half of 2026, which, just in my opinion is a crazy high number. Can I get you to admit that volume targets? And I think you're saying this, and I don't want to preempt the Capital Markets Day, but can I get you to admit that volume targets as the success criteria alone, it really is the wrong thing to continue to perpetuate? Thanks, Jim.\nJim Farley: Yes, absolutely. Look, we all have to plan our business professionally, and scaling is important. Look what happened in the first quarter for Model e. We want that scaling benefit, but that is not success. In fact, I would say, the more we study this -- our trip to China was a real epiphany for our leadership team. I would say, the more -- the thing that I look for as a CEO is not necessarily just the volume growth, it's actually how fast we use the data off the vehicle to make the customers' software experience better. That, to me -- the quickness of that loop is the fitness for differentiating brand and profit in the future for this new digital product category we happen to call electric vehicles. To me, yes, volume is important, but that quickness of that loop, which we're already on a 10 million OTA. We've now gained 65% more miles traveled on BlueCruise in three months. We were only 42 million miles three months ago, we're now at 70 million, and the reason why that's growing so fast is because we continue to do OTAs to BlueCruise to make it better and better. On Ford Pro, those software subscriptions are growing fast. So, to me, of all the metrics I look for as a proof point for our success in this new digital product category we call EVs, I think that's the one, Adam, I look for the close -- the best. And we will always balance profit with scaling.\nAdam Jonas: Thanks Jim.\nOperator: The next question is from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nRod Lache: Hi everybody. I'd actually like to follow-up on Adam's question. I'm just looking at the $900 million increase in structural costs in the quarter and I know that the investments you're making are aimed at driving growth. But in the past, when the industry has experienced higher structural costs, it put a lot of pressure on everybody to hit volume targets, which ultimately wasn't good for pricing. And I know you said, Jim, that you're planning to target segments where you've got strong pricing power and you're confident in conquesting customers. But can you just talk a little bit about whether you agree with that assertion that there's going to be pressure even on Ford just given the magnitude of the structural cost increase that you're taking on? And what kind of flexibility do you have to make the targets if volume or pricing assumptions come in a bit short?\nJohn Lawler: Yes, Adam. Let me -- sorry, you're following up on Adam's question. So, let me, Rod, start off on the cost there. Yes, you're right. We did see our structural costs go up in the quarter on a year-over-year basis as we continue to invest, as Jim said, in our EVs, in our digital architecture and our software. I think for us, a key part of that is bringing those structural costs down in Blue over time and then driving efficiencies in our overall cost structure and contribution costs, some material costs, in warranty, in freight, et cetera. So, that's where we need to see the turn on our cost structure in those areas as well. And then cost structure coming out of Blue as we continue to invest in e and Pro. Now, of course, we have to do that at an efficient level so that it doesn't put that much pressure on the business, but Jim can talk about this more. But as we're investing in the growth of EVs, we're not doing it where we're proliferating. We're looking to be very focused on the segments we're going into, be very disciplined on the complexity in the number of top hats and models that we have, have the right footprint, the industrial plants needed to have the right efficiency levels. And we'll talk more about that at Capital Markets Day, but we're very, very thoughtful of the fact that as that investment goes in, it needs to be very efficient.\nRod Lache: Okay. And just maybe secondly, just switching gears to -- your variable costs like material freight and commodities were up $1.3 billion in the quarter. Are you still expecting $1 billion of savings in variable costs and $1 billion to $1.5 billion in commodities? And that's the case, you also have the super volume ramping later this year. I just would be curious about whether you can give us a little bit more color on the first half to second half assumption since your full year guidance implies some pretty meaningful decline in the year versus the level we're seeing right now?\nJohn Lawler: Yeah. So when you look at it from a cost standpoint, let's just unpack what happened last year. When you look at the cost increases in 2022, only about 15% of that happened in the first quarter. So on a year-over-year basis, coming out of last year, this was a tough read. If you look at it sequentially, when you look at our costs on a sequential basis, our costs were down in the quarter. And they were down significantly in Blue. They were up a little bit in e, and they were about flat in Pro. So, yeah, we have got to gain traction on the cost reductions for sure as we go through the second half of the year, and you'll start to see that come through in the second half. Overall, when you look at it from a cost standpoint, we expect our total cost to come down and cost of goods sold to come down about $2 billion versus the $2.5 billion, and that's primarily reflecting the fact that commodities aren't coming down as quickly as we thought. So that's where we see costs unfolding through the second half of the year.\nRod Lache: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from John Murphy with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJohn Murphy: Good afternoon guys. Just a first question on fleet, because that seems to be leading the volume recovery here early in 2023. Just curious how much of a tailwind that was for you and where that shows up in the numbers, whether it's all in Pro or do we actually see something actually showing up on the Blue and in e side? And how much do you expect that to continue to be a tailwind as you go through the course of this year and maybe even for the next year or two?\nJohn Lawler: Yeah. The league business is largely sitting in Pro, John. We see that continuing through the year. We see Pro -- strength in Pro as we go through the year. There's considerable pent-up demand. We now have the new Super Duty. We'll be launching the Transit in the second half of the year, and we expect that to continue. So that's where we see quite a bit of opportunity as we go through the year, as we expect the profits in Pro to double this year versus last year. On Blue, what we saw in the first quarter for Blue was about flat pricing. It was up 1/10, a strong mix, really strong mix and some volume increases in Blue in the first quarter. And that strong mix was on F-Series. And that's because last year, we had the TICO issue, which kept our series mix down, plus we were launching Escape this year in the first quarter. So when you look at it, that's where we see things unfolding. When we go through the rest of the year on Blue, we expect that mix to come off. That's not going to repeat itself as we run through the rest of the year.\nJim Farley: On Pro, I just want to highlight a few things, John. There was a huge backorder of vehicle, pent-up demand for small business in the US and Europe that is still not even close to being satisfied. So yes, a lot of the bigger fleets, U-Hauls, you can imagine that they are the truck and van customers, we've done a good job getting them the product they want. They still want more, a lot more. And this is before we launch a new Super Duty and, of course, a new Transit in Europe. And so there's a lot of pent-up demand for large fleets. But most of the real profitable Pro business is small and medium-sized business, and they have been waiting literally three to four years for their Transit and Super Duty\u2019s. So the pent-up demand we're seeing now is really those customers, and there's still a lot of pricing power and lots of pent-up orders for. And especially, now that we have brand-new Super Duty and Transit in Europe, it's going to be even more intense to get those products. So good -- the larger fleets, we've done a good job getting them more product, but there's a ton of pent-up demand for Pro vehicles with those small and medium-sized business, which is the heart and soul of the TAM.\nJohn Murphy: And Jim, if I could follow up just on the pricing discussion. There seems to be a change in the philosophy of the way that people are thinking about this, particularly that new, large competitor that is cutting price. And that you can cut price on the front end and not make a lot of money on the hardware, but you can make a whole lot of money on the software and services on the back end so you're not so worried about profit on the front end. You think you can make it up on the back end. As you think about your business evolving over time, do you think in five years' time plus that you're going to be sort of selling the vehicles hardware and making all the money on the back end? I mean how should we think about sort of the balance of how the money is earned on vehicles going forward?\nJim Farley: Will that business model, I mean outside of maybe Tesla, that business model is live and well at Ford right now in Pro. So when I answer your question, please understand that we are operating that kind of business, where our after sales and software is now large 30-plus percent attach rates. And I would say the answer is I am not giving any relief to my vehicle teams for software sales or any kind of margin advantage. They -- those products have to get to 8% on their own. And we see the software and especially for Pro, the physical after sales. Those attach rates charging equipment that we're seeing 30-plus percent tax rates, that's plus business for us. That's an annuity we want to create, and we do not want to commoditize our products. That is not our strategy. Maybe someone else's, but not ours. And that's coming from a company that is already doing like we could do that now with Pro, but we are not going to do that. I hope that's clear.\nJohn Murphy: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRyan Brinkman: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I read, Jim that you recently said at a charity event in Detroit, we're going to have to rethink what the Ford brand means in a place like China. So where do you think you stand with regard to your China operations currently? I mean Lincoln seems like a bright spot. But what aspirations do you have for your operations in that market, either in terms of the portfolio or margins or returns? And what time frame would you like to achieve those aspirations?\nJim Farley: Well, thank you. And I guess that's the end of my charity work. But we -- Pro and Blue are profitable everywhere in the world, including China. But I'm glad you asked this question, because we went to China to finalize our strategy as a leadership team. And I guess I would explain -- so our ICE business there is profitable. Lincoln is a success. But you have to look at China through the strategy lens, it's not a huge business for us. And we believe that not only is the biggest EV market in the world, but customers digitally are ahead of the rest of the world, and so it's a really important market for us. And what we really see in our presence there is battery tech, digital experience for the customer and advanced product, both software and hardware integrated. Our strategy going forward in China will change. We're going to go to a much lower investment, leaner, more focused business in China with higher returns. And I'll give you an example. I don't want to lay out the whole strategy here. But since you asked the question, I think our partnership with JMC is a good example. We are going to double down on our commercial business, including EVs in China. We also believe that JMC can be an export hub for affordable EVs and ICE commercial vehicles using the Ford distribution network for our Pro business around the world. We have great Pro dealers in South America, in south Africa, in Australia, Mexico, places that we can export. And now we have a source of a fantastic affordable EVs and commercial ICE products with JMC. That's an example of how we're going to approach China from now on. We're not going to try to serve everyone. It will be a lower investment, leaner, much more focused business in China. And we're going to have a team on the ground that will be global resources for the company, because of how important the market is in the EV.\nRyan Brinkman: Okay, great. Thanks. And then just lastly, what is the latest you're seeing in terms of auto loan APR, credit availability, maybe in light of some of the turmoil that we've seen in the banking sector in the US? The SAAR has been very strong this year, in line or stronger than your expectation for $15 million total SAAR, particularly in light of the higher rates, maybe helped by the strong equity in used vehicles. But just curious, if you're hearing anything maybe different at the margin from your dealers or customers or just how you're thinking about the auto finance market generally.\nMarion Harris: Yeah. Hey, Ryan, it's Marion. We have seen a number of banks pulling back from auto lending, which is kind of a hallmark of banks through difficult markets, and that's created a bit of a pricing opportunity for us, as well as improvement in share -- financing share for us. So I don't see it getting a lot better over the coming months for banks. But the credit availability is still there for customers and captives across the industry, are going to continue to support the OEMs.\nRyan Brinkman: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from James Picariello with BNP Paribas. Please, go ahead.\nJames Picariello: Hi, everyone. First question on price. So, is pricing overall is still expected to be neutral for the year? It sounds as though Blue is guided to be negative for the full year as incentive spend picks up. But, yes, could you just help unpack how we should be thinking about this year's price for Model e and Pro with the Super Duty strength still to come?\nJohn Lawler: Yes. So, overall, for us, our bridge from 2022 to 2023, we expect pricing for us to be neutral. We still expect that to be the case. We do expect the second half to see pricing pressures, especially on Blue as we see supply and demand normalize. Pro, we believe there will be pricing strength throughout the year. And on e, we see pricing being slightly down on a year-over-year basis as well. So, overall, no change to what we had talked about at the teaching. We see pricing is neutral for Ford.\nJames Picariello: Okay, got it. And then just to confirm, you talked about 20% -- or minus 20% Model e margins for the second half. Is that right?\nJohn Lawler: Contribution margin, yes.\nJames Picariello: Contribution margin. Okay. All right. Thank you. Appreciate it.\nJohn Lawler: Sorry. About -- no, no, no. Total margin, contribution margin positive, total margin would be -- EBIT margin would be minus 20%.\nJames Picariello: Got it. Yes. So, my follow-on to that because that's what I thought you'd sit. Can you bridge what the benefits are from a materials perspective, scaling in terms of the buckets maybe that you provided at the teach-in, what helps get to that minus 20% run rate for the second half? Thanks.\nJohn Lawler: It's not different than what's in the teach-in. I mean when you look at it, we're going to scale through the year. We start to grow volumes. We have the LFP battery coming in, and then we have the design reductions that Jim talked about, getting to about a $5,000 reduction on Mach-E. We have a significant reduction in play on Lightning as well. So, it's the same buckets that we talked about at the teach-in.\nJames Picariello: Thanks.\nOperator: The next question is from Dan Levy with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nDan Levy: Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking the questions. I just want to follow-up on that last question on the contribution margin. And I know you didn't disclose contribution margin at the teach-in. But just at the midpoint of if I look at what you disclosed in your deck, it's roughly negative $4,000 contribution margin right now, and you said a lot of this is on sort of material reduction. So, I just wanted to understand how easily you can reduce content mid-cycle of a product. I know you said that there are some design changes that you can do. But typically, you see more material content modifications at the end of a product cycle. So, just want to get a sense of your visibility on content modification to get that contribution margin to breakeven?\nJohn Lawler: So, there's a couple of things you can do from a content standpoint to drive your cost down. One of them is we're using the digital connectivity of the vehicle to understand what features that customers find valuable. And if they're not using something that we have on the vehicle, we can design that out. The other thing we're doing is, as Jim said, we didn't wait on Mach-E. So, we started to put together what we thought of as bundled actions into minor programs as we work through Model e, and we're launching those as we go through the year this year and into next year to get us to that $5,000 reduction. As a first mover, we felt it was important to get to market quickly. We've readily admitted that the design and efficiency of our first-generation products isn't where it needs to be, and we're working on that -- those reductions now. And we're taking all the learnings from that and incorporating it into our second-generation products and we'll talk more about that in a couple of weeks at Capital Markets Day. So, yes, there's things you can do. You just need to be thoughtful about it as you go through the product. And where there's opportunities, you bundle them together, and you do a minor launch, you do a change and you go. And that's what we're doing on e, and we're using the connected data to take out features that the customers don't value.\nDan Levy: Great. Thank you. And then as my follow-up, I just want to touch on some of the earlier questions that were asked and this notion of how you're looking at volume. And I think the message clearly you're making is that you're not necessarily -- you're balancing that volume with profit. But historically, this has been a business that is dictated by volume. This is dictated by utilization. And if I read your comments correctly that you're focused on unique segments and you want to get out of the fray a little bit, that would probably tell me that if you're punching at four million units a year now, which is low versus actually where you've been historically, that if you're focused on these more premium segments or more unique segments that there could be a much lower volume going forward. So how should we think about your volume more broadly? I realize that's probably a better question for the CMD. But how are you thinking about structurally what type of volume we should look at in the future?\nJim Farley: Yeah, good question. So I want to make it really clear that our growth strategy for the company is very aggressive, and it focuses on conquest customers. So we plan to grow, and that capacity increase for e and Pro is mostly additive to the company's overall growth. And what gives us confidence in that is that we are targeting conquest vehicles and software to customer categories that we know really well. It's not lost on us that when we launched Lightning, almost all the full-size pickup truck EV customers were new to Ford and new to the segment. So what we learned in Lightning's case, a segment traditionally has been 13% of the industry for pretty much my whole career can be much, much bigger when you add new product features like a funk, lockable storage for a full-size truck, zero emissions and the ability to power your house for three days. A lot of new customers bought a Lightning that never owned a pickup truck before. And we intend to do that with three-row crossover and with a bunch of EV Pro vehicles, which we think will be a huge growth for us. So you should expect that a lot of that capacity we're putting in is for growth for the company, but we are not going to grow at any cost. We're going to manage that incremental new growth for profitability and growth together, and we've put a lot of thinking into our product strategy. One of the most important aspects of our product strategy is not to have too much top hat engineering. We want to have a lot of scale per top hat. And again, we'll go into the capital markets day, as you said, because I think it's best answer there with real examples where you can really see our strategy coming to life. But we've learned a lot for Lightning and for Mach-E. Frankly, the number of new customers we're seeing is very encouraging for us because of our capacity increase. And we know that the second cycle product can be radically simpler and lower cost, aside from the scaling effect. And again, we'll lay this out in capital markets day for you and for everyone else.\nDan Levy: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Tom Narayan with RBC. Please go ahead.\nTom Narayan: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just had two quick follow-ups. So for Blue, it sounds like the downshift kind of implied in the rest of the year is really coming more from mix than not price as you're saying net neutral on price for the full year. Is that right?\nJohn Lawler: Yes. So mix -- we had very strong mix in Q1. We don't expect that to repeat as we go through the year, and we do expect on a full year basis that we will see some pressures on pricing in Blue on a full year basis as we go through the second half of the year. Remember, what's really important is to understand that run rate of price as you come out of the back end of the year because you have the accrual impact for all of the units that are in stock and then you have to take the incentive levels from Q1 of 2024 and apply it to those units that are in stock. So you've got to think about that on a run rate business coming out of the end of the year. But overall, yes, it's -- for Blue, we definitely see that there'll be some pressure on pricing.\nTom Narayan: Okay. And then another follow-up. So on this question of attach rates, you have a 30% attach rate on Pro, which is amazing. And just curious, as you think about that, is there an incentive perhaps to increase that attach rate perhaps by sacrificing on price? Presumably, those subscription revenues come in at higher margins, or is the view we're not going to -- at the end of the day, we make these products and these subscription services are add-on to enhance the product. I mean how do you think about that trade-off? Thanks.\nJim Farley: It's a great question. Right now, given the order bank we see for Pro's business, the more we can invest in profitable high-growth products, the better. But you should think it's a very important question you're asking for Pro, because I don't think everyone would realize that the margins on software and the margins on parts are actually pretty similar. So in the end of the day, the customer wants us to have fantastic products for Pro, but they're largely regulated, kind of box or pickup truck pet or whatever. So really for the customer, the value is going to be the software, the attached rates and the experience they get with an integrated approach. Think about this future state, which we are executing too. 100% prediction of failure of components before they sale, okay. You sense vehicle to do that? It\u2019s integrated and software, the software gets better everyday, so you can predict failure more precisely and for more components. The customer gets a vehicle that never really goes out of service. If you're a small, medium size commercial Pro customer, which is most of the TAM in Europe and the US, those customers, they take one van down, that\u2019s 20% of the revenue. So they will pay because they can drive more business with the vehicle that\u2019s never off the road. So think about this not as a trade-off between the vehicle profit, the parts business and the software. Think about it from the customer standpoint as an integrated approach, where everything is designed for each other, where you can't think of doing prognostics without a vehicle design to do that or the fulfillment of the parts business pre-picking the part before the customer even gets there, so that they could do the service really quickly, so the vehicle is not off the road for very long, if it does need service. So it's -- I don't really think we think of it from the customer standpoint as a like trade from margin. We think of designing the whole system, so that every piece of it adds value, and you can't kind of think of the physical product or the software independently of each other. Now, it may turn out over time, let's say, on the low part of Pro. That's a software in the parts business is more profitable. But from the customer standpoint, we're designing the pro business where they're inseparable, like the prognostic example. I hope that makes sense to you.\nTom Narayan: Yes, it does. Thank you.\nOperator: And the last question today is from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Please, go ahead.\nEmmanuel Rosner: Hi. Thank you very much. So I think you announced a price cut on the Mach-E today. And to your point, Jim, I think this is a more competitive segment within all the various EV segments.\nJim Farley: Yes, yes.\nEmmanuel Rosner: Can you maybe comment on the demand environment for Lightning? There's -- I've seen some anecdotal evidence of some decent amount sitting on some dealers' lots. I read that you're planning to ship some to Norway, which it feels like the US pickup market should have more demand than your ability to supply. So can you just maybe talk a little bit about where Lightning demand is in general and whether sort of like cost actions are needed in order to bring down the price?\nJim Farley: But there's only one or two in the market, so I can understand why maybe some people would look at it that way if they don't have a product in the market. But from our standpoint, the Lightning demand is outstanding. We've taken $11,000 worth of pricing on Lightning, $11,000. And, yes, thank goodness that we are seeing now some dealer stock for the first time in like two years for Lightning. And we are really excited about our cost reductions and, of course, the software we're shipping at the vehicle like BlueCruise 1.2. But the demand for Lightning is really, really strong. I look at Bring a Trailer every week, because two years ago, it was like, I don't know, the most popular new vehicle on Bring a Trailer was a Lightning with four miles on it, that someone was flipping. And the prices have come down and they're basically at MSRP now. So we're selling it at full MSRP. The demand is higher. In fact, I would say that the pricing is higher than MSRP still. And we're totally sold out in Norway, like we are everywhere. So this is a global segment, we believe. Ford is clearly the number one pickup truck maker in the world, and we're not going to just keep our pickup trucks in the US. It's a global market. So we feel great about the demand or else we wouldn't be doubling production this year.\nEmmanuel Rosner: Yes. Thanks for that Jim. And then, just maybe one follow-up for John. So curious if you could just put a final point on the puts and takes for your unchanged 2023 guidance. I think you mentioned in terms of costs for materials and freight maybe now a $2 billion benefit instead of $2.5 billion. Are there any other big pieces which are either more or less of a benefit or a headwind than you saw previously?\nJohn Lawler: Yes, sure. So, we had shared what we thought the bridge was earlier this year. And so as I said, we think pricing overall for us will be about neutral for the year. We said that our COGS are primarily material and logistics. We had said that it would be about $2.5 billion. We think it's about $2 billion now. That's primarily due to commodities not coming down as quickly as we had thought. Volumes, we were up 9% in Q1. We expect to be about -- up about 6%-ish for the full year overall. So, I think you can look at that, and those are the three areas that have basically changed versus what we had bridged before. We see past service pension at about a $2 billion negative. Credit, we don't change there, we're about that $1.4 million, and we're going to continue to invest in growth and then we stock exchange and other of about $1 billion. So, that bridge largely remains the same, except we got a little bit of movement between some volume and some commodity costs.\nEmmanuel Rosner: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes the Ford Motor Company first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jim Farley",
            "content": "Thank you, Lynn. And hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. I'd bottom line the first quarter like this. Our team delivered a solid quarter while making real progress on our Ford+ growth plan. And I hope that becomes a trend at Ford, boringly predictable when it comes to execution and delivering financials, but extremely ambitious and dynamic in creating the Ford of the future. For the quarter, we saw growth across all of our key metrics. In addition, Ford Pro and Blue were profitable in every region where we operate. Our balance sheet is strong. We ended the quarter with close to $29 billion in cash, even as we invest in growth and return capital to our shareholders. With each quarter that passes, I'm more confident and convinced and thankful we made the decision to create three separate customer-focused businesses. This has unleased clarity, speed and accountability across the company, not to mention a whole new level of discipline on capital allocation. So let me cover a few highlights. I'd like to start with Ford Pro. I know many of you were surprised at the true size of the Pro business in March when we recast our financials. Pro starts with marketing leadership in our vehicles across the world, tremendous scale and customer knowledge. And we're layering on top of that the future of our industry, an ecosystem of software and services and EV charging that we believe will be invaluable to our commercial customers. And this will unlock tremendous loyalty and profitable growth. Our strong order books in North America and Europe as well as all the demand signals we can see for Pro support our target to nearly double Pro's EBIT this year. In March, we launched the all-new Super Duty in Kentucky and Ohio. It has received tremendous reception, and it's going to strengthen a franchise that is already the market leader. Importantly, Super Duty is a platform for software and services that help our customers maximize their uptime, accelerate their productivity and lower total cost of ownership. I would also say the Super Duty launch is a good case study for the disciplined approach we're implementing across our industrial system. Simply put, we slowed the launch down, significantly increased on road and in plant quality testing, we dispatched a large and skilled launch team to our plant. We added test vehicles. We drove millions of miles to prove our durability, and we deployed new technology and artificial intelligence to catch issues. Basically, we put all the pressure in the system to find and then prevent future quality issues rather than speeding up the line to match our launch curve. Short-term patience, we believe that will result in long-term gain for our customers and yes, the company. In the quarter, Ford Pro extended its leadership in true commercial vehicle categories. Our share of the Class 1 through 7 truck and vans in the US increased by one full share point to 41% share. In Europe, we've already been the top commercial brand for eight years now running, and our share grew to more than 15%. We also maintained our EV strength in North America and Europe. In the US, E-Transit has already a 50% market share. In the quarter, we won a contract to deliver more than 9,000 E-Transit vans to the US Postal Service. Ford Pro's paid software subscriptions rose 64% in the quarter including higher revenue per unit software sales, like our telematics and charging software. With these and all the other initiatives, Ford Pro is developing into a resilient business, certainly less cyclical than the broader automotive sector. In Ford Blue, the team is focused on capitalizing on our red-hot product lineup. Our opportunity to smartly grow extends to valuable franchises with great pricing power, like the F-150, the new Maverick, the new Bronco and, of course, the Mustang. We'll grow our leadership position in pickups, in off-road, in performance and in SUVs with all new derivatives. For example, we just introduced the Bronco less than three years ago. And already, it's neck and neck in sales with the Jeep Wrangler, and it has higher transaction prices. We've also recently expanded the Bronco lineup with exciting derivatives, like the Bronco Everglades, the Bronco Raptor and the Bronco Heritage. Derivatives not only continued to contribute to our growth, but importantly, they can also drive higher transaction prices and higher returns. See, these derivatives often have 80% part commonality with the base models, but their contribution margin percents can be 30% higher with a two-fold increase in capital efficiency. We also have one of the strongest product years coming for Ford Blue. So it's just beginning. We have the new Escape, including New Hybrid. It's just arriving in dealerships now. Next week, we will reveal the all-new Ranger in the highly anticipated Ranger Raptor. That will be followed by an all-new Mustang and high-performance Dark Horse Mustang this summer. While I can't get into the details yet, we have more exciting news to share about two of America's best-selling vehicles, the F-150 and the Explorer later this year. And on top of all that, we have the Lincoln Corsair arriving at dealerships now. And of course, we just revealed the Lincoln Nautilus. Now, Ford Model e operates with a start-up intensity to build a profitable EV business with a differentiated portfolio and a differentiated customer experience. US investors now have true visibility into how Ford Model e's profitability strengthens over time, supported by volume-driven operating leverage, improvements in design and efficiency and, of course, lower battery costs. We're on track this year towards a contribution margin approaching breakeven in Model e and for our first-generation products to be EBIT margin positive by the end of next year. Wholesales were down in the quarter, which deleveraged our cost structure. Part of the decline was planned, as we have brought Mustang Mach-E production down for several weeks, so we could almost double the capacity, and we are now hitting that 35 jump per hour run rate in the plant. Volumes were also impacted by the lower output of F-150 Lightning. We did the right thing, and I congratulate my team many times by immediately stopping production and working with our battery supplier finding and then fixing the root cause of the fire that happened on the Ford property. We're now shipping Lightnings, again, taking new orders and increasing production to an annual run rate of 150,000 units, about double what we do now. We are also revealing -- we revealed an all-electric Explorer in Europe, which is now very well received. We made progress on Model e in the quarter, advancing our industrial system to scale EVs. The site preparation is already underway for our LFP battery plant in Michigan. And construction continues at the BlueOval SK Battery Park in Kentucky and, of course, BlueOval City in Tennessee. We now plan to transform our Oakville Assembly Complex into a Canadian hub of electric vehicle and battery pack manufacturing. We also continue to make progress towards locking in all the raw materials that we need to support our capacity targets in \u201826 and beyond. Model e is our center of excellence for technology, including software. A good example of that is BlueCruise, which continues to be hit with our customers. Consumer Reports rated it the top advanced, hands-free driver assist system on the market in the US, and that was just version 1.0. Our latest release, which we're OTA-ing into customers, is version 1.2. It automatically changes lanes with the tap of a turn signal, and it delivers a much more natural driving experience hands-free. We also launched BlueCruise in the UK, our Mustang Mach-E, and became the first OEM to gain approval for hands-free highway driving speed anywhere in Europe with more than -- and now BlueCruise has more than 70 million miles driven to date, and we continue to upgrade BlueCruise for customers with each over-the-air update. Before I turn it over to John, I want to share our thoughts on how the EV market is evolving in our eyes. It's easy to look at the landscape of the EV market as a mono lift. But we plan to be surgical about where we play and how we win with the right products, the right cost structure, and the right price points. We do not subscribe to a win vehicle share at any cost approach. We look at share of vehicles, of course, and share revenue. We also look at share profits and share of the customer lifetime value, and we believe this is the only way to ensure we drive appropriate return on capital over time. By 2025, we now expect there to be 45 EV models to be offered in the US in the small, medium utility segment. It will be a very saturated two-row EV market. Against this backdrop to ensure profitable growth, we know we have to have a fresh, compelling offering with the right cost structure, something we continue to improve with the Mustang Mach-E. We also found that customers are very loyal to full EV powertrains once they enter, but they are not brand-loyal for their first purchase. We capitalize on that by getting to the market early with the Mustang Mach-E and our whole lineup, and it continues to reward us with over 60% of the customers new to Ford. We're seeing that the second EV purchase is much more loyal to the brand in these developed EV markets. So. we're glad that we have all these customers in our digital and physical ecosystem. We are aggressively lowering our product costs for our current and next-generation products. You'll find out a lot more in Capital Markets Day. But in fact, for Mustang Mach-E from launch through the end of this year, we'll have reduced the building materials from Mustang Mach-E by $5,000 per vehicle. Now, in contrast to two-world crossovers that we believe will be a very saturated market, we believe Model e can be highly differentiated in markets where we know the customer well, like the three-row utility space. And as I said, we'll share more about at our Capital Markets event later this month on our product strategy. I had a chance along with John and most of our leadership team, to go to China in the last few weeks and look at the EV market in a gemba, go-and-see activity up close. It's interesting to see how customers are no longer just attracted to traditional luxury brands with EVs or even hardware design anymore. Outstanding hardware styling, performance, quality are just a given in the EV digital marketplace today. The best new brands are offering integrated digital, retail, lifestyle and experience that are software defined. This is firmly in our sights for our second-generation EVs. This software as a differentiator, plus a radically different cost structure, and the ability to attract -- attach value-added software and services, gives us confidence we can compete and win in unit, revenue, profit and vehicle share while delivering appropriate returns. And Ford Pro is already there. I'll wrap up by saying we are pleased, but we are not satisfied. As I said, solid execution and some really thrilling progress advancing our Ford+ plan. I look forward to seeing many of you in-person in three weeks for our capital markets event, where we will go much deeper into our strategy and our progress. John? Thanks, Adam. It depends -- well, first of all, our first three EVs are all very different in terms of pricing. I think the Lightning's price is up $11,000 since we launched, and E-Transit is up a lot. So -- and of course, we're increasing production to get that scale benefit. So the most important thing we've learned three or four years ago is be careful where you compete, and we have selected where we compete extremely carefully. We want to go after segments where we have a great reputation, but there's a lot of conquest customers. And we want to innovate beyond just the powertrain, like Pro Power Onboard and as well software. We now know the three shippable software stacks: safety and security, productivity for Pro and, of course, partial autonomy. All those are really great hedges against the inevitable overcapacity in certain segments. We could see the overcapacity in the two-row electric utility segment like years ago, Adam. Literally, like before we had finished the Mach-E development. We knew this was coming. That's why we got our team together. We brought down the cost of the bill of material by $5,000. We aren't waiting for a minor change. We're not doing things like we normally do, and we continue to get the data off the vehicle to make the software better and better so the customers' vehicles get better every day. So I would say the message from me as the CEO is that, we are not going to price just to gain market share. We will always balance a healthy profit roadmap in the first generation of products, it's pretty challenging because we didn't know what we didn't know four years ago when we designed them. But now we're two years into designing the second cycle. And in Capital Markets Day, we will take you through why we believe that 8% margin is totally realistic, despite all the pricing pressure that we will absolutely get, because everyone wants to grow. So, I would say, we're quite different than maybe some of the pure EV players that are pricing just for growth. We will always balance that, because we want a profitable EV business, and we're pulling every lever we can in the first-gen products. The second gen is where we can really make hay. Yes, absolutely. Look, we all have to plan our business professionally, and scaling is important. Look what happened in the first quarter for Model e. We want that scaling benefit, but that is not success. In fact, I would say, the more we study this -- our trip to China was a real epiphany for our leadership team. I would say, the more -- the thing that I look for as a CEO is not necessarily just the volume growth, it's actually how fast we use the data off the vehicle to make the customers' software experience better. That, to me -- the quickness of that loop is the fitness for differentiating brand and profit in the future for this new digital product category we happen to call electric vehicles. To me, yes, volume is important, but that quickness of that loop, which we're already on a 10 million OTA. We've now gained 65% more miles traveled on BlueCruise in three months. We were only 42 million miles three months ago, we're now at 70 million, and the reason why that's growing so fast is because we continue to do OTAs to BlueCruise to make it better and better. On Ford Pro, those software subscriptions are growing fast. So, to me, of all the metrics I look for as a proof point for our success in this new digital product category we call EVs, I think that's the one, Adam, I look for the close -- the best. And we will always balance profit with scaling. On Pro, I just want to highlight a few things, John. There was a huge backorder of vehicle, pent-up demand for small business in the US and Europe that is still not even close to being satisfied. So yes, a lot of the bigger fleets, U-Hauls, you can imagine that they are the truck and van customers, we've done a good job getting them the product they want. They still want more, a lot more. And this is before we launch a new Super Duty and, of course, a new Transit in Europe. And so there's a lot of pent-up demand for large fleets. But most of the real profitable Pro business is small and medium-sized business, and they have been waiting literally three to four years for their Transit and Super Duty's. So the pent-up demand we're seeing now is really those customers, and there's still a lot of pricing power and lots of pent-up orders for. And especially, now that we have brand-new Super Duty and Transit in Europe, it's going to be even more intense to get those products. So good -- the larger fleets, we've done a good job getting them more product, but there's a ton of pent-up demand for Pro vehicles with those small and medium-sized business, which is the heart and soul of the TAM. Will that business model, I mean outside of maybe Tesla, that business model is live and well at Ford right now in Pro. So when I answer your question, please understand that we are operating that kind of business, where our after sales and software is now large 30-plus percent attach rates. And I would say the answer is I am not giving any relief to my vehicle teams for software sales or any kind of margin advantage. They -- those products have to get to 8% on their own. And we see the software and especially for Pro, the physical after sales. Those attach rates charging equipment that we're seeing 30-plus percent tax rates, that's plus business for us. That's an annuity we want to create, and we do not want to commoditize our products. That is not our strategy. Maybe someone else's, but not ours. And that's coming from a company that is already doing like we could do that now with Pro, but we are not going to do that. I hope that's clear. Well, thank you. And I guess that's the end of my charity work. But we -- Pro and Blue are profitable everywhere in the world, including China. But I'm glad you asked this question, because we went to China to finalize our strategy as a leadership team. And I guess I would explain -- so our ICE business there is profitable. Lincoln is a success. But you have to look at China through the strategy lens, it's not a huge business for us. And we believe that not only is the biggest EV market in the world, but customers digitally are ahead of the rest of the world, and so it's a really important market for us. And what we really see in our presence there is battery tech, digital experience for the customer and advanced product, both software and hardware integrated. Our strategy going forward in China will change. We're going to go to a much lower investment, leaner, more focused business in China with higher returns. And I'll give you an example. I don't want to lay out the whole strategy here. But since you asked the question, I think our partnership with JMC is a good example. We are going to double down on our commercial business, including EVs in China. We also believe that JMC can be an export hub for affordable EVs and ICE commercial vehicles using the Ford distribution network for our Pro business around the world. We have great Pro dealers in South America, in south Africa, in Australia, Mexico, places that we can export. And now we have a source of a fantastic affordable EVs and commercial ICE products with JMC. That's an example of how we're going to approach China from now on. We're not going to try to serve everyone. It will be a lower investment, leaner, much more focused business in China. And we're going to have a team on the ground that will be global resources for the company, because of how important the market is in the EV. Yeah, good question. So I want to make it really clear that our growth strategy for the company is very aggressive, and it focuses on conquest customers. So we plan to grow, and that capacity increase for e and Pro is mostly additive to the company's overall growth. And what gives us confidence in that is that we are targeting conquest vehicles and software to customer categories that we know really well. It's not lost on us that when we launched Lightning, almost all the full-size pickup truck EV customers were new to Ford and new to the segment. So what we learned in Lightning's case, a segment traditionally has been 13% of the industry for pretty much my whole career can be much, much bigger when you add new product features like a funk, lockable storage for a full-size truck, zero emissions and the ability to power your house for three days. A lot of new customers bought a Lightning that never owned a pickup truck before. And we intend to do that with three-row crossover and with a bunch of EV Pro vehicles, which we think will be a huge growth for us. So you should expect that a lot of that capacity we're putting in is for growth for the company, but we are not going to grow at any cost. We're going to manage that incremental new growth for profitability and growth together, and we've put a lot of thinking into our product strategy. One of the most important aspects of our product strategy is not to have too much top hat engineering. We want to have a lot of scale per top hat. And again, we'll go into the capital markets day, as you said, because I think it's best answer there with real examples where you can really see our strategy coming to life. But we've learned a lot for Lightning and for Mach-E. Frankly, the number of new customers we're seeing is very encouraging for us because of our capacity increase. And we know that the second cycle product can be radically simpler and lower cost, aside from the scaling effect. And again, we'll lay this out in capital markets day for you and for everyone else. It's a great question. Right now, given the order bank we see for Pro's business, the more we can invest in profitable high-growth products, the better. But you should think it's a very important question you're asking for Pro, because I don't think everyone would realize that the margins on software and the margins on parts are actually pretty similar. So in the end of the day, the customer wants us to have fantastic products for Pro, but they're largely regulated, kind of box or pickup truck pet or whatever. So really for the customer, the value is going to be the software, the attached rates and the experience they get with an integrated approach. Think about this future state, which we are executing too. 100% prediction of failure of components before they sale, okay. You sense vehicle to do that? It's integrated and software, the software gets better everyday, so you can predict failure more precisely and for more components. The customer gets a vehicle that never really goes out of service. If you're a small, medium size commercial Pro customer, which is most of the TAM in Europe and the US, those customers, they take one van down, that's 20% of the revenue. So they will pay because they can drive more business with the vehicle that's never off the road. So think about this not as a trade-off between the vehicle profit, the parts business and the software. Think about it from the customer standpoint as an integrated approach, where everything is designed for each other, where you can't think of doing prognostics without a vehicle design to do that or the fulfillment of the parts business pre-picking the part before the customer even gets there, so that they could do the service really quickly, so the vehicle is not off the road for very long, if it does need service. So it's -- I don't really think we think of it from the customer standpoint as a like trade from margin. We think of designing the whole system, so that every piece of it adds value, and you can't kind of think of the physical product or the software independently of each other. Now, it may turn out over time, let's say, on the low part of Pro. That's a software in the parts business is more profitable. But from the customer standpoint, we're designing the pro business where they're inseparable, like the prognostic example. I hope that makes sense to you. Yes, yes. But there's only one or two in the market, so I can understand why maybe some people would look at it that way if they don't have a product in the market. But from our standpoint, the Lightning demand is outstanding. We've taken $11,000 worth of pricing on Lightning, $11,000. And, yes, thank goodness that we are seeing now some dealer stock for the first time in like two years for Lightning. And we are really excited about our cost reductions and, of course, the software we're shipping at the vehicle like BlueCruise 1.2. But the demand for Lightning is really, really strong. I look at Bring a Trailer every week, because two years ago, it was like, I don't know, the most popular new vehicle on Bring a Trailer was a Lightning with four miles on it, that someone was flipping. And the prices have come down and they're basically at MSRP now. So we're selling it at full MSRP. The demand is higher. In fact, I would say that the pricing is higher than MSRP still. And we're totally sold out in Norway, like we are everywhere. So this is a global segment, we believe. Ford is clearly the number one pickup truck maker in the world, and we're not going to just keep our pickup trucks in the US. It's a global market. So we feel great about the demand or else we wouldn't be doubling production this year."

We have seen a number of banks pulling back from auto lending, which is kind of a hallmark of banks through difficult markets, and that's created a bit of a pricing opportunity for us, as well as improvement in share -- financing share for us. So I don't see it getting a lot better over the coming months for banks. But the credit availability is still there for customers and captives across the industry, are going to continue to support the OEMs."

            "content": "Thanks, Jim. First quarter, wholesales were up 9% year-over-year as we delivered $3.4 billion in adjusted EBIT. Margin was 8.1%, up 140 basis points. Ford Blue and Ford Pro profit improved, reflecting favorable mix and higher net pricing. And as expected, those benefits were partially offset with a loss in Model e as we invest in our clean sheet next-generation EVs and scale our leading portfolio of first-generation electric vehicles. For the quarter, we delivered $700 million of adjusted free cash flow, improving consistent free cash flow from our industrial footprint, combined with disciplined capital allocation, provides us with significant flexibility to fund our growth while also consistently returning capital to our shareholders. Our balance sheet remains strong. We ended the quarter with close to $29 billion of cash and over $46 billion of liquidity. In addition, despite the recent market volatility, we successfully completed the renewal of our $17 billion sustainability-linked corporate credit facilities. So turning to our customer focused business segments. With wholesales up 6%, Ford Blue delivered $2.6 billion in EBIT and a 10.4% margin. That was 400 basis points higher than a year ago supported by favorable mix and higher volume. Our fresh and exciting product lineup continues to drive strong demand. Wholesales for Model e declined in the quarter, reflecting planned downtime that allowed us to almost double our production capacity for Mustang Mach-E. Now the profitability of any EV start-up, including Ford Model e is highly levered to volume. Importantly, holding volume constant, our first quarter EBIT margin would have been roughly flat compared to the fourth quarter at around negative 40%. We expect Ford Model e EBIT margin to improve to around negative 20% in the second half of this year, reflecting stronger per unit contribution margin and significantly higher volumes. In fact, we expect Model e contribution margin to approach breakeven this year, and we continue to target positive EBIT margin for our first-generation vehicles by the end of 2024. Ford Pro delivered an 18% increase in wholesales. And EBIT improved $900 million to $1.4 billion for the quarter, delivering a margin of 10. 3%. The improvement in profitability was supported by higher net pricing, increased volume and favorable mix. Importantly, this was achieved during a quarter when wholesales for Super Duty were down, both year-over-year and sequentially as we ramped up production of our all-new version of this highly popular truck. Ford Credit delivered EBT of $300 million, down $600 million from a year ago, reflecting lower financing margin, higher credit losses and lower lease income, all of which has been reflected in our full year outlook. Credit loss performance remains strong and is still below the historical average but beginning to normalize. Auction values remain robust, but down from their peak in the first half of 2022. Ford Credit liquidity remained strong at $26 billion, up $5 billion from year-end. In addition, despite the volatile market conditions, the company has already completed $12 billion of public issuance or roughly 50% of its 2023 funding plan. Turning to our outlook. We continue to expect full year 2023 total company adjusted EBIT of $9 billion to $11 billion, adjusted free cash flow of about $6 billion and capital expenditures between $8 billion to $9 billion. This guidance includes headwinds that reflect global economic uncertainty, higher industry-wide customer incentives as vehicle supply and demand rebalance, lower past service pension income, exchange and investments in growth such as customer service and connected services. And tailwinds driven by improvement in the supply chain, our higher industry volume with SAARs of about $15 million and $13 million in the US and Europe, respectively, launch of our all-new Super Duty and lower cost of goods sold, including materials and commodities. Turning to the segments. Ford Blue to deliver full year EBIT of about $7 billion cost improvements and higher industry volumes will likely be offset partially by pricing headwinds, as inventory stocks continue to normalize and industry incentives rise through the year, along with adverse exchange. Ford Model e to report an EBIT loss of around $3 billion, largely reflecting disciplined investment in new products and capacity. We also anticipate Ford Pro's EBIT to nearly double to around $6 billion compared to our 2022 results. The gain is driven by improved pricing and volume, including the benefits from the launch of our all-new Super Duty. And EBT for Ford Credit is anticipated to be around $1.3 billion. Additionally, I hope that all of you are blocking time for our next capital markets event on May 21 and 22, here on Dearborn. This will be an important couple of days as we update you on Fords strategy, take a deep dive into financial targets and KPIs for each of our customer-centered business segments and talk about our capabilities and expectations for software and services. By the time we're done, I believe you will even be better equipped to value the expected contributions of each of the segments to Ford's overall growth and return. So that wraps up our prepared remarks. We'll use the balance of the time to address what's on your minds. Thank you. Operator, please open the line for questions. Yes, Adam. Let me -- sorry, you're following up on Adam's question. So, let me, Rod, start off on the cost there. Yes, you're right. We did see our structural costs go up in the quarter on a year-over-year basis as we continue to invest, as Jim said, in our EVs, in our digital architecture and our software. I think for us, a key part of that is bringing those structural costs down in Blue over time and then driving efficiencies in our overall cost structure and contribution costs, some material costs, in warranty, in freight, et cetera. So, that's where we need to see the turn on our cost structure in those areas as well. And then cost structure coming out of Blue as we continue to invest in e and Pro. Now, of course, we have to do that at an efficient level so that it doesn't put that much pressure on the business, but Jim can talk about this more. But as we're investing in the growth of EVs, we're not doing it where we're proliferating. We're looking to be very focused on the segments we're going into, be very disciplined on the complexity in the number of top hats and models that we have, have the right footprint, the industrial plants needed to have the right efficiency levels. And we'll talk more about that at Capital Markets Day, but we're very, very thoughtful of the fact that as that investment goes in, it needs to be very efficient. Yeah. So when you look at it from a cost standpoint, let's just unpack what happened last year. When you look at the cost increases in 2022, only about 15% of that happened in the first quarter. So on a year-over-year basis, coming out of last year, this was a tough read. If you look at it sequentially, when you look at our costs on a sequential basis, our costs were down in the quarter. And they were down significantly in Blue. They were up a little bit in e, and they were about flat in Pro. So, yeah, we have got to gain traction on the cost reductions for sure as we go through the second half of the year, and you'll start to see that come through in the second half. Overall, when you look at it from a cost standpoint, we expect our total cost to come down and cost of goods sold to come down about $2 billion versus the $2.5 billion, and that's primarily reflecting the fact that commodities aren't coming down as quickly as we thought. So that's where we see costs unfolding through the second half of the year. Yeah. The league business is largely sitting in Pro, John. We see that continuing through the year. We see Pro -- strength in Pro as we go through the year. There's considerable pent-up demand. We now have the new Super Duty. We'll be launching the Transit in the second half of the year, and we expect that to continue. So that's where we see quite a bit of opportunity as we go through the year, as we expect the profits in Pro to double this year versus last year. On Blue, what we saw in the first quarter for Blue was about flat pricing. It was up 1/10, a strong mix, really strong mix and some volume increases in Blue in the first quarter. And that strong mix was on F-Series. And that's because last year, we had the TICO issue, which kept our series mix down, plus we were launching Escape this year in the first quarter. So when you look at it, that's where we see things unfolding. When we go through the rest of the year on Blue, we expect that mix to come off. That's not going to repeat itself as we run through the rest of the year. Yes. So, overall, for us, our bridge from 2022 to 2023, we expect pricing for us to be neutral. We still expect that to be the case. We do expect the second half to see pricing pressures, especially on Blue as we see supply and demand normalize. Pro, we believe there will be pricing strength throughout the year. And on e, we see pricing being slightly down on a year-over-year basis as well. So, overall, no change to what we had talked about at the teaching. We see pricing is neutral for Ford. Contribution margin, yes. Sorry. About -- no, no, no. Total margin, contribution margin positive, total margin would be -- EBIT margin would be minus 20%. It's not different than what's in the teach-in. I mean when you look at it, we're going to scale through the year. We start to grow volumes. We have the LFP battery coming in, and then we have the design reductions that Jim talked about, getting to about a $5,000 reduction on Mach-E. We have a significant reduction in play on Lightning as well. So, it's the same buckets that we talked about at the teach-in. So, there's a couple of things you can do from a content standpoint to drive your cost down. One of them is we're using the digital connectivity of the vehicle to understand what features that customers find valuable. And if they're not using something that we have on the vehicle, we can design that out. The other thing we're doing is, as Jim said, we didn't wait on Mach-E. So, we started to put together what we thought of as bundled actions into minor programs as we work through Model e, and we're launching those as we go through the year this year and into next year to get us to that $5,000 reduction. As a first mover, we felt it was important to get to market quickly. We've readily admitted that the design and efficiency of our first-generation products isn't where it needs to be, and we're working on that -- those reductions now. And we're taking all the learnings from that and incorporating it into our second-generation products and we'll talk more about that in a couple of weeks at Capital Markets Day. So, yes, there's things you can do. You just need to be thoughtful about it as you go through the product. And where there's opportunities, you bundle them together, and you do a minor launch, you do a change and you go. And that's what we're doing on e, and we're using the connected data to take out features that the customers don't value. Yes. So mix -- we had very strong mix in Q1. We don't expect that to repeat as we go through the year, and we do expect on a full year basis that we will see some pressures on pricing in Blue on a full year basis as we go through the second half of the year. Remember, what's really important is to understand that run rate of price as you come out of the back end of the year because you have the accrual impact for all of the units that are in stock and then you have to take the incentive levels from Q1 of 2024 and apply it to those units that are in stock. So you've got to think about that on a run rate business coming out of the end of the year. But overall, yes, it's -- for Blue, we definitely see that there'll be some pressure on pricing. Yes, sure. So, we had shared what we thought the bridge was earlier this year. And so as I said, we think pricing overall for us will be about neutral for the year. We said that our COGS are primarily material and logistics. We had said that it would be about $2.5 billion. We think it's about $2 billion now. That's primarily due to commodities not coming down as quickly as we had thought. Volumes, we were up 9% in Q1. We expect to be about -- up about 6%-ish for the full year overall. So, I think you can look at that, and those are the three areas that have basically changed versus what we had bridged before. We see past service pension at about a $2 billion negative. Credit, we don't change there, we're about that $1.4 million, and we're going to continue to invest in growth and then we stock exchange and other of about $1 billion. So, that bridge largely remains the same, except we got a little bit of movement between some volume and some commodity costs."

At this time, I would like to welcome you to the Ford Motor Company Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Lynn Antipas Tyson, Executive Director of Investor Relations.\nLynn Antipas Tyson: Thank you, Laila. Welcome to Ford Motor Company's third quarter 2024 earnings call. With me today are Jim Farley, President and CEO, and John Lawler, Vice Chair and CFO. Also joining us today is Cathy O'Callaghan, CEO of Ford Credit. Today's discussions include some non-GAAP references. These are reconciled to the most comparable US GAAP measures in the appendix of our earnings deck. You can find the deck along with the rest of our earnings materials and other important content at shareholder.ford.com. Our discussion also includes forward-looking statements about our expectations. Actual results may differ from those stated. The most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ are included on Page 20. Unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year-over-year. Company EBIT, EPS, and free cash flow are on an adjusted basis. Lastly, I'd like to call out a key near term IR engagement. On November 20th, John Lawler, Vice Chair and CFO, and Sherry House, VP Finance, will participate in a fireside chat with Dan Levy at the Barclays Global Automotive and Mobility Tech Conference in New York. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jim.\nJim Farley: Thanks, Lynn. Hi, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I want to start by thanking our global team for their commitment to Ford+ and to adding and creating value for all of our shareholders. I'd like to touch on an overview of our strategy and why we believe we're so well positioned versus the competitors in key areas, and John will take you through the Q3 results and full year outlook. Several years ago, we restructured our overseas operations, and our global footprint is a key strength for Ford. We restructured in Europe, South America, India and China. Collectively, in 2018, those regions were losing $2.2 billion and burned $3.4 billion in cash. Now, all of those regions are collectively profitable. We're going to continue to stay laser-focused on cost and getting leaner as a company, but our team won't be distracted by major international restructuring facing other OEMs, especially in China. And speaking of China, we've gone asset-light for a couple of years, as we've told you. We have strong JV partners, and we have a growing export business. In fact, China and its exports are now contributing over $600 million to the company's EBIT this year. Another area of strength is our EV strategy, which I wouldn't trade for any of our competitors. We moved early. We've learned a lot on Gen-1 from our customers, the global market dynamics, and what it requires to be fit to compete. No doubt there's a global price war and it's fueled by overcapacity, a flood of new EV nameplates, and massive compliance pressure. In our home market in the US, no OEM is immune. Since Q1 of last year, EV volumes have grown 35%, while revenues in total are flat at $14 billion. That means the progress on volume has been fully offset by prices. We're expecting roughly 150 new EV nameplates to hit North America by the end of 2026. And some of our competitors are already resorting to very aggressive lease tactics even on the brand-new products, which creates huge residual risk and overhang and brand damage. What we're doing about these market dynamics? Well, we're focused on cost. We've already reduced $1 billion in our EV costs this year. We remade our battery footprint. We trimmed our capacity to -- by 35%, in line with where we think the market will be in a few years. We accelerated the mix of our batteries, emphasizing LFP will be the first one to manufacture in the US, and that battery will leverage the IRA production tax credit. We're shifting new launches, focused on getting the products we do have in our EV portfolio profitable within the first 12 months, and we're deep into the design and engineering of our next-generation vehicles. Boy! are we excited about these coming out in the next few years. In 40 years in the industry, I've seen a lot of game-changer products, but the mid-sized electric pickup designed by our California team has got to be one of the most exciting. It's incredible package and consumer technology for a segment we know well. It matches the cost structure of any Chinese auto manufacturer building in Mexico in the future. How do we know that? Because 60% of the [BOM] (ph) has already been quoted. Another advantage for us obviously is Ford Pro. It's unique because we're combining product strength with software and repair services all linked together. Don't be confused by other press releases on-the-ground game in the commercial market, because what our customers see is that we have reach, a leading product portfolio and incredible software portfolio, as well as gaining strength in our repair services, all of that driving sticky reoccurring high-margin revenues. It turns out, in Pro, our dealer network is one of our key advantages. In the US, we have the largest commercial vehicle network, and that's essential to drive those attach rates to services. And our software is also a competitive advantage. Our paid subscriptions delivered a growth of 50% in revenue, 30% just this quarter, and our gross margins are over 50%. There's incredible upside at Ford for our software to grow our installed base, attach rates and ARPU. Another strength is our diverse powertrain lineup. For example, in the US, the hybrid pickup sales at Ford have more than doubled in the past two years. We now have a nearly 80% market share of hybrid pickups. A lot of our companies shunned hybrids, and now they're scrambling, but it's going to take them years to catch up. Interestingly, in our home market, Ford is the #1 ICE brand, the #2 EV brand, and the #3 hybrid brand. Taking a step back, clearly, our strategic advantages are not falling to the bottom-line the way they should. Costs, especially warranty has held back our earnings power, but as we bend that curve, there is significant financial upside for investors. By design, 70% of the bonuses for our managers is tied to cost and quality, and more than half of our long-term incentives as leaders is tied to TSR. Let me double click on the EV business. We applied lessons really early that we learned on Mustang Mach-E across our lineup. In the last 24 months, we've reduced the Mustang Mach-E's cost by $5,000 per unit. As you know, Mach-E is second to Model Y in this segment for sales and transaction prices despite being in the market now for several years. And we continue to break down the friction or barriers to adoption for mainstream ICE customers. We are the first to join Tesla's Supercharger network, and we'll be shipping about 100,000 adapters by the end of this year. We are the first to offer complimentary home charging and installation. We call it the Ford Power Promise, and we've seen a huge uptick in interest on our website from the Power Promise. But our dealers are also becoming a competitive advantage for mainstream customers. Take, for example, Tim Hovik and his team at San Tan Ford in Arizona. In the quarter, one of the months, they sold 137 electric vehicles. And Arizona is not a ZEV state. These were incremental sales with solid gross profits for the dealers. And we are building on that know-how for the last couple of years in scaling and being #2 across our whole US dealer network. All of our 3,000 dealers are primed to sell EVs now. We have 7,000 trained EV specialists, and 14,000 dealership hours have been spent on EVs now. Our dealer network has already installed 800 fast chargers across the US and Canada, and many more are on the way. Next year, we expect to improve the trajectory of Model e's business through cost, scaling, and we're not trading wooden nickels inside the company for emissions credits. That won't change the economics of our EV vehicles and the company as a whole. Turning to Pro. We're the first OEM to segment our customers between retail and commercial. And it starts by having a great product line up and leaning into the future. About 9% of transit sales are now electric vehicles in the quarter. That's up 1.5 percentage points from a year ago. Our Super Duty has more variance than any other OEM, and we're bundling vehicles and services to provide unique value for our customers. What I mean by that is, about 13% of our EBIT Ford Pro now comes from repair services or software. We think that will grow to about 20% by 2026. We have the largest service network in North America. We're on track this year to add over 4,000 commercial service base and 2,500 Pro Mobile Service units. That, by the way, is up 50% year-over-year. Our mobile repair orders are up 60% year-over-year, and now almost one out of 10 Pro repair orders is done by a mobile service truck. Globally, Ford Pro Intelligence subscriptions rose 30% in the quarter. We now have about 630,000 subscriptions. As I said, that's a revenue growth of 50%. We're adding more and more product functionality and features that third-party software companies can't offer, because it's tied to the product, including remote vehicle lock and unlock, limits to our top speed and acceleration. Yes, we are seeing more pricing pressure on Pro in the second half, but that was consistent with our original guidance for the year. Demand is also in line with our expectations. We're seeing pent-up demand for Super Duty cabin chassis and transit wagons. And then, Ford Blue. Let me double-click for a second on that business. First, we have an incredibly fresh lineup across the globe, and we're going to add to that. We have four key US launches on deck. The Maverick and Bronco will be launching in the fourth quarter with new derivatives and a freshened product, and we have an all-new Expedition and Navigator launching early next year. In Q3, in the US, our share was up 40 basis points to 12.6%. Our ATPs in September were in line with the industry, and the Ford brand continues to transact higher than the average non-premium brands. Now, let me unpack the inventory. We ended the quarter with 91 days of gross stock and 68 days of dealer stock. That's a little higher than our target range of 50 to 60 days, but the mix is really good. Now, we're intentionally holding extra inventory through the year-end to protect sales during the Q1 launch activities that I mentioned. And adjusting for that, we're right in the target range for us as we start 2025 from an inventory standpoint. The biggest opportunity of the company clearly is cost and warranty. We're attacking both of these, and we will realize the upside. The biggest opportunity is warranty. And here's some evidence of things on the input metric side that are really improving. Our 3 MIN -- MIS, or three months in service, quality is getting a lot better, a 31% increase in the last three years. This year, the high-volume vehicle lines like F-150 and Escape had huge launches and really had no -- virtually no warranty spike. J.D. Powers typically sees a 92% increase in defects during a launch. Our launch production losses have also been cut in half from the last year, and these are very large-scale launches like F-150 and Explorer. Another key improvement that we're seeing is our ability to OTA and improve our vehicles in the field. We've updated 4 million vehicles at Ford this year and 20 million total since we started doing OTAs. We can now update 30 different vehicle modules, well beyond the SYNC in infotainment modules. The OTAs, on average, save our customers five to six waiting days waiting for repairs and, of course, it lowers our cost of warranty. All improvements to warranty will take time to reduce our warranty expense, maybe up to 18 months, but we're moving the needle on all the inputs. Taking a step back, I believe we're in a very strong competitive position. We have a lean and profitable international business with no distractions. We have a fresh and appealing lineup, which will get even fresher. We have a strong and diversified powertrain strategy that gives customers choice and gives us the flexibility and reach. We're already on our second generation of electric vehicles. They'll be launching in the next couple of years. We'll reduce the losses short-term on our Gen-1 products and set us up to be a global competitor in the long term. We have a vibrant growing software and repair business for Pro, and Pro is clearly a strategic advantage for the company. We're going to keep doing the hard yards to capture the tremendous upside in cost and warranty defects present to us and we're going to bring it home for our valued investors. John?\nJohn Lawler: Thanks, Jim. In the third quarter, wholesales were flat, while revenue grew by 5% to over $46 billion. That's our 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. And this is supported by our compelling product lineup offering, freedom of choice to both our retail and commercial customers. The quarter benefited from strong truck sales, including hybrids, as well as the launch of the all-new Ford Explorer and Lincoln Aviator. We delivered $2.6 billion in adjusted EBIT, with a margin of 5.5%, up 50 basis points from a year ago. The profit improvement was driven by higher volume and favorable mix, partially offset by expected EV pricing pressures and adverse exchange. Overall, costs were lower in the quarter. I have great confidence in today's business and the changes that are underway. Several years ago, we proactively restructured our global product lineup and tailored it to focus on customer segments we know [best] (ph) and lead in, which has driven consistent top-line growth. We're also slowly but surely improving our industrial system and shedding behaviors that have held us back in the past. And our free cash flow is stronger and more consistent than just a few years ago. All evidence that our Ford+ plan is working. Adjusted free cash flow was $3.2 billion in the quarter and $5.9 billion year-to-date, with cash conversion of 74%, well above our targeted range of 50% to 60%. Our balance sheet remains strong with almost $28 billion in cash and $46 billion in liquidity. We continue to believe that it is prudent to have extra cash on hand during this unprecedented time in this industry and provides us flexibility to invest in accretive growth, execute strategic build partner buy opportunities, and maintain financial flexibility during the next economic cycle. I'm also pleased to announce that we declared our fourth quarter regular dividend of $0.15 per share payable on December 2nd to shareholders of record on November 7th. We target to return 40% to 50% of adjusted free cash flow to shareholders annually, and including today's announcement, have paid out over $10 billion to shareholders since the beginning of 2022. Now, let me turn to our segments. Ford Pro delivered close to $16 billion of revenue in the quarter, up 13%, another quarter of growth. Wholesales were up 9%, aided by the launch of the all-new one-ton Transit Custom in Europe and robust demand for Super Duty and two-ton Transit vans. EBIT of $1.8 billion was up year-over-year with a healthy margin of 11.6%. Ford Pro continues to be our prototype for sticky high-margin, non-cyclical revenue, paid subscriptions, attach rate and monthly ARPU were up in the quarter. Pro's results continue to demonstrate the consistency and resiliency of this higher-margin growth business, underscored by their year-to-date EBIT margin performance of 14.6%, in line with our long-term target. Ford Model e generated a loss of $1.2 billion. We delivered $500 million of year-over-year cost improvement, which was offset by industry pricing pressures. Global wholesales were down 11%, reflecting our focus on yield management and balancing dealer inventory in North America, offset partially by the launch of the all-new Explorer EV in Europe. Our team is focused on delivering further cost reductions, optimizing the Gen-1 market equation, and driving capital efficiencies, helping to improve our profit look -- outlook as we head into 2025. Ford Blue revenue was up 3% in the quarter, while wholesales were down 2%, driven by discontinued low-margin ICE passenger vehicles. Although overall volume was down, North America volume was up 8%, driven by key nameplates like F-150 and Ranger. EBIT of $1.6 billion and margin of 6.2% were both down year-over-year due to adverse exchange and higher manufacturing costs, offset partially by lower warranty expense and higher net pricing. Hybrid sales up 30% in the quarter continue to shine and our global hybrid mix is still on pace to approach 9% by year-end, up over 2 points year-over-year with more products on the way. Ford Credit generated EBT of $544 million, up $186 million year-over-year, driven by an improvement in financing margin and higher receivables. Auction values declined 1%, and lease return rates continue to normalize from historic lows. We continue to originate a high-quality book with US retail and lease FICO scores again exceeding 750 for the quarter. Our exposure to EV residual risk is low, with EVs representing less than 10% of our lease portfolio in the US. So, let's turn to our outlook. When we began the year, we expected full year company-adjusted EBIT of $10 billion to $12 billion. Since then, our product portfolio has exceeded our expectations, delivering favorable market factors, including mix through the first nine months of the year, and we expect this trend to continue in the fourth quarter. This speaks to the strength of our key nameplates and the resilience of our commercial business at Ford Pro. We are also on track to deliver $2 billion of cost efficiencies within our industrial platform, offsetting expected higher labor and product refresh costs for the year. However, two gating factors keep us from a record adjusted EBIT this year, higher-than-expected warranty costs and the impact of inflation at our JV Ford Otosan in Turkey, which increases the material cost of transit vans sold in Europe. While inflationary pressures in Turkey is outside of our control, increased warranty costs are within our control. We now expect full year company-adjusted EBIT of about $10 billion, which includes lower-than-planned volume in the second half for Ford Pro and Ford Blue due to supplier disruptions. In general, we see supply and demand for vehicles in balance. We continue to expect adjusted free cash flow of $7.5 billion to $8.5 billion, with CapEx between $8 billion to $8.5 billion. Our outlook for '24 assumes a flat to slightly higher SAAR in both the US and Europe. Our planning assumptions for the US is 16 million to 16.5 million units. Full year of customer demand for all new Super Duty contributing to better market factors for Ford Pro, lower industry pricing of roughly 2%, driven by higher incentive spending as we exit the year. For Ford, we expect this to be partly offset by top-line growth from the launch of our new products. Our segment outlook anticipates continued strength in Ford Pro. We now expect EBITDA of about $9 billion with an improved market equation, including continued pricing strength on core products. An expected loss of about $5 billion for Model e, which is the positive end of our guidance range, driven by over $1 billion in cost improvements that were partially offset by continued pricing pressure and investments in our new vehicle platforms. And for Ford Blue, we now expect EBIT of $5 billion, reflecting a balanced market equation and higher product, manufacturing and warranty costs, partially offset by cost efficiencies. And lastly, Ford Credit's EBT will be about $1.6 billion, a double-digit growth year-over-year. Our performance this quarter demonstrates a positive progress on our Ford+ plan: capital discipline, the right product portfolio and consistent cash generation to reward our shareholders. We are relentlessly working to make our business better and we remain focused on improving both quality and cost. That wraps up our prepared remarks. We'll use the balance of the time to address your questions.\nOperator: We will now move to our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMark Delaney: Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks very much for taking the question. Pro EBIT was strong, but did fall to 11.6% in the quarter, although still at 14.6% year-to-date. Maybe you can talk a bit more around what led to the moderation in Pro EBIT during the third quarter and what gives you confidence in that mid-teens EBIT margin in the Pro segment over the intermediate to longer-term?\nJohn Lawler: Yeah. So, when you look at it, what we're seeing this year like we saw last year is seasonality in the second [half] (ph). Now there's transparency around the commercial business that we didn't have in the past. And first quarter, we see the peak in the rental business that falls off in second quarter. In fact, this quarter, third quarter, we had basically zero rental business. The other thing we see in the second half is we see the shutdowns that we see at our plants. And as you know, we run these at full capacity. So, we lose those units, and we can't make them up. And that's the seasonality you're seeing, and then you see that show up in the EBIT in the second half. The confidence we have in Ford Pro ongoing is we're continuing to see, as Jim said, strong demand for our Super Duty and Transit, especially the chassis and the wagons. Our pricing has held up pretty strong so far this year. We are seeing some top-line pricing pressure with the '25 model year vehicles as we expected, but we're still continuing to move forward, and it's not something that we're concerned about at this point based on what we're seeing so far with the '25 model years. So, again, the business continues to be strong. And I would tell you that we're really starting to gain traction on our overall process of how we're going to market and we're selling the solution, right? We're selling the vehicle along with the services that come along with that, that's about improving our customers' business and giving them productivity, which helps them improve their profits. So, all of that's coming together and it's leading to a continued strength in Ford Pro.\nMark Delaney: Thanks for that. I had one either for you or for Jim around Model e. I think you said during your prepared remarks, you expect improved EBIT trajectory in Model e next year. Maybe you can help us better understand how impactful some of the recent cost and capacity actions the company has taken might be within the Model e segment? And within your outlook for an improved EBIT trajectory within the Model e, how much of a risk might be rising CO2 requirements within Europe and just the broader pricing environment for EVs be as you think about that improved trajectory? Thank you.\nJim Farley: Thanks for your question. Good news is we're starting to scale the EV business in Europe and those vehicles are contribution margin positive, and they're becoming a bigger mix of our business. We are definitely getting traction from our cost-down efforts on our first cycle of products, and we're really focused on Mustang Mach-E. We've made a lot of progress, and we have a lot more to make. So, I think this is one of the benefits of having the segmentation broken out, and no doubt about it. I think we tried to highlight in our prepared comments the growing risk for everyone on pricing, and no OEM is immune to that. And as I said, we're seeing some of our competitors have enormous lease mixes like 70%-plus. So, that will play out, especially in Europe, as you said, there's a lot of pressure in Europe. Our products are brand new in Europe. So that's a good thing, and that'll help us next year. Anything else, John?\nJohn Lawler: No, I just think that we're going to continue to focus on cost improvements in the current generation and the future generation, and that's -- have being in the marketplace as long as we have, that's really helped frame up the mandate we have for the California team around cost to be competitive. And what it's all going to hinge on is, as you said, Jim, that top-line pricing pressure.\nJim Farley: Yes. And to be specific on the cost, we really expect next year and the following years, a lot of progress in the production tax credit for our first-gen products. That's really one of the key levers for us as we've been able to pretty quietly restructure our sourcing of our batteries, where they come from, who makes them to really maximize the PTC. And that will drive a lot of cost down for our existing products. And you'll see that come to fruition starting in mid-next year and all the way through 2027.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America. Please unmute your line and ask your question.\nJohn Murphy: Good evening, everybody. Just a first question on warranty for -- maybe for both of you. I mean, Jim, you kind of cited some pretty good positive data around J.D. Power, some other sources, but I'm just curious if you're willing to, at this point, kind of ring the sort of the positive alarm bell that we're now kind of all clear on some of the warranty issues we've seen in the past, particularly last quarter, or is there -- I mean, what is the certainty that we're through the worst of this.\nJohn Lawler: Yeah, John, I wish I could answer that with certainty. We are seeing the leading indicators, the physicals. We're seeing improvement there, especially around our three months in service. '24 model year is over 30% better than what we saw in '21 and '22. As Jim mentioned, our launch spikes basically on Explorer and Cougar, we did see one. So, those are good indicators that things are going to get better from an overall quality standpoint. Now, it's going to take time for that to flow through from a warranty standpoint. What I can't tell you is, I don't and can't read, and we're doing the best we can on this, I know it's not satisfactory for you guys is the FSAs and the older models, where what could potentially hit us. And we're out looking at all the data we can. We're looking at everything to try to get out in front of any of those. And we're working to increase on our current models, everything we can do to fix things through OTAs, get the repairs out there as fast as possible, cut off any issues that are in the plants. So, I think we're doing all the right things from a physical standpoint. I just can't tell you when that curve is going to bend for sure and how that's going to start flowing through from a cost standpoint. And we're doing everything we can to figure that out and get there and understand the transparency and clarity around that.\nJohn Murphy: And then just a second question around pricing. I mean in Blue, it was still, on a net basis, even positive in the third quarter. So, a lot of concern around might have -- what's going on with your inventory, although it sounds like you've answered that question, but also inventory at Stellantis and what might happen in the broader market. So, I mean, as you look at this and you think about pricing, you've got great product coming out now and into next year that should be a bit of an offset. It seems like you'll have the inventory worked out. How do you think about pricing going forward in the industry? I mean, it keeps surprising and being relatively resilient and actually even positive for you guys. So I mean, how do you think about that going forward?\nJohn Lawler: Yeah. So, this year, top-line both pricing and volume were a tailwind for us relative to what we had thought. The industry is down 2%. We are seeing increasing pressures as we come through the end of the quarter into Q4 from a top-line standpoint. Your guess is as good as mine, John, as what's going to happen and how deep some of our competitors are going to go that have an issue with inventories. Yeah, our inventories were higher, but we also gained share in the quarter and our sales pace increased. So, we think we've got a plan to manage our inventories. We've got a plan to get back to within the run rate of what we expect. We do have some launches in Q1, so we will carry some higher inventory for those vehicles through the end of the year, but next year, we plan to get back to that 50 to 60 days run rate, for sure. As we move into 2025, there's a lot of water that needs to flow under the bridge still between now and the end of the year. One of the things we're looking at is the consumers in Europe, it seems that they're pulling back a bit and spending less. So, we've got to watch that. And I think many of you guys have written about the fact that, are we heading into cyclical pricing headwinds? And is that going to show up in 2025? As you said, we've all been pleasantly surprised as how it's held up so far, but I want to see how we run through this quarter, how the year-end is coming along, how sales are at the end of the year before I can give you any call on what we think is going to happen with pricing next year.\nJim Farley: And the only thing I would add on the pricing is really the mix. We continue to see customers move into small utility, affordable side of EVs continue to be really fuel the unit growth and we're even seeing some change in series mix. So, those are all uncertainties that we have to handicap for next year. But I just encourage all of us to not just look at the top-line or the discounting, but also look at the mix and the segmentation. The good news is the truck segments and the Pro segments are holding up really well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please unmute to ask your question.\nAdam Jonas: Good evening, everybody. So, the Chinese have really been growing rapidly in Europe and rest of world as you've seen. I know you don't break out results geographically, but any color on any impact you might be seeing in Europe competitively or even in rest of world regions that you wanted to highlight? And specifically, I was kind of surprised you mentioned that China was contributing $600 million to your results this year. I'm curious how much of that was from the domestic market versus reverse exporting from China?\nJohn Lawler: Yeah. Adam, I'll start with that and then I think Jim will cover the rest of your question. So, we are profitable in China in and of itself in China. Jim mentioned $600 million of total profits, and that includes our exports, primarily to the rest of Asia and South America. So, going asset-light has allowed us to stay profitable within China. And then, the export strategy, primarily from our JV, our JMC, and exporting those vehicles to the rest of Asia as well as South America is driving significant profit in Ford Blue.\nJim Farley: And Adam, for our revenue globally, Ranger has become such a key product for us. We are in so many markets, and the reason why we're profitable overseas is so many of those markets is because of Ranger. When I came to the company, Ranger was 13th, now we're #2 to Toyota Hilux. And in many markets like Australia, we outsell them. So, that's where the pressure is going to show up for Ford's revenue. Great Wall is now localizing in Thailand. They're 60% of the pickup market in China. They're really sharp company with great products and great value proposition. So, we have a great strategy for that, but that's where we see it. In Europe, as you said in Europe, the passenger car market has been impacted, but we really don't compete there. We really compete in the commercial Pro business in Europe. We don't see the Chinese being major movers. [indiscernible] a little bit in the UK, but they haven't really focused on the commercial Pro business. The good thing there is that we have a multi-energy strategy for all of our Transits where we can offer customers whatever they want, including electric Transits, as I said, almost 10% of our products. So, we're well positioned, I think in both locations, for Ranger and Transit.\nAdam Jonas: Thanks, Jim. Just as a follow-up, John, you cut about $1 billion out of the full year outlook. You provide the detail by your reporting segments, but I was wondering if you could break down what compromised that $1 billion shortfall by factor if I gave you your costs versus your expectations. You mentioned warranty costs are down, but not as much as you thought. You're not satisfied. FX and the supplier disruption, you mentioned you missed some units. I wanted to know if you could quantify that or any other factors by causal factor. Thanks.\nJohn Lawler: Yeah. I think, Adam, when you look at it, you've got to look at it on the full year versus where we're guiding down now relative to what we had in Q2, right? And when we guided Q2, we had the headwinds hit us quite hard from a warranty standpoint and we are seeing inflationary costs in Turkey. So, if you just step back on the full year, what's gating us from hitting the record profits is the fact that we have those headwinds that are offsetting the positives we had from a top-line we just talked about, volumes and mix and pricing stronger than we expected. Now, coming out of the second quarter, what we've seen since then, which is gating us now to the lower end of our range is that we're seeing, in particularly, in Blue, we're missing some volume and we're seeing some mix headwinds due to some constraints we have with suppliers. And it's hitting our most profitable, highest-profitable mix vehicles. Some of that is, we lost some production due to the hurricane, but we also have some issues with a certain supplier on their productivity that we're trying to work through. We believe we'll be through that by the end of the quarter, but that is hitting Ford Blue and that's what's pulling Ford Blue down now from a standpoint versus what we guided at Q2. Does that explain -- does that cover it?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Daniel R\u00f6ska from AllianceBernstein.\nDaniel R\u00f6ska: Hey, good evening, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe, Jim, if you take a step back and think about Ford+ and the targets we've discussed over the past, I'm not going to hold you to 10% in '26, but could you still remind us of the stepping stones here for performance kind of in the medium term, and also give us a little bit of your view on how kind of the somewhat slower transition into EV might impact kind of what we've talked about in the past?\nJim Farley: Thank you. Well, certainly, our focus continues to be cost and our biggest cost focus is warranty, coverages and FSAs. That is our -- that's always been our work at Ford. I'd say we approached it looking at the most systematic changes that we need to make in the industrial system. And I'm proud of the progress, but we're not satisfied at all, and we have a lot of opportunity. And going into maybe what looks like, in our home market, a little bit of a tougher pricing environment, that's upside for us as a company. And the management team is all focused on that and we're rewarded for doing that work. I would say the EV journey has been really interesting because as much as it's slowed down, I'm really proud of the team reacting really quickly to it. Many of our competitors still have a lot of models coming out. And we made the adjustment really early and those second-generation products will be coming out. In addition to that, we really learned the industrial fitness we have to have in the way the vehicle is designed, the design costs, the design for manufacturability, and that's all in our second-generation products. And I think that's a four-, five-year advantage for Ford. The other opportunity that kind of emerged maybe that we didn't expect was the popularity of hybrids, especially on trucks. Most of our competitors don't offer hybrid on an F-150 or a Maverick, and this has been a fantastic revenue opportunity for us. We frankly can't keep up with the demand. And our -- the reason why we focused our hybrids on truck is because we can innovate for the customer at Pro Power Onboard using hybrid and other advantages than just more efficient propulsion. And I think that has encouraged us to put hybrid across our whole lineup, and be more curious about other partial electric solutions, which we'll talk to you about. I would say the -- this skunkworks team has over-delivered, at least in the designing the platform. Now we have to make it to high-scale production. And I am so excited to show everyone their work because it really shows how a company like Ford can compete with a company like BYD. And I would say Pro has been a really interesting journey for us, because I think it kind of shows the future of the auto industry with attached services, with more focus on aftersales and repair, and software that's kind of tied to the vehicle itself, not just generic productivity software, but software that actually is tied to the vehicle, and to do that, we need advanced electric architectures. But there's been some challenges beyond cost and quality, obviously, and the slow uptake of EVs. Electric architectures are hard to execute. The software journey and the technology for the company is big know-how. We're already at 20 million OTAs. That's going to be a more and more important capability for the company. So, there have been surprises, but I think, as I said, we're really well-positioned in the short and mid-term.\nDaniel R\u00f6ska: Great. Thanks for that. And maybe, John, to follow up a little bit, if you kind of summarize, there's been headwinds in the short term, EV has been a little delayed. So that ramp up kind of certainly isn't happening maybe quite as fast as you might [Technical Difficulty] stability on the cash side, but could I push you a bit and ask what would make you reconsider kind of the strategy on shareholder distribution? Because we've seen a couple of your competitors kind of be a little bit more aggressive on immediate distributions, be it dividends or buybacks, right, but just as a -- what's the balance you're striking and what would maybe move you, let's say, to increase the dividend again, for example, or to take other distribution actions? What could some of those factors be to tilt the capital allocation towards shareholders?\nJohn Lawler: Right. So, we talk about this every quarter, as you would expect. And we're consistent in that we're going to pay out 40% to 50% of our free cash flow. And we do think it's prudent at this point in time to hang on to the incremental cash. We have $28 billion and $8 billion higher than our stated cash minimum that we need is $20 billion. And I think at this point in time, where we're at in the industry, where we're at in the overall economic cycle, the uncertainty around the globe, right now, it's the right thing to hang on to cash. And I'm not saying there's going to be something that happens in the global economy, I'm not saying there's going to be some disruption, but were that to happen, we would be very pleased having this cash in hand. So, we look at it every quarter. We understand that if we don't have a use for the cash or if the environment doesn't change and we see that the risks that might be facing us diminish significantly, then we have to make sure that we handle that cash appropriately and either invest it for an accretive growth or pay it back to the shareholders. And we will look at that every quarter and we will adjust appropriately.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joseph Spak with UBS. Please unmute and ask your question.\nJoseph Spak: Thanks, Jim. Actually, if we could just pick up right there, I want to talk about a little bit about the 40% to 50% payout, because I hear you and Jim's confidence on the business, but I also hear on this call that warranty is something you still don't quite have a handle on and there's some uncertainty there in the US market, it's hard to see how it becomes stronger. You talked about potentially a pricing cycling downwards. Again, not expecting it maybe or necessarily, but it's possible. And if the industry stalls out, obviously, then there's working capital headwinds. We saw how fast free cash flow deteriorates at a competitor. You mentioned higher inflation, there's still some investment that needs to be made. So -- and I know you want to keep cash on hand for optionality. So, when I hear you talk about 40% to 50%, it sounds to me like that's a retrospective view, but I'm actually wondering how much of a prospective view are you considering in that? And like why is 40% to 50% even the right number?\nJohn Lawler: Yeah. And we -- of course, we look at both prospective and as well, what we're going to pay out for the year. So, we set the strategy around that payout ratio, 40% to 50%. And we thought -- we think that's a good point to be at right now. And we do look prospectively as to where we see the environment changing, what's in front of us, where the outlook could potentially be the risks, the potential headwinds, potential tailwinds, et cetera. So, we do do that. It's just that at this point in time, we don't have anything to announce. But we're always evaluating it and we're always looking at it. We have the conversation every quarter as you would expect. And once we feel that it's the right time, then we will make a prospective change, a change based on a prospective outlook.\nJim Farley: I would only add to John's comment that we're really excited about the Pro services, and we don't have anything to announce, but we're always going to want to have some optionality, not just for running the business, but for strategic optionality to build our services business. I mean, when is a car company had a chance to get the profitability of a Pro business to 20% or 30% of its revenue being services. That is such a special moment for our company and frankly for the industry, but that just doesn't come from organic growth all the time. Sometimes, it takes investments in new kinds of services. I'm not going to go into that, but I just want you to understand that we're also thinking very carefully like we have all of our strategy choices, like going asset-light in China, like restructuring our businesses, like the way we handle the Rivian investment, we're thinking very carefully about our Pro business and how to nurture those services beyond what we have today.\nJoseph Spak: Maybe just as a second question, I want to go back to Mark's question on European compliance. I know last -- in the last 10-Q, you called out $3.8 billion for regulatory compliance and I reread it this morning and said for North America and Europe for current and future model years. But in Europe, it's really more of a -- right, like there's no credit system, that's my understanding, right, it's a bilateral negotiation maybe for a pooling agreement. So, is that what's being considered in that number? And between a potential pooling agreement and your new BEV portfolio with the Explorer, the Capri, et cetera, do you expect to be compliant next year?\nJohn Lawler: Yes.\nJim Farley: Yes. And the other thing to think about in Europe or in North America is we tend to talk about CO2 compliance is like one thing is actually heavy duty or light duty as well as a passenger car, and they're very different. And in Europe, that's really important to consider. So, not only are we committed obviously to be compliant, but we also have to think about our heavy-duty compliance in both markets. And that's why we launch -- that's one of the reasons why we're so excited about. We have a whole new line of electric and combustion small vans. We just launched our main van, the one-ton Transit, that's available in diesel, gas and fully electric. So, we obviously giving ourselves the best chance from an offer standpoint as well. But when it comes to CO2 compliance, I hope we start to double-click and not only look at ZEV states in the US, but also look at heavy-duty compliance because it's really -- it's quite different actually.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner from Wolfe Research. Please unmute your line and ask your question.\nEmmanuel Rosner: Thank you so much. My first question is on the cost reduction program. So, this year's outlook still includes $2 billion in cost reductions for material, freight, manufacturing. You said you're on track for those. How much is it year-to-date? How much do you still need to achieve in the fourth quarter? And then, if we look forward, I know there's a lot of uncertainty into next year and you've discussed them in detail, both in terms of volume and pricing and mix, et cetera, but in terms of things you control, what is sort of like the size of the cost opportunity as you move into 2025?\nJohn Lawler: Yeah. So, on the efficiencies that we've brought through this year so far, most of it is through the first three quarters. So, we do have some savings to come through in Q4, but most of it was through the first three quarters. And you would expect that, right, Emmanuel, because there was a large part of that was on the design changes that we made with the launch of the model year. So, most of that's come through.\nEmmanuel Rosner: And on a go-forward basis?\nJohn Lawler: So, as you know as well as anybody and you had identified this morning in your note, we have a tremendous opportunity given our cost competitiveness relative to competition. The question is the rate and flow and how we bend that curve and pull that cost out. It is our number one opportunity to unlock the potential of our Ford+ strategy. We understand that. And we're not going to give any numbers on '25 at this standpoint right now, right? We're in our planning cycle. There's a lot of water, as I said earlier, to flow under the bridge before the end of the year. We'll give that guidance, and we'll give you an update in Q4 earnings for '25 and what we're going after in cost -- on cost from that perspective. But there's a tremendous -- you know this as well as all of you know this that our cost -- our position from a cost competitive standpoint, we have a lot of opportunity there and we understand that and we're aggressively going after it.\nJim Farley: For the industrial team, what we're really focused on as we finish off this year and next year is another cycle of our material cost reduction. We had a really -- we've made a lot of progress here, but we also added a lot of new product cost as well. That all is opportunity for us on material costs. So, this will be kind of the second rotation of that as we enter next year. And of course, a double-click or special attention on our EV Gen-1 costs. On warranty, we're really looking at our software warranty costs and the cost of repairing modules as well as powertrain. That's really where the team is focused on warranty. Obviously, we made good progress on manufacturing, but we have a lot more work to do in North America and that includes freight and duty. And then, we're looking very carefully at our should-cost on supply chain with our suppliers, working carefully with them to make sure that we have competitive negotiations and any inflation-related requests that we're dispositioning those to be fair to both the supplier and Ford. And we have dedicated teams on all those areas. We benchmark our competitors from a process and talent standpoint, and that's where we're spending our time as a team.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Levy from Barclays. Your line is open, Dan. Feel free to unmute.\nDan Levy: Hi. Sorry about that. Thank you. I want to follow up on the prior line of questions and just ask something a little different on cost. You mentioned or you discussed at your Capital Markets Day, I think it was some 15 -- 18 months ago now that you had the $7 billion cost gap against your competitors, mostly on the material costs. You mentioned that you -- you're getting the $2 billion of cost this year, but you've had other costs come into the system. Where do you think you stand now on narrowing that cost gap? Are you just as confident today that you can narrow that cost gap versus when you originally presented that target?\nJohn Lawler: Yeah. So Dan, I think we're in a different position today versus where we were 18 months ago about really understanding the root cause issue of that and what it's going to take to make the changes to get that cost out of the system. And that's been a very fundamental change for us as a leadership team, honestly. Our cost gap versus competition versus then has not closed. That's not to say that we haven't taken cost out, we have. We've taken cost out, but we're not doing it at a pace faster than our competition. So, we go through every quarter, and we update the analysis, we pull apart the financial statements when we get the Qs and at the end of the year with K, we look at the progress we've made versus the progress that our competitors have made. And it largely sits, we've made more progress on material costs, but we've gone backwards on warranty cost. We've made some progress on our structural costs [ASP] (ph), SG&A relative to competition, but other areas have offset that. We've had more inflationary costs because of our joint venture in Turkey with what they've seen with that business. So, it's still a very strong business. It's still the lowest-cost business. We've just seen this increase this year that we weren't planning for. So, we need to move faster, bottom line, and warranty needs to be a big part of that. We need to continue to make the progress on material cost, our manufacturing costs, overall structural costs, as well as driving down the warranty cost. So, it's a humbling position to be in is that, as you said, 18 months later, we haven't closed the gap. Despite taking cost out, our competitors are doing the same thing. They're taking cost out. We need to accelerate our pace to outrun what our competitors are doing.\nDan Levy: Thank you. That's helpful color. Maybe as a follow-up, wanted to ask about a comment, Jim, that you mentioned earlier that on the skunkworks EV, you have confidence in the cost because you've already quoted 60% of the BOM. So, maybe you could give us a flavor of sort of what pieces you've seen clear achievements on in your quoting or sourcing that are driving these material cost outs versus maybe where the rest of the industry is and that's enabling you to achieve what you think is structurally lower cost on the EVs?\nJim Farley: Yes. So obviously, having a competitive LFP battery is really, really important. Competitive is keyword. The team took a totally different approach to developing the vehicle. And I don't want to get into too much detail, but I'm really proud that we basically verified the design of each part like a year or two earlier than we normally do. And we verified it from the supplier standpoint and ours by looking at a variety of different suppliers, even challenger suppliers. And that has been an eye-opening experience for us to see what really should-cost is on a lot of these advanced components, especially, because we think companies like BYD have an incredible advantage on affordability of batteries. So, we have to make that up, or our opportunity is on the EV component side, inverters, gearboxes, motors, et cetera. And I think it's a combination of very new approaches to the actual design of the component, as well as leveraging new suppliers as well as working way upfront on the part design itself to get the cost out using the technology roadmap of the supplier. And that's where we're seeing a lot of the progress. Basically, the answer to your question is we radically simplified the vehicle. Like, if you look at the number of parts in the vehicle, it is just a completely order of magnitude change. And when you simplify the components to that level, and you really move the design and supplier design phases earlier, you can integrate a simpler design with a better should-cost. That's the high hard one on the skunkworks team. Look, we've done a lot on manufacturing. We have a whole new kitting strategy for the vehicle. We have a unit casting strategy that massively simplifies the stamping of the vehicle. I think a lot of other companies will do that. But what I'm really seeing is an ethos of simplicity and a higher engagement with a broader supply chain earlier in the process than the typical for development cycle.\nOperator: This concludes the Ford Motor Company third quarter 2024 earnings conference call.

            "name": "Jim Farley",
            "content": "Thanks, Lynn. Hi, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I want to start by thanking our global team for their commitment to Ford+ and to adding and creating value for all of our shareholders. I'd like to touch on an overview of our strategy and why we believe we're so well positioned versus the competitors in key areas, and John will take you through the Q3 results and full year outlook. Several years ago, we restructured our overseas operations, and our global footprint is a key strength for Ford. We restructured in Europe, South America, India and China. Collectively, in 2018, those regions were losing $2.2 billion and burned $3.4 billion in cash. Now, all of those regions are collectively profitable. We're going to continue to stay laser-focused on cost and getting leaner as a company, but our team won't be distracted by major international restructuring facing other OEMs, especially in China. And speaking of China, we've gone asset-light for a couple of years, as we've told you. We have strong JV partners, and we have a growing export business. In fact, China and its exports are now contributing over $600 million to the company's EBIT this year. Another area of strength is our EV strategy, which I wouldn't trade for any of our competitors. We moved early. We've learned a lot on Gen-1 from our customers, the global market dynamics, and what it requires to be fit to compete. No doubt there's a global price war and it's fueled by overcapacity, a flood of new EV nameplates, and massive compliance pressure. In our home market in the US, no OEM is immune. Since Q1 of last year, EV volumes have grown 35%, while revenues in total are flat at $14 billion. That means the progress on volume has been fully offset by prices. We're expecting roughly 150 new EV nameplates to hit North America by the end of 2026. And some of our competitors are already resorting to very aggressive lease tactics even on the brand-new products, which creates huge residual risk and overhang and brand damage. What we're doing about these market dynamics? Well, we're focused on cost. We've already reduced $1 billion in our EV costs this year. We remade our battery footprint. We trimmed our capacity to -- by 35%, in line with where we think the market will be in a few years. We accelerated the mix of our batteries, emphasizing LFP will be the first one to manufacture in the US, and that battery will leverage the IRA production tax credit. We're shifting new launches, focused on getting the products we do have in our EV portfolio profitable within the first 12 months, and we're deep into the design and engineering of our next-generation vehicles. Boy! are we excited about these coming out in the next few years. In 40 years in the industry, I've seen a lot of game-changer products, but the mid-sized electric pickup designed by our California team has got to be one of the most exciting. It's incredible package and consumer technology for a segment we know well. It matches the cost structure of any Chinese auto manufacturer building in Mexico in the future. How do we know that? Because 60% of the [BOM] (ph) has already been quoted. Another advantage for us obviously is Ford Pro. It's unique because we're combining product strength with software and repair services all linked together. Don't be confused by other press releases on-the-ground game in the commercial market, because what our customers see is that we have reach, a leading product portfolio and incredible software portfolio, as well as gaining strength in our repair services, all of that driving sticky reoccurring high-margin revenues. It turns out, in Pro, our dealer network is one of our key advantages. In the US, we have the largest commercial vehicle network, and that's essential to drive those attach rates to services. And our software is also a competitive advantage. Our paid subscriptions delivered a growth of 50% in revenue, 30% just this quarter, and our gross margins are over 50%. There's incredible upside at Ford for our software to grow our installed base, attach rates and ARPU. Another strength is our diverse powertrain lineup. For example, in the US, the hybrid pickup sales at Ford have more than doubled in the past two years. We now have a nearly 80% market share of hybrid pickups. A lot of our companies shunned hybrids, and now they're scrambling, but it's going to take them years to catch up. Interestingly, in our home market, Ford is the #1 ICE brand, the #2 EV brand, and the #3 hybrid brand. Taking a step back, clearly, our strategic advantages are not falling to the bottom-line the way they should. Costs, especially warranty has held back our earnings power, but as we bend that curve, there is significant financial upside for investors. By design, 70% of the bonuses for our managers is tied to cost and quality, and more than half of our long-term incentives as leaders is tied to TSR. Let me double click on the EV business. We applied lessons really early that we learned on Mustang Mach-E across our lineup. In the last 24 months, we've reduced the Mustang Mach-E's cost by $5,000 per unit. As you know, Mach-E is second to Model Y in this segment for sales and transaction prices despite being in the market now for several years. And we continue to break down the friction or barriers to adoption for mainstream ICE customers. We are the first to join Tesla's Supercharger network, and we'll be shipping about 100,000 adapters by the end of this year. We are the first to offer complimentary home charging and installation. We call it the Ford Power Promise, and we've seen a huge uptick in interest on our website from the Power Promise. But our dealers are also becoming a competitive advantage for mainstream customers. Take, for example, Tim Hovik and his team at San Tan Ford in Arizona. In the quarter, one of the months, they sold 137 electric vehicles. And Arizona is not a ZEV state. These were incremental sales with solid gross profits for the dealers. And we are building on that know-how for the last couple of years in scaling and being #2 across our whole US dealer network. All of our 3,000 dealers are primed to sell EVs now. We have 7,000 trained EV specialists, and 14,000 dealership hours have been spent on EVs now. Our dealer network has already installed 800 fast chargers across the US and Canada, and many more are on the way. Next year, we expect to improve the trajectory of Model e's business through cost, scaling, and we're not trading wooden nickels inside the company for emissions credits. That won't change the economics of our EV vehicles and the company as a whole. Turning to Pro. We're the first OEM to segment our customers between retail and commercial. And it starts by having a great product line up and leaning into the future. About 9% of transit sales are now electric vehicles in the quarter. That's up 1.5 percentage points from a year ago. Our Super Duty has more variance than any other OEM, and we're bundling vehicles and services to provide unique value for our customers. What I mean by that is, about 13% of our EBIT Ford Pro now comes from repair services or software. We think that will grow to about 20% by 2026. We have the largest service network in North America. We're on track this year to add over 4,000 commercial service base and 2,500 Pro Mobile Service units. That, by the way, is up 50% year-over-year. Our mobile repair orders are up 60% year-over-year, and now almost one out of 10 Pro repair orders is done by a mobile service truck. Globally, Ford Pro Intelligence subscriptions rose 30% in the quarter. We now have about 630,000 subscriptions. As I said, that's a revenue growth of 50%. We're adding more and more product functionality and features that third-party software companies can't offer, because it's tied to the product, including remote vehicle lock and unlock, limits to our top speed and acceleration. Yes, we are seeing more pricing pressure on Pro in the second half, but that was consistent with our original guidance for the year. Demand is also in line with our expectations. We're seeing pent-up demand for Super Duty cabin chassis and transit wagons. And then, Ford Blue. Let me double-click for a second on that business. First, we have an incredibly fresh lineup across the globe, and we're going to add to that. We have four key US launches on deck. The Maverick and Bronco will be launching in the fourth quarter with new derivatives and a freshened product, and we have an all-new Expedition and Navigator launching early next year. In Q3, in the US, our share was up 40 basis points to 12.6%. Our ATPs in September were in line with the industry, and the Ford brand continues to transact higher than the average non-premium brands. Now, let me unpack the inventory. We ended the quarter with 91 days of gross stock and 68 days of dealer stock. That's a little higher than our target range of 50 to 60 days, but the mix is really good. Now, we're intentionally holding extra inventory through the year-end to protect sales during the Q1 launch activities that I mentioned. And adjusting for that, we're right in the target range for us as we start 2025 from an inventory standpoint. The biggest opportunity of the company clearly is cost and warranty. We're attacking both of these, and we will realize the upside. The biggest opportunity is warranty. And here's some evidence of things on the input metric side that are really improving. Our 3 MIN -- MIS, or three months in service, quality is getting a lot better, a 31% increase in the last three years. This year, the high-volume vehicle lines like F-150 and Escape had huge launches and really had no -- virtually no warranty spike. J.D. Powers typically sees a 92% increase in defects during a launch. Our launch production losses have also been cut in half from the last year, and these are very large-scale launches like F-150 and Explorer. Another key improvement that we're seeing is our ability to OTA and improve our vehicles in the field. We've updated 4 million vehicles at Ford this year and 20 million total since we started doing OTAs. We can now update 30 different vehicle modules, well beyond the SYNC in infotainment modules. The OTAs, on average, save our customers five to six waiting days waiting for repairs and, of course, it lowers our cost of warranty. All improvements to warranty will take time to reduce our warranty expense, maybe up to 18 months, but we're moving the needle on all the inputs. Taking a step back, I believe we're in a very strong competitive position. We have a lean and profitable international business with no distractions. We have a fresh and appealing lineup, which will get even fresher. We have a strong and diversified powertrain strategy that gives customers choice and gives us the flexibility and reach. We're already on our second generation of electric vehicles. They'll be launching in the next couple of years. We'll reduce the losses short-term on our Gen-1 products and set us up to be a global competitor in the long term. We have a vibrant growing software and repair business for Pro, and Pro is clearly a strategic advantage for the company. We're going to keep doing the hard yards to capture the tremendous upside in cost and warranty defects present to us and we're going to bring it home for our valued investors. John? Thanks for your question. Good news is we're starting to scale the EV business in Europe and those vehicles are contribution margin positive, and they're becoming a bigger mix of our business. We are definitely getting traction from our cost-down efforts on our first cycle of products, and we're really focused on Mustang Mach-E. We've made a lot of progress, and we have a lot more to make. So, I think this is one of the benefits of having the segmentation broken out, and no doubt about it. I think we tried to highlight in our prepared comments the growing risk for everyone on pricing, and no OEM is immune to that. And as I said, we're seeing some of our competitors have enormous lease mixes like 70%-plus. So, that will play out, especially in Europe, as you said, there's a lot of pressure in Europe. Our products are brand new in Europe. So that's a good thing, and that'll help us next year. Anything else, John? Yes. And to be specific on the cost, we really expect next year and the following years, a lot of progress in the production tax credit for our first-gen products. That's really one of the key levers for us as we've been able to pretty quietly restructure our sourcing of our batteries, where they come from, who makes them to really maximize the PTC. And that will drive a lot of cost down for our existing products. And you'll see that come to fruition starting in mid-next year and all the way through 2027. And the only thing I would add on the pricing is really the mix. We continue to see customers move into small utility, affordable side of EVs continue to be really fuel the unit growth and we're even seeing some change in series mix. So, those are all uncertainties that we have to handicap for next year. But I just encourage all of us to not just look at the top-line or the discounting, but also look at the mix and the segmentation. The good news is the truck segments and the Pro segments are holding up really well. And Adam, for our revenue globally, Ranger has become such a key product for us. We are in so many markets, and the reason why we're profitable overseas is so many of those markets is because of Ranger. When I came to the company, Ranger was 13th, now we're #2 to Toyota Hilux. And in many markets like Australia, we outsell them. So, that's where the pressure is going to show up for Ford's revenue. Great Wall is now localizing in Thailand. They're 60% of the pickup market in China. They're really sharp company with great products and great value proposition. So, we have a great strategy for that, but that's where we see it. In Europe, as you said in Europe, the passenger car market has been impacted, but we really don't compete there. We really compete in the commercial Pro business in Europe. We don't see the Chinese being major movers. [indiscernible] a little bit in the UK, but they haven't really focused on the commercial Pro business. The good thing there is that we have a multi-energy strategy for all of our Transits where we can offer customers whatever they want, including electric Transits, as I said, almost 10% of our products. So, we're well positioned, I think in both locations, for Ranger and Transit. Thank you. Well, certainly, our focus continues to be cost and our biggest cost focus is warranty, coverages and FSAs. That is our -- that's always been our work at Ford. I'd say we approached it looking at the most systematic changes that we need to make in the industrial system. And I'm proud of the progress, but we're not satisfied at all, and we have a lot of opportunity. And going into maybe what looks like, in our home market, a little bit of a tougher pricing environment, that's upside for us as a company. And the management team is all focused on that and we're rewarded for doing that work. I would say the EV journey has been really interesting because as much as it's slowed down, I'm really proud of the team reacting really quickly to it. Many of our competitors still have a lot of models coming out. And we made the adjustment really early and those second-generation products will be coming out. In addition to that, we really learned the industrial fitness we have to have in the way the vehicle is designed, the design costs, the design for manufacturability, and that's all in our second-generation products. And I think that's a four-, five-year advantage for Ford. The other opportunity that kind of emerged maybe that we didn't expect was the popularity of hybrids, especially on trucks. Most of our competitors don't offer hybrid on an F-150 or a Maverick, and this has been a fantastic revenue opportunity for us. We frankly can't keep up with the demand. And our -- the reason why we focused our hybrids on truck is because we can innovate for the customer at Pro Power Onboard using hybrid and other advantages than just more efficient propulsion. And I think that has encouraged us to put hybrid across our whole lineup, and be more curious about other partial electric solutions, which we'll talk to you about. I would say the -- this skunkworks team has over-delivered, at least in the designing the platform. Now we have to make it to high-scale production. And I am so excited to show everyone their work because it really shows how a company like Ford can compete with a company like BYD. And I would say Pro has been a really interesting journey for us, because I think it kind of shows the future of the auto industry with attached services, with more focus on aftersales and repair, and software that's kind of tied to the vehicle itself, not just generic productivity software, but software that actually is tied to the vehicle, and to do that, we need advanced electric architectures. But there's been some challenges beyond cost and quality, obviously, and the slow uptake of EVs. Electric architectures are hard to execute. The software journey and the technology for the company is big know-how. We're already at 20 million OTAs. That's going to be a more and more important capability for the company. So, there have been surprises, but I think, as I said, we're really well-positioned in the short and mid-term.\nDaniel Ro\u0308ska: Great. Thanks for that. And maybe, John, to follow up a little bit, if you kind of summarize, there's been headwinds in the short term, EV has been a little delayed. So that ramp up kind of certainly isn't happening maybe quite as fast as you might [Technical Difficulty] stability on the cash side, but could I push you a bit and ask what would make you reconsider kind of the strategy on shareholder distribution? Because we've seen a couple of your competitors kind of be a little bit more aggressive on immediate distributions, be it dividends or buybacks, right, but just as a -- what's the balance you're striking and what would maybe move you, let's say, to increase the dividend again, for example, or to take other distribution actions? What could some of those factors be to tilt the capital allocation towards shareholders? I would only add to John's comment that we're really excited about the Pro services, and we don't have anything to announce, but we're always going to want to have some optionality, not just for running the business, but for strategic optionality to build our services business. I mean, when is a car company had a chance to get the profitability of a Pro business to 20% or 30% of its revenue being services. That is such a special moment for our company and frankly for the industry, but that just doesn't come from organic growth all the time. Sometimes, it takes investments in new kinds of services. I'm not going to go into that, but I just want you to understand that we're also thinking very carefully like we have all of our strategy choices, like going asset-light in China, like restructuring our businesses, like the way we handle the Rivian investment, we're thinking very carefully about our Pro business and how to nurture those services beyond what we have today. Yes. And the other thing to think about in Europe or in North America is we tend to talk about CO2 compliance is like one thing is actually heavy duty or light duty as well as a passenger car, and they're very different. And in Europe, that's really important to consider. So, not only are we committed obviously to be compliant, but we also have to think about our heavy-duty compliance in both markets. And that's why we launch -- that's one of the reasons why we're so excited about. We have a whole new line of electric and combustion small vans. We just launched our main van, the one-ton Transit, that's available in diesel, gas and fully electric. So, we obviously giving ourselves the best chance from an offer standpoint as well. But when it comes to CO2 compliance, I hope we start to double-click and not only look at ZEV states in the US, but also look at heavy-duty compliance because it's really -- it's quite different actually. For the industrial team, what we're really focused on as we finish off this year and next year is another cycle of our material cost reduction. We had a really -- we've made a lot of progress here, but we also added a lot of new product cost as well. That all is opportunity for us on material costs. So, this will be kind of the second rotation of that as we enter next year. And of course, a double-click or special attention on our EV Gen-1 costs. On warranty, we're really looking at our software warranty costs and the cost of repairing modules as well as powertrain. That's really where the team is focused on warranty. Obviously, we made good progress on manufacturing, but we have a lot more work to do in North America and that includes freight and duty. And then, we're looking very carefully at our should-cost on supply chain with our suppliers, working carefully with them to make sure that we have competitive negotiations and any inflation-related requests that we're dispositioning those to be fair to both the supplier and Ford. And we have dedicated teams on all those areas. We benchmark our competitors from a process and talent standpoint, and that's where we're spending our time as a team. Yes. So obviously, having a competitive LFP battery is really, really important. Competitive is keyword. The team took a totally different approach to developing the vehicle. And I don't want to get into too much detail, but I'm really proud that we basically verified the design of each part like a year or two earlier than we normally do. And we verified it from the supplier standpoint and ours by looking at a variety of different suppliers, even challenger suppliers. And that has been an eye-opening experience for us to see what really should-cost is on a lot of these advanced components, especially, because we think companies like BYD have an incredible advantage on affordability of batteries. So, we have to make that up, or our opportunity is on the EV component side, inverters, gearboxes, motors, et cetera. And I think it's a combination of very new approaches to the actual design of the component, as well as leveraging new suppliers as well as working way upfront on the part design itself to get the cost out using the technology roadmap of the supplier. And that's where we're seeing a lot of the progress. Basically, the answer to your question is we radically simplified the vehicle. Like, if you look at the number of parts in the vehicle, it is just a completely order of magnitude change. And when you simplify the components to that level, and you really move the design and supplier design phases earlier, you can integrate a simpler design with a better should-cost. That's the high hard one on the skunkworks team. Look, we've done a lot on manufacturing. We have a whole new kitting strategy for the vehicle. We have a unit casting strategy that massively simplifies the stamping of the vehicle. I think a lot of other companies will do that.

            "content": "Thanks, Jim. In the third quarter, wholesales were flat, while revenue grew by 5% to over $46 billion. That's our 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. And this is supported by our compelling product lineup offering, freedom of choice to both our retail and commercial customers. The quarter benefited from strong truck sales, including hybrids, as well as the launch of the all-new Ford Explorer and Lincoln Aviator. We delivered $2.6 billion in adjusted EBIT, with a margin of 5.5%, up 50 basis points from a year ago. The profit improvement was driven by higher volume and favorable mix, partially offset by expected EV pricing pressures and adverse exchange. Overall, costs were lower in the quarter. I have great confidence in today's business and the changes that are underway. Several years ago, we proactively restructured our global product lineup and tailored it to focus on customer segments we know [best] (ph) and lead in, which has driven consistent top-line growth. We're also slowly but surely improving our industrial system and shedding behaviors that have held us back in the past. And our free cash flow is stronger and more consistent than just a few years ago. All evidence that our Ford+ plan is working. Adjusted free cash flow was $3.2 billion in the quarter and $5.9 billion year-to-date, with cash conversion of 74%, well above our targeted range of 50% to 60%. Our balance sheet remains strong with almost $28 billion in cash and $46 billion in liquidity. We continue to believe that it is prudent to have extra cash on hand during this unprecedented time in this industry and provides us flexibility to invest in accretive growth, execute strategic build partner buy opportunities, and maintain financial flexibility during the next economic cycle. I'm also pleased to announce that we declared our fourth quarter regular dividend of $0.15 per share payable on December 2nd to shareholders of record on November 7th. We target to return 40% to 50% of adjusted free cash flow to shareholders annually, and including today's announcement, have paid out over $10 billion to shareholders since the beginning of 2022. Now, let me turn to our segments. Ford Pro delivered close to $16 billion of revenue in the quarter, up 13%, another quarter of growth. Wholesales were up 9%, aided by the launch of the all-new one-ton Transit Custom in Europe and robust demand for Super Duty and two-ton Transit vans. EBIT of $1.8 billion was up year-over-year with a healthy margin of 11.6%. Ford Pro continues to be our prototype for sticky high-margin, non-cyclical revenue, paid subscriptions, attach rate and monthly ARPU were up in the quarter. Pro's results continue to demonstrate the consistency and resiliency of this higher-margin growth business, underscored by their year-to-date EBIT margin performance of 14.6%, in line with our long-term target. Ford Model e generated a loss of $1.2 billion. We delivered $500 million of year-over-year cost improvement, which was offset by industry pricing pressures. Global wholesales were down 11%, reflecting our focus on yield management and balancing dealer inventory in North America, offset partially by the launch of the all-new Explorer EV in Europe. Our team is focused on delivering further cost reductions, optimizing the Gen-1 market equation, and driving capital efficiencies, helping to improve our profit look -- outlook as we head into 2025. Ford Blue revenue was up 3% in the quarter, while wholesales were down 2%, driven by discontinued low-margin ICE passenger vehicles. Although overall volume was down, North America volume was up 8%, driven by key nameplates like F-150 and Ranger. EBIT of $1.6 billion and margin of 6.2% were both down year-over-year due to adverse exchange and higher manufacturing costs, offset partially by lower warranty expense and higher net pricing. Hybrid sales up 30% in the quarter continue to shine and our global hybrid mix is still on pace to approach 9% by year-end, up over 2 points year-over-year with more products on the way. Ford Credit generated EBT of $544 million, up $186 million year-over-year, driven by an improvement in financing margin and higher receivables. Auction values declined 1%, and lease return rates continue to normalize from historic lows. We continue to originate a high-quality book with US retail and lease FICO scores again exceeding 750 for the quarter. Our exposure to EV residual risk is low, with EVs representing less than 10% of our lease portfolio in the US. So, let's turn to our outlook. When we began the year, we expected full year company-adjusted EBIT of $10 billion to $12 billion. Since then, our product portfolio has exceeded our expectations, delivering favorable market factors, including mix through the first nine months of the year, and we expect this trend to continue in the fourth quarter. This speaks to the strength of our key nameplates and the resilience of our commercial business at Ford Pro. We are also on track to deliver $2 billion of cost efficiencies within our industrial platform, offsetting expected higher labor and product refresh costs for the year. However, two gating factors keep us from a record adjusted EBIT this year, higher-than-expected warranty costs and the impact of inflation at our JV Ford Otosan in Turkey, which increases the material cost of transit vans sold in Europe. While inflationary pressures in Turkey is outside of our control, increased warranty costs are within our control. We now expect full year company-adjusted EBIT of about $10 billion, which includes lower-than-planned volume in the second half for Ford Pro and Ford Blue due to supplier disruptions. In general, we see supply and demand for vehicles in balance. We continue to expect adjusted free cash flow of $7.5 billion to $8.5 billion, with CapEx between $8 billion to $8.5 billion. Our outlook for '24 assumes a flat to slightly higher SAAR in both the US and Europe. Our planning assumptions for the US is 16 million to 16.5 million units. Full year of customer demand for all new Super Duty contributing to better market factors for Ford Pro, lower industry pricing of roughly 2%, driven by higher incentive spending as we exit the year. For Ford, we expect this to be partly offset by top-line growth from the launch of our new products. Our segment outlook anticipates continued strength in Ford Pro. We now expect EBITDA of about $9 billion with an improved market equation, including continued pricing strength on core products. An expected loss of about $5 billion for Model e, which is the positive end of our guidance range, driven by over $1 billion in cost improvements that were partially offset by continued pricing pressure and investments in our new vehicle platforms. And for Ford Blue, we now expect EBIT of $5 billion, reflecting a balanced market equation and higher product, manufacturing and warranty costs, partially offset by cost efficiencies. And lastly, Ford Credit's EBT will be about $1.6 billion, a double-digit growth year-over-year. Our performance this quarter demonstrates a positive progress on our Ford+ plan: capital discipline, the right product portfolio and consistent cash generation to reward our shareholders. We are relentlessly working to make our business better and we remain focused on improving both quality and cost. That wraps up our prepared remarks. We'll use the balance of the time to address your questions. Yeah. So, when you look at it, what we're seeing this year like we saw last year is seasonality in the second [half] (ph). Now there's transparency around the commercial business that we didn't have in the past. And first quarter, we see the peak in the rental business that falls off in second quarter. In fact, this quarter, third quarter, we had basically zero rental business. The other thing we see in the second half is we see the shutdowns that we see at our plants. And as you know, we run these at full capacity. So, we lose those units, and we can't make them up. And that's the seasonality you're seeing, and then you see that show up in the EBIT in the second half. The confidence we have in Ford Pro ongoing is we're continuing to see, as Jim said, strong demand for our Super Duty and Transit, especially the chassis and the wagons. Our pricing has held up pretty strong so far this year. We are seeing some top-line pricing pressure with the '25 model year vehicles as we expected, but we're still continuing to move forward, and it's not something that we're concerned about at this point based on what we're seeing so far with the '25 model years. So, again, the business continues to be strong. And I would tell you that we're really starting to gain traction on our overall process of how we're going to market and we're selling the solution, right? We're selling the vehicle along with the services that come along with that, that's about improving our customers' business and giving them productivity, which helps them improve their profits. So, all of that's coming together and it's leading to a continued strength in Ford Pro. No, I just think that we're going to continue to focus on cost improvements in the current generation and the future generation, and that's -- have being in the marketplace as long as we have, that's really helped frame up the mandate we have for the California team around cost to be competitive. And what it's all going to hinge on is, as you said, Jim, that top-line pricing pressure. Yeah, John, I wish I could answer that with certainty. We are seeing the leading indicators, the physicals. We're seeing improvement there, especially around our three months in service. '24 model year is over 30% better than what we saw in '21 and '22. As Jim mentioned, our launch spikes basically on Explorer and Cougar, we did see one. So, those are good indicators that things are going to get better from an overall quality standpoint. Now, it's going to take time for that to flow through from a warranty standpoint. What I can't tell you is, I don't and can't read, and we're doing the best we can on this, I know it's not satisfactory for you guys is the FSAs and the older models, where what could potentially hit us. And we're out looking at all the data we can. We're looking at everything to try to get out in front of any of those. And we're working to increase on our current models, everything we can do to fix things through OTAs, get the repairs out there as fast as possible, cut off any issues that are in the plants. So, I think we're doing all the right things from a physical standpoint. I just can't tell you when that curve is going to bend for sure and how that's going to start flowing through from a cost standpoint. And we're doing everything we can to figure that out and get there and understand the transparency and clarity around that. Yeah. So, this year, top-line both pricing and volume were a tailwind for us relative to what we had thought. The industry is down 2%. We are seeing increasing pressures as we come through the end of the quarter into Q4 from a top-line standpoint. Your guess is as good as mine, John, as what's going to happen and how deep some of our competitors are going to go that have an issue with inventories. Yeah, our inventories were higher, but we also gained share in the quarter and our sales pace increased. So, we think we've got a plan to manage our inventories. We've got a plan to get back to within the run rate of what we expect. We do have some launches in Q1, so we will carry some higher inventory for those vehicles through the end of the year, but next year, we plan to get back to that 50 to 60 days run rate, for sure. As we move into 2025, there's a lot of water that needs to flow under the bridge still between now and the end of the year. One of the things we're looking at is the consumers in Europe, it seems that they're pulling back a bit and spending less. So, we've got to watch that. And I think many of you guys have written about the fact that, are we heading into cyclical pricing headwinds? And is that going to show up in 2025? As you said, we've all been pleasantly surprised as how it's held up so far, but I want to see how we run through this quarter, how the year-end is coming along, how sales are at the end of the year before I can give you any call on what we think is going to happen with pricing next year. Yeah. Adam, I'll start with that and then I think Jim will cover the rest of your question. So, we are profitable in China in and of itself in China. Jim mentioned $600 million of total profits, and that includes our exports, primarily to the rest of Asia and South America. So, going asset-light has allowed us to stay profitable within China. And then, the export strategy, primarily from our JV, our JMC, and exporting those vehicles to the rest of Asia as well as South America is driving significant profit in Ford Blue. Yeah. I think, Adam, when you look at it, you've got to look at it on the full year versus where we're guiding down now relative to what we had in Q2, right? And when we guided Q2, we had the headwinds hit us quite hard from a warranty standpoint and we are seeing inflationary costs in Turkey. So, if you just step back on the full year, what's gating us from hitting the record profits is the fact that we have those headwinds that are offsetting the positives we had from a top-line we just talked about, volumes and mix and pricing stronger than we expected. Now, coming out of the second quarter, what we've seen since then, which is gating us now to the lower end of our range is that we're seeing, in particularly, in Blue, we're missing some volume and we're seeing some mix headwinds due to some constraints we have with suppliers. And it's hitting our most profitable, highest-profitable mix vehicles. Some of that is, we lost some production due to the hurricane, but we also have some issues with a certain supplier on their productivity that we're trying to work through. We believe we'll be through that by the end of the quarter, but that is hitting Ford Blue and that's what's pulling Ford Blue down now from a standpoint versus what we guided at Q2. Does that explain -- does that cover it? Right. So, we talk about this every quarter, as you would expect. And we're consistent in that we're going to pay out 40% to 50% of our free cash flow. And we do think it's prudent at this point in time to hang on to the incremental cash. We have $28 billion and $8 billion higher than our stated cash minimum that we need is $20 billion. And I think at this point in time, where we're at in the industry, where we're at in the overall economic cycle, the uncertainty around the globe, right now, it's the right thing to hang on to cash. And I'm not saying there's going to be something that happens in the global economy, I'm not saying there's going to be some disruption, but were that to happen, we would be very pleased having this cash in hand. So, we look at it every quarter. We understand that if we don't have a use for the cash or if the environment doesn't change and we see that the risks that might be facing us diminish significantly, then we have to make sure that we handle that cash appropriately and either invest it for an accretive growth or pay it back to the shareholders. And we will look at that every quarter and we will adjust appropriately. Yeah. And we -- of course, we look at both prospective and as well, what we're going to pay out for the year. So, we set the strategy around that payout ratio, 40% to 50%. And we thought -- we think that's a good point to be at right now. And we do look prospectively as to where we see the environment changing, what's in front of us, where the outlook could potentially be the risks, the potential headwinds, potential tailwinds, et cetera. So, we do do that. It's just that at this point in time, we don't have anything to announce. But we're always evaluating it and we're always looking at it. We have the conversation every quarter as you would expect. And once we feel that it's the right time, then we will make a prospective change, a change based on a prospective outlook. Yes. Yeah. So, on the efficiencies that we've brought through this year so far, most of it is through the first three quarters. So, we do have some savings to come through in Q4, but most of it was through the first three quarters. And you would expect that, right, Emmanuel, because there was a large part of that was on the design changes that we made with the launch of the model year. So, most of that's come through. So, as you know as well as anybody and you had identified this morning in your note, we have a tremendous opportunity given our cost competitiveness relative to competition. The question is the rate and flow and how we bend that curve and pull that cost out. It is our number one opportunity to unlock the potential of our Ford+ strategy. We understand that. And we're not going to give any numbers on '25 at this standpoint right now, right? We're in our planning cycle. There's a lot of water, as I said earlier, to flow under the bridge before the end of the year. We'll give that guidance, and we'll give you an update in Q4 earnings for '25 and what we're going after in cost -- on cost from that perspective. But there's a tremendous -- you know this as well as all of you know this that our cost -- our position from a cost competitive standpoint, we have a lot of opportunity there and we understand that and we're aggressively going after it. Yeah. So Dan, I think we're in a different position today versus where we were 18 months ago about really understanding the root cause issue of that and what it's going to take to make the changes to get that cost out of the system. And that's been a very fundamental change for us as a leadership team, honestly. Our cost gap versus competition versus then has not closed. That's not to say that we haven't taken cost out, we have. We've taken cost out, but we're not doing it at a pace faster than our competition. So, we go through every quarter, and we update the analysis, we pull apart the financial statements when we get the Qs and at the end of the year with K, we look at the progress we've made versus the progress that our competitors have made. And it largely sits, we've made more progress on material costs, but we've gone backwards on warranty cost. We've made some progress on our structural costs [ASP] (ph), SG&A relative to competition, but other areas have offset that. We've had more inflationary costs because of our joint venture in Turkey with what they've seen with that business. So, it's still a very strong business. It's still the lowest-cost business. We've just seen this increase this year that we weren't planning for. So, we need to move faster, bottom line, and warranty needs to be a big part of that. We need to continue to make the progress on material cost, our manufacturing costs, overall structural costs, as well as driving down the warranty cost. So, it's a humbling position to be in is that, as you said, 18 months later, we haven't closed the gap. Despite taking cost out, our competitors are doing the same thing. They're taking cost out. We need to accelerate our pace to outrun what our competitors are doing."

At this time, I would like to welcome you to the Ford Motor Company Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Lynn Antipas Tyson, Executive Director of Investor Relations.\nLynn Antipas Tyson: Thank you, Gary. Welcome to Ford Motor Company's second quarter 2024 earnings call. With me today are Jim Farley, President and CEO; and John Lawler, Vice Chair and Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us for Q&A is Cathy O'Callaghan, CEO of Ford Credit. Today's discussion includes some non-GAAP references. These are reconciled to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures in the appendix of our earnings deck, and you can find the deck along with the rest of our earnings materials and other important content at shareholder.ford.com. Our discussion also includes forward-looking statements about our expectations. Actual results may differ from those stated. The most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ are included on page 20. Unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year-over-year. Company EBIT, EPS, and free cash flow on an adjusted basis. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jim.\nJim Farley: Thanks, Lynn. And thanks for joining us. First, I wanted to thank our global team. Remaking Ford into a high-margin, high-growth, more capital-efficient and a more durable business is really hard work. It requires focus, collaboration and excellence. And I also want to thank our investors. We're committed to creating value consistently over the long-term, and we appreciate your support and input. Execution against our Ford+ plan allows us to break free from the low-margin, capital-intensive and cyclical attributes that have constrained auto -- legacy auto valuations for a long time. And this process does not happen in a straight line. We are absolutely a different company than we were three years ago. And our pace of change is intensifying. The creation of Ford Pro, Blue, and Model e have been a huge catalyst for transparency, accountability and more rigorous capital allocation. Our Ford Pro business is amazing. It's a high-margin business tracking towards $70 billion in revenue this year with further opportunities for profitable growth outside of vehicle sales, parts and service and software. And a good example of that is a recent decision by our team to add 100,000 units of capacity of Super Duty in Canada. It not only serves our customers, but it's capital-efficient and has very high returns for many years to come. As you know, we flipped our international operations many years ago from deep losses to now profits and positive cash flow with more opportunities ahead, and that includes China. We also took our product portfolio from too many generic vehicles and infused it with passion and purpose. We build out our iconic F-Series and Transit lines, as well as passion vehicles like Mustang and the new Bronco lineup, and sub-brands like Raptor and Tremor and Dark Horse. Few OEMs can offer a customer choice like Ford at our scale. Ford is number one in our home market for internal combustion. We're number two in EVs and have been for 2.5 years. And we are the number three hybrid brand in the U.S. But what's less visible, but incredibly important for investors is the foundational work underway in the company to move to software-defined vehicles and breakthrough digital experiences. And I'll talk about that later, but this will have significant operating leverage. Ford+ is on track. Today we reaffirmed our adjusted EBIT guidance for the whole year and raised our outlook for adjusted free cash flow. I'm going to comment on our EV landscape and strategy, software technology and services that are growing importance at Ford, our Ford Pro business and quality. On electrification, we've been very vocal about why electric vehicles are so important and a great choice for customers and businesses. Customers' usage data and cost of ownership data would indicate about 50% of customers who buy automobiles would be better served on buying an electric vehicle. Now there's a lot of misconceptions around EVs on the separate areas of costs like resale value and insurance, of course range and charging and battery life, and OEMs like Ford must do a much better job in educating our customers about the advantages that EV offers in terms of cost of ownership. As you know, we are the number two EV brand in the U.S. for over 2.5 years. That's a long time, and we've learned a lot and now we have used those learnings to sharpen our strategy. What we learned is that it's incredibly important to be transparent about Model e losses. Inside the company as well forces this forced accountability, and the result is our team is getting much more strappy and resourceful in terms of turning the business around. We are now more disciplined and have to be for capital and expense. And this means we will not launch vehicles at a loss that are not good for our business knowing what we know now about the reality of the market equation. And we clearly see China and Tesla as the cost benchmark. We also see excess capacity that will lead to more pricing pressures, which is in our business plan, more consolidation and many, many more partnerships. We see less vertical integration in some areas to relieve capital, and we see a lot of tough choices on footprint. Early majority customers are really different than the early adopters, particularly in retail. And we see a lot more openness to hybrids and extended-range electric vehicles we call E-REVs. We also see a divergence on electrification adoption between commercial and retail. Commercial customers focus on total cost of ownership. They use the vehicles much more intensely and they do not overbuy batteries that retail customers do. They're also investing in our Pro charging depots and our integrated software because they want to be smart about the cost of charging their vehicles. And I'm happy to say that our EV Pro contribution margin for our EV vans is now already positive. We also have learned a lot about the size of the vehicle. We believe smaller, more affordable vehicles are the way to go for EV in volume. Why? Because the math is completely different than ICE. In ICE, the business we've been in for 120 years, the bigger the vehicle, the higher the margin. But it's exactly the opposite for EVs; the larger the vehicle, the bigger the battery, the more pressure on margin because customers will not pay a premium for those larger batteries. And lastly, compliance. There is a lot of pressure on compliance. And the lower demand for EVs, especially the pricing, means that CO2 credits are now likely going to be needed for fleet flexibility and optionality and will be a critical strategy choice for any company. What are the success criteria's for EVs in the future? Well, the first one is to have the right mix of fully and partially electric solutions. This is imperative. You have to have a compelling product roadmap and you have to have very flexible manufacturing. A good example is our hybrid business. The global hybrid portfolio at Ford is on track to grow 40% this year across nine nameplates. And we really bet on hybrid trucks. In the first half of the year, our hybrid pickups, Maverick and F-150, grew more than three times the rate of the overall hybrid segment. Our F-150 hybrid with Pro Power onboard is a game-changer for our customers. Commercial customers have power on the run like job sites, and our retail customers have emergency power backup. And boy, have we seen that in Texas and all the other extreme weather events, how important that is for our customers. The second success factor is matching the cost of the Chinese OEMs and Tesla, especially on affordable EVs. Now when people hear about affordability and they think about small and unaffordable, I'd like to address that now. We are designing a super-efficient platform, leveraging innovation across our product development, supply chain and manufacturing teams. With no engine or drivetrain, a smaller vehicle can have a much roomier package, actually the interior package of a class above, with a small silhouette. That's a big advantage for customers versus ICE. And we're focusing on very differentiated vehicles priced under $40,000 or even $30,000. And we're going to focus on two segments: work and adventure. And why does this matter? Well, the use case for smaller vehicles, affordable vehicles means shorter trips, more urban locations. It fits the duty cycle of an EV. And affordability, well, smaller batteries have an outsized impact on the cost and margin of the vehicle. And the consumer tax credit in the U.S. become a much larger part of the sticker price of the vehicle and that is supercharging the lower cost of ownership that EVs have already without it. And finally, we have the ability to leverage this platform across many top hats, which will drive scale and large installed base for our growing software business. And the last success criteria is to be really careful about your larger EVs. For us, they'll be part of the picture, but success requires even more breakthrough on a cost efficiency, much smarter choices on segments, in our case, work and commercial, a lot of partnerships and a lot of technology pathways. Overall, the EV journey has been humbling, but it has forced us to get even more fit as a company, including applying it to our ICE business, and that will pay off long run -- in the long run. I am so happy we scaled 2.5 years ago, and we have the option to incorporate those learnings into our next generation of EVs launching in the coming years. I want to double-click on the software technology and services business. Ford, alongside Rivian and Tesla, are really the only non-Chinese OEMs controlling software across all the vehicle domain. Most companies are doing OTAs on vehicle entertainment. Ford now has multi-year experience on updating powertrains, braking, the fundamental performance of the vehicle and connectivity. And the breadth of our portfolio, including F-150 and our Pro business, the customer use case is clearly much more complicated than Rivian and Tesla. Our vehicles are increasingly general-purpose computers capable of delivering the type of application environment, AI for our customers and user experiences that we expect from all of our digital devices. And this allows us to create powerful, connected, ever-improving customized experiences, which I'll talk about. Many of you may be surprised that Ford leads on OTAs. According to the 2024 OEM OTA capability rankings in North America, we are the leader based on quality of our updates. This is not how many updates we do, although we do a lot. It's about the ability to improve the fundamental performance and capability of the entire vehicle and all the modules in the vehicle. And there's no better evidence than Mach-E. Longer range, better efficiency on the battery, faster zero to 60 times, better BlueCruise performance, we've done it all with Mach-E for many years now. Our vision is not just a powerful computer on wheels. It's actually a robot. We will link with these digital experiences. Things that only a vehicle can really do, like safety and security, and the other innovative use cases we shared with you at Capital Markets Day. These experiences that will drive higher profitability, accretive revenue and are the reasons for customers to actually stay with Ford and Lincoln, lower marketing costs, are now becoming clear to us. One example on the retail side on the technology is our first implementation of the Phoenix system, we called the Lincoln Digital experience with our new panorama display in our new Nautilus. This experience is really a differentiator in the luxury space with Google Maps and Google Assistant and enhanced carplay. Our sales have surged for Nautilus 48%. We now have much younger customers. And the biggest application for this technology is BlueCruise and ADAS. It's a leading hands-free driving technology in America, we believe. We now have 415,000 enabled vehicles on the road. That's a 25% increase in one quarter. We have 213 million miles, three-million-plus miles of hands-free driving now since launch. To better dimension our progress of software technology and services; in the quarter alone, total company paid subscriptions grew 40% to over 765,000 paid subscriptions. Our integrated service revenue is now on track for double-digit growth this year. We are targeting $1 billion of revenue next year for our software. This revenue has gross margins of 50-plus-percent, which drives significant operating leverage and improved capital efficiency. Now the major part of this new software business is actually Ford Pro, so let me touch on that. The foundation of Pro is really simple. It's our vehicles. A robust and fresh lineup, the freshest we've ever had at Ford of ICE, hybrid and EVs, including the all-new Super Duty, the all-new Ranger globally, the all-new F-150 that has just finished its launch, the all-new custom Transit in Europe, and our two small vans in Europe, the new Transit Connect and Courier, and the new extended-range two-ton electric Transit we sell in both Europe and North America. Now what these brand -- these brands and vehicles are seeing is resilient revenue streams based on a much longer tail spending on the infrastructure by government and private enterprise. We also have a very robust and diverse customer range. We dominate in small business and medium business with tradesmen, but we have very large customers. We have state, local and national governments. And we have rental, which by the way, is very profitable for Pro. In fact, in the U.S., one out of four of these fleets, mom-and-pop tradesmen, all the way to large companies, one out of four of those fleets are U.S. -- in the U.S. are Ford only. But the big opportunity for Pro is beyond vehicles and that's where we're focusing. With Pro Power Intelligence, we have a highly differentiated telematics offering. We offer real-time driver coaching, which provides significant improvements for driver safety and now is available in about half of our modem-enabled Pro vehicles. This includes features like seatbelt and speed monitoring and harsh braking notification. Pro Intelligence is also a platform for vehicle controls. Our first foray, it's a big deal, is Fleet Start Inhibit, which protects our Pro vehicles from theft and also unauthorized use. We will expand these vehicle controls to speed control and acceleration limits in the near term. Now, no third-party telematics solution can offer this functionality because it's related to the vehicle. We call it uncrossable moat for our software business. Over four billion miles have now been traveled in the first half of this year on vehicles equipped with Pro telematics, insights and controls. And our paid subscriptions for Ford Pro Intelligence grew 35% year-over-year, now including 610,000 paid subscriptions with a triple-digit growth in telematics fleet management and charging depot software. Turning to physical service, which is the second big non-vehicle revenue and profit for us at Pro, we have a massive opportunity to grow physical services of parts. In the first half of this year, Ford Pro was only 24% of our after-sales revenue. It's a huge upside. Bank of America estimated the profit pool for maintenance, repair and parts, physical repair of the vehicle that escape our dealer network is about $135 billion. That's 2.5 times the profit dealers capture through vehicle sales and financing. This is a huge untapped TAM. Ford Pro already has the largest physical and mobile service network in North America, but for specialized commercial service, many of which is open 24/7 for our customers with specialty technicians. And we continue to expand that physical network to a competitive advantage by adding Pro Elite centers and mobile service units. We are on track this year to reach 27,000 commercial service base by the end of this year. That is up 20% year-over-year. Growth will be led by Elite base, the largest and most capable of the service base for Pro, which will more than quadruple this year to 1,300. We are now on track to increase our mobile service units by 45% to 2,500 service trucks and vans. That's 10% of our entire physical network. Mobile service network is incredibly important competitively. None of our competitors offer this kind of scale. We address many repairs, limiting our downtime for our customers. We service multi-make fleets, which helps us with our share garage unlike our competitors. And global mobile repair orders that generated from this fleet is up 115% in the quarter. Our focus on software and physical service expands the moat for Pro, while helping our customers improve productivity and grow their business. Pro is on track for software and physical services to contribute 20% of our EBIT by 2026. On quality, we're making progress with our latest vehicles. Ford jumped 14 points in the latest J.D. Power's 2024 U.S. Initial Quality survey. We went from 23rd in the industry to ninth. Bronco Sport is now named the best small utility in initial quality, outperforming 18 competitors. Our launch in initial quality are leading indicators for warranty in the future and we expect to see benefits in the future. We did see warranty cost increase in 2Q, of course, tied to new technologies, FSAs and inflationary pressures for the cost of repair. We expect technology-related warranty costs to now normalize, as technology matures and we deploy that great OTA capability to address known issues. We are confident we are on the right trajectory with a very clear and non-negotiable mission at Ford to deliver best-in-class quality. I'll close with this. The remaking of Ford is not without growing pains, but is unlocking opportunity to serve our customers in growing ways we never thought possible. My confidence comes from the fact that we have built a world-class team, and we are executing a compelling strategy. No other company has Ford Pro. We intend to fully press that advantage. No company has a more compelling product lineup with an attractive mix of ICE and partially and fully electric options for both work and retail customers. We also know we have a lot to prove. We look forward to proving our EV strategy out. That has become more realistic and sharpened by the tough environment. Thankfully, we scaled years ago. We are confident we can reduce the losses and sustain a profitable business in the future with everything we've known. We look forward to proving that we can be profitable on smaller vehicles as well, not just on EVs, but across all of our powertrain choices. It's time to prove our recent quality gains are repeatable and will flow to the bottom line. Plenty of work ahead, but the direction is crystal clear to us. We are building a high-growth, high-margin, more capital-efficient and more durable Ford. John?\nJohn Lawler: Thanks, Jim. And I want to thank the entire Ford team for their hard work and continued focus on executing our Ford+ strategy. And more importantly, we are working aggressively to remake Ford into a higher-growth, higher-margin and more durable business, as you said. And frankly, a higher-performing company. Our automotive business is solid and consistently generating strong free cash flow, which is a core ingredient to drive total shareholder returns over time. Now in the quarter, we generated nearly $48 billion in revenue, with growth of 6%. Wholesales were up 2%, as our fresh and compelling product line gave our retail and commercial customers unmatched freedom of choice. The quarter benefited from record Transit wholesales, as well as the completion of our all-new F-150 launch, including drawdown of the inventory we had held at the end of the first quarter. We delivered $2.8 billion in adjusted EBIT, with a margin of 5.8%, as higher costs were partially offset by the continued strength in Pro. Costs were up year-over-year, primarily reflecting an increase in warranty reserves, higher new product-related material costs and higher manufacturing costs. Now if you take a step back and look at our sequential performance, Q2 saw revenue growth of 12% on a 9% increase in wholesales, driven by higher truck volume and the strength of our product portfolio. Despite this revenue growth, EBIT was flat, reflecting primarily higher warranty and manufacturing costs related to the inventory, which was driven by seasonality and the high-volume launches. We remain on track to deliver $2 billion of material, manufacturing and freight efficiencies over the full year, which will partially offset higher labor and product refresh costs. We are seeing emerging headwinds in warranty and inflationary pressures in Turkey, and we are working to mitigate these costs. Now, I have more confidence in today's business than ever. Our strong global product lineup is differentiated and driving continued top-line growth. And we're slowly but surely improving our industrial system and shedding behaviors that have held us back in the past. We're on track to deliver our full year guidance, and we are generating stronger and more consistent cash flow than just a few years ago, evidence that our Ford+ plan is working. Adjusted free cash flow was $3.2 billion in the quarter and $2.8 billion through the first half, resulting in a cash conversion rate of 51%. Our $1 billion increase to adjusted free cash flow guidance for the year underscores our growing confidence in the business. Our balance sheet remains strong with close to $27 billion in cash and $45 billion in liquidity, providing considerable flexibility in a very dynamic environment. I'm also pleased to announce that we declared our third quarter regular dividend of $0.15 per share payable on September 3d to shareholders of record on August 7th. Now let me spend a few minutes summarizing the financial performance of our customer focus segment and highlight how each of them is driving Ford+ and making our business stronger. Ford Pro delivered a 9% increase in revenue on a 3% increase in wholesales. The segment has consistently delivered year-over-year revenue growth each quarter since we re-segmented our businesses. EBIT was a solid $2.6 billion with a healthy margin of over 15%, reflecting increased Super Duty and Transit volume that are both capacity-constrained along with higher net pricing. Ford Pro is the prototype for sticky high-margin, non-cyclical revenue. Pro's results this quarter continue to demonstrate consistency, predictability and resiliency of this higher-margin growth business. Ford Model e generated a loss of $1.1 billion as continued industry pricing pressures and wholesale decline -- wholesale declines of 23% more than offset lower cost. Our team's intense focus on cost delivered about $400 million in savings to the bottom line in the quarter. Key factors included reductions in material costs, improved battery economics and lower engineering. This builds on the cost reductions we have achieved since the launch of our first-generation products, helping to improve our profit outlook as we head into '25. Ford Blue revenue grew by 7% on a 3% increase in wholesales, led by growth in trucks and strong pricing. Wholesales were impacted by the launch of the Explorer as we ended the quarter with about 21,000 vehicles in inventory for quality checks. EBIT of $1.2 billion and a margin of 4.4% were both down year-over-year, mostly driven by higher warranty. Once again, Blue was profitable in every region. Our hybrid sales, up 34% in the quarter, continue to shine and our global hybrid mix is now approaching 9%, up over 2 points year-over-year with more products on the way. Ford Credit generated EBT of $343 million, down slightly year-over-year. As expected, auction values declined by 9%, and lease return rates continued to normalize from historic lows. Credit losses and insurance losses were also higher, but mostly offset by an improvement in financing margin. We continue to originate a high-quality book with U.S. retail and lease FICO scores again exceeding 750 for the quarter. Our exposure to EV residual risk is low as EVs represent less than 5% of our lease portfolio. So now let me turn to our outlook. As I referenced earlier, we continue to expect full year company adjusted EBIT in the range of $10 billion to $12 billion. In general, we see supply and demand for vehicles in balance. And industry dynamics, including market equations for our four segments, are playing out similar to what we forecast at the beginning of the year. We are increasing our adjusted free cash flow guidance by $1 billion to $7.5 billion to $8.5 billion, supported by strong earnings and lower-than-planned CapEx. We are keeping our CapEx target range of $8 billion to $9 billion and are focused on delivering at the low end. Our outlook for the year assumes a flat to slightly higher SAAR in both the U.S. and Europe. Our planning assumption for the U.S. is 16 million to 16.5 million units. Full year of customer demand for all-new Super Duty contributing to better market factors for Ford Pro. Lower industry pricing of roughly 2%, driven by higher incentive spending as we move through the second half of this year. For Ford, we expect this to be partially offset by top-line growth from the launch of our new products, warranty reserve increases from software, higher repair costs and FSAs. Our segment outlook anticipates continued Ford Pro strength, and we are increasing our EBIT range to $9 billion to $10 billion, reflecting further growth and favorable mix, partially offset by moderated pricing. As expected, losses in the range of $5 billion to $5.5 billion for Model e, driven by continued pricing pressure and investments in new vehicles. And for Ford Blue, we are trimming our EBIT range to $6 billion to $6.5 billion, reflecting a balanced market equation and higher warranty. We expect Blue's profit trajectory to significantly improve in the second half, reflecting higher volume with the F-150, Explorer, and Ranger launches that we've just recently completed, and our recent capacity expansion on Bronco. And we expect Ford Credit's EBT to be about $1.5 billion, double-digit growth year-over-year. Now our performance this quarter demonstrates the positive progress on our Ford+ plan. We're disciplined with capital, and we have the right portfolio of products, and we are delivering consistent cash generation to reward our shareholders. We are relentlessly seeking out new ways to make our business better and remain focused on driving improvements in both quality and cost. So that wraps our prepared remarks. We'll use the balance of time for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nAdam Jonas: Hi, everybody. Jim, you said that Ford is a different company from what it was three years ago, but the stock market really doesn't seem to agree with you at all on that. Stock is down about 10% after hours and around $12 a share. And my team just ran the numbers, Ford ranks 494 out of 500 companies in the S&P on PE. Jim, do you -- my first question is, do you think Ford's stock is good value?\nJim Farley: Yes. Yes, we're -\nAdam Jonas: Then why does your -- then why does your Board refuse to authorize a share buyback? And people on this call, I think they understand the reason, like the family element. But in your opinion, if you're telling me the stock is a good value, and it's like the bottom one-percentile of the S&P, what's the plausible reason why -- do you really think you have better uses of capital than that?\nJim Farley: Yes, we do. And I have to tell you that it's hard for people to understand those possible uses of capital, but we have so many exciting businesses to invest in. And Pro is a great example. I'm not going to get into specifics, Adam, but I think people will understand over time how many exciting opportunities there are at Ford. And I'm not just referring to vehicles, I'm referring to non-vehicle activities. We have 27,000 service base. There's lots of opportunities. And as I said, when you look at Ford Pro, I'll just deep dive on that one, and I'm so glad you asked this question, by the way. So Ford Pro is a very, very high percentage of our company's profit. Just look at the ratio between the overall company's EBIT in Pro and our guidance. And then think about our after-sales business, only 24% of our revenue comes from Pro-related vehicles. And we could spend a lot of time talking about this opportunity, but that's why I highlighted in my comments, there are so many places for us to grow Pro on the physical services. They're like 35% margin, but it's hard stuff, right? It's like bays and technicians and a lot of work. We have very exciting electrical architecture investments that we have to make in our future that will really change our ICE vehicles and their revenue potential. Because that revenue won't be just when we sell the vehicle, it will be over time, which we're seeing with Pro already. So I don't want to belabor the point. I'll just tell you there are plenty of opportunities. Anything else?\nAdam Jonas: Okay. Just a follow-up on Skunkworks.\nJim Farley: Yes.\nAdam Jonas: Your team has made a number of visits to China over the last couple of years, including, I think, just a couple of months back, I believe, you were there. What are you learning from these trips? And specifically, I mean, you mentioned China along with Tesla are the cost benchmark, but do you think Ford can bring to market a low-cost EV profitably without help from your partners in China or is China part of the solution? And if China is part of the solution, then what are you going to do about it?\nJim Farley: Yes, great question and an important question for any OEM as the EV market evolves here. Look, we made the bet on CATL many years ago. It was a very important bet for our company to localize LFP cells in North America happen to be in Michigan. We're two years into that project. That is a signature partnership. CATL is the largest battery maker in the world, and they lead iron phosphate cost and reliability. That is a signature partnership that we launched many years ago that we've been working hard on, and Marshall is on track. Look what Volkswagen is doing with XPeng, and many others who are kind of taking a Chinese low-cost platform and using that. That's not our strategy. Our partnership strategy will be on the component side, going deep into the supply chain for IP that is critical and unique. I'm not going to get into specifics, but CATL is one example, and we're going to learn how to do that at the company. We believe that this is essential know-how for the company because the true fitness test for EV profitability will be on these small vehicles. And we have learned from our experience with Mazda and Kia and many others that we have to have this know-how in the company because it applies across all of our vehicles, not just EVs. And the lowest cost is the most important capability. We believe that many of our competitors will turn to their Chinese either independent companies or partners to basically use their platform globally. We learned a lot, not just from China, but from MEB. We've been scaling MEB. We know the cost of Volkswagen. They're one of the leaders in scale. And what we found in that trip and subsequent trips to China is that we have a very competitive battery with CATL, but many of the Chinese players in the lower-cost have very affordable batteries, but they don't have the most efficient design outside of the battery on the other EV components. And our team, the Skunkworks team, we might as well call it a big team now because it's no longer Skunkworks, we're betting on them as our affordable platform. They have really designed breakthrough EV components with our own design that we think are better and cheaper. And we have a very competitive battery localized with the IRA benefit. And the partnership discussion, I think, will -- we think will largely put out in larger vehicles. We think that's where the partnership -- big partnership opportunity really lies. In the commercial vehicles that I talked about, I'm not -- we have nothing to say right now, but this is -- we -- why is the partnership so important? Because the bigger vehicles have this kind of inverted cost, and the partners allow you to be more capital-efficient and have better returns. And that's why we think that the partnerships on larger vehicles will play out as vibrantly as affordable vehicles.\nOperator: The next question is from Bruno Dossena with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nBruno Dossena: Yes, thank you for taking the questions. I was wondering if you could just contextualize what fundamentally within the organization you think is leading to these persistent warranty issues. And I realize partly it's because it was on a prior industrial system, but just given how frequently the surprise warranty issues keep popping up, how do you have visibility or how can investors really build confidence in an earnings trajectory when, every year the surprise warranty issues keep happening? Thanks.\nJim Farley: Thank you. I think the most important evidence, the J.D. Power's IQS, that's a really big point of evidence for everyone. Our internal data, by the way, had been saying that for quite some time. It's now verified. I think that is clearly cutting the initial quality defects to a fully competitive rate, where we're leading some segments, will clearly bring our warranty down over time. But it take -- as you said, it takes time. You got to launch vehicles, you got to get in the industrial system and make sustainable changes. The other one I would say is as painful it is quarter after quarter to have all these great launches, we do not release them until we're happy with the quality and that we've done all the testing. And it makes our quarters lumpy and it's challenging, but it will reduce warranty over time. When you look at the root causes for these issues, and I can go through the hundreds that we go through, it's very clear that these are issues many of which we could have caught at launch. And that is what's happening now at Ford. We have to go through all these launches to find these, and over time we're confident they come down. The other thing we maybe made it more difficult in a way, but better for the company fitness-wise is we put a lot of new technology in our vehicles. And that new technology is difficult for the dealers to diagnose when customers come in and say something is wrong with my SYNC system. They replace modules unnecessarily, et cetera, and that hits our warranty reserves. What we've found though is that this kind of fixing is different than mechanical fixes, where that OTA capability redirected to these defects can really reduce our cost outlays for the warranty -- against the warranty reserves. And we're working all of those cost curves every day for each of our models. John, anything to add?\nJohn Lawler: Yes. I think that, there's the lag that you're going to have between the quality improving and the warranty run rates improving. And so, the first step, as Jim said, is the quality improving and we're seeing that in the physicals now. And that lags, 12 to 18 months and we should start to see the warranty coming in. On the prior models, majority of what's coming through our FSAs, we're doing things to fix those quicker, get out in front of them, reduce, the impact of them, but we're working that every day. And it's an issue that the team is focused on, and the encouragement is that the quality is improving and that is the most important thing for the future of the business and the longer run rate of the business.\nJim Farley: What we won't do at Ford is reduce our actual cash expense at the expense of our customers. We will fix these problems. We will do the right thing. I don't care if it costs rental cars or whatever. We want to turn these quality issues into positives for our customer experience.\nBruno Dossena: Okay, thank you. So maybe to step back, and I think this touches on Adam's Skunkworks questions, but when you compare Ford now to history, earnings are now significantly higher. But the capital base has expanded such that returns really haven't improved. And this isn't just Ford. This is most Western automakers. The earnings part of the equation is only partly in your control, but the structural costs are. So how are you thinking about the trajectory of structural costs from here, even simply, are they going up or down? And B, given this is a similar dynamic for a lot of automakers, and so many traditional automakers are investing billions in R&D, really trying to achieve the same thing with respect to EVs, make an affordable EV at scale to compete with Tesla and Chinese OEMs, why do you think the legacy OEMs are all doing this by themselves? And why aren't there more partnerships? Thanks.\nJohn Lawler: Well, I would say that you have to think about how you're going to fundamentally change the development process. I think that's the core thing. It's not necessarily just doing it with somebody else. Sure, we're looking to be as capital-efficient as possible, bring partners in -- partnerships in for capital, but you can do that on components and you can do that in other ways as well. And we know and we've done a lot of work understanding what has kept this industry kind of in that penalty box that Adam was talking about, as you mentioned. We're not capital-efficient, we're lower-margin, we don't grow enough and, we're not resilient and it's a very cyclical business, and we're working to change that. We've walked through the areas that we're doing and attacking to improve those key areas. But it's really about the efficiency of the design, and the Skunkworks team is doing something very different. That team is unique for a traditional OEM, the talent on that team. They're doing an agile waterfall systems integrated design process, which no other global OEM has done, a traditional OEM. And we're really working that to be focused on what can happen from a tech standpoint as well. And that vertical integration really helps us drive to those lowest costs. And we're finding that there's ways to be more efficient in many ways than some of the Chinese by incorporating the technology that the team is able to bring forward and leveraging the know-how that they've had from the last products that they've put forward. So I think there's a lot of opportunity for us with that team and the talent and the change in the process that's not only going to show up when we get to our affordable EVs that are going to come from them, but it's also important to understand that if you don't have that transfer function Jim talked about, the entire company isn't going to improve. And by doing it within the company with that team, we have a much higher probability of that transfer function being successful.\nJim Farley: Yes. And I would just emphasize that the ambition at Ford for partnering on EVs is record level high. We're not going to make any announcements in earning call, but this is absolutely a flip-the-script moment for our company. We have done partnerships like Volkswagen. We have learned how successful -- how to be successful with the one-ton Transit that includes an electric vehicle. We really see that opportunity in front of us. But we are not going to partner to the level where we delegate our future and the future fitness for cost competitiveness outside the company. We need -- and if we have a partner, we have to have that transfer function that John mentioned. I would only say that we need as an industry to start focusing equally on the one-time cost investment in the electrical architectures and the transition to digital products. Now the integrated services that we're finding, we have 765,000 paid subscriptions. They were different than our competitors who just basically do it for infotainment. We are basically, you know, productivity on Pro as well as BlueCruise. And to take that to the next level, make that business supercharged, we need to invest heavily in electrical architectures, not just on our EVs, but also in our ICE vehicles and hybrid vehicles. And that will be a one-time investment. And the benefit of that was what I was trying to highlight in my script, which is when the economy turns down, we still have those subscriptions. Our service business, customers turn to that even more in a downturn because they keep their vehicles longer, they have to do more maintenance. These are ways to kind of derisk our exposure to economic cycles. And we have to make OTA, the updated IVI system, the integrated services team, both B2C and B2B, our electrical architectures, these are all basic enablers that go beyond EVs. And the industry is going through that transformation too, and I believe Ford is in advance of others because we have more complicated platforms than Rivian and many -- and Tesla and many of the other OEMs. And because of that, we also have more scale. We have more complexity, but we have more scale. And I think that transition and kind of structural change in the industry is as big as the EV change. We're going to get to $1 billion of revenue, we think, next year on software. I wouldn't have thought of that two, three years ago.\nOperator: The next question is from John Murphy with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJohn Murphy: Good evening, everybody. Just to take it back to more sort of the core of the business. Jim, I just wanted to go through some numbers or kind of your take on the Ontario Super Duty capacity add. I mean, obviously, it's a big step-up in capacity for the Super Duty 100,000 units. It seems like current demand would certainly soak that up or absorb that reasonably easily. But I'm just curious, if you think we might be hitting sort of a peak in this truck, what's your sort of view on the ability to kind of sustain these high levels of demand and sell-through? How should we think about incremental margins on that? Because it seems like a $3 billion investment might have a payback of less than two years and then --\nJim Farley: Correct.\nJohn Murphy: -- spin out a lot of cash real quickly, so it might be a really, really, really good investment. So I was just wondering if you could talk about that and then also what kind of powertrains those trucks will have.\nJim Farley: Yes. Thank you. So powertrain-wise, it will be a diverse powertrain, multi-energy platform. We will -- I'm not going to get into specifics, but you can imagine what we've done with F-150 and Transit Van, we've gone to -- and all of our commercial vehicles, a multi-energy platform. So we will offer customers the choice that we think no other competitor will have. And we're -- we believe we'll be a first-mover, if not the first-mover in multi-energy Super Duty. Look, we saw the $1.2 trillion investment in Infrastructure and the Jobs Act. That is coming home. There's a 5G upgrade that's going now. I think it's close to $300 billion investment. And I think what's -- I'm really glad you asked this question, John, because it's not obvious to people. The real part of our Super Duty business that is -- that has been under constant, supply strains is our chassis business. It's about 25% of our entire Super Duty business, but they are not pickup trucks that people use like what you think in road construction. These are people with bucket trucks doing 5G upgrades, heavy construction. And that is the demand that we have not been able to fill. Ford is -- and I'll give you an example. We dominate ambulance in the U.S. Ambulances tend to use our Super Duty chassis business. The average age of an ambulance in the U.S. is 15 years now. They're all falling apart. We have not been able to service that industry, and now we can with this incremental capacity. And so it's an aged fleet, the chassis business. It's got a ton of investment tails to it still. And we lead in the industry because of our upfitter in the products. And now we're going to take the lead on the multi-energy part. That's kind of the story, and it will be a great payback. And we wouldn't be doing it at Ford unless we thought this was going to -- this demand would last for many, many years to come, John.\nJohn Murphy: Okay. And if I could sneak just one more in, maybe for Cathy, on the used residuals or the residuals at auctions. It seems like although down year-over-year, the last three quarters, they've stabilized and started to improve. And I'm just curious what your outlook is there and it just seems like the supply is going to remain relatively constrained in the used market, the late-model used market. So this might be a good guy, not just for Ford Motor Credit, but for resids and potentially, a lift or support for new vehicle pricing. So just what are your expectations there and what are you seeing in the market, Cathy?\nCathy O'Callaghan: Yes. So we're seeing auction values down about 9% this quarter year-over-year, but up sequentially about 3%. We're expecting auction values to continue to decline in the second half of this year, and we're also expecting our return rates to increase as well in line with that.\nJohn Murphy: Great, thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Dan Levy with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nDan Levy: Hi, good evening. Thank you for taking the questions. I wanted to start first with a question on Pro where we're seeing these continued strong results and really pricing is doing a lot of the strength. So I understand all the bits about, pent-up demand and that's really helping and there's really a thirst for these products, but maybe you can help give us some color on the sustainability of this pricing -- product pricing. And specifically, A, how long is this tale of pent-up demand? B, how much of the pricing is contractual versus, let's call it more spot retail, which would be more subject to the market fluctuations? So any color on the trajectory of pricing in Pro given it's had such a strong run.\nJohn Lawler: Yes. So when you look at Pro, we've been talking about the fact that the demand-supply imbalance has been, great for the top line and it's been running pretty strong, right? No surprise there. We have been forecasting that we expect as we move into the '25 model year that there will be some of the top line coming off. And that's in our guidance. So we understand that over time, that's going to get chipped away at a little bit here and there. But we also believe that there are very underserved segments like chassis that we're going to be able to provide product to, where there'll be more price stability as we move forward. So we don't see prices collapsing. Now when you look at our business, about, I would say, 60% of it or so comes from the fleets, which are negotiated on an annual basis. Those have remained very strong the last couple of years. I've talked about in the past that we'll start to see what the '25 model year contracts look like as we move through the third quarter. Initial indications are continued, demand beyond what we can supply, but we'll work through that and we'll have an update as we come through third quarter. But, we're seeing demand continue both on the typical fleet contracts as well as through the dealers when it comes to the smaller fleet customers, the fleet tail, we call it, where they're buying two or three vehicles at a time. So we're watching this very closely, but so far with '25, early indicators are positive, but we need to really move through that process much deeper before we can say where '25 is going to fall out.\nJim Farley: I wish there were car wars for commercial. Because if there was, we would see the product freshness at Ford be an outstanding situation for us. So aside from kind of the industry backdrop of the industry pricing and the demand, I think one of the most important decisions we made several years ago is to go full in on Pro. So we invested in a one-ton Transit, which is our profit machine in Europe. We invested in new Ranger globally. We invested in a brand-new Super Duty, including chassis, including multi-energy. We invested in new F-150. And we have all these new electric Transit, two-ton Transits. That was very intentional. We did it several years ago and now that will pay off, I believe, as we look into these multi-year contracts. And I -- for Ford at least, it's very important to understand how outsized the freshness of our lineup is at Pro. It's -- I've been here 16 years. I've never seen all of our core products updated within a 12-month period like this.\nDan Levy: Great, thank you. That's helpful. As a follow-up, Jim, I'm wondering if you could just address the electrification strategy in light of the November presidential elections. We know, obviously, there's one candidate who's talked about pulling back on the EV mandate, and there could be some implications on IRA or the federal or California mandates. I appreciate you've talked about, the need to have flexibility, and I think you even referenced earlier on the call, that credits will play a role, but maybe you could give us a sense of, where the strategy is. Is your strategy one that's more existential that - and clearly with Skunkworks, it seems to indicate that it is, versus a strategy that is maybe one that's just more meant to reach compliance with a long-term -- longer-term goal in mind, but maybe you can give us a sense of how the strategy might change, if at all, depending on the outcome of the elections.\nJim Farley: Yes, thank you. Obviously, Ford has had a lot of history -- a lot of experience and wisdom after 120 years of elections. And I would say think about our strategy this way. We believe that the fitness of the Chinese in EVs will eventually wash over our entire industry in all regions. And so we believe as a company, even if there were short-term adjustments we can make to a compliance-led, lower requirement lineup, we're not going to approach it that way. We really believe what I said, which is that many Americans would find an electric vehicle lowering their cost, not everyone, but a high percent. And we believe that to be fully fit globally, whether it's our Ranger business, our commercial business, anything really, we have to find a way inside the company to be fully fit with lots of partnerships on the supply chain side. And so this is a kind of enduring strategy at the company. It is not a strategy where we handicap the presidential election for the next one and the next one and see what we can get away with the EPA. That is not how we run Ford because Ford has -- Ford didn't go bankrupt. We have been enduring. And the only way we believe to be enduring is to make money on small EVs and commercial. And that's our bet. You'll see it play out in coming years. It's a big adjustment from our Gen 1 products. I'm glad, as I said, we scaled 2.5 years ago because we could learn about the reality of the market equation, which is just requiring us to be more fit and move faster. The EPA could certainly change, but it would take, as John said, several years for -- through legislation and lawsuits for that to change. So even from a compliance standpoint, we can't really count on administrations changing this way or that way. I've been to the Hill many times in the last month, talking to many Republican leaders of the country, and I always say the same thing to them. Please realize that there's a subset of customers that absolutely would save money, and they're also, absolutely, a group of customers who like partial electrification. And Ford's strategy is choice, manufacturing flexibility and choice. We are not going to bet student body left on this or right. We are going to give customers choice. We're going to be flexible manufacturing. That's why we want to be a first-adopter to an E-REV or whatever is next on partial electrification because we want to be first and best at that choice. But on EVs, we need to be fully competitive with BYD, Geely, even our own partner Changan. And the only way for us to have done that is through this small group in California.\nDan Levy: Great, thank you.\nOperator: The final question today is from Ryan Brinkman with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nRyan Brinkman: Hi, Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan. Thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to ask on the warranty performance that led to the higher cost. I remember a similar issue with higher warranty expense back in 2022, which you then tied to, I think, a transmission installed on vehicles some years prior while noting that the quality on vehicles built more recently had improved. So, I know you're prioritizing initial launch quality, including with the F-150, you discussed at length last quarter, but really any color you could share would be helpful such as, whether the higher warranty provision this quarter relates to a discrete issue like in 2022, or maybe you could share what age cohort of vehicles is driving the higher cost this quarter. And then with that new provision, do you think you've got a better handle now on what future costs could be and the provision in future quarters, it could normalize lower as soon as next quarter, or how would you rate the potential for quality performance in older vehicles to maybe surprise negatively again?\nJohn Lawler: Yes, Ryan. I mean that's part of the issue is these are issues that are popping up in the field on these older models. The largest one coming through is on a rear axle bolt for vehicles that were engineered for the 2021 model year was when they were introduced. And if these things come through, at a higher time in service, we're made aware of them, we need to take care of our customers, we go out to fix them. And we have several of those types of things popping up on older models. We got a failed oil pump issue that's popping up on, 2016-launched vehicles. And so it's clear that we had a period of time where the robustness wasn't what it needed to be and that's showing up. And it is hard to predict on some of these units that have been out in the field for quite a while that one of these issues is going to show up, these longer-term durability and quality issues. But we need to work through that. And we do believe that overall, as we improve our near-term quality and that starts to show up in the field, that will allow us to, based on the rules that we have around how we do our accruals, bring down that overall accrual level. So these types of issues if they pop up will have less of an impact overall because our run rate on quality will be improving.\nRyan Brinkman: Okay, thanks. And maybe just a follow-up on how your comments there might relate to what Jim was saying earlier about Ford controlling the software stack from bumper to bumper, from all the over-the-air update capabilities. What do these new capabilities mean for your ability to troubleshoot or prevent warranty issues in the future?\nJohn Lawler: Those are critical because when you look at some of these things, that have been out in the field for a while that have failed, they crossover -- let's say they launched in a '16 model year was the first year it was done. So it was designed and engineered in '13, '14, '15, launched in '16, and it's been out there for quite a few years. With the connected vehicle and having the digital electrical architecture and us controlling the software across all of the operating domains, we will be able to get signals off the vehicle early to tell us whether or not we're having an issue in certain components. And if we understand that early, we can understand the cause of that and then we can go out and minimize, reduce, get out there earlier and reduce the number of vehicles that are impacted and actually either do an over-the-air update, if we can fix it that way, or do a preventative maintenance type program for folks, which will be much cheaper than a field service action recall where you're replacing components and modules, et cetera. So there's a lot of advantages through that connected data that we'll be able to run through warranty -- the warranty system. That's more on the physical side. On the software side, we'll be able to understand, when things are an issue much earlier and we'll be able to fix them through over-the-air updates, which will be a much lower cost as we move forward.\nJim Farley: And during our launches, Kumar and Doug have partnered in a way that hasn't been done at Ford for a while at least, where we are testing vehicles to failure and individual components to failure, which is not our launch standard, but we are now doing that. And we are also looking at the DTC codes off the vehicle, especially powertrain DTCs, and running these vehicles at extremely high mileage, far beyond our standard for launch. And that has caught many, many issues in our industrial system that we've been able to correct before we release the vehicle. It's painful to have all these vehicles over quarter ends, but it's the right thing to do for the company and it is the only way, we believe, in addressing our warranty spend.\nRyan Brinkman: Very helpful, thank you.\nOperator: This concludes the Ford Motor Company's second quarter 2024 earnings conference call.

            "content": "Thanks, Lynn. And thanks for joining us. First, I wanted to thank our global team. Remaking Ford into a high-margin, high-growth, more capital-efficient and a more durable business is really hard work. It requires focus, collaboration and excellence. And I also want to thank our investors. We're committed to creating value consistently over the long-term, and we appreciate your support and input. Execution against our Ford+ plan allows us to break free from the low-margin, capital-intensive and cyclical attributes that have constrained auto -- legacy auto valuations for a long time. And this process does not happen in a straight line. We are absolutely a different company than we were three years ago. And our pace of change is intensifying. The creation of Ford Pro, Blue, and Model e have been a huge catalyst for transparency, accountability and more rigorous capital allocation. Our Ford Pro business is amazing. It's a high-margin business tracking towards $70 billion in revenue this year with further opportunities for profitable growth outside of vehicle sales, parts and service and software. And a good example of that is a recent decision by our team to add 100,000 units of capacity of Super Duty in Canada. It not only serves our customers, but it's capital-efficient and has very high returns for many years to come. As you know, we flipped our international operations many years ago from deep losses to now profits and positive cash flow with more opportunities ahead, and that includes China. We also took our product portfolio from too many generic vehicles and infused it with passion and purpose. We build out our iconic F-Series and Transit lines, as well as passion vehicles like Mustang and the new Bronco lineup, and sub-brands like Raptor and Tremor and Dark Horse. Few OEMs can offer a customer choice like Ford at our scale. Ford is number one in our home market for internal combustion. We're number two in EVs and have been for 2.5 years. And we are the number three hybrid brand in the U.S. But what's less visible, but incredibly important for investors is the foundational work underway in the company to move to software-defined vehicles and breakthrough digital experiences. And I'll talk about that later, but this will have significant operating leverage. Ford+ is on track. Today we reaffirmed our adjusted EBIT guidance for the whole year and raised our outlook for adjusted free cash flow. I'm going to comment on our EV landscape and strategy, software technology and services that are growing importance at Ford, our Ford Pro business and quality. On electrification, we've been very vocal about why electric vehicles are so important and a great choice for customers and businesses. Customers' usage data and cost of ownership data would indicate about 50% of customers who buy automobiles would be better served on buying an electric vehicle. Now there's a lot of misconceptions around EVs on the separate areas of costs like resale value and insurance, of course range and charging and battery life, and OEMs like Ford must do a much better job in educating our customers about the advantages that EV offers in terms of cost of ownership. As you know, we are the number two EV brand in the U.S. for over 2.5 years. That's a long time, and we've learned a lot and now we have used those learnings to sharpen our strategy. What we learned is that it's incredibly important to be transparent about Model e losses. Inside the company as well forces this forced accountability, and the result is our team is getting much more strappy and resourceful in terms of turning the business around. We are now more disciplined and have to be for capital and expense. And this means we will not launch vehicles at a loss that are not good for our business knowing what we know now about the reality of the market equation. And we clearly see China and Tesla as the cost benchmark. We also see excess capacity that will lead to more pricing pressures, which is in our business plan, more consolidation and many, many more partnerships. We see less vertical integration in some areas to relieve capital, and we see a lot of tough choices on footprint. Early majority customers are really different than the early adopters, particularly in retail. And we see a lot more openness to hybrids and extended-range electric vehicles we call E-REVs. We also see a divergence on electrification adoption between commercial and retail. Commercial customers focus on total cost of ownership. They use the vehicles much more intensely and they do not overbuy batteries that retail customers do. They're also investing in our Pro charging depots and our integrated software because they want to be smart about the cost of charging their vehicles. And I'm happy to say that our EV Pro contribution margin for our EV vans is now already positive. We also have learned a lot about the size of the vehicle. We believe smaller, more affordable vehicles are the way to go for EV in volume. Why? Because the math is completely different than ICE. In ICE, the business we've been in for 120 years, the bigger the vehicle, the higher the margin. But it's exactly the opposite for EVs; the larger the vehicle, the bigger the battery, the more pressure on margin because customers will not pay a premium for those larger batteries. And lastly, compliance. There is a lot of pressure on compliance. And the lower demand for EVs, especially the pricing, means that CO2 credits are now likely going to be needed for fleet flexibility and optionality and will be a critical strategy choice for any company. What are the success criteria's for EVs in the future? Well, the first one is to have the right mix of fully and partially electric solutions. This is imperative. You have to have a compelling product roadmap and you have to have very flexible manufacturing. A good example is our hybrid business. The global hybrid portfolio at Ford is on track to grow 40% this year across nine nameplates. And we really bet on hybrid trucks. In the first half of the year, our hybrid pickups, Maverick and F-150, grew more than three times the rate of the overall hybrid segment. Our F-150 hybrid with Pro Power onboard is a game-changer for our customers. Commercial customers have power on the run like job sites, and our retail customers have emergency power backup. And boy, have we seen that in Texas and all the other extreme weather events, how important that is for our customers. The second success factor is matching the cost of the Chinese OEMs and Tesla, especially on affordable EVs. Now when people hear about affordability and they think about small and unaffordable, I'd like to address that now. We are designing a super-efficient platform, leveraging innovation across our product development, supply chain and manufacturing teams. With no engine or drivetrain, a smaller vehicle can have a much roomier package, actually the interior package of a class above, with a small silhouette. That's a big advantage for customers versus ICE. And we're focusing on very differentiated vehicles priced under $40,000 or even $30,000. And we're going to focus on two segments: work and adventure. And why does this matter? Well, the use case for smaller vehicles, affordable vehicles means shorter trips, more urban locations. It fits the duty cycle of an EV. And affordability, well, smaller batteries have an outsized impact on the cost and margin of the vehicle. And the consumer tax credit in the U.S. become a much larger part of the sticker price of the vehicle and that is supercharging the lower cost of ownership that EVs have already without it. And finally, we have the ability to leverage this platform across many top hats, which will drive scale and large installed base for our growing software business. And the last success criteria is to be really careful about your larger EVs. For us, they'll be part of the picture, but success requires even more breakthrough on a cost efficiency, much smarter choices on segments, in our case, work and commercial, a lot of partnerships and a lot of technology pathways. Overall, the EV journey has been humbling, but it has forced us to get even more fit as a company, including applying it to our ICE business, and that will pay off long run -- in the long run. I am so happy we scaled 2.5 years ago, and we have the option to incorporate those learnings into our next generation of EVs launching in the coming years. I want to double-click on the software technology and services business. Ford, alongside Rivian and Tesla, are really the only non-Chinese OEMs controlling software across all the vehicle domain. Most companies are doing OTAs on vehicle entertainment. Ford now has multi-year experience on updating powertrains, braking, the fundamental performance of the vehicle and connectivity. And the breadth of our portfolio, including F-150 and our Pro business, the customer use case is clearly much more complicated than Rivian and Tesla. Our vehicles are increasingly general-purpose computers capable of delivering the type of application environment, AI for our customers and user experiences that we expect from all of our digital devices. And this allows us to create powerful, connected, ever-improving customized experiences, which I'll talk about. Many of you may be surprised that Ford leads on OTAs. According to the 2024 OEM OTA capability rankings in North America, we are the leader based on quality of our updates. This is not how many updates we do, although we do a lot. It's about the ability to improve the fundamental performance and capability of the entire vehicle and all the modules in the vehicle. And there's no better evidence than Mach-E. Longer range, better efficiency on the battery, faster zero to 60 times, better BlueCruise performance, we've done it all with Mach-E for many years now. Our vision is not just a powerful computer on wheels. It's actually a robot. We will link with these digital experiences. Things that only a vehicle can really do, like safety and security, and the other innovative use cases we shared with you at Capital Markets Day. These experiences that will drive higher profitability, accretive revenue and are the reasons for customers to actually stay with Ford and Lincoln, lower marketing costs, are now becoming clear to us. One example on the retail side on the technology is our first implementation of the Phoenix system, we called the Lincoln Digital experience with our new panorama display in our new Nautilus. This experience is really a differentiator in the luxury space with Google Maps and Google Assistant and enhanced carplay. Our sales have surged for Nautilus 48%. We now have much younger customers. And the biggest application for this technology is BlueCruise and ADAS. It's a leading hands-free driving technology in America, we believe. We now have 415,000 enabled vehicles on the road. That's a 25% increase in one quarter. We have 213 million miles, three-million-plus miles of hands-free driving now since launch. To better dimension our progress of software technology and services; in the quarter alone, total company paid subscriptions grew 40% to over 765,000 paid subscriptions. Our integrated service revenue is now on track for double-digit growth this year. We are targeting $1 billion of revenue next year for our software. This revenue has gross margins of 50-plus-percent, which drives significant operating leverage and improved capital efficiency. Now the major part of this new software business is actually Ford Pro, so let me touch on that. The foundation of Pro is really simple. It's our vehicles. A robust and fresh lineup, the freshest we've ever had at Ford of ICE, hybrid and EVs, including the all-new Super Duty, the all-new Ranger globally, the all-new F-150 that has just finished its launch, the all-new custom Transit in Europe, and our two small vans in Europe, the new Transit Connect and Courier, and the new extended-range two-ton electric Transit we sell in both Europe and North America. Now what these brand -- these brands and vehicles are seeing is resilient revenue streams based on a much longer tail spending on the infrastructure by government and private enterprise. We also have a very robust and diverse customer range. We dominate in small business and medium business with tradesmen, but we have very large customers. We have state, local and national governments. And we have rental, which by the way, is very profitable for Pro. In fact, in the U.S., one out of four of these fleets, mom-and-pop tradesmen, all the way to large companies, one out of four of those fleets are U.S. -- in the U.S. are Ford only. But the big opportunity for Pro is beyond vehicles and that's where we're focusing. With Pro Power Intelligence, we have a highly differentiated telematics offering. We offer real-time driver coaching, which provides significant improvements for driver safety and now is available in about half of our modem-enabled Pro vehicles. This includes features like seatbelt and speed monitoring and harsh braking notification. Pro Intelligence is also a platform for vehicle controls. Our first foray, it's a big deal, is Fleet Start Inhibit, which protects our Pro vehicles from theft and also unauthorized use. We will expand these vehicle controls to speed control and acceleration limits in the near term. Now, no third-party telematics solution can offer this functionality because it's related to the vehicle. We call it uncrossable moat for our software business. Over four billion miles have now been traveled in the first half of this year on vehicles equipped with Pro telematics, insights and controls. And our paid subscriptions for Ford Pro Intelligence grew 35% year-over-year, now including 610,000 paid subscriptions with a triple-digit growth in telematics fleet management and charging depot software. Turning to physical service, which is the second big non-vehicle revenue and profit for us at Pro, we have a massive opportunity to grow physical services of parts. In the first half of this year, Ford Pro was only 24% of our after-sales revenue. It's a huge upside. Bank of America estimated the profit pool for maintenance, repair and parts, physical repair of the vehicle that escape our dealer network is about $135 billion. That's 2.5 times the profit dealers capture through vehicle sales and financing. This is a huge untapped TAM. Ford Pro already has the largest physical and mobile service network in North America, but for specialized commercial service, many of which is open 24/7 for our customers with specialty technicians. And we continue to expand that physical network to a competitive advantage by adding Pro Elite centers and mobile service units. We are on track this year to reach 27,000 commercial service base by the end of this year. That is up 20% year-over-year. Growth will be led by Elite base, the largest and most capable of the service base for Pro, which will more than quadruple this year to 1,300. We are now on track to increase our mobile service units by 45% to 2,500 service trucks and vans. That's 10% of our entire physical network. Mobile service network is incredibly important competitively. None of our competitors offer this kind of scale. We address many repairs, limiting our downtime for our customers. We service multi-make fleets, which helps us with our share garage unlike our competitors. And global mobile repair orders that generated from this fleet is up 115% in the quarter. Our focus on software and physical service expands the moat for Pro, while helping our customers improve productivity and grow their business. Pro is on track for software and physical services to contribute 20% of our EBIT by 2026. On quality, we're making progress with our latest vehicles. Ford jumped 14 points in the latest J.D. Power's 2024 U.S. Initial Quality survey. We went from 23rd in the industry to ninth. Bronco Sport is now named the best small utility in initial quality, outperforming 18 competitors. Our launch in initial quality are leading indicators for warranty in the future and we expect to see benefits in the future. We did see warranty cost increase in 2Q, of course, tied to new technologies, FSAs and inflationary pressures for the cost of repair. We expect technology-related warranty costs to now normalize, as technology matures and we deploy that great OTA capability to address known issues. We are confident we are on the right trajectory with a very clear and non-negotiable mission at Ford to deliver best-in-class quality. I'll close with this. The remaking of Ford is not without growing pains, but is unlocking opportunity to serve our customers in growing ways we never thought possible. My confidence comes from the fact that we have built a world-class team, and we are executing a compelling strategy. No other company has Ford Pro. We intend to fully press that advantage. No company has a more compelling product lineup with an attractive mix of ICE and partially and fully electric options for both work and retail customers. We also know we have a lot to prove. We look forward to proving our EV strategy out. That has become more realistic and sharpened by the tough environment. Thankfully, we scaled years ago. We are confident we can reduce the losses and sustain a profitable business in the future with everything we've known. We look forward to proving that we can be profitable on smaller vehicles as well, not just on EVs, but across all of our powertrain choices. It's time to prove our recent quality gains are repeatable and will flow to the bottom line. Plenty of work ahead, but the direction is crystal clear to us. We are building a high-growth, high-margin, more capital-efficient and more durable Ford. John? Yes. Yes, we're - Yes, we do. And I have to tell you that it's hard for people to understand those possible uses of capital, but we have so many exciting businesses to invest in. And Pro is a great example. I'm not going to get into specifics, Adam, but I think people will understand over time how many exciting opportunities there are at Ford. And I'm not just referring to vehicles, I'm referring to non-vehicle activities. We have 27,000 service base. There's lots of opportunities. And as I said, when you look at Ford Pro, I'll just deep dive on that one, and I'm so glad you asked this question, by the way. So Ford Pro is a very, very high percentage of our company's profit. Just look at the ratio between the overall company's EBIT in Pro and our guidance. And then think about our after-sales business, only 24% of our revenue comes from Pro-related vehicles. And we could spend a lot of time talking about this opportunity, but that's why I highlighted in my comments, there are so many places for us to grow Pro on the physical services. They're like 35% margin, but it's hard stuff, right? It's like bays and technicians and a lot of work. We have very exciting electrical architecture investments that we have to make in our future that will really change our ICE vehicles and their revenue potential. Because that revenue won't be just when we sell the vehicle, it will be over time, which we're seeing with Pro already. So I don't want to belabor the point. I'll just tell you there are plenty of opportunities. Anything else? Yes. Yes, great question and an important question for any OEM as the EV market evolves here. Look, we made the bet on CATL many years ago. It was a very important bet for our company to localize LFP cells in North America happen to be in Michigan. We're two years into that project. That is a signature partnership. CATL is the largest battery maker in the world, and they lead iron phosphate cost and reliability. That is a signature partnership that we launched many years ago that we've been working hard on, and Marshall is on track. Look what Volkswagen is doing with XPeng, and many others who are kind of taking a Chinese low-cost platform and using that. That's not our strategy. Our partnership strategy will be on the component side, going deep into the supply chain for IP that is critical and unique. I'm not going to get into specifics, but CATL is one example, and we're going to learn how to do that at the company. We believe that this is essential know-how for the company because the true fitness test for EV profitability will be on these small vehicles. And we have learned from our experience with Mazda and Kia and many others that we have to have this know-how in the company because it applies across all of our vehicles, not just EVs. And the lowest cost is the most important capability. We believe that many of our competitors will turn to their Chinese either independent companies or partners to basically use their platform globally. We learned a lot, not just from China, but from MEB. We've been scaling MEB. We know the cost of Volkswagen. They're one of the leaders in scale. And what we found in that trip and subsequent trips to China is that we have a very competitive battery with CATL, but many of the Chinese players in the lower-cost have very affordable batteries, but they don't have the most efficient design outside of the battery on the other EV components. And our team, the Skunkworks team, we might as well call it a big team now because it's no longer Skunkworks, we're betting on them as our affordable platform. They have really designed breakthrough EV components with our own design that we think are better and cheaper. And we have a very competitive battery localized with the IRA benefit. And the partnership discussion, I think, will -- we think will largely put out in larger vehicles. We think that's where the partnership -- big partnership opportunity really lies. In the commercial vehicles that I talked about, I'm not -- we have nothing to say right now, but this is -- we -- why is the partnership so important? Because the bigger vehicles have this kind of inverted cost, and the partners allow you to be more capital-efficient and have better returns. And that's why we think that the partnerships on larger vehicles will play out as vibrantly as affordable vehicles. Thank you. I think the most important evidence, the J.D. Power's IQS, that's a really big point of evidence for everyone. Our internal data, by the way, had been saying that for quite some time. It's now verified. I think that is clearly cutting the initial quality defects to a fully competitive rate, where we're leading some segments, will clearly bring our warranty down over time. But it take -- as you said, it takes time. You got to launch vehicles, you got to get in the industrial system and make sustainable changes. The other one I would say is as painful it is quarter after quarter to have all these great launches, we do not release them until we're happy with the quality and that we've done all the testing. And it makes our quarters lumpy and it's challenging, but it will reduce warranty over time. When you look at the root causes for these issues, and I can go through the hundreds that we go through, it's very clear that these are issues many of which we could have caught at launch. And that is what's happening now at Ford. We have to go through all these launches to find these, and over time we're confident they come down. The other thing we maybe made it more difficult in a way, but better for the company fitness-wise is we put a lot of new technology in our vehicles. And that new technology is difficult for the dealers to diagnose when customers come in and say something is wrong with my SYNC system. They replace modules unnecessarily, et cetera, and that hits our warranty reserves. What we've found though is that this kind of fixing is different than mechanical fixes, where that OTA capability redirected to these defects can really reduce our cost outlays for the warranty -- against the warranty reserves. And we're working all of those cost curves every day for each of our models. John, anything to add? What we won't do at Ford is reduce our actual cash expense at the expense of our customers. We will fix these problems. We will do the right thing. I don't care if it costs rental cars or whatever. We want to turn these quality issues into positives for our customer experience. Yes. And I would just emphasize that the ambition at Ford for partnering on EVs is record level high. We're not going to make any announcements in earning call, but this is absolutely a flip-the-script moment for our company. We have done partnerships like Volkswagen. We have learned how successful -- how to be successful with the one-ton Transit that includes an electric vehicle. We really see that opportunity in front of us. But we are not going to partner to the level where we delegate our future and the future fitness for cost competitiveness outside the company. We need -- and if we have a partner, we have to have that transfer function that John mentioned. I would only say that we need as an industry to start focusing equally on the one-time cost investment in the electrical architectures and the transition to digital products. Now the integrated services that we're finding, we have 765,000 paid subscriptions. They were different than our competitors who just basically do it for infotainment. We are basically, you know, productivity on Pro as well as BlueCruise. And to take that to the next level, make that business supercharged, we need to invest heavily in electrical architectures, not just on our EVs, but also in our ICE vehicles and hybrid vehicles. And that will be a one-time investment. And the benefit of that was what I was trying to highlight in my script, which is when the economy turns down, we still have those subscriptions. Our service business, customers turn to that even more in a downturn because they keep their vehicles longer, they have to do more maintenance. These are ways to kind of derisk our exposure to economic cycles. And we have to make OTA, the updated IVI system, the integrated services team, both B2C and B2B, our electrical architectures, these are all basic enablers that go beyond EVs. And the industry is going through that transformation too, and I believe Ford is in advance of others because we have more complicated platforms than Rivian and many -- and Tesla and many of the other OEMs. And because of that, we also have more scale. We have more complexity, but we have more scale. And I think that transition and kind of structural change in the industry is as big as the EV change. We're going to get to $1 billion of revenue, we think, next year on software. I wouldn't have thought of that two, three years ago. Correct. Yes. Thank you. So powertrain-wise, it will be a diverse powertrain, multi-energy platform. We will -- I'm not going to get into specifics, but you can imagine what we've done with F-150 and Transit Van, we've gone to -- and all of our commercial vehicles, a multi-energy platform. So we will offer customers the choice that we think no other competitor will have. And we're -- we believe we'll be a first-mover, if not the first-mover in multi-energy Super Duty. Look, we saw the $1.2 trillion investment in Infrastructure and the Jobs Act. That is coming home. There's a 5G upgrade that's going now. I think it's close to $300 billion investment. And I think what's -- I'm really glad you asked this question, John, because it's not obvious to people. The real part of our Super Duty business that is -- that has been under constant, supply strains is our chassis business. It's about 25% of our entire Super Duty business, but they are not pickup trucks that people use like what you think in road construction. These are people with bucket trucks doing 5G upgrades, heavy construction. And that is the demand that we have not been able to fill. Ford is -- and I'll give you an example. We dominate ambulance in the U.S. Ambulances tend to use our Super Duty chassis business. The average age of an ambulance in the U.S. is 15 years now. They're all falling apart. We have not been able to service that industry, and now we can with this incremental capacity. And so it's an aged fleet, the chassis business. It's got a ton of investment tails to it still. And we lead in the industry because of our upfitter in the products. And now we're going to take the lead on the multi-energy part. That's kind of the story, and it will be a great payback. And we wouldn't be doing it at Ford unless we thought this was going to -- this demand would last for many, many years to come, John. I wish there were car wars for commercial. Because if there was, we would see the product freshness at Ford be an outstanding situation for us. So aside from kind of the industry backdrop of the industry pricing and the demand, I think one of the most important decisions we made several years ago is to go full in on Pro. So we invested in a one-ton Transit, which is our profit machine in Europe. We invested in new Ranger globally. We invested in a brand-new Super Duty, including chassis, including multi-energy. We invested in new F-150. And we have all these new electric Transit, two-ton Transits. That was very intentional. We did it several years ago and now that will pay off, I believe, as we look into these multi-year contracts. And I -- for Ford at least, it's very important to understand how outsized the freshness of our lineup is at Pro. It's -- I've been here 16 years. I've never seen all of our core products updated within a 12-month period like this. Yes, thank you. Obviously, Ford has had a lot of history -- a lot of experience and wisdom after 120 years of elections. And I would say think about our strategy this way. We believe that the fitness of the Chinese in EVs will eventually wash over our entire industry in all regions. And so we believe as a company, even if there were short-term adjustments we can make to a compliance-led, lower requirement lineup, we're not going to approach it that way. We really believe what I said, which is that many Americans would find an electric vehicle lowering their cost, not everyone, but a high percent. And we believe that to be fully fit globally, whether it's our Ranger business, our commercial business, anything really, we have to find a way inside the company to be fully fit with lots of partnerships on the supply chain side. And so this is a kind of enduring strategy at the company. It is not a strategy where we handicap the presidential election for the next one and the next one and see what we can get away with the EPA. That is not how we run Ford because Ford has -- Ford didn't go bankrupt. We have been enduring. And the only way we believe to be enduring is to make money on small EVs and commercial. And that's our bet. You'll see it play out in coming years. It's a big adjustment from our Gen 1 products. I'm glad, as I said, we scaled 2.5 years ago because we could learn about the reality of the market equation, which is just requiring us to be more fit and move faster. The EPA could certainly change, but it would take, as John said, several years for -- through legislation and lawsuits for that to change. So even from a compliance standpoint, we can't really count on administrations changing this way or that way. I've been to the Hill many times in the last month, talking to many Republican leaders of the country, and I always say the same thing to them. Please realize that there's a subset of customers that absolutely would save money, and they're also, absolutely, a group of customers who like partial electrification. And Ford's strategy is choice, manufacturing flexibility and choice. We are not going to bet student body left on this or right. We are going to give customers choice. We're going to be flexible manufacturing. That's why we want to be a first-adopter to an E-REV or whatever is next on partial electrification because we want to be first and best at that choice. But on EVs, we need to be fully competitive with BYD, Geely, even our own partner Changan. And the only way for us to have done that is through this small group in California. And during our launches, Kumar and Doug have partnered in a way that hasn't been done at Ford for a while at least, where we are testing vehicles to failure and individual components to failure, which is not our launch standard, but we are now doing that. And we are also looking at the DTC codes off the vehicle, especially powertrain DTCs, and running these vehicles at extremely high mileage, far beyond our standard for launch. And that has caught many, many issues in our industrial system that we've been able to correct before we release the vehicle. It's painful to have all these vehicles over quarter ends, but it's the right thing to do for the company and it is the only way, we believe, in addressing our warranty spend."

            "content": "Thanks, Jim. And I want to thank the entire Ford team for their hard work and continued focus on executing our Ford+ strategy. And more importantly, we are working aggressively to remake Ford into a higher-growth, higher-margin and more durable business, as you said. And frankly, a higher-performing company. Our automotive business is solid and consistently generating strong free cash flow, which is a core ingredient to drive total shareholder returns over time. Now in the quarter, we generated nearly $48 billion in revenue, with growth of 6%. Wholesales were up 2%, as our fresh and compelling product line gave our retail and commercial customers unmatched freedom of choice. The quarter benefited from record Transit wholesales, as well as the completion of our all-new F-150 launch, including drawdown of the inventory we had held at the end of the first quarter. We delivered $2.8 billion in adjusted EBIT, with a margin of 5.8%, as higher costs were partially offset by the continued strength in Pro. Costs were up year-over-year, primarily reflecting an increase in warranty reserves, higher new product-related material costs and higher manufacturing costs. Now if you take a step back and look at our sequential performance, Q2 saw revenue growth of 12% on a 9% increase in wholesales, driven by higher truck volume and the strength of our product portfolio. Despite this revenue growth, EBIT was flat, reflecting primarily higher warranty and manufacturing costs related to the inventory, which was driven by seasonality and the high-volume launches. We remain on track to deliver $2 billion of material, manufacturing and freight efficiencies over the full year, which will partially offset higher labor and product refresh costs. We are seeing emerging headwinds in warranty and inflationary pressures in Turkey, and we are working to mitigate these costs. Now, I have more confidence in today's business than ever. Our strong global product lineup is differentiated and driving continued top-line growth. And we're slowly but surely improving our industrial system and shedding behaviors that have held us back in the past. We're on track to deliver our full year guidance, and we are generating stronger and more consistent cash flow than just a few years ago, evidence that our Ford+ plan is working. Adjusted free cash flow was $3.2 billion in the quarter and $2.8 billion through the first half, resulting in a cash conversion rate of 51%. Our $1 billion increase to adjusted free cash flow guidance for the year underscores our growing confidence in the business. Our balance sheet remains strong with close to $27 billion in cash and $45 billion in liquidity, providing considerable flexibility in a very dynamic environment. I'm also pleased to announce that we declared our third quarter regular dividend of $0.15 per share payable on September 3d to shareholders of record on August 7th. Now let me spend a few minutes summarizing the financial performance of our customer focus segment and highlight how each of them is driving Ford+ and making our business stronger. Ford Pro delivered a 9% increase in revenue on a 3% increase in wholesales. The segment has consistently delivered year-over-year revenue growth each quarter since we re-segmented our businesses. EBIT was a solid $2.6 billion with a healthy margin of over 15%, reflecting increased Super Duty and Transit volume that are both capacity-constrained along with higher net pricing. Ford Pro is the prototype for sticky high-margin, non-cyclical revenue. Pro's results this quarter continue to demonstrate consistency, predictability and resiliency of this higher-margin growth business. Ford Model e generated a loss of $1.1 billion as continued industry pricing pressures and wholesale decline -- wholesale declines of 23% more than offset lower cost. Our team's intense focus on cost delivered about $400 million in savings to the bottom line in the quarter. Key factors included reductions in material costs, improved battery economics and lower engineering. This builds on the cost reductions we have achieved since the launch of our first-generation products, helping to improve our profit outlook as we head into '25. Ford Blue revenue grew by 7% on a 3% increase in wholesales, led by growth in trucks and strong pricing. Wholesales were impacted by the launch of the Explorer as we ended the quarter with about 21,000 vehicles in inventory for quality checks. EBIT of $1.2 billion and a margin of 4.4% were both down year-over-year, mostly driven by higher warranty. Once again, Blue was profitable in every region. Our hybrid sales, up 34% in the quarter, continue to shine and our global hybrid mix is now approaching 9%, up over 2 points year-over-year with more products on the way. Ford Credit generated EBT of $343 million, down slightly year-over-year. As expected, auction values declined by 9%, and lease return rates continued to normalize from historic lows. Credit losses and insurance losses were also higher, but mostly offset by an improvement in financing margin. We continue to originate a high-quality book with U.S. retail and lease FICO scores again exceeding 750 for the quarter. Our exposure to EV residual risk is low as EVs represent less than 5% of our lease portfolio. So now let me turn to our outlook. As I referenced earlier, we continue to expect full year company adjusted EBIT in the range of $10 billion to $12 billion. In general, we see supply and demand for vehicles in balance. And industry dynamics, including market equations for our four segments, are playing out similar to what we forecast at the beginning of the year. We are increasing our adjusted free cash flow guidance by $1 billion to $7.5 billion to $8.5 billion, supported by strong earnings and lower-than-planned CapEx. We are keeping our CapEx target range of $8 billion to $9 billion and are focused on delivering at the low end. Our outlook for the year assumes a flat to slightly higher SAAR in both the U.S. and Europe. Our planning assumption for the U.S. is 16 million to 16.5 million units. Full year of customer demand for all-new Super Duty contributing to better market factors for Ford Pro. Lower industry pricing of roughly 2%, driven by higher incentive spending as we move through the second half of this year. For Ford, we expect this to be partially offset by top-line growth from the launch of our new products, warranty reserve increases from software, higher repair costs and FSAs. Our segment outlook anticipates continued Ford Pro strength, and we are increasing our EBIT range to $9 billion to $10 billion, reflecting further growth and favorable mix, partially offset by moderated pricing. As expected, losses in the range of $5 billion to $5.5 billion for Model e, driven by continued pricing pressure and investments in new vehicles. And for Ford Blue, we are trimming our EBIT range to $6 billion to $6.5 billion, reflecting a balanced market equation and higher warranty. We expect Blue's profit trajectory to significantly improve in the second half, reflecting higher volume with the F-150, Explorer, and Ranger launches that we've just recently completed, and our recent capacity expansion on Bronco. And we expect Ford Credit's EBT to be about $1.5 billion, double-digit growth year-over-year. Now our performance this quarter demonstrates the positive progress on our Ford+ plan. We're disciplined with capital, and we have the right portfolio of products, and we are delivering consistent cash generation to reward our shareholders. We are relentlessly seeking out new ways to make our business better and remain focused on driving improvements in both quality and cost. So that wraps our prepared remarks. We'll use the balance of time for questions. Thank you. Yes. I think that, there's the lag that you're going to have between the quality improving and the warranty run rates improving. And so, the first step, as Jim said, is the quality improving and we're seeing that in the physicals now. And that lags, 12 to 18 months and we should start to see the warranty coming in. On the prior models, majority of what's coming through our FSAs, we're doing things to fix those quicker, get out in front of them, reduce, the impact of them, but we're working that every day. And it's an issue that the team is focused on, and the encouragement is that the quality is improving and that is the most important thing for the future of the business and the longer run rate of the business. Well, I would say that you have to think about how you're going to fundamentally change the development process. I think that's the core thing. It's not necessarily just doing it with somebody else. Sure, we're looking to be as capital-efficient as possible, bring partners in -- partnerships in for capital, but you can do that on components and you can do that in other ways as well. And we know and we've done a lot of work understanding what has kept this industry kind of in that penalty box that Adam was talking about, as you mentioned. We're not capital-efficient, we're lower-margin, we don't grow enough and, we're not resilient and it's a very cyclical business, and we're working to change that. We've walked through the areas that we're doing and attacking to improve those key areas. But it's really about the efficiency of the design, and the Skunkworks team is doing something very different. That team is unique for a traditional OEM, the talent on that team. They're doing an agile waterfall systems integrated design process, which no other global OEM has done, a traditional OEM. And we're really working that to be focused on what can happen from a tech standpoint as well. And that vertical integration really helps us drive to those lowest costs. And we're finding that there's ways to be more efficient in many ways than some of the Chinese by incorporating the technology that the team is able to bring forward and leveraging the know-how that they've had from the last products that they've put forward. So I think there's a lot of opportunity for us with that team and the talent and the change in the process that's not only going to show up when we get to our affordable EVs that are going to come from them, but it's also important to understand that if you don't have that transfer function Jim talked about, the entire company isn't going to improve. And by doing it within the company with that team, we have a much higher probability of that transfer function being successful. Yes. So when you look at Pro, we've been talking about the fact that the demand-supply imbalance has been, great for the top line and it's been running pretty strong, right? No surprise there. We have been forecasting that we expect as we move into the '25 model year that there will be some of the top line coming off. And that's in our guidance. So we understand that over time, that's going to get chipped away at a little bit here and there. But we also believe that there are very underserved segments like chassis that we're going to be able to provide product to, where there'll be more price stability as we move forward. So we don't see prices collapsing. Now when you look at our business, about, I would say, 60% of it or so comes from the fleets, which are negotiated on an annual basis. Those have remained very strong the last couple of years. I've talked about in the past that we'll start to see what the '25 model year contracts look like as we move through the third quarter. Initial indications are continued, demand beyond what we can supply, but we'll work through that and we'll have an update as we come through third quarter. But, we're seeing demand continue both on the typical fleet contracts as well as through the dealers when it comes to the smaller fleet customers, the fleet tail, we call it, where they're buying two or three vehicles at a time. So we're watching this very closely, but so far with '25, early indicators are positive, but we need to really move through that process much deeper before we can say where '25 is going to fall out. Yes, Ryan. I mean that's part of the issue is these are issues that are popping up in the field on these older models. The largest one coming through is on a rear axle bolt for vehicles that were engineered for the 2021 model year was when they were introduced. And if these things come through, at a higher time in service, we're made aware of them, we need to take care of our customers, we go out to fix them. And we have several of those types of things popping up on older models. We got a failed oil pump issue that's popping up on, 2016-launched vehicles. And so it's clear that we had a period of time where the robustness wasn't what it needed to be and that's showing up. And it is hard to predict on some of these units that have been out in the field for quite a while that one of these issues is going to show up, these longer-term durability and quality issues. But we need to work through that. And we do believe that overall, as we improve our near-term quality and that starts to show up in the field, that will allow us to, based on the rules that we have around how we do our accruals, bring down that overall accrual level. So these types of issues if they pop up will have less of an impact overall because our run rate on quality will be improving. Those are critical because when you look at some of these things, that have been out in the field for a while that have failed, they crossover -- let's say they launched in a '16 model year was the first year it was done. So it was designed and engineered in '13, '14, '15, launched in '16, and it's been out there for quite a few years. With the connected vehicle and having the digital electrical architecture and us controlling the software across all of the operating domains, we will be able to get signals off the vehicle early to tell us whether or not we're having an issue in certain components. And if we understand that early, we can understand the cause of that and then we can go out and minimize, reduce, get out there earlier and reduce the number of vehicles that are impacted and actually either do an over-the-air update, if we can fix it that way, or do a preventative maintenance type program for folks, which will be much cheaper than a field service action recall where you're replacing components and modules, et cetera. So there's a lot of advantages through that connected data that we'll be able to run through warranty -- the warranty system. That's more on the physical side. On the software side, we'll be able to understand, when things are an issue much earlier and we'll be able to fix them through over-the-air updates, which will be a much lower cost as we move forward."

And June 11, John Lawler will participate in a fireside chat in New York with Emmanuel Rosner at Deutsche Bank's Auto Summit. Jim?\nJim Farley: Thank you, Lynn. Hi, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The cornerstone of Ford+ is pretty straightforward, a more resilient business model, higher growth, higher margin, and more capital efficiency. And I would say, quarter one had a lot of great green shoots in that plan. It sets us up for a very strong 2024 and beyond. Before John goes through the quarter, I wanted to highlight four key strategic areas, how our growth drivers are changing, our progress in quality, the resilient Ford Pro business, and what we're learning on the electrification journey in quarter one. On growth, the portfolio changes we made and the restructuring we've done in our geographic footprint has really paid off for Ford. Several years ago, we normally would be reducing our volume and our mix and having good news on pricing. What's changed in the last year, and especially in Q1 you could see, is our top line and bottom line profitability are increasing, driven by improved volumes and mix. And we're actually seeing pricing headwinds. And that new portfolio and geographic footprint is really tremendous to see at Ford. There is no better example for this than the portfolio changes we've made in our truck and van business. Ford is the number one best-selling pickup manufacturer in the world. And our Ford Transit Cargo Van is the best-selling in the world. It's now our second best-selling nameplate at Ford. And our midsize Ranger, not our most affordable pickup, is a third best-selling vehicle at Ford. And together with the Everest makes up our profits outside of China, North America, and Europe. It's an incredible new franchise for Ford. These changes in our portfolio at all different sizes and price points in the truck and the van business has really played to Ford's strength. And it doesn't stop there. Our growth drivers are diversifying. We now have a vibrant software business and physical services business led by Ford Pro. You don't need to look very far beyond our mobile services. An example, Ford now has 3,500 or more remote service vehicles in our fleet globally. And last year, we did 2.4 million remote service experiences, both remote service and pickup and delivery. 40% of that was for Pro and 60% was for our retail business. Ford now has more than 700,000 paid subscribers for software. That's up 47% year-over-year. It's capital efficient, and the gross margins are more than 50%. Our quality is making real progress. Kumar and the team have really focused on key areas. Our '23 model year, three months in service, initial quality is 10% better than the previous model year. And we're seeing our current model year that we're selling for several months, another 10% improvement. That should put us in the middle of the pack. And many of our vehicles start to lead their segments in initial quality. But to bend the curve on warranty costs and customer recalls, we're really focusing on our launches. We're past the Super Duty launch now and well into the F-150 launch, and we made a lot of changes to improve and bend that curve. On the F-150 and others, we've delayed the OK2Buy three to six weeks. We've taken a lot of new testing regiments. Actually, we ended the quarter with 60,000 units in our plant stock, which hurt our first quarter but will benefit because we're shipping those now in our second quarter for all those quality processes. And what we're so far seeing is, we avoided about 12 recalls on F-150. And we're seeing the best performance on 3 MIS after a launch in a long time. And I'd like to be specific here. Normally, after a launch, we've seen about -- in the last five years about a 70% spike in our defects. The industry average is about 20%. And the Super Duty and Mustang launches were about that industry average 20% spike. And now, we're seeing with the F-150 even better performance at industry average. And boy, do we have a lot of launches in the second half to prove out this new launch process. What we're going to see long-term is fewer recalls and lower warranty costs because of this new process. I'm really proud of the team's progress on quality. And we have so much more to do. I'd like to talk quickly about Ford Pro. I mean, look at quarter one. We made $3 billion. That's how much we made the whole year in Pro two years ago. We're growing revenues, EBIT, EBIT margin, we're growing our volume. Our attach rates for high margin software and physical services are improving. And when you ask yourself, why is this different? Why would this business -- why would these profits be more resilient than our retail business? It comes down to three things. First is, the diversity of our customer base. About a third of our Pro customers are small business. Another third are large companies and about 20% more is governments, all different kinds. And the diversity of those customers and all three of them are driving a white-hot demand for our vehicles and services right now from infrastructure build out, roadworks, 5G, onshore manufacturing and re-fleeting for our key government fleets. One out of four of those fleets are all Ford, and boy do they trust our company. But more than anything, it's the breath and freshness of our new lineup at Pro that's driving our profitability. We have the freshest lineup we've had in 20 years in Pro. We have an all new Super Duty, an all-new Transit from top to bottom. And we have an all new Ranger and five plus plants around the world. These new products are really attractive to customers. And beyond that, we have the most diverse Class 1 to 7 lineup in North America, our key market. And that adjacency sales are important because customers buy different kinds of vehicles for us in the same fleet. But beyond that, in those fresh nameplates, we offer the best choice. We have cabin chassis and cutaway versions of our vans, different wheel bases and heights, the same on our pickup trucks. And we also have the most choice in terms of upfitters. We have 500 different upfitters across Western Europe and the US that prefer to work with Ford because of our experience with them. And it doesn't stop there. We've designed all of our commercial vehicles with a multi-energy platform. And that allows our customers to choose electric, partial electric, diesel, petrol, whatever choice on powertrain that best meets their cost of ownership. No one has this kind of lineup in our business globally. The third key area is the diversification and the completeness of our software and physical services experiences for our customers. Now, 13% of Ford Pro's profits in the last 12 years make up these attached services. And it's a big change for us. And what's really driving that is our advantage in physical service. We have the largest repair network you can find of any brand out there. And we're widening that gap. We've added 700 commercial service bays in the last year and more than 11 very large service lead centers with between 50 and 200 repair bays that are open 24/7 for our customers. None of our competitors offer this kind of extensive repair network. And it doesn't stop there. We have over 2,000 remote trucks and vans doing remote service for our Pro customers, no brand can match that either. And now we have over 560,000 active software subscriptions for our Pro customers, that's up 40%. And that Pro Intelligence business took many years to build. It requires advanced electric architecture. It's a really hard moat to copy. Long list short, Ford Pro is in for a great performance over the next several years. What did we learn on electric so far? Well, as you know, we're number two in our home market and electric sales for the last couple of years. And boy, we learned a lot. Since Capital Markets last year, we continue to adapt to and evolve our spending and our investment ramp for battery plants and assembly capacity for our EVs to match customers demand. And more importantly than all of that, match the price expectations. We're retiming our launches and our capital spending. In fact, this year we expected to spend about $10 billion as a company. We've now guided $8 billion to $9 billion. We'll probably be on the low end of that range. And we're being very consistent about our discipline on profitability. We expect every one of our EVs to make money in the first 12 months. And that is a very disciplined process. In fact, we delayed the launch of our three-row crossover, which is a great product, two years, not only to match the slower growth in EV, but more importantly, to take advantage of new battery chemistry and formats to substantially reduce the cost of the batteries for that vehicle. We'll do everything it takes to be profitable in the first 12 months of our vehicles. And what's our bet as a company? Well, it's pretty simple. We're going to bet on commercial work vehicles where we do really well, where we know the customers, where we can innovate for them like Pro Power Onboard with partial and fully electric vehicles. But increasingly, our bet will be on our new small, affordable platform developed by our team on the West Coast. Why is affordability so important? Well, when we look at the connected car data from our EV customers, we notice that people live in the suburbs, urban customers, they tend to drive shorter distances, and those more affordable vehicles, more approachable, and we believe that's where the adoption of EV will go the fastest. And we believe we can compete in segments of small cars and vehicles, more affordable vehicles in a unique way that's Ford. A good example was, we learned a lot when we -- in our more expensive vehicles, Mach-E, when in February we dropped the price 17%, our volume went up 141%. That's telling us that the more affordable we can make great product, the more attractive it is to these mainstream EV adopters. And the last thing I'd say is, we're learning about the importance of choice. Our growth in the first quarter in hybrids is a good example. We grew 36%, we think the full year would be 40%, we're now approaching 400,000 units of volume for our hybrid business. And we're now number three in hybrids in the US. It's a big advantage. We've been in the business for more than 20 years. And what's really exciting for us is for the first time, some of our contribution margins on hybrids are above or at similar contribution margins than our pure internal combustion engine margins. With that, I'll turn it over to John.\nJohn Lawler: Okay. Thanks, Jim. So our team around the globe is becoming more focused and adept at applying the Ford+ strategy, and we really did deliver a solid quarter. We are transforming Ford into a higher-growth, higher-margin, more capital-efficient and more resilient business. We're progressively shedding behaviors that have weighed down performance and valuation of legacy auto companies for most of the industry's history. Our strong global product lineup is differentiated, offering customers freedom of powertrain choice and drove first quarter revenue of $43 billion, up 3%. Our revenue has grown in each of the last three years and we expect 2024 to be no different. Wholesales were down 1%, more than explained by the late quarter launch timing of the new F-150. We delivered $2.8 billion in adjusted EBIT with a margin of 6.5%, reflecting continued strength in Ford Pro. Costs were up $1.2 billion, but if you double-click on this, you'll see that $1.1 billion of that was investments in growth by Ford Pro, including new products. Ford Blue and Ford Model e costs were roughly flat, and we're on track to deliver $2 billion of cost efficiencies for the full year. Adjusted free cash flow was a use of $500 million, more than explained by the vehicles in inventory, and this impact will reverse in the second quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong with $25 billion in cash and close to $43 billion in liquidity. And earlier this week, we also completed the renewal of our $18 billion corporate credit facilities, extending maturities by an additional year. Overall, our strong liquidity provides significant flexibility for us to invest in profitable growth. Consistent with our commitment to return 40% to 50% of adjusted free cash flow to shareholders, today, we also declared a regular second quarter dividend of $0.15 per share payable June 3 to shareholders of record on May 8. I'll spend a few minutes summarizing the financial performance of each of our customer-focused segments. And there's evidence in every one of them of how Ford+ is making our business stronger. Ford Pro delivered a 36% increase in revenue on a 21% increase in wholesales. The segment has consistently delivered year-over-year revenue growth each quarter since we re-segmented our business. EBIT more than doubled to $3 billion with a margin of 16.7%, reflecting increased Super Duty and Transit production, richer Super Duty mix and higher net pricing. In addition, over the past 12 months, roughly 13% of Ford Pro's EBIT came from software and physical services, on the glide path to reaching 20% in a few years. And this important revenue stream generates sticky and recurring gross margins in the 40% to 50% range. And as you can see, given the breadth and depth of Ford Pro's competitive moats, investments in growth drive tremendous operating leverage. The segment's results this quarter demonstrate the consistency, predictability, and earnings power of this growth business. Ford Model e generated a loss of $1.3 billion as significant industry pricing pressure more than offset flat costs as wholesales declined 20%. In the quarter, we took action to bring down inventory levels. For example, after being at a price premium to competition in 2023, we lowered pricing on Mustang Mach-E in the US by 17%, bringing us in line with the two-row crossover segment. And as Jim mentioned, we did see elasticity with an improved mix of higher trends. In the US, retail sales jumped 77% versus the total EV segment, which was up roughly 2.6%. Our total EV market share grew by 3.4 points to 7.5%, and Mach-E was the second best-selling e-SUV, only behind Tesla's Model Y. The bottom line is that we're more competitive and doing well in the marketplace. We've reduced our stock levels significantly and the pace of sales has increased. In Ford Blue, revenue, wholesales, and EBIT were down, all impacted by the F-150 production ramp and vehicles and inventory. EBIT margin was 4.2%, and our international operations continue to be profitable across the board. Ford Blue's global product portfolio remains strong and our hybrid sales continued to grow, up 36% in the quarter as we get the benefit of hybrid products planned years ago. Our global mix of hybrid is currently at 7%, up 2 points year-over-year with more products on the way. Additionally, China exports increased 33%, including Lincoln Nautilus, and that's consistent with our strategy to better leverage that asset-light footprint. Ford Credit generated EBT of $326 million. In the quarter, financing margin improved and credit loss performance continued to normalize and remains below our historical average. Importantly, we continued to see a high-quality book based on strong FICO scores, which continue to exceed 750. And as expected, auction values have declined by roughly 10% as lease return rates continued to normalize. So we're beginning to unlock the huge potential for customers and all of our stakeholders with the Freedom of Choice made possible by Ford+. There's plenty of work ahead to fulfill that potential. However, the progress we've made so far is undeniable. We're delivering growth and profitability, sharpening capital efficiency and fortifying the resilience of our business. Accordingly, turning to our outlook, we continue to expect full year company adjusted EBIT of $10 billion to $12 billion and are tracking toward the high end of this range, and that would be a record for Ford. We're raising our adjusted free cash flow guidance to $6.5 billion to $7.5 billion, supported by the underlying strength of the business and lower-than-planned CapEx. Our adjusted free cash flow guidance is consistent with our cash flow conversion target of 50% to 60%. We're tightening our CapEx range to $8 billion to $9 billion as the team adjusts to the dynamic EV landscape. We're scrutinizing every dollar and driving efficiencies that we believe could land us at the lower end of this revised CapEx range. Our outlook for 2024 assumes a flat to slightly higher SAAR in both the US and Europe. Our planning assumption is for the US is 16 million to 16.5 million units. Full year of customer demand for all-new Super Duty contributing to better market factors for Ford Pro. Industry supply demand normalizing. From a planning perspective, we're assuming lower industry pricing of roughly 2%, driven by higher incentive spending as we move through the year. We expect this to be partially offset by top line growth from the launch of our new products. There's no change to our segment outlook, which anticipates continued strength in Ford Pro, leading to EBIT of $8 billion to $9 billion, and that's driven by the continued growth and favorable mix, partially offset by moderated pricing. As expected, a loss in the range of [$5 billion to $5 billion] (ph) for Model e, driven by continued pricing pressure and investments in new vehicles, and for Ford Blue, EBIT of $7 billion to $7.5 billion, reflecting a balanced market equation and also cost efficiencies offsetting higher labor and product costs. And we expect Ford Credit's EBT to be about $1.5 billion, up slightly year-over-year. Our performance this quarter continues to demonstrate the positive momentum of Ford+. Capital discipline is driving the right global footprint, portfolio of products and consistent cash generation. We continue to see growth opportunities and remain focused on delivering improvements in both quality and cost. So that wraps up our prepared remarks, and we'll use the balance of the time to address what's on your mind. So thank you, and operator, please open up the line for questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today is from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nAdam Jonas: Hey, everybody. I got one question for John and one for Jim. John, you were just on Bloomberg saying EVs are needed to meet compliance regulations. Now it's my understanding that Ford does not disclose penalties or ZEV credit purchases for Ford on Clean Air Regulation. Can you confirm that? That's not disclosed, right?\nJohn Lawler: So let me clarify a few things, Adam, on that, is that it's not an option for us not to be compliant. If you don't comply with your ZEV or your greenhouse gas emissions requirements, you can't pay fines. What happens is you can't sell, and that's consistent across the industry. So it\u2019s -- that's for all OEMs. All OEMs are under those rules. And so there's really three levers that we have. We can sell EVs and hybrids, we can sell fewer ICE, or we can contract to buy credits from another OEM. And when we do contract to buy credits, we will disclose that as we did in our 10-K at the end of the year. And so those are the three levers. And we, I would say, monthly, if not weekly, are working to optimize across those three levers to drive the highest profitability and the highest cash flow for the company. So to continue to sell the ICE vehicles, we are going to need to sell EVs, and we're going to optimize across the profitability. Now the most important thing, as Jim said, is we need to get the EV business to stand on its own, to be profitable, and return on the capital we've invested, and then all the levers will be accretive to Ford and we'll be able to make it really positive. So that's what we're focused on, and that's what I intended to communicate earlier today.\nAdam Jonas: Okay. But you did -- so you do disclose? You did disclose the ZEV? What was it?\nJohn Lawler: Yeah, we disclosed last year in the 10-K that we had purchase commitments of $700 million.\nAdam Jonas: And will that increase this year?\nJohn Lawler: In the first quarter, there wasn't anything material. And as we go through the year, if it's the right lever to pull, as I said as we're optimizing, we will report it.\nAdam Jonas: I appreciate that, John. Just my follow-up for Jim. Ford Pro is kicking butt, okay. And at 10 times EBIT, that business can be worth like double Ford's entire market cap. So the market is kind of implying that the rest of the business will be valued at negative many, many tens of billions. Seeing another way, your stock, I mean, this business is incredible. People would die to have this business. And I think folks are aware, it's not a secret anymore, Jim, but people are aware of how good this business is. Yet your stock ranks 491 out of 500 companies in the S&P 500 on PE multiple. Now, Jim, I know you don't like it and I know you don't agree with it, but can you explain why does the market value -- your company is one of the lowest multiple companies in the world in any industry, why? Try to rationalize that for me because it seems important that you, as a leader of this organization, understand that, so you can address that problem. Thanks.\nJim Farley: Thank you, Adam. And first of all, thanks for your report on Pro. I appreciate you taking the time to understand the business. Look, I mean, we -- as John mentioned, we have to make tremendous progress on Model e. It's a huge drag not just on Ford but on our whole industry, even for pure-play EV players. So -- and we're very clear-eyed about that. We're very committed to transparency. A lot of OEMs will handle EVs very different. We won't. It's like if we had an unprofitable regional business and we rolled it up and it wouldn't be transparent to investors, we would never do that. We're not going to do that with EVs, and we're not going to subsidize our Pro and Blue business by not being transparent about e. It's how we run the business. I think investors should understand for me as a leader is that we're going to build a sustainably profitable EV business with terminal value. And we -- and it needs to return the cost of capital on its own and not be subsidized as I mentioned. And the real turning point for us not only is our flat cost in Model e this year, but most importantly, it will be the profitability in our next cycle of products. And I'm proud of the work that our team has done to make the adjustments in our capital spending and to make sure that all of our next EVs are profitable. And the evidence will be there. And I think that is the main drag on the company right now as it will be for the whole industry. Blue is in really good shape. I wonder out loud, Adam, if everyone really understands the resilience of the Pro business over time. We're very profitable now, but we believe that this business will be profitable and durable for many years to come. And I'm not sure the full market understands that personally. I know you've gone through the business, understanding the demand, and I encourage everyone to understand and ask us more questions about Pro. Thanks.\nAdam Jonas: Thanks, Jim.\nOperator: The next question is from John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nJohn Murphy: Good afternoon, guys. The Freedom of Choice is a great marketing tool to go out to market with, and I think it's reasonably -- or should be very effective. But, Jim, as you think about this, as the market is shifting towards hybrids at least in the near term, I'm just curious what kind of capacity you have to ramp up significantly in hybrids if the demand really is there. And if you think about sort of the competitive threat really coming from Toyota with a lot of capacity on this side, is there risk that there's market share losses to them over time? Or do you have the ability to really step up here? I think you mentioned something about 400,000 hybrids on an LTM basis. But can you do a whole lot more and really sort of garner your fair share of the market?\nJim Farley: Hi, John. We made a lot of capacity decisions several years ago on hybrid, and I'm very thankful we did. For example, we just radically increased the capacity for F-150 that we're launching now up to 25%. And it takes, as you said, it takes a long time for suppliers to ramp to that capacity. It's not assembly capacity that\u2019s a constraint. So that 400,000 is almost double what we did a couple of years ago. That was all very intentional. And we made the decision a couple of years ago to actually make hybrid more pervasive in our lineup, and we're actually now going to -- we've now committed publicly we're going to offer hybrid on all of our vehicles across our lineup. And of course, the capacity has to be there. But if you look at the pricing premium today, which is maybe the most important thing to look for because now that contribution margin for hybrid is covering the cost of the hybrid incremental material cost, that's really a meaningful development. And I think we're in good shape. Of course, our hybrid business is different than the others. We're number three in the US. Number one and number two is of course Toyota and Honda. But our hybrid capacity is in trucks. That's where most of our hybrid sales are in North America. And we don't see a lot of competition so far for that business. We'll see over time. So I feel really good about the decisions we made several years ago about our capacity expansion. Will it be more than 40% growth? It could be. And I think we have flexibility. Now we have really meaningful scale for our suppliers. A lot of our competitors will be starting from scratch.\nJohn Murphy: And I have one follow-up on Pro. It seems like there's a lot of pent-up demand on the fleet side, both on commercial and government. I'm just wondering if you can comment though on that on sort of a unit basis as well as potentially a service basis and just really kind of talk about what kind of benefit that may sort of still garner towards for Pro, which is, as you said, shooting the lights out or we should say that. It seems like there's a lot of opportunity here still just from a market release of pent-up demand, and that might be even more structural over time.\nJim Farley: It's true. The demand on Pro is fundamentally different than retail. There's no doubt about it. Our retail customers are not re-fleeting. They're not doing roadworks and 5G infrastructure build-out. I mean, these are all fundamental drivers. The ambulance market in the US, the average ambulance is 15 years old. I mean, they've been waiting for Transits for a long time. We're now increasing our capacity, which is great. But I mean, we're oversubscribed on the new Super Duty 2:1. So I wish I could say we got that right. We didn't, but we are expanding capacity. I think -- and we have this freshest lineup that we've never had. So we have this kind of double opportunity. Our lineup is fresh. We have the most choice. At the same time, our customers are in kind of white-hot demand that we saw in retail two years ago during the supply shock. And we're doing everything we can to increase our capacity for our customers. It's very frustrating for them.\nJohn Murphy: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question is from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRyan Brinkman: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I'd love to get some more of your thoughts on capital allocation, including after in the release, you repeat the intention to return 40% to 50% of free cash flow to shareholders. I guess with CapEx coming further down and FCF up, there's more to return. But at the same time, targeting to return only up to half of what you generate obviously implies you want to continue to grow cash on hand despite the current $28 billion being well more than the over $20 billion that you've historically targeted. And of course, you've got lots of available liquidity beyond that, close to a record, I think. So just curious what might be driving the conservatism here, whether it relates to more macro or industry uncertainty or wanting to preserve some other optionality or for some contingency I'm not thinking of. I think in the past when I\u2019ve asked this question, you'd sort of point to the industry transition towards EVs. But seems like the last couple of quarters now, your focus is more on improving the EV business by trying to spend less, not needing to spend more, all right? So just wanted to check in how you're feeling about capital allocation, what you're seeing that causes you to want to be conservative now? And then what could cause you to potentially want to become more aggressive in the future?\nJohn Lawler: Yeah. So, thank you. So we have our stated policy, as you said, 40% to 50% of free cash flow. Our balance sheet is strong. Our cash position, we ended the year strong. We're at $25 billion this quarter when we talked about the fact that our guidance for this year went up. So when we look at it, we believe that right now in the transition point for the industry, we would rather invest in accretive growth opportunities. And we've always said that if those opportunities don't come to fruition, then we'll need to look at other allocation decisions that we would need to make, but we're not there yet. So we're continuing to talk about this as a team consistently. But we think at this point, the position we're at, we're comfortable with, given where we're at in the transition. We'll pay out the 40%, 50% of free cash flow. The last couple of years, it's been at the high end of that range. And eventually, as we continue to execute on our Ford+ plan, if those accretive opportunities to allocate capital for additional accretive growth aren't there, then we'll look at other ways of returning that cash to our shareholders.\nRyan Brinkman: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Bruno Dossena with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nBruno Dossena: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask in Model e. And I understand that reaching breakeven depends on the timing of the launch of the next-gen vehicles. But in the intermediate term, can you tell us how you're thinking about the trajectory of losses in e and specifically the potential to work down the structural costs associated with this business?\nJohn Lawler: Yes. So we are -- I don't know, it's a cliche, I guess, laser-focused on the -- all the costs around Model e. And for the year, when you look at -- well, let's just take it back up a second. The last couple of years, when you look at Model e, we've actually reduced the cost of our vehicles significantly. On Mach-E, we've taken over $5,000 of cost out, but the revenue keeps dropping faster than we're able to take out the cost. And we're being very thoughtful about what we're putting in as far as structural costs, et cetera. And so we're going to continue to work on driving every dollar of cost out of the business in the near term. And if the pricing stabilizes and we don't see these significant reductions continuing across the industry, then I think that you could probably start to see some of those cost reductions flow to the bottom line. But so far, the last 12 to 18 months, it's just been a continuous march down on the top line, which is offsetting any of the savings we've had from a cost standpoint. So it's in our control. We have to take cost out. We know that. That's what we're marching towards. And we're understanding the dynamics and the competitiveness of the market equation as we set up the cost structure for our second-gen vehicles. And as Jim said, we pushed out the three-row SUV because we need more cost to come out of that for that to be at the margin levels we expect.\nBruno Dossena: Okay. On a similar vein to the comments you made around cost and pricing for the Mach-E, if we look at your combustion, Blue and Pro, we see the costs are up $1.2 billion year-over-year, presumably from material content on some new launches, warranty, maybe offset by some savings. And we also see that pricing in these businesses is up about $1 billion. But can you give us some insight into if or when you'll see some improvement in variable costs relative to pricing and Ford beginning to close the variable cost gap compared to peers?\nJohn Lawler: Yeah. So you look at that, most of the cost this quarter was up in Ford Pro and is all related to the material costs for our new product launches, both the Super Duty and the Transit that we launched in Europe as well as manufacturing costs for the increased volumes that we're bringing across, as Jim mentioned. So that's what drove most of the cost increase in the quarter. We're on track to deliver the $2 billion of cost reductions we talked about at the beginning of the year of raw manufacturing costs, material costs as well as freight and overhead. And so you'll start to see that really gain traction as we move through the second half of the year. And that's when you'll start to see it on our quarterly results.\nOperator: The next question is from Itay Michaeli with Citi. Please go ahead.\nItay Michaeli: Great. Thanks. Good afternoon everyone. Just two questions for me. First, on back to Pro. With a $3 billion outcome in Q1, can you maybe talk about the puts and takes, if I think about the rest of the year? And maybe should we think about the full year at the high end of the range? And then going back to Model e, the press release did allude to EV costs improving going forward but an offset from top line pressure. I was hoping you could help to mention what you're assuming for EV prices the rest of the year. And as volume kind of responds to these price cuts, is there a level where Model e can still become contribution margin positive over the next 12-plus months?\nJohn Lawler: So let me unpack that. So for the year, we're not projecting or sharing where we expect the cost to come down. If you look at what recently happened in the quarter when it comes to pricing on Model e, we had entered the year assuming that prices would come down about 20%. They came down much more than that. We had to take our prices down [in the] (ph) 17% to remain competitive, and mass competition as we went through the quarter. So we've seen prices coming down quite dramatically, and that's why we haven't been able to keep up from a cost reduction standpoint. Look, we're targeting to take out as much cost this year as we can on Model e and all in the spirit of driving towards that contribution margin positive so we can have some leverage as we move volumes through the chain. So that definitely is our intention as we continue to work on Model e in the near term.\nJim Farley: On Pro, obviously, Q1, Pro is really structured not necessarily on traditional demand like retail. It's actually deliveries. So our delivery volume in Q1, it's kind of -- it's a cyclical business globally and we have a lot of strong delivery in the first quarter just because of the contractual agreements with our customers, including fleetail. And when you look at the rest of the year, we have shutdowns. There are a lot of other -- we have launches. There are a lot of reasons why we feel really comfortable even with the strong result in the first quarter, that our guidance is still accurate for Ford Pro, given all the puts and takes. But we'll revisit in the second quarter. We'll see how pricing lands. We're going to be doing quite a bit of fleetail business this quarter as well as looking at locking in pricing for some of our large corporate fleets later in the year. So we're going to learn a lot more this quarter on whether there's tailwinds or headwinds on Pro.\nItay Michaeli: Terrific. That\u2019s all very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Joseph Spak with UBS. Please go ahead.\nJoseph Spak: Thanks. Jim, first to start, I appreciate all the commentary you talked about on the F-150 launches and as well as Super Duty and Mustang and some of the improvement there. As you mentioned, you've got some other big launches coming up later this year, I think Explorer and a number of others. So was the lesson learned that you will go more cautious and careful? And is that -- should we expect a slower ramp-up than we've seen historically for some of these new launches later in the year?\nJim Farley: I would say we're seeing real benefits to our customers and the company, I believe, long term in taking this new approach to launches. It also requires our industrial system under Kumar to work differently, to solve problems, to do different kinds of testing and that goes into kind of our longer-term lessons learned. And we're now really spending a lot of time on long-term durability, which is an area where Ford has standards but maybe didn't look to lead the industry, which we now look to. And so we're not going to change our approach to these launches. We think this new more measured approach with more physical testing, a lot more time for problem solving for our team is the right approach for the company in the midterm and long term. We do have some very significant launches coming up. We have Explorer and Aviator as you mentioned, which are high volume in both North America. And in China, we have a new wave, we call Wave 2 for the one-ton Transit in Europe, which is super profitable. And we're going to be building and launching the higher-end derivatives of that. We have the Bronco in China. I mean, I can go on and on. We have a freshened Maverick and Bronco Sport coming and even more models than that. So given all that complexity, it's actually even more important for us to take our time. And it may, like quarter one, it may mean that in some quarter ends, we may have some company stock and [plants] (ph) to make sure that we do the right thing on quality. So our earnings may be a little bit lumpy. We'll see how that works out based on this new approach.\nJoseph Spak: Okay. Thanks for that. And then just back to the hybrid conversation because as you pointed out, your hybrid portfolio is much different than Toyota or Honda. It's pretty limited. I think you only have like three hybrids right now. But how should we think about scaling that to the rest of the portfolio, as you mentioned? Is it really like taking existing power plants you have and trying to sort of fit it -- make it fit on more models? Or are there real new investments that need to be made for hybrids?\nJim Farley: It's a good question. So I would say mostly, it's taking our current internal combustion engines and adding new hybrid components and doing the engineering to fit that. Look at the T6 platform. We had the Ranger. We had the Everest, we have the Bronco. That's an obvious candidate. We have our full-size SUVs, candidate. We have the Explorer platform. And I think we're lucky. We have the right engines. Some of them may have to go to an [action] (ph) cycle engine from a normal combustion cycle. We have the components in our system from the hybrid, the torque splitting devices that -- we do have to up the investment in some capacities like our hybrid transmissions, but we've made the decision to do that already and that's in our spending plan this year. I think we're in really good shape. It doesn't require wholesale inventing new powertrains. But it does involve some engineering and investment in capacity. I would say kind of modest investments, mostly in the capacity side and some engineering.\nJoseph Spak: Okay. Thank you for that.\nOperator: The next question is from Colin Langan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nColin Langan: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. It sounds like you're pretty optimistic about pickup demand, but I think there's media reports that some of the data showing pricing was a bit weak in Q1, inventories look pretty high. So are you seeing any risks in the market? And where do you see pricing for some of these models coming for the rest of the year, I guess, now that you got maybe some of the 2023s out? And then where should inventory really end?\nJohn Lawler: Yeah. So what you saw in pickups for us as we came out of the end of last year into the first quarter of this year here in the US is we built up stock as we knew we were coming into the launch. So we built stocks of '23 models. And then we were selling those down in the first quarter throughout the majority of the quarter. And that's why you saw, to stay competitive with our competitors that had '24 year model pickup trucks, we saw some top line coming down. So we had higher incentives to sell the '23 model year longer through the quarter. You see now that our '24 F-150s are at dealers and selling. They're turning in about seven days. You'll see, as you look at the data, that our average transaction prices are going up and our incentive spend is coming down because of the '24 year mix. So that's a big part of what moved it for us on pickup trucks. And it was -- because we're such a big player, it was moving in [Technical Difficulty]\nJim Farley: I just want to emphasize, I don't think there's a brand out there that has a Maverick. That's pretty much alone in the segment, and we still are in a supply shock for Maverick. It's one of our fastest-growing vehicles. We have an all-new F-150 with a hybrid option, as John said, turning really fast. We have a Super Duty on the Pro side that's oversubscribed 2:1, and we have a brand-new Ranger. So we're a bit of a unicorn in the sense that yes, we're big, and there is some risk. But I would say the risk is for people who have aged product. And I think Ford is in a particularly advantaged situation.\nColin Langan: And what about inventory levels? I think some of the data is showing in the high 90s ending up, March kind of coming down to...\nJohn Lawler: Yes, that's come down considerably, and if you look at us on an overall basis, our dealer day supply is mid-50s. Yeah. We're completely out of stock on Rangers. Maverick is like 30-day supply or something like that. F-150 came down because we had quite a few '23s. But now with the launch and the quality effort, I think the stocks are really in good shape. And Super Duty, we have very few in stock for retail. Yeah. So you've got to look at the dealer day supply, and that's in a good place.\nColin Langan: And just as a follow-up, maybe color on industry pricing. What is sort of embedded in your guidance at this point? And how is pricing holding up, I guess, sequentially because I think some of the comps are a little tough with launches year-over-year?\nJohn Lawler: Yeah. First quarter pricing held up pretty well, Q4 into Q1. From a planning perspective, we assume that the industry, we expect to see pricing pressure of about 2% negative pricing across the industry. And it really comes back to affordability. Many folks across the industry have been talking about pricing coming down, though what -- and it hasn't. And again, we saw in the first quarter that it remained pretty robust. But we keep looking at it from an affordability standpoint, from the consumer perspective. And when you look at where consumers were pre-COVID, then we had the supply shocks and we had a very imbalance between supply and demand. But now as that's normalized, we would expect that affordability should go back to where it was pre COVID, and that's about 13% to 14% of monthly disposable income. And you also have to factor in right now with interest rates, that payment prices have gone up, insurance rates have gone up as well as maintenance rates. And so when you take all that together, we think about affordability, we say, okay, if you're going to be back towards that range of affordability for the consumer, then prices are going to have to come off a couple of points or so across the industry. And so that's how we think about it and that's what we have planned. And we'll see where that runs with Q2 and then as we go through the second half of this year.\nColin Langan: Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: The next question is from Tom Narayan with RBC. Please go ahead.\nTom Narayan: Thanks for taking the question. Jim, we heard from your guys' commentary that EV prices those drops stabilized, then the losses would lessen. But as we've heard from some of the earnings yesterday, Tesla, GM, it seems like the opposite is happening. It seems like OEMs are trying to make cheaper EVs and that pricing is really only going to go lower. I guess, how confident are you that you could reduce EV losses in this environment if EV prices just keep on going down?\nJohn Lawler: So when you look at it, it's clear that when the EV craze started, right, it was -- it looked like demand was going to be well long supply. But that was with the early adopters and they were willing to pay a higher price. What we're finding with being in the marketplace is that EV prices are normalizing, and our early majority customers are not willing to pay a premium. And that's what we're seeing. And so we think that prices for EVs are going to normalize around where gas is and the consumers are going to weigh the value proposition of that propulsion choice, either for their duty cycle, what works for them, either it's going to be an EV or a traditional ICE engine or a diesel or a hybrid. And pricing is going to have to be relatively consistent across all choices of propulsion, and a customer will make a choice based on the value of that. And that's how we're building the business model for electric vehicles. I don't think that you're going to find that you're going to have electric vehicles well below gas prices unless there's so much capacity pushing against the demand curve, and it's an imbalance on that end of it. But eventually, rational players will have to come to the marketplace.\nJim Farley: We launched our first small SUV this year in Europe in Cologne, our Explorer to two-row crossover. It's a relatively small vehicle certainly in the U.S. And you can expect, as I mentioned several times, that our new affordable platform will be used for most of our volume in their next cycle of product. What's really exciting for us is that we see an opening in the market. We see a lot of brands having to launch compliance vehicles that lose money, and they probably don't want to sell a lot of volume but they have to. We believe that we can be profitable at $25,000 to $30,000 so it's a huge opportunity for Ford. And what we're learning with BlueCruise and our Protiviti software on Pro is that all those vehicles will be great platforms for software and services. And so we're really excited about that new more affordable vehicle lineup, starting with Explorer in Europe this year.\nTom Narayan: Thanks. And maybe as a follow-up, maybe this is something that could help here is battery raw mat costs, we have lithium down like 80% since the peak in 2022. Could you just remind us of how your contracts work? I think there's -- we've heard from some other OEMs that there's still some benefits to come, actually getting better, given how contracts work and you could actually see benefits on battery raw mats later in the year.\nJohn Lawler: Yeah, we're seeing the same thing. We're no different.\nJim Farley: I would say that the biggest leverage on the battery cost is still going to be taking nickel out of them and those kind of things. It's great to see the easing of some of the raw materials, and that will definitely cascade into our business, depending on our contracts. I think the most important thing strategically is to get to new chemistries that have a lot less expensive materials in them. And we see that right around the corner at Ford. And we're changing our launch timing to take advantage of that.\nOperator: Our final question today is from James Picariello with BNP Paribas Exane. Please go ahead.\nJames Picariello: Hi everyone. Just back on Joe's question regarding this year's heavy slate of model launches. I know the hyperfocus is on improved launch quality. I believe, Jim, you mentioned at some point Ford Pro lost $1 billion in profit last year from a more delivered Super Duty launch, excluding the impact from the strike. My question is, we already saw the F-150 refresh this quarter result in 60,000 units getting pushed. Is there a risk to Ford Blue's guide from lower launch volumes? Is this already factored into the range or is it mainly expected Ford will avoid any material slowdown from here?\nJohn Lawler: It\u2019s already factored in.\nJames Picariello: Already factored in. Okay. That was easy. Can you also -- can you just unpack how the implied ASP for Model e in the quarter finished in the $10,000 to $14,000 range? And then just given the slow volume start to the year, should we still be expecting modest full year growth for Model e?\nJohn Lawler: Yes. We expect high single-digit growth in the Model e, primarily with the launch of the Explorer, as Jim mentioned, in Europe. When you look at the average selling price with the math, it's difficult because of the quarter. So we had quite a few units in stock. And as we saw the competitive pricing in the industry come down, we took our prices down, too. So then we had to take the prices down of all units in stock equally, and that was about $300 million of impact there. So when you look at the tenth of revenue for the quarter for Model e, you need to add that $300 million in, if you want to do the math based on the wholesales in the quarter.\nJames Picariello: Got it. Maybe my first question doesn't count, given how you answered. Just on the $2 billion in material manufacturing cost savings for this year, I know there are not going to be clean numbers that stand out in the bridge quarter-to-quarter, but can you just give a high-level assessment on the progress to date? What initiatives are really showing through? And any color you're willing to share on first half versus second half timing on those initiatives? Thanks.\nJohn Lawler: Yeah. So majority of them are going to be towards the second half. I'm really encouraged by the progress that Kumar and the industrial platform are making around the design changes. And those design changes are trying to be implemented as we get the new model year changeover in the second half and as we bring vehicles online in the second half. So that's one area where I've seen tremendous progress by the Ford teams. They're working on those design reductions to come through. The other area we're seeing progress is in manufacturing, and Bryce and his team as they're working to drive efficiencies to help offset the increases we have this year based on the contract that we signed last year. So in both areas, I'm seeing green shoots there. And Liz is doing a really nice job on the supply chain side as well. We've got better systems and tools and processes. We're working more collaboratively with the supply base. She's changing the culture. And so across all three of those areas in the industrial platform between what Kumar is doing, leading the team with Bryce and Liz, we're seeing green shoots, and we're confident on the $2 billion this year, but mostly timed towards the second half.\nJim Farley: And one of the most important priorities for us as a team is to take that cost out and improve quality at the same time. So on the design side, for example, we have specific windows where the team can make design changes and not to protect our quality. I just want to emphasize that because we're trying to do both at the same time, improve quality and improve our costs in the industrial system. And to do that, we have to be very intentional.\nJames Picariello: Thanks.\nOperator: This concludes the Ford Motor Company first quarter 2024 earnings conference call.

The cornerstone of Ford+ is pretty straightforward, a more resilient business model, higher growth, higher margin, and more capital efficiency.

Before John goes through the quarter, I wanted to highlight four key strategic areas, how our growth drivers are changing, our progress in quality, the resilient Ford Pro business, and what we're learning on the electrification journey in quarter one. On growth, the portfolio changes we made and the restructuring we've done in our geographic footprint has really paid off for Ford. Several years ago, we normally would be reducing our volume and our mix and having good news on pricing. What's changed in the last year, and especially in Q1 you could see, is our top line and bottom line profitability are increasing, driven by improved volumes and mix. And we're actually seeing pricing headwinds. And that new portfolio and geographic footprint is really tremendous to see at Ford. There is no better example for this than the portfolio changes we've made in our truck and van business. Ford is the number one best-selling pickup manufacturer in the world. And our Ford Transit Cargo Van is the best-selling in the world. It's now our second best-selling nameplate at Ford. And our midsize Ranger, not our most affordable pickup, is a third best-selling vehicle at Ford. And together with the Everest makes up our profits outside of China, North America, and Europe. It's an incredible new franchise for Ford. These changes in our portfolio at all different sizes and price points in the truck and the van business has really played to Ford's strength. And it doesn't stop there. Our growth drivers are diversifying. We now have a vibrant software business and physical services business led by Ford Pro. You don't need to look very far beyond our mobile services. An example, Ford now has 3,500 or more remote service vehicles in our fleet globally. And last year, we did 2.4 million remote service experiences, both remote service and pickup and delivery. 40% of that was for Pro and 60% was for our retail business. Ford now has more than 700,000 paid subscribers for software. That's up 47% year-over-year. It's capital efficient, and the gross margins are more than 50%. Our quality is making real progress. Kumar and the team have really focused on key areas. Our '23 model year, three months in service, initial quality is 10% better than the previous model year. And we're seeing our current model year that we're selling for several months, another 10% improvement. That should put us in the middle of the pack. And many of our vehicles start to lead their segments in initial quality. But to bend the curve on warranty costs and customer recalls, we're really focusing on our launches. We're past the Super Duty launch now and well into the F-150 launch, and we made a lot of changes to improve and bend that curve. On the F-150 and others, we've delayed the OK2Buy three to six weeks. We've taken a lot of new testing regiments. Actually, we ended the quarter with 60,000 units in our plant stock, which hurt our first quarter but will benefit because we're shipping those now in our second quarter for all those quality processes. And what we're so far seeing is, we avoided about 12 recalls on F-150. And we're seeing the best performance on 3 MIS after a launch in a long time. And I'd like to be specific here. Normally, after a launch, we've seen about -- in the last five years about a 70% spike in our defects. The industry average is about 20%. And the Super Duty and Mustang launches were about that industry average 20% spike. And now, we're seeing with the F-150 even better performance at industry average. And boy, do we have a lot of launches in the second half to prove out this new launch process. What we're going to see long-term is fewer recalls and lower warranty costs because of this new process. I'm really proud of the team's progress on quality. And we have so much more to do. I'd like to talk quickly about Ford Pro. I mean, look at quarter one. We made $3 billion. That's how much we made the whole year in Pro two years ago. We're growing revenues, EBIT, EBIT margin, we're growing our volume. Our attach rates for high margin software and physical services are improving. And when you ask yourself, why is this different? Why would this business -- why would these profits be more resilient than our retail business? It comes down to three things. First is, the diversity of our customer base. About a third of our Pro customers are small business. Another third are large companies and about 20% more is governments, all different kinds. And the diversity of those customers and all three of them are driving a white-hot demand for our vehicles and services right now from infrastructure build out, roadworks, 5G, onshore manufacturing and re-fleeting for our key government fleets. One out of four of those fleets are all Ford, and boy do they trust our company. But more than anything, it's the breath and freshness of our new lineup at Pro that's driving our profitability. We have the freshest lineup we've had in 20 years in Pro. We have an all new Super Duty, an all-new Transit from top to bottom. And we have an all new Ranger and five plus plants around the world. These new products are really attractive to customers. And beyond that, we have the most diverse Class 1 to 7 lineup in North America, our key market. And that adjacency sales are important because customers buy different kinds of vehicles for us in the same fleet. But beyond that, in those fresh nameplates, we offer the best choice. We have cabin chassis and cutaway versions of our vans, different wheel bases and heights, the same on our pickup trucks. And we also have the most choice in terms of upfitters. We have 500 different upfitters across Western Europe and the US that prefer to work with Ford because of our experience with them. And it doesn't stop there. We've designed all of our commercial vehicles with a multi-energy platform. And that allows our customers to choose electric, partial electric, diesel, petrol, whatever choice on powertrain that best meets their cost of ownership. No one has this kind of lineup in our business globally. The third key area is the diversification and the completeness of our software and physical services experiences for our customers. Now, 13% of Ford Pro's profits in the last 12 years make up these attached services. And it's a big change for us. And what's really driving that is our advantage in physical service. We have the largest repair network you can find of any brand out there. And we're widening that gap. We've added 700 commercial service bays in the last year and more than 11 very large service lead centers with between 50 and 200 repair bays that are open 24/7 for our customers. None of our competitors offer this kind of extensive repair network. And it doesn't stop there. We have over 2,000 remote trucks and vans doing remote service for our Pro customers, no brand can match that either. And now we have over 560,000 active software subscriptions for our Pro customers, that's up 40%. And that Pro Intelligence business took many years to build. It requires advanced electric architecture. It's a really hard moat to copy. Long list short, Ford Pro is in for a great performance over the next several years. What did we learn on electric so far? Well, as you know, we're number two in our home market and electric sales for the last couple of years. And boy, we learned a lot. Since Capital Markets last year, we continue to adapt to and evolve our spending and our investment ramp for battery plants and assembly capacity for our EVs to match customers demand. And more importantly than all of that, match the price expectations. We're retiming our launches and our capital spending. In fact, this year we expected to spend about $10 billion as a company. We've now guided $8 billion to $9 billion. We'll probably be on the low end of that range. And we're being very consistent about our discipline on profitability. We expect every one of our EVs to make money in the first 12 months. And that is a very disciplined process. In fact, we delayed the launch of our three-row crossover, which is a great product, two years, not only to match the slower growth in EV, but more importantly, to take advantage of new battery chemistry and formats to substantially reduce the cost of the batteries for that vehicle. We'll do everything it takes to be profitable in the first 12 months of our vehicles. And what's our bet as a company? Well, it's pretty simple. We're going to bet on commercial work vehicles where we do really well, where we know the customers, where we can innovate for them like Pro Power Onboard with partial and fully electric vehicles. But increasingly, our bet will be on our new small, affordable platform developed by our team on the West Coast. Why is affordability so important? Well, when we look at the connected car data from our EV customers, we notice that people live in the suburbs, urban customers, they tend to drive shorter distances, and those more affordable vehicles, more approachable, and we believe that's where the adoption of EV will go the fastest. And we believe we can compete in segments of small cars and vehicles, more affordable vehicles in a unique way that's Ford. A good example was, we learned a lot when we -- in our more expensive vehicles, Mach-E, when in February we dropped the price 17%, our volume went up 141%. That's telling us that the more affordable we can make great product, the more attractive it is to these mainstream EV adopters. And the last thing I'd say is, we're learning about the importance of choice. Our growth in the first quarter in hybrids is a good example. We grew 36%, we think the full year would be 40%, we're now approaching 400,000 units of volume for our hybrid business. And we're now number three in hybrids in the US. It's a big advantage. We've been in the business for more than 20 years. And what's really exciting for us is for the first time, some of our contribution margins on hybrids are above or at similar contribution margins than our pure internal combustion engine margins. With that, I'll turn it over to John. Thank you, Adam. And first of all, thanks for your report on Pro. I appreciate you taking the time to understand the business. Look, I mean, we -- as John mentioned, we have to make tremendous progress on Model e. It's a huge drag not just on Ford but on our whole industry, even for pure-play EV players. So -- and we're very clear-eyed about that. We're very committed to transparency. A lot of OEMs will handle EVs very different. We won't. It's like if we had an unprofitable regional business and we rolled it up and it wouldn't be transparent to investors, we would never do that. We're not going to do that with EVs, and we're not going to subsidize our Pro and Blue business by not being transparent about e. It's how we run the business. I think investors should understand for me as a leader is that we're going to build a sustainably profitable EV business with terminal value. And we -- and it needs to return the cost of capital on its own and not be subsidized as I mentioned. And the real turning point for us not only is our flat cost in Model e this year, but most importantly, it will be the profitability in our next cycle of products. And I'm proud of the work that our team has done to make the adjustments in our capital spending and to make sure that all of our next EVs are profitable. And the evidence will be there. And I think that is the main drag on the company right now as it will be for the whole industry. Blue is in really good shape. I wonder out loud, Adam, if everyone really understands the resilience of the Pro business over time. We're very profitable now, but we believe that this business will be profitable and durable for many years to come. And I'm not sure the full market understands that personally. I know you've gone through the business, understanding the demand, and I encourage everyone to understand and ask us more questions about Pro. Thanks. Hi, John. We made a lot of capacity decisions several years ago on hybrid, and I'm very thankful we did. For example, we just radically increased the capacity for F-150 that we're launching now up to 25%. And it takes, as you said, it takes a long time for suppliers to ramp to that capacity. It's not assembly capacity that's a constraint. So that 400,000 is almost double what we did a couple of years ago. That was all very intentional. And we made the decision a couple of years ago to actually make hybrid more pervasive in our lineup, and we're actually now going to -- we've now committed publicly we're going to offer hybrid on all of our vehicles across our lineup. And of course, the capacity has to be there. But if you look at the pricing premium today, which is maybe the most important thing to look for because now that contribution margin for hybrid is covering the cost of the hybrid incremental material cost, that's really a meaningful development. And I think we're in good shape. Of course, our hybrid business is different than the others. We're number three in the US. Number one and number two is of course Toyota and Honda. But our hybrid capacity is in trucks. That's where most of our hybrid sales are in North America. And we don't see a lot of competition so far for that business. We'll see over time. So I feel really good about the decisions we made several years ago about our capacity expansion. Will it be more than 40% growth? It could be. And I think we have flexibility. Now we have really meaningful scale for our suppliers. A lot of our competitors will be starting from scratch. It's true. The demand on Pro is fundamentally different than retail. There's no doubt about it. Our retail customers are not re-fleeting. They're not doing roadworks and 5G infrastructure build-out. I mean, these are all fundamental drivers. The ambulance market in the US, the average ambulance is 15 years old. I mean, they've been waiting for Transits for a long time. We're now increasing our capacity, which is great. But I mean, we're oversubscribed on the new Super Duty 2:1. So I wish I could say we got that right. We didn't, but we are expanding capacity. I think -- and we have this freshest lineup that we've never had. So we have this kind of double opportunity. Our lineup is fresh. We have the most choice. At the same time, our customers are in kind of white-hot demand that we saw in retail two years ago during the supply shock. And we're doing everything we can to increase our capacity for our customers. It's very frustrating for them. On Pro, obviously, Q1, Pro is really structured not necessarily on traditional demand like retail. It's actually deliveries. So our delivery volume in Q1, it's kind of -- it's a cyclical business globally and we have a lot of strong delivery in the first quarter just because of the contractual agreements with our customers, including fleetail. And when you look at the rest of the year, we have shutdowns. There are a lot of other -- we have launches. There are a lot of reasons why we feel really comfortable even with the strong result in the first quarter, that our guidance is still accurate for Ford Pro, given all the puts and takes. But we'll revisit in the second quarter. We'll see how pricing lands. We're going to be doing quite a bit of fleetail business this quarter as well as looking at locking in pricing for some of our large corporate fleets later in the year. So we're going to learn a lot more this quarter on whether there's tailwinds or headwinds on Pro. I would say we're seeing real benefits to our customers and the company, I believe, long term in taking this new approach to launches. It also requires our industrial system under Kumar to work differently, to solve problems, to do different kinds of testing and that goes into kind of our longer-term lessons learned. And we're now really spending a lot of time on long-term durability, which is an area where Ford has standards but maybe didn't look to lead the industry, which we now look to. And so we're not going to change our approach to these launches. We think this new more measured approach with more physical testing, a lot more time for problem solving for our team is the right approach for the company in the midterm and long term. We do have some very significant launches coming up. We have Explorer and Aviator as you mentioned, which are high volume in both North America. And in China, we have a new wave, we call Wave 2 for the one-ton Transit in Europe, which is super profitable. And we're going to be building and launching the higher-end derivatives of that. We have the Bronco in China. I mean, I can go on and on. We have a freshened Maverick and Bronco Sport coming and even more models than that. So given all that complexity, it's actually even more important for us to take our time. And it may, like quarter one, it may mean that in some quarter ends, we may have some company stock and [plants] (ph) to make sure that we do the right thing on quality. So our earnings may be a little bit lumpy. We'll see how that works out based on this new approach. It's a good question. So I would say mostly, it's taking our current internal combustion engines and adding new hybrid components and doing the engineering to fit that. Look at the T6 platform. We had the Ranger. We had the Everest, we have the Bronco. That's an obvious candidate. We have our full-size SUVs, candidate. We have the Explorer platform. And I think we're lucky. We have the right engines. Some of them may have to go to an [action] (ph) cycle engine from a normal combustion cycle. We have the components in our system from the hybrid, the torque splitting devices that -- we do have to up the investment in some capacities like our hybrid transmissions, but we've made the decision to do that already and that's in our spending plan this year. I think we're in really good shape. It doesn't require wholesale inventing new powertrains. But it does involve some engineering and investment in capacity. I would say kind of modest investments, mostly in the capacity side and some engineering. I just want to emphasize, I don't think there's a brand out there that has a Maverick. That's pretty much alone in the segment, and we still are in a supply shock for Maverick. It's one of our fastest-growing vehicles. We have an all-new F-150 with a hybrid option, as John said, turning really fast. We have a Super Duty on the Pro side that's oversubscribed 2:1, and we have a brand-new Ranger. So we're a bit of a unicorn in the sense that yes, we're big, and there is some risk. But I would say the risk is for people who have aged product. And I think Ford is in a particularly advantaged situation. We launched our first small SUV this year in Europe in Cologne, our Explorer to two-row crossover. It's a relatively small vehicle certainly in the U.S. And you can expect, as I mentioned several times, that our new affordable platform will be used for most of our volume in their next cycle of product. What's really exciting for us is that we see an opening in the market. We see a lot of brands having to launch compliance vehicles that lose money, and they probably don't want to sell a lot of volume but they have to. We believe that we can be profitable at $25,000 to $30,000 so it's a huge opportunity for Ford. And what we're learning with BlueCruise and our Protiviti software on Pro is that all those vehicles will be great platforms for software and services. And so we're really excited about that new more affordable vehicle lineup, starting with Explorer in Europe this year. I would say that the biggest leverage on the battery cost is still going to be taking nickel out of them and those kind of things. It's great to see the easing of some of the raw materials, and that will definitely cascade into our business, depending on our contracts. I think the most important thing strategically is to get to new chemistries that have a lot less expensive materials in them. And we see that right around the corner at Ford. And we're changing our launch timing to take advantage of that. And one of the most important priorities for us as a team is to take that cost out and improve quality at the same time. So on the design side, for example, we have specific windows where the team can make design changes and not to protect our quality. I just want to emphasize that because we're trying to do both at the same time, improve quality and improve our costs in the industrial system. And to do that, we have to be very intentional."

            "name": "John Lawler",
            "content": "Okay. Thanks, Jim. So our team around the globe is becoming more focused and adept at applying the Ford+ strategy, and we really did deliver a solid quarter. We are transforming Ford into a higher-growth, higher-margin, more capital-efficient and more resilient business. We're progressively shedding behaviors that have weighed down performance and valuation of legacy auto companies for most of the industry's history. Our strong global product lineup is differentiated, offering customers freedom of powertrain choice and drove first quarter revenue of $43 billion, up 3%. Our revenue has grown in each of the last three years and we expect 2024 to be no different. Wholesales were down 1%, more than explained by the late quarter launch timing of the new F-150. We delivered $2.8 billion in adjusted EBIT with a margin of 6.5%, reflecting continued strength in Ford Pro. Costs were up $1.2 billion, but if you double-click on this, you'll see that $1.1 billion of that was investments in growth by Ford Pro, including new products. Ford Blue and Ford Model e costs were roughly flat, and we're on track to deliver $2 billion of cost efficiencies for the full year. Adjusted free cash flow was a use of $500 million, more than explained by the vehicles in inventory, and this impact will reverse in the second quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong with $25 billion in cash and close to $43 billion in liquidity. And earlier this week, we also completed the renewal of our $18 billion corporate credit facilities, extending maturities by an additional year. Overall, our strong liquidity provides significant flexibility for us to invest in profitable growth. Consistent with our commitment to return 40% to 50% of adjusted free cash flow to shareholders, today, we also declared a regular second quarter dividend of $0.15 per share payable June 3 to shareholders of record on May 8. I'll spend a few minutes summarizing the financial performance of each of our customer-focused segments. And there's evidence in every one of them of how Ford+ is making our business stronger. Ford Pro delivered a 36% increase in revenue on a 21% increase in wholesales. The segment has consistently delivered year-over-year revenue growth each quarter since we re-segmented our business. EBIT more than doubled to $3 billion with a margin of 16.7%, reflecting increased Super Duty and Transit production, richer Super Duty mix and higher net pricing. In addition, over the past 12 months, roughly 13% of Ford Pro's EBIT came from software and physical services, on the glide path to reaching 20% in a few years. And this important revenue stream generates sticky and recurring gross margins in the 40% to 50% range. And as you can see, given the breadth and depth of Ford Pro's competitive moats, investments in growth drive tremendous operating leverage. The segment's results this quarter demonstrate the consistency, predictability, and earnings power of this growth business. Ford Model e generated a loss of $1.3 billion as significant industry pricing pressure more than offset flat costs as wholesales declined 20%. In the quarter, we took action to bring down inventory levels. For example, after being at a price premium to competition in 2023, we lowered pricing on Mustang Mach-E in the US by 17%, bringing us in line with the two-row crossover segment. And as Jim mentioned, we did see elasticity with an improved mix of higher trends. In the US, retail sales jumped 77% versus the total EV segment, which was up roughly 2.6%. Our total EV market share grew by 3.4 points to 7.5%, and Mach-E was the second best-selling e-SUV, only behind Tesla's Model Y. The bottom line is that we're more competitive and doing well in the marketplace. We've reduced our stock levels significantly and the pace of sales has increased. In Ford Blue, revenue, wholesales, and EBIT were down, all impacted by the F-150 production ramp and vehicles and inventory. EBIT margin was 4.2%, and our international operations continue to be profitable across the board. Ford Blue's global product portfolio remains strong and our hybrid sales continued to grow, up 36% in the quarter as we get the benefit of hybrid products planned years ago. Our global mix of hybrid is currently at 7%, up 2 points year-over-year with more products on the way. Additionally, China exports increased 33%, including Lincoln Nautilus, and that's consistent with our strategy to better leverage that asset-light footprint. Ford Credit generated EBT of $326 million. In the quarter, financing margin improved and credit loss performance continued to normalize and remains below our historical average. Importantly, we continued to see a high-quality book based on strong FICO scores, which continue to exceed 750. And as expected, auction values have declined by roughly 10% as lease return rates continued to normalize. So we're beginning to unlock the huge potential for customers and all of our stakeholders with the Freedom of Choice made possible by Ford+. There's plenty of work ahead to fulfill that potential. However, the progress we've made so far is undeniable. We're delivering growth and profitability, sharpening capital efficiency and fortifying the resilience of our business. Accordingly, turning to our outlook, we continue to expect full year company adjusted EBIT of $10 billion to $12 billion and are tracking toward the high end of this range, and that would be a record for Ford. We're raising our adjusted free cash flow guidance to $6.5 billion to $7.5 billion, supported by the underlying strength of the business and lower-than-planned CapEx. Our adjusted free cash flow guidance is consistent with our cash flow conversion target of 50% to 60%. We're tightening our CapEx range to $8 billion to $9 billion as the team adjusts to the dynamic EV landscape. We're scrutinizing every dollar and driving efficiencies that we believe could land us at the lower end of this revised CapEx range. Our outlook for 2024 assumes a flat to slightly higher SAAR in both the US and Europe. Our planning assumption is for the US is 16 million to 16.5 million units. Full year of customer demand for all-new Super Duty contributing to better market factors for Ford Pro. Industry supply demand normalizing. From a planning perspective, we're assuming lower industry pricing of roughly 2%, driven by higher incentive spending as we move through the year. We expect this to be partially offset by top line growth from the launch of our new products. There's no change to our segment outlook, which anticipates continued strength in Ford Pro, leading to EBIT of $8 billion to $9 billion, and that's driven by the continued growth and favorable mix, partially offset by moderated pricing. As expected, a loss in the range of [$5 billion to $5 billion] (ph) for Model e, driven by continued pricing pressure and investments in new vehicles, and for Ford Blue, EBIT of $7 billion to $7.5 billion, reflecting a balanced market equation and also cost efficiencies offsetting higher labor and product costs. And we expect Ford Credit's EBT to be about $1.5 billion, up slightly year-over-year. Our performance this quarter continues to demonstrate the positive momentum of Ford+. Capital discipline is driving the right global footprint, portfolio of products and consistent cash generation. We continue to see growth opportunities and remain focused on delivering improvements in both quality and cost. So that wraps up our prepared remarks, and we'll use the balance of the time to address what's on your mind. So thank you, and operator, please open up the line for questions. So let me clarify a few things, Adam, on that, is that it's not an option for us not to be compliant. If you don't comply with your ZEV or your greenhouse gas emissions requirements, you can't pay fines. What happens is you can't sell, and that's consistent across the industry. So it's -- that's for all OEMs. All OEMs are under those rules. And so there's really three levers that we have. We can sell EVs and hybrids, we can sell fewer ICE, or we can contract to buy credits from another OEM. And when we do contract to buy credits, we will disclose that as we did in our 10-K at the end of the year. And so those are the three levers. And we, I would say, monthly, if not weekly, are working to optimize across those three levers to drive the highest profitability and the highest cash flow for the company. So to continue to sell the ICE vehicles, we are going to need to sell EVs, and we're going to optimize across the profitability. Now the most important thing, as Jim said, is we need to get the EV business to stand on its own, to be profitable, and return on the capital we've invested, and then all the levers will be accretive to Ford and we'll be able to make it really positive. So that's what we're focused on, and that's what I intended to communicate earlier today. Yeah, we disclosed last year in the 10-K that we had purchase commitments of $700 million. In the first quarter, there wasn't anything material. And as we go through the year, if it's the right lever to pull, as I said as we're optimizing, we will report it. Yeah. So, thank you. So we have our stated policy, as you said, 40% to 50% of free cash flow. Our balance sheet is strong. Our cash position, we ended the year strong. We're at $25 billion this quarter when we talked about the fact that our guidance for this year went up. So when we look at it, we believe that right now in the transition point for the industry, we would rather invest in accretive growth opportunities. And we've always said that if those opportunities don't come to fruition, then we'll need to look at other allocation decisions that we would need to make, but we're not there yet. So we're continuing to talk about this as a team consistently. But we think at this point, the position we're at, we're comfortable with, given where we're at in the transition. We'll pay out the 40%, 50% of free cash flow. The last couple of years, it's been at the high end of that range. And eventually, as we continue to execute on our Ford+ plan, if those accretive opportunities to allocate capital for additional accretive growth aren't there, then we'll look at other ways of returning that cash to our shareholders. Yes. So we are -- I don't know, it's a cliche, I guess, laser-focused on the -- all the costs around Model e. And for the year, when you look at -- well, let's just take it back up a second. The last couple of years, when you look at Model e, we've actually reduced the cost of our vehicles significantly. On Mach-E, we've taken over $5,000 of cost out, but the revenue keeps dropping faster than we're able to take out the cost. And we're being very thoughtful about what we're putting in as far as structural costs, et cetera. And so we're going to continue to work on driving every dollar of cost out of the business in the near term. And if the pricing stabilizes and we don't see these significant reductions continuing across the industry, then I think that you could probably start to see some of those cost reductions flow to the bottom line. But so far, the last 12 to 18 months, it's just been a continuous march down on the top line, which is offsetting any of the savings we've had from a cost standpoint. So it's in our control. We have to take cost out. We know that. That's what we're marching towards. And we're understanding the dynamics and the competitiveness of the market equation as we set up the cost structure for our second-gen vehicles. And as Jim said, we pushed out the three-row SUV because we need more cost to come out of that for that to be at the margin levels we expect. Yeah. So you look at that, most of the cost this quarter was up in Ford Pro and is all related to the material costs for our new product launches, both the Super Duty and the Transit that we launched in Europe as well as manufacturing costs for the increased volumes that we're bringing across, as Jim mentioned. So that's what drove most of the cost increase in the quarter. We're on track to deliver the $2 billion of cost reductions we talked about at the beginning of the year of raw manufacturing costs, material costs as well as freight and overhead. And so you'll start to see that really gain traction as we move through the second half of the year. And that's when you'll start to see it on our quarterly results. So let me unpack that. So for the year, we're not projecting or sharing where we expect the cost to come down. If you look at what recently happened in the quarter when it comes to pricing on Model e, we had entered the year assuming that prices would come down about 20%. They came down much more than that. We had to take our prices down [in the] (ph) 17% to remain competitive, and mass competition as we went through the quarter. So we've seen prices coming down quite dramatically, and that's why we haven't been able to keep up from a cost reduction standpoint. Look, we're targeting to take out as much cost this year as we can on Model e and all in the spirit of driving towards that contribution margin positive so we can have some leverage as we move volumes through the chain. So that definitely is our intention as we continue to work on Model e in the near term. Yeah. So what you saw in pickups for us as we came out of the end of last year into the first quarter of this year here in the US is we built up stock as we knew we were coming into the launch. So we built stocks of '23 models. And then we were selling those down in the first quarter throughout the majority of the quarter. And that's why you saw, to stay competitive with our competitors that had '24 year model pickup trucks, we saw some top line coming down. So we had higher incentives to sell the '23 model year longer through the quarter. You see now that our '24 F-150s are at dealers and selling. They're turning in about seven days. You'll see, as you look at the data, that our average transaction prices are going up and our incentive spend is coming down because of the '24 year mix. So that's a big part of what moved it for us on pickup trucks. And it was -- because we're such a big player, it was moving in [Technical Difficulty] Yes, that's come down considerably, and if you look at us on an overall basis, our dealer day supply is mid-50s. Yeah. We're completely out of stock on Rangers. Maverick is like 30-day supply or something like that. F-150 came down because we had quite a few '23s. But now with the launch and the quality effort, I think the stocks are really in good shape. And Super Duty, we have very few in stock for retail. Yeah. So you've got to look at the dealer day supply, and that's in a good place. Yeah. First quarter pricing held up pretty well, Q4 into Q1. From a planning perspective, we assume that the industry, we expect to see pricing pressure of about 2% negative pricing across the industry. And it really comes back to affordability. Many folks across the industry have been talking about pricing coming down, though what -- and it hasn't. And again, we saw in the first quarter that it remained pretty robust. But we keep looking at it from an affordability standpoint, from the consumer perspective. And when you look at where consumers were pre-COVID, then we had the supply shocks and we had a very imbalance between supply and demand. But now as that's normalized, we would expect that affordability should go back to where it was pre COVID, and that's about 13% to 14% of monthly disposable income. And you also have to factor in right now with interest rates, that payment prices have gone up, insurance rates have gone up as well as maintenance rates. And so when you take all that together, we think about affordability, we say, okay, if you're going to be back towards that range of affordability for the consumer, then prices are going to have to come off a couple of points or so across the industry. And so that's how we think about it and that's what we have planned. And we'll see where that runs with Q2 and then as we go through the second half of this year. So when you look at it, it's clear that when the EV craze started, right, it was -- it looked like demand was going to be well long supply. But that was with the early adopters and they were willing to pay a higher price. What we're finding with being in the marketplace is that EV prices are normalizing, and our early majority customers are not willing to pay a premium. And that's what we're seeing. And so we think that prices for EVs are going to normalize around where gas is and the consumers are going to weigh the value proposition of that propulsion choice, either for their duty cycle, what works for them, either it's going to be an EV or a traditional ICE engine or a diesel or a hybrid. And pricing is going to have to be relatively consistent across all choices of propulsion, and a customer will make a choice based on the value of that. And that's how we're building the business model for electric vehicles. I don't think that you're going to find that you're going to have electric vehicles well below gas prices unless there's so much capacity pushing against the demand curve, and it's an imbalance on that end of it. But eventually, rational players will have to come to the marketplace. Yeah, we're seeing the same thing. We're no different. It's already factored in. Yes. We expect high single-digit growth in the Model e, primarily with the launch of the Explorer, as Jim mentioned, in Europe. When you look at the average selling price with the math, it's difficult because of the quarter. So we had quite a few units in stock. And as we saw the competitive pricing in the industry come down, we took our prices down, too. So then we had to take the prices down of all units in stock equally, and that was about $300 million of impact there. So when you look at the tenth of revenue for the quarter for Model e, you need to add that $300 million in, if you want to do the math based on the wholesales in the quarter. Yeah. So majority of them are going to be towards the second half. I'm really encouraged by the progress that Kumar and the industrial platform are making around the design changes. And those design changes are trying to be implemented as we get the new model year changeover in the second half and as we bring vehicles online in the second half. So that's one area where I've seen tremendous progress by the Ford teams. They're working on those design reductions to come through. The other area we're seeing progress is in manufacturing, and Bryce and his team as they're working to drive efficiencies to help offset the increases we have this year based on the contract that we signed last year. So in both areas, I'm seeing green shoots there. And Liz is doing a really nice job on the supply chain side as well. We've got better systems and tools and processes. We're working more collaboratively with the supply base. She's changing the culture. And so across all three of those areas in the industrial platform between what Kumar is doing, leading the team with Bryce and Liz, we're seeing green shoots, and we're confident on the $2 billion this year, but mostly timed towards the second half."
