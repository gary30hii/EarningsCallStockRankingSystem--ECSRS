I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Hank Diamond, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Thank you. You may begin. \nHenry Diamond: Good afternoon. Welcome, and thank you for joining Take-Two's conference call to discuss its results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020, ended March 31, 2020.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Before I begin, on behalf of our entire management team and colleagues around the world, I'd like to express our deep condolences for those who've lost their lives or lost family members during this pandemic. In every corner of the world, heroes in the form of first responders and health care workers put their lives at risk to take care of the ill, preserve life and enable societies to return to normal, for which we're all incredibly grateful. I'm also proud of our entire organization for seamlessly and successfully shifting to a work-from-home environment to keep our company moving forward and to continue to deliver the best entertainment experiences to our audiences. \n Turning to our business. Our significantly better-than-expected fourth quarter results concluded another extraordinary year for Take-Two, during which we achieved numerous milestones, including record net bookings of nearly $3 billion as well as record digitally delivered net bookings, o recurrent consumer spending and earnings. Nearly all of our titles outperformed in the fourth quarter, including NBA 2K20, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2, Borderlands 3 and Social Point's mobile games, to name just a few. During the fourth quarter, both recurrent consumer spending on and full game sales of NBA 2K20 significantly outperformed our expectations. Consumer engagement with NBA 2K remained at record levels throughout fiscal 2020 with daily active users growing 13% and MyTeam users increasing nearly 50%. During the fourth quarter, over 9 million hours of NBA 2K gameplay were watched on Twitch across more than 1,100 channels, representing a 40% increase over the third quarter. This strong engagement began prior to people sheltering at home and resulted in recurrent consumer spending growth of 18% in the fourth quarter, reversing our expectation of a decline. This positive trend was driven primarily by the success of February content drops for MyTeam. For the full year, recurrent consumer spending on the NBA 2K franchise grew nearly 30% to a new record and remained the largest contributor to that part of our business. To date, NBA 2K20 is sold in over 12 million units, up 33% over NBA 2K19 in the same period. We now expect the lifetime units recurrent consumer spending and net bookings for NBA 2K20 will be the highest ever for a 2K sports title. I'd like to thank visual concepts in 2K for doing an incredible job addressing the prior issues with NBA 2K20 and delivering another year of record results. \n As part of our broader support of those in need during the COVID-19 pandemic, 2K partnered with the NBA, NBA players association and ESPN to create the NBA 2K players tournament comprised of 16 NBA stars that raised funds for the Arizona Food Bank network. We are incredibly proud to include this unique program among our worldwide COVID-19 response initiatives. The positive momentum for Grand Theft Auto Online continues with superlative performance in both players and net bookings. Since the July launch of the Diamond Casino & Resort update, Grand Theft Auto Online achieved its best-ever monthly active users in both July and August 2019 and then grew sequentially each month from December 2019 through March 2020. This exceptional engagement helped to drive recurrent consumer spending growth of 87% during the fourth quarter and 40% for the full fiscal year, new records in both periods. In addition, sales of Grand Theft Auto V surpassed our expectations, and the title is now sold in over 130 million units, further cementing its position as the must-have title of the current console generation. Red Dead Redemption 2 also exceeded our expectations in the fourth quarter and to date has sold in more than 31 million units worldwide. Both engagement and recurrent consumer spending on Red Dead Online continue to gain momentum. Net bookings grew 62% in the fourth quarter and more than tripled for the full year, excluding digital content bundled with the Red Dead Redemption 2 premium additions. Throughout the coming year Rockstar Games will continue to support both Red Dead Online and Grand Theft Auto Online with more content updates to keep new and returning players excited and engaged. \n Borderlands 3, the latest installment in our genre-defining shooter-looter series outperformed our expectations in the fourth quarter and the title is now sold in over 10 million units, up 50% over Borderlands 2 in the same period. On March 13, Borderlands 3 was released on an array of PC retailers, including Steam, where sales of the game exceeded our projections. During the fourth quarter, 2K and Gearbox launched Guns, Love, and Tentacles: The Marriage of Wainwright & Hammerlock, the second of 4 announced paid campaigns that are included in the Borderlands 3 Super Deluxe Edition and the Season Pass or it can be purchased separately upon release. The Season Pass attach rate for Borderlands 3 continues to be the highest in 2Ks in the franchise's history, and there's more content coming. Borderline 3s monthly active users have steadily climbed in each month during the fourth quarter. And in March, we had the largest influx of new players since the launch due to its release on Steam. We attribute this success in part to 2K's and Gearbox software's continued effort to support Borderlands 3 as a live service game with weekly events, free content drops and consistent communication with fans that should continue to benefit the title and the series over the long term. \n During fiscal 2020, Private Division launched their most successful release to date with The Outer Worlds. The title is an immense critical and commercial success and has significantly exceeded our expectations with more than 2.5 million units sold in to-date. The Outer Worlds is a perfect example of how Private Division can complement our core portfolio selectively and contribute meaningful results to our bottom line. Our fiscal 2020 results were also enhanced by a variety of other offerings led by NBA 2K19, Sid Meiers Civilization VI, Social Point's mobile games and the WWE 2K series. In fiscal 2020, recurring consumer spending grew 34% to a new record and accounted for 51% of our total net bookings. In addition to virtual currency for NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Red Dead Online, recurring consumer spending was enhanced by a variety of other offerings. In the free-to-play category, Social Point outperformed our expectations in the fourth quarter and remains a significant contributor to our results through its 2 biggest games: Dragon City and Monster Legends as well as Word Life, Tasty Town and World Chef. Social Point continues to invest in its broad and innovate pipeline of more than 10 new games planned for launch in the coming years. \n WWE SuperCard also outperformed during the fourth quarter, growing 20%. The title has now been downloaded more than 20 million times and remains 2K's highest grossing mobile title. And NBA 2K Online in China significantly exceeded our expectations, growing 37% and 25% during the fourth quarter and full year, respectively. The title remains the #1 PC online sports game in China with more than 49 million registered users. Add-on content grew 85% in fiscal 2020, led by offerings for the Borderlands franchise, Sid Meiers Civilization VI and WWE 2K20.  Finally, sales of Borderlands 3 premium additions, which include additional content that is allocated to recurrent consumer spending, also contributed positively to our results. \n Looking ahead, our company has the strongest development pipeline in its history, including sequels from our biggest franchises as well as exciting new IP. While fiscal 2021 will be a light year for new releases, we expect to deliver strong results, due to the diversity and strength of our catalog and live service offerings. Transition to a new console cycle is always a very exciting time for our industry, and our development teams are already taking their creative aspirations to a new level by finding ways to push the limits of this new technology; however, the speed of these transitions can be unpredictable, particularly in a year upended by COVID-19. And our fiscal 2021 release slate reflects our strategy to bring our creative achievements to the largest possible audience. Our commitment to deliver the highest quality titles and give them optimal conditions to achieve success remains resolute. We have an array of titles that we'll begin to launch in fiscal 2022, which we expect to drive sequential growth that year. Karl will discuss this in more detail shortly. \n There's no doubt that our recent results have benefited from people sheltering at home as players have sought interactive entertainment to stay connected and engaged with friends and family. The connections and communities built will remain in place once people resume their normal activities and should continue to benefit our industry's results. We're fortunate to work in an industry that can bring some positivity in a difficult time. As previously mentioned, all of Take-Two's labels have come together to deliver a portion of proceeds from April and May to COVID-19 charities worldwide. Looking ahead, Take-Two remains superbly positioned creatively, operationally and financially, to capitalize on the many positive trends in our industry and to deliver continued growth and returns for our shareholders over the long term. \n I'll now turn the call over to Karl. \nKarl Slatoff: Thanks, Strauss. I'd like to join Strauss in expressing our condolences to all those who have lost loved ones and are facing adversity during this global pandemic. We at Take-Two are very fortunate to have colleagues around the world who continue to dedicate themselves to our mission despite very difficult and uncertain times. I'll now discuss our recent and upcoming releases. On April 24, 2K and games released XCOM: Chimera Squad, an all-new standalone title in the award-winning, turn-based, XCOM tactical series. Set 5 years after the events of XCOM 2, Chimera Squad provides a dynamic and unique experience for fans and new players. The title has received strong reviews, including 4.5 out of 5 stars from Screen Rant, who said Chimera Squad is a worthy addition for any turn-based strategy fan collection. Comics & Gaming Magazine gave the title in 8.5 out of 10 and called it a whole new dimension of strategy. Yesterday, 2K launched the Mafia Trilogy for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC. The Trilogy combines all 3 previously released Mafia titles into a single package curated by 2K's Hangar 13 development studio. Mafia II and Mafia III are currently available with the purchase of the Trilogy, while Mafia I will be delivered on August 28, as the game is being completely remade from the ground up, including new technology, new voice acting, new game mechanics and more. \n Starting tomorrow and through March 2021, 2K and Firaxis Games will begin their bimonthly release of 6 downloadable content packs as part of the all-new Sid Meier's Civilization VI  New Frontier Pass for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and PC. Later this year, the new Frontier Pass will come to mobile platform and each pack will be available for individual purchase. The new Frontier Pass will provide 8 new civilizations, 9 new leaders and a variety of new gameplay modes and content. In addition, Firaxis Games will also provide free updates between packs that feature new maps, scenarios, balance updates and more. On May 29, 2K will continue to bolster our offerings for the Nintendo Switch with some of their most popular and successful franchises, including BioShock: The Collection, the Borderlands Legendary Collection and the XCOM 2 Collection. In addition, on June 5, Private Division will release the critically acclaimed player choice-driven RPG, the Outer Worlds for the Switch. On June 16, Private Division will launch Disintegration for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC. Developed by V1 Interactive, the independent studio founded by Halo co-creator, Marcus Lehto, disintegration is a Sci-Fi first person shooter that blends real-time tactical elements to create an entirely new experience featuring a thrilling single player campaign as well as frenetic multiplayer gameplay, Disintegration is currently available for preorder, including an array of bonus cosmetic digital content for use in multiplayer modes. \n Early this week, Private Division and Squad announced a partnership with the European Space Agency to launch a new Kerbal Space Program update entitled Shared Horizons, which is planned to launch on PC on July 1, 2020. The update will also be available later this year on consoles. Shared Horizons celebrates the European Space Agency's outstanding contribution to space exploration and will be a free update for all players of the critically acclaimed space simulation game. On August 21, 2K will release PGA Tour 2K21 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PC and Stadia. Developed by HB Studios, PGA Tour 2K21 will feature PGA Tour professional, Justin Thomas, on the cover; officially licensed pro players, courses and gear; the most realistic course scanning to date; play-by-play commentary by Luke Elvy and Rich Beem; a new PGA TOUR Career Mode, online and local multiplayer; course and player customization; and online societies. In addition, throughout the coming months, 2K will release additional content offerings for NBA 2K20 and Borderlands 3. Additional details will be revealed shortly. And Rockstar Games will continue to provide an array of content and gameplay experiences for the vast open worlds of Grand Theft Auto Online and Red Dead Online, which continues to set engagement records. \n Selectively expanding our sports offerings remains an exciting growth opportunity for our company. In March, 2K announced a partnership with the NFL, encompassing multiple games. The partnership marks the return of football theme games to 2K's stable of renowned sports titles as well as an expansion of video game properties for the NFL. While specific game titles, developers and release dates will be revealed over time, we can confirm that these projects will be non-simulation football game experiences and will launch starting in calendar year 2021, during fiscal 2022. We're thrilled to be back in business with the NFL, which is one of the most successful sports brands in the world. We're confident that our forthcoming NFL offerings will be extremely fun, highly engaging and deeply social experiences. Last month, 2K announced that it would be extending the production time line for the next WWE 2K franchise simulation game to ensure that the development team at visual concepts has the opportunity to create the best experience possible. We also believe that there is a meaningful opportunity to expand our WWE offerings. To that end, 2K announced WWE 2K Battlegrounds, a completely new gaming experience that will feature arcade-style action and over-the-top superstar designs, environments and moves. WWE 2K Battlegrounds is being developed by Saber Interactive, the studio behind NBA 2K Playgrounds, and is scheduled to launch this fall. 2K will have more to share about the games in the coming months. The team at Private Division's new Seattle studio remains hard at work on Kerbal Space Program 2, the next-generation of the popular space simulation franchise. Due to delays from COVID-19, we are moving the release of the game for fall 2021 in order to provide the team with the time they need to create the best Kerbal Space Program experience possible. \n Turning to eSports. On May 5, the NBA 2K league began its 2020 season, planning at least 6 weeks of remote gameplay. All 23 NBA 2K league teams are participating in regular-season gameplay in their local markets from their homes with games simulcast live on the NBA 2K League's Twitch and YouTube channels. Details surrounding the remainder of the 2020 season schedule and structure will be shared as information becomes available. We are very excited about the continued progress and growth of the league, which has a long-term potential to enhance engagement and to be a driver of profits for our company. In order to build the scale of our organization, we continue to make significant investments to enhance our industry-leading portfolio of intellectual property. I'll now provide visibility into our long-term pipeline which is the strongest in our company's history. Note that we are only including full game releases and not add on content. Across our internally-owned labels and outside development studio partners, we currently have 93 titles planned for release over the next 5 years through fiscal 2025. Of the 93 titles, 63, are core gaming experiences, including 15 platform extensions of existing titles; 17 are mid-core or arcade-style experiences and 13 titles are casual experiences. 47 of these 93 titles are from existing franchises and 46 are from new intellectual properties. In terms of platforms, 72 of the 93 titles are planned for console, PC and/or streaming, including 7 that will also be available on mobile and 21 are planned specifically for mobile. With respect to business models, 67 of the 93 are games that are required to be purchased and 26 are free-to-play. Note that these figures reflect a snapshot of our current pipeline as it stands today. It is likely that some of these titles will not be developed through completion, and we will undoubtedly be adding new titles to our slate. \n As Strauss mentioned, fiscal 2021 will be a light new release year; however, given our strong pipeline and expectations for increasing recurring consumer spending, we expect sequential growth to resume in fiscal 2022. In closing, we are incredibly excited about the many long-term opportunities for our company to deliver the most captivating and engaging experiences in all of entertainment to audiences around the world. Whether capitalizing on new platforms, embracing new business models and distribution channels and expanding into emerging markets, 2K is exceedingly well positioned to generate value to consumers as well as growth and margin expansion for our shareholders. \n I'll now turn the call over to Lainie. \nLainie Goldstein: Thanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal 2020 results and then review our financial outlook for the first quarter and fiscal year 2021. Please note that additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release. I would also like to express my deepest condolences to those who have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. I'm also immensely proud of my colleagues around the world, who continue to support our organization with the utmost level of professionalism and dedication to both our business and consumers. As Strauss mentioned, our significantly better-than-expected fourth quarter results finished a terrific year for Take-Two, during which we achieved record results. \n Starting with the fourth quarter, total net bookings grew 49% to $729 million, as compared to our outlook of $540 million to $590 million. This outstanding result was driven by the exceptional performance of our titles in the fourth quarter. Recurrent consumer spending grew 47% and accounted for 61% of total net bookings as compared to our outlook of over 10% growth. Recurrent consumer spending exceeded our outlook due primarily to the record performance of NBA 2K and Grand Theft Auto Online. Digitally delivered net bookings grew 60% and accounted for 92% of the total as compared to our outlook of over 20% growth. This result exceeded our outlook due to the outperformance of recurrent consumer spending and digitally delivered full game sales. During the fourth quarter, 65% of sales of current generation console games were delivered digitally, up from 57% last year. GAAP net revenue grew 41% to $761 million and cost of goods sold increased to $396 million. Operating expenses increased by 9% to $243 million, due primarily to higher R&D expense and GAAP net income grew to $123 million or $1.07 per share as compared to $57 million or $0.50 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. \n Turning to our fiscal 2020 results. Total net bookings grew to a new record of $2.99 billion. This extraordinary result was driven by growth from NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V and the record-breaking launch of Borderlands 3. Recurrent consumer spending grew 34% to a new record and accounted for 51% of total net bookings. This exceeded our outlook of 25% growth. Digitally delivered net bookings grew 35% to a new record of $2.4 billion and accounted for 82% of the total. This too exceeded our outlook of 25% growth due to better-than-expected recurring concur spending and digitally delivered full game sales. During fiscal 2020, 55% of sales of current generation console games were delivered digitally, up from 38% last year. Non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow was $615 million as compared to our outlook of over $500 million. During fiscal 2020, we spent $53 million in capital expenditures. At fiscal year-end, our cash and short-term investments balance was over $2 billion. GAAP net revenue grew 16% to $3.09 billion and cost of goods sold increased to $1.5 billion. Operating expenses increased by 20% to $1.1 billion due primarily to higher R&D and marketing expenses. And GAAP net income grew to $404 million or $3.54 per share. Today, we gave a strong initial outlook for fiscal 2021. Our operating results are currently expected to be lower than fiscal 2020 due to the likely reschedule, coupled with continued investments in our future pipeline that should enable us to scale further and improve margins over time. \n When people began the shelter-at-home, we saw an increase in consumer engagement with our titles due to the online accessibility and the social nature of our products. We're continuing to experience this positive trend, which is reflected in our first quarter outlook. We have not included any additional benefit from this trend in our outlook for the back half of the year nor we assumed a deep recession or further delays in releases, which could affect our results. Now to our guidance. Starting with the fiscal first quarter. We project net bookings to range from $800 million to $850 million, up 93% from $422 million in the first quarter last year. This increase is being driven primarily by expected growth from Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, NBA 2K, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online and the Borderlands franchise. The largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, NBA 2K20, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online and Borderlands 3. We project recurrent consumer spending to grow by approximately 75%. This growth is expected to be driven primarily by Grand Theft Auto Online and NBA 2K20. We also expect digitally delivered net bookings to double. Our forecast assumes that 81% of our current generation console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 75% in the same period last year. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $775 million to $825 million and cost of goods sold to range from $392 million to $480 million. Operating expenses are expected to range from $267 million to $277 million. At the midpoint, this represents a 10% increase over last year, driven primarily by higher R&D expense and charitable contribution. And GAAP net income is expected to range from $103 million to $116 million or $0.90 to $1 per share.  For management reporting purposes, we expect our tax rate to be 16% throughout fiscal 2021. \n Turning to our outlook for the full fiscal year. We project net bookings to range from $2.55 billion to $2.65 billion. We expect growth from NBA 2K to be offset by lower results from Borderlands 3, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Grand Theft Auto V. Grand Theft Auto Online and Red Dead Online, excluding digital content bundles with the premium addition, are projected to be approximately in line with fiscal 2020. The largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Social Point's mobile games, Borderlands 3, Civilization VI and The Outer Worlds. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our label to be roughly 55% 2K, 35% Rockstar Games and 10% Private Division and Social Point. And we forecast our geographic net booking split to be about 60% United States and 40% international. We expect recurrent consumer spending to be roughly flat as compared to fiscal 2020, driven primarily by growth from NBA 2K, offset by lower allocated recurrent consumer spending from the Borderlands 3 and Red Dead Redemption 2 premium edition. The current consumer spending as a percentage of our business is expected to grow to approximately 60% versus 51% last year. We project digitally-delivered net bookings to decline by about 8%. As a percent of our business, digital is projected to represent 86%, up from 82% last year. Our forecast assumes that 68% of current generation console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 55% last year. We expect to generate more than $350 million in non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow, and we plan to deploy approximately $75 million for capital expenditures. The increase in capital expenditures over the prior year was primarily due to spending on studio and office build-outs and IT expense. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $2.63 to $2.73 billion and cost of goods sold to range from $1.19 to $1.24 billion. Total operating expenses are expected to range from $1.10 to $1.12 billion. At the midpoint, this represents a 1% decrease over the prior year, driven by lower marketing and stock compensation expenses, partially offset by higher R&D expense and charitable contribution. And we expect GAAP net income to range from $299 million to $329 million or $2.60 to $2.85 per share. \n In closing, fiscal 2020 was a record year for Take-Two, whether delivering incredible stand-alone entertainment experiences or providing engaging live services that captivate and connect communities around the world, our ability to serve our audiences has never been better. Fiscal 2021 promises to be another great year for our organization, and we are well positioned to both capitalize on the many opportunities within our industry and to navigate the uncertainties of these times. We have the strongest development pipeline in our company's history, and we expect sequential growth to resume in fiscal 2022. With our world-class creative assets, focus on operational excellence and disciplined approach to capital allocation, Take-Two is positioned to generate significant growth and margin expansion over the long term. \n Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Strauss. \nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for their hard work, their commitment to excellence and for delivering another outstanding year, particularly under these circumstances. For our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued support. We'll now take your questions. Operator? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird. \nColin Sebastian: Congrats on the strong quarter and hope you all are doing well. And also, thanks for the visibility on the pipeline, that's very helpful. I was wondering if you could add any color on the linearity of planned releases over that 3- or 4-year time period. And then, Strauss, maybe a bigger picture question, as the publisher of the world's most successful open world franchise, I wonder if you think there's a real business opportunity for a metaverse type environment. I know this is one of the more topical discussion points in certain industry circles right now, but with the next-gen on the horizon and given what we've just been going through, I wonder if you see any potential for that. \nStrauss Zelnick: By linearity, I think what you're asking, Colin, is, should we expect a gentle constant upward sloping curve of our releases, net bookings and cash flow? And the answer is, we really are aiming to have a handful or greater of new significant releases every year from existing franchises and new intellectual property. And as you could tell from Karl's description, we have plenty of great content coming that reflects that desire. But it doesn't mean that in any given year, there'll be linearity as you put it. And this year, fiscal '21 reflects that. The good news is that with our strong catalog, with our live service offerings and with our annual releases, we can have great strength even in a light year, even though it's not our goal to have a light year and then do even better in the year where we have -- we're able to launch a number of titles, which is our strategy and even better than that, if we're fortunate enough to have a blockbuster title, and we have some of those as well. So the variability in our results, I don't think will ever go away, not when you have some of the biggest entertainment properties on earth that don't come out every year, that can't come out every year, if they are to remain the biggest titles. So that's my view on linearity. Definitely, our goal is to be smoother and to grow. There will still be some variability. And while I'd love to answer your question more broadly, I really think that's more a label question than anything else. As soon as we get into the nature of the content and what we're doing in the future, those questions are better answered by our labels. We aim to give as much visibility as we can on these calls. But when we get into specific core creative matters, we'll announce that at the label level in due time. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. \nMichael Ng: I just had a question about the pipeline visibility. Could you just give us a sense of what the completion rate for games in development have been in the past? And could you just help us think about exactly what a core gaming experience is? I think you guys said 72 games for PC console streaming over the next 5 years, so it's 14 games a year on average. Is this just a significant increase in output relative to what you've done in the past? Or is there add-on content or something else in those numbers? \nKarl Slatoff: Just to answer the last part of your question first, we did not include add on content in those numbers. So those are all full game releases. And how we define is a bit of hard to, but how we define what our core experience is, what we really -- this is not necessarily to say to reflect that means the largest investments that we make. They tend to be bigger investments because core games tend to be bigger games and more engaging, targeting more core gamers, but it doesn't necessarily mean that. And as we said before, there is a lot of new IP. And generally speaking, you can really expect on the new IP front is much more risky. And generally speaking, our development budgets are going to be lower for new IP. So there'll be a wide range of investments across all of our types of releases we're doing, including core games. But the core games are really those looking for engaging experiences where you could play anywhere from 5 minutes to 5 hours at a time, right? So it's really things that set the -- AAA is probably the wrong way to commentate it because that does condensate investment. And that's not specifically what we're talking about here. Then the first part of the question, I forgot it was? \nMichael Ng: It was about the percentage of games in development that typically go through completion in the past? \nKarl Slatoff: Yes. I don't have a specific number there for you. Obviously, though, games that are coming out that are part of existing franchises, the rate of completion on that is obviously much, much higher. For new IPs, in various stages of development, I mean, for something that might be in a prototype stage, maybe you could be anywhere from -- it could be half the time or it could be 75% of the time, it really just depends. And we've got titles that are in various different stages of development in that pipeline that I suggested. And look, the more new projects that we have with new IP, you could probably expect that completion rate to be lower than if it was just all existing franchises. And we do have a lot of IP in there. And just to stress again, those numbers assume that all those things come out, which we know is not going to be the case, but it also assumes that nothing gets added to the release slate, which also is not going to be the case. So this is a larger pipeline than we've had before. We've been talking about this for quite some time. And our expectation is we'd like to keep up this velocity. It's really important for us to build scale, and this is one way that we're doing it. We need more to add that. \nOperator: Our next question is from Mario Lu with Barclays. \nX. Lu: I have one on NBA and one high-level question. So the one on NBA, I noticed that NBA 2K21 is still slated for fall 2020. Any thoughts you can provide on what will happen to that title in its release date if the NBA season continues to be suspended through the rest of the calendar year? And then, Strauss, you mentioned in the past that consumers on average watch 150 hours of linear TV and 45 hours of video games. How has that -- those hours increase or shifted during the current COVID environment? And what is your vision on what a post-COVID world will look like in terms of time spent on entertainment and video games? \nKarl Slatoff: Sure. This is Karl for NBA. Look, obviously, we're hoping that we're going to have an NBA season, and we have actually been through -- we've had history with NBA seasons not starting on time in the past. We've had a strike situation in the past. So we have familiarity with that. We don't want to say that it wouldn't impact the game at all, but we tend to be able to continue our business in a robust way even in the light of delays in season starting or in different kinds of season starting. So obviously, all of us, around the world, hope that we've got an NBA season. If we don't for some reason, I think the game as a standalone basis is a compelling experience, and we'll be fine. \nStrauss Zelnick: And this is Strauss. Regarding engagement, Activate, which is a leading media consultancy, just provided us with some research. All groups, all age groups, all demographics during this COVID shelter-in-place time period, time spent with gaming has increased about 39%, while time spent with video, linear entertainment, has increased about 43%. So they're in the same ballpark, but linear entertainment did increase more. But what's interesting is their research shows that post-COVID, once people return to their normal routines, they expect time spent with gaming to grow at a greater rate, about 14%, a sustained increase of about 14% versus about an 8% sustained increase in time spent with linear entertainment with video compared to pre-COVID-19 levels. \n So I think it represents a sea change, a shift, and we're going to begin to see meaningful growth in interactive entertainment that meaningfully outstrips the growth in linear entertainment, a trend that we've seen of late, of course. But I think that the lines are going to begin to diverge in the favor of interactive entertainment. And why do I think that? I think that sheltering at home, tragic as it is, sad as it is, has caused people to look for entertainment. And people have returned to interactive entertainment, new people have come to it, and they realize not only is it beautiful, not only is it engaging, not only is it fun and potentially competitive depending on the game, not only are there great stories and characters, but you can also be engaged with friends and communities all around the world. You can create new friends and communities all around the world while you're playing those games, and you can play with those people because you can connect with them. You can talk to them while you're playing over chat clients. So this is not a moment for celebration. We're deeply saddened by what's going on in the world, but the view -- I think the smart view is that all pre-existing trends have been accelerated by this crisis. And the shift to interactive entertainment and the growth in the sector is one of those trends. Now with all that said, we still have to execute every day. The growth in the sector is not going to help us if we don't make great games, if we don't deliver hits. \nOperator: Our next question is from Brian Fitzgerald with Wells Fargo. \nBrian Fitzgerald: I wanted to ask about what you see on a regional basis, if there's any differentiating engagement dynamics as we kind of meter through areas getting hard hit and then responding a bit, China, and then as places around the world return to some of the normal on the development side. How was your shift to work from home? Was that kind of lockstep, no real problems? And then what are you seeing as regions start to get back to work in Asia Pac? \nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks, Brian. I'm sorry for the delay. We're all working remotely. We don't see meaningful differences regionally. And so far, we have not seen meaningful changes as regions have gone back to work. For example, NBA 2K Online in China now has 49 million registered users, remains the #1 PC sports title in China, and it was up 25% year-over-year. I think it was up about 40% in the quarter. So we are not seeing meaningful differences. We are not seeing significant changes as people head back to work, but I think it is fully our expectation that -- and I just -- I reflected that in the research I just quoted, that this level of engagement will not stay the same as things return to normal, but we do think it will be higher than it was before. \n And in terms of working from home, look, we're very fortunate. We got a real wake-up call during Hurricane Sandy when we were not really particularly prepared and ever since then, which was quite some time ago. We've been a company, in addition to being a highly compliant company but a company that's on disaster recovery and we have state-of-the-art systems. In fact, we had planned, completely apart from this crisis, to have a work-from-home test day on March 12, and then it turns out -- we had to go live right about then. Anyhow, a week after that, we had 5,000 people effectively working from home, completely set up with all the equipment they needed. And because we know when people are connected online, of course, we could see that their productivity, if anything, had increased over working in the office and as people got used to sitting in one place with not much else to do in front of their desktops. We're fortunate. We have an incredibly talented, hardworking group of colleagues who really believe in this company's mission and who largely, I hope, mostly love working together. And we saw it as our mission to uplift people during this very difficult time. And we're very connected with our teams. We're talking to them all the time. I'm doing 3 town hall meetings next week on Zoom, 3 different time zones. I hope to connect with almost everyone who works at the company. \n So it's gone incredibly well and we really haven't missed a beat. Over time, I think it gets harder, but I still don't expect that we will miss a beat. But it does get harder. I'm not of the view that you start shutting down your real estate and everyone works from home and it's just as effective. I think it's pretty close to as effective in a pinch, in a crisis like this where you have no choice and people see it's their obligation to pull together and do great work, but there's no substitute for in-person collaboration and connection. \nOperator: Our next question is from Eric Sheridan with UBS. \nEric Sheridan: Maybe I can ask another sort of longer-term question on the back of some of the answers you've given on the current environment and what it means for engagement long term. What you've seen so far -- and I know it's a short period of time over the last couple of months and against pretty horrible backdrop, but has that changed at all your view with the way in which games should be distributed or maybe thinking about game development or even more thinking about game monetization over the long term as you see that type of increased engagement levels maybe playing out for interactive payment over the medium to long term, moving beyond just the quality of the content, also the form and manner of monetization to make sure they're capturing that surge in engagement? \nStrauss Zelnick: I'm sure there are many things that we have learned already and can learn. We haven't seen a massive change in our approach. And remember, when we talk about monetization, our goal is always to deliver a phenomenal entertainment experience, first and foremost. And we figure that if we do that, monetization takes care of itself. Our goal is not to constantly build monetization. Naturally, we need to get paid appropriately so we can share the proceeds with our talented colleagues and create a return for our investors and it's our job to do both. And we care about all of our constituents. So we're not a charitable organization. We're a for-profit organization. Obviously, we wouldn't be on the call if we weren't. But monetization isn't a problem for this organization. When we put out the best entertainment on earth, people show up for it. If we give them something that's incredibly valuable, they pay for it. We take it as axiomatic that the nature of an experience is the intersection of the quality of the experience and whether you feel you receive value for that experience. If you go to a phenomenal restaurant and have an incredible meal but the bill \n [Audio Gap] \n it should have cost, you're not going back. Even if you can afford it, even if you're price-inelastic, you're not going back. It just doesn't feel good. So we need to make sure that we always deliver more than what we charge, and that's the goal of our company and that's the goal of all of our labels. With all that said, with increased engagement comes increased monetization. You're seeing the effects of that in these results and in this initial guidance. \nOperator: Our next question is from Ryan Gee with Bank of America. \nRyan Gee: A couple of quick ones for you here, one for Lainie then maybe for Karl. Lainie, if we rewind back to fiscal '18, that's probably the last year you didn't really have any big new AAA titles beyond sports. I noticed that the profit margin, earnings per share was higher than what you're guiding to for fiscal '21, even at the high end. I know there are share count and tax rate differences going on, but maybe what's the 1 or 2 differences you would call us to as to why fiscal '21 maybe doesn't look as robust as compared to fiscal '18? \n And then, Karl, just on Mafia real quick. Can you remind us how material that franchise has been for Take-Two in the past? It sounds like this Trilogy is a quasi-new game with some ports and remasters along with it. So what's the opportunity we should really think about this type of game, the Trilogy, in '21? \nLainie Goldstein: Ryan, I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I can tell you off the top of my head, for sure. It's going to be higher R&D expense is going to definitely be one of those numbers that are much higher right now. As Karl talked about our release sched, our pipeline of titles has grown significantly over the last couple of years. And you've seen the detail about our titles and what we have coming out in the next 5 years. That has been something that we've worked on growing significantly. And as we look at the development, a lot of that is going to R&D expense, which has grown our operating expense line. And since that's going through the OpEx, that has affected our bottom line margin for the business and that -- as well as our overall G&A expense, which has grown for higher personnel and IT expense for cybersecurity as well as just overall IT expense for the business and our online games. I think that's probably where you're seeing the biggest increase for the overall business. \nKarl Slatoff: And in terms of the Mafia opportunity, Mafia has been an incredibly successful franchise for us over a long period of time between Mafia I, Mafia II and Mafia III. And just to give you an idea, Mafia III has already sold in -- about 7 million units or so. Mafia II is also incredibly successful and Mafia I as well. So it's been a significant contributor for us. We're really excited about the Trilogy. It is the same 3 games but it is -- there's obviously much more improvements that are occurring with the game. The Mafia I is going to be basically completely remade -- I mean it's not fully really remade but there's going to be new tech, there's going to be new voice acting, new game mechanics and a lot more than that. So there is quite a bit of work that's going into bringing out the Trilogy. And we've had great success with bringing out these collections. And again, even though they're not brand-new experiences, there's always a new audience to catch and then there's always a new experience depending on the generation that each of those individual titles came out where even existing fans can enjoy it in a different way. So it's been meaningful for us as a franchise, and we're really excited about the Trilogy coming out. \nOperator: Next question is from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. \nBrian Nowak: Two on GTA. So recently, there's been an offering on the Epic Games store where people have been able to get GTA for free on PC. Can you update us on your thinking about lowering barriers to entry to some of these big RCS-driven games, whether it's NBA 2K or obviously this recent thing with GTA? Presumably, getting people into the ecosystem, driving the network effects and engaging them and ultimately monetizing that engagement is such a big part of the business. How do you think about the risk/reward of bringing people in for free versus charging them for upfront access? And has that changed at all recently? And then just following up on something came up earlier in the call. You mentioned 15 platform extensions. Is GTA V one of those 15? \nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks, Brian, for your question. I think your question was also pretty good answer. It's sort of all of the above. Grand Theft Auto V is a 7-year old title. Obviously, it's been offered at lower price points than its initial release price point. And we do have a -- obviously an online offering, and there are monetization opportunities within that offering. So specific promotions with specific outlets with specific deals behind them can make sense to us. And we do believe that it's a great idea, in general, to grow the audience, grow engagement, grow users. And with that will come more net bookings and will come more profits. So that was the thesis behind it. We're very, very selective in those kinds of promotions, and they typically are only available for limited periods of time when they make sense for catalog titles. And we haven't yet made any announcements that we -- that are reflected in today's release. And as you know, we don't talk about specific new titles at these calls. We leave those discussions to the labels. \nOperator: Our next question is from Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein. \nTodd Juenger: For either Karl or Strauss, whoever feels like it. I hope you don't mind me going back to the engagement question yet one more time, but I'd love to explore it this way. When you think about the increased engagement recently, can you help us understand how much of that you think is proportionately driven by existing gamers who are playing more versus perhaps lapsed gamers who have come back versus perhaps new people to gaming? And any differences in that answer based on either platform, PC versus console versus mobile, or by your major franchises. \nKarl Slatoff: It's Karl. In terms of engagement, I'm probably going to give you an answer that's not overly satisfying, but the answer to your question is it's really both. It's all of those things. It's new gamers. It's existing gamers. It's people coming back to the franchises. And we track all of that. We don't publicize it but we track all of that. And really, what keeps people coming -- if they're coming back -- and even keeps new people coming in, is a constant release of new content. I mean because every time we come out with new content, there is ultimately some publicity around that and it brings people back in the franchise. It keeps people engaged who are currently engaged with the franchise, and it also brings new folks in. So it really is all of the above. And I really haven't seen that change so much specifically as it relates to anything going on during the pandemic, but obviously, there are other avenues open to us to bring new folks in. I mean we're always playing with pricing models. We mentioned we're doing things like putting things into subscription-oriented services or getting things away for a certain time. All of that generates new excitement and engagement for our franchises and for our games. That is -- hopefully continues well into the future. It isn't just a temporary thing, and we've seen that time over time. \n And I'd like to point out we're still really in experimental mode. We're getting better and better and our investment in data analytics really allows us to show -- to see in real-time what these things do for us. Where do we get the most engagement? How does a new player coming in, in a free context or subscription service context or in a low price context compare to someone who came in paying full price? What does that cohort look like? And we're getting better and better at analyzing that so that we optimize all of our promotional activity to maximize our economic opportunities. \nOperator: Our next question is from Eric Handler with MKM Partners. \nEric Handler: Strauss, when you look at -- given all of the games that you have in your pipeline now, I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about scale and infrastructure. And if even half of those games come to fruition, do you have everything you need in place in terms of personnel to effectively distribute these games and market these games? \nStrauss Zelnick: I thought you were going to ask do we have everything in place to develop, and we still will be building up our development teams. In terms of marketing and distribution, yes, I mean one of the reasons that we've talked about the need for scale in order to have competitive operating margins. We already have competitive gross margins, highly competitive gross margins. To have competitive operating margins, you need scale with the same level of success of your games, and that's our goal here. But the reason you get those higher operating margins with more net bookings is because you don't build up your fixed overhead and your fixed overhead would typically include marketing and distribution expenses. I fully expect that our distribution will become more efficient as the world moves more to digital distribution. We already have a highly efficient distribution mechanism. And yes, with volume, you might increase your marketing head count modestly but not all that significantly. Naturally, our development head count is part of the cost of making a game. And you should expect with volume that our development expense goes up, and you're already seeing that. \nEric Handler: Great. And just as a follow-up, when you think about capital allocation and given all the cash that you have on hand, it doesn't seem like there's much going on from an industry M&A standpoint at this time. But given all the games you have in the pipeline, do you think it lessens the need for you to be thinking about M&A? Or how are you thinking about balancing what you're currently developing versus external opportunities? \nStrauss Zelnick: We still feel that our capital is used best in 3 different ways: First, to support organic growth. It has been an incredibly successful story for this company. This year is no exception. We've really only done one meaningful acquisition, which is Social Point. The second is to support a return of capital to shareholders, and we've done a great deal of that selectively and we've done it through buybacks. They've been opportunistic, and I think the highest price we ever paid was around $99, if I'm not mistaken. So obviously, so far, we've called that reasonably well. And then we've reserved capital and incredibly strong balance sheet for the possibility of very selective inorganic growth driven by acquisition. We're very disciplined. We're looking only for accretive deals. And you're right, there aren't a lot of opportunities. We're hopeful that there will be some opportunity that would move our company forward, potentially diversify its operations a bit and bring in intellectual property and talent. Those have been our rubrics. \n We expect to stay squarely within interactive entertainment. You shouldn't expect us to diversify outside of it. And those opportunities are few and far between but they do exist. And done right, the benefit of that would be to have highly competitive operating margins. So we don't need scale for scale's sake. But if we want to be the best in the business, and we do, then our financial results have to reflect that. And that means we have to have highly competitive operating margins, and the only thing standing in the way of that for us is scale. But again, if you buy scale in a foolish way, it won't help you. And if you buy scale and then can't maintain the success of that organization, thereby ruining your gross margins, you obviously would not benefit your operating margin. Said another way, if you're going to do an acquisition, it has to be smart, it has to be accretive relatively quickly, if not immediately. And then post closing, you've got to integrate the business soundly and run the business successfully in order for it to make sense. That's a tall order. That's why most corporate acquisitions fail. That's why we're so incredibly disciplined. But we are of the view that there will be opportunities and, certainly coming out of this crisis, there may be more opportunities than we otherwise would have expected. \nOperator: Our next question is from Matthew Thornton with SunTrust. \nMatthew Thornton: So maybe first question, just coming back to the pipeline title count that you discussed earlier. I'm wondering if you have a label breakdown. I don't think you talked about it in terms of breakdown by label but wondering if you have one. \n Secondly, recurring-type titles, I guess when we think about that, that total count, would -- something that's recurring like an NBA 2K, which will come out obviously 5 times over the next 5 years, is that counted 5 times? Or is that -- is it counted 1 time? \n And then third question, Strauss, just curious how you think about growth bogeys over a multiyear time frame. Do you kind of look at the growth rate, maybe blockbuster launch -- a blockbuster launch? Or is it over a 5- year frame or -- just curious how you think about growth milestones when you look at the business over a multiyear lens. \nKarl Slatoff: It's Karl. The -- yes, you're right, we did not break it down by label but there are releases obviously from all of the labels. We don't really have anything to share in that regard, but there are quite a few releases from all of our labels, including Private Division, 2K, Rockstar and Social Point as well. \n And in terms of the breakdown, how that works, so if there is a sequel that comes out, if there's a franchise that -- something that comes out every year, this is our -- a view of our entire pipeline. So yes, that would be counted. \nStrauss Zelnick: And in terms of how we look at growth, good news is we're operators. We're also investors. We also are big shareholders. We look at it exactly the way you would. We're looking for growth in net bookings. We're looking for growth in EBITDA. We're looking for growth in recurrent consumer spending because it reflects solidity in the business. It's much less volatile than initial releases could be. And finally, we're looking for growth in our stock price. And that's how we're judged. So we're judged from an economic point of view, largely on total shareholder return, as we should be. We're not judged at all on EPS, which I think is a terrible way to judge a management team for obvious reasons because you can fiddle around with it. Total shareholder return, there's no place to hide and that's how we're judged. So I think in exactly the way you would look at it, scale, because it's correlated with operating margins in the way that I said earlier, the scale of your operating profit or your EBITDA or your operating cash flow and, of course, your stock price. And on those metrics, we've done very well indeed for quite some time. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Hickey with The Benchmark Company. \nMichael Hickey: I was curious to your view on the economy over your fiscal year '21, '22. I think you said you didn't see a deep recession, but I'm curious what sort of recovery you expect and how unemployment or other factors you look at could impact online game sales or live service as it relates to your guidance. \nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks, Mike. We're -- our expectations for fiscal '21 have not been adjusted for the recent success that we've had in this tragic period in the back half of the year. So we're not counting on this level of engagement and spending to continue. Equally though, we are not planning for a deep, prolonged consumer recession. So I would say if you had to peg it, we're right there in the middle, where -- which is where we probably should be since we can't call it. My own personal view, which does not influence our numbers, is that we're going to see a relatively rapid consumer-driven recovery when the dust clears. And my own view is that dust is probably going to clear sooner than many people think. But I'm an optimist and we don't plan based on my opinions. So I would say we're right down the middle that we assume relatively stable economic conditions that if we were surprised and there were deep, ongoing consumer recession, we would not be [ influenced from it ] and our results could be negatively influenced by. And equally, if there was a massive unexpected expansion, that could benefit our results. So I think we're assuming relative stability. We are not assuming continued enhanced engagement and monetization, the likes of which we have seen recently. \nMichael Hickey: That's helpful. The last one from me. On fiscal year '22, you noted your expectation for sequential growth. And of course, you guys tend to be very conservative, which is a good thing. Maybe I missed it, but broadly speaking, can you sort of talk to the drivers of growth for fiscal year '22? And obviously, it looks like half the year is in your first quarter guidance for '21. So we think there's probably upside there. Do you expect to grow over fiscal year '20 in '22? \nStrauss Zelnick: Yes. Sorry. I think probably not much to add. We expect sequential growth year-over-year in fiscal '22, and that is driven by the release schedule that Karl described in the pipeline that we're investing in. So we expect some releases coming out of that pipeline in fiscal '22, and we expect them to generate sequential growth, so as simple as that. \nOperator: The next question is from Doug Creutz with Cowen and Company. \nDouglas Creutz: I went back 10 to 15 years ago. There were a lot of successful sports franchises out there. Most of the major leagues supported multiple simulation and arcade titles. You had an MLB title. There was golf, tennis, extreme sports, so on and so on. You go to today and there's basically 3 enormous titles in sports in the market, including NBA 2K, but few others that are kind of hanging on by the skin of their teeth and that's it, presumably the other ones on the way because it became uneconomical to make them at diminishing unit numbers. You've got a PGA title. You're working on some NFL titles. You're continuing to invest in WWE. Is it simply a function of getting the cost structure down to a level where they can be profitable at relatively low unit numbers? Or do you see something in the market where you think there are opportunities opening up that maybe didn't exist 2, 3, 4 years ago? \nKarl Slatoff: Well, look, there are certain sports obviously that are not going to drive the audiences that you're going to get with, for example, NBA or FIFA or with football. Obviously, we're very excited about moving back into football. The NFL is one of the most powerful brands in the world. We've been in the NFL business before. We've excelled in the NFL business before. Although we're not going into the simulation space, we're very excited about what we can bring -- that we can bring to that market. So we think there's significant opportunity for us to expand within that market, just where we are now. But you're right, some of the other smaller sports, you're not going to be able to spend the kind of money that you can on the bigger sports to drive your economics. You need to balance it out. So by definition, smaller audiences, smaller sports, you're going to need to balance it with smaller development budgets. But that doesn't mean there's not a lot of opportunity to be -- to make -- to generate significant economics because once you actually get people into -- there -- obviously, there's correlation between the popularity of the sport and the game itself, but it's not necessarily limited to that. So people who aren't golf fans can play golf games. That -- we've seen that over and over again. And we think that there's an opportunity for us to go into some of these sports and do very, very well, of course, with a reasonable budget, but to bring best content we can to the consumer, engage them and then the economics will come. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Ray Stochel with Consumer Edge Research. \nRaymond Stochel: A high-level question on this topic of scale and I guess how you guys are thinking about investments in your forward pipeline. I'd love to know more about your green-light process. And I guess if you look at the last 10 or so years plus of video gaming, there's been a lot of focus on really growing in that head content. Even you yourself have seen a lot of success with GTA and NBA. And it does seem like you have a lot of smaller titles or tuck-in titles or AA titles that are in your pipeline. So how do we think about you green-lighting those titles in addition to what you just talked about with things like NBA and PGA? And what do the unit economics look like for those titles relative to some of the big AAA releases? And I guess is that something that could eventually lead to a lower margin structure on a per unit basis, which would sort of limit the upside of what you're talking about with scale? \nKarl Slatoff: Yes. Well, I think what you're really talking about is how -- our approach to new IP because for the most part, we have leaned in the industry, generally speaking, and obviously at Take-Two as well because we've got such huge, powerful franchises. We've leaned into those franchises and generated significant economic results driven by the consumer engagement with them. But we still think it's critical to invest in new IP to keep that fresh pipeline going because you never know where your next hit is going to come from. But you can't -- but you're right, you can't invest in the same way that you do in your franchise. So you do have to take a different approach to it. We're always continuing to seek new, innovative ways to enhance our product portfolio, including bringing out new IP that has a chance to be successful. \n And it doesn't necessarily have to happen in the first iteration. I always like to use the example of Bruce Springsteen. It took him a long time to even hit a gold album. It took him a few releases to get there. You need to curate these front titles. So the idea is take as many shots as you can to do so in such a way that if it doesn't work out, you don't lose your shirt but then you create some kind of reaction. There's something great about something that you did. And maybe the first one isn't economically powerful, but the idea for us is always to grow iteration after iteration. So on the second one, when we know we've got an audience, we can invest a lot more and expand that marketing budget, expand that development budget and push that franchise forward. That's what franchise development is all about. You don't have to come out off the bat and be successful at the same level as a Grand Theft Auto or an NBA day 1. If you take that approach, you'll never launch anything new. I mean that's just shortsighted. And it's tempting. There's no doubt about it to do that because it's very, very efficient and the margin structures are enormous, but I think we're limiting ourselves creatively and economically if we take that path. And that's not what we're doing. But we have to be mindful about our investment levels and be patient and look at franchise development over the long term. I mean our franchise has -- almost in every single case, iteration -- release after release, have grown. They don't go the other way, and there's a reason for that because we take the long view. \nRaymond Stochel: Got it. And then as you have success with some of these new IPs that you'll be putting out there, I mean how do you think about -- let's say you do have a blockbuster hit off the jump. Can you reposition some of your resources towards recurrent spending and rebuilding that model immediately? Or do you expect to sort of keep these studio paths separate, meaning -- let's say you do have something that all of a sudden is in the tier of maybe not Grand Theft Auto but maybe of Borderlands, do you reposition other studios to sort of attack the recurrent spending opportunity? Or do you remain on this pipeline path that you've laid out? \nKarl Slatoff: Well, to the extent that you've got a title that takes off unexpectedly, the -- you certainly can pivot resources on the go. And if there is a significant opportunity to do so through recurrent consumer spending, then you can absolutely do that and you can extend the life of a franchise. I mean Borderlands is actually a great example because when Borderlands 2 took off -- Borderlands 1 was successful. Borderlands 2 took off like crazy. Our DLC plan expanded on a daily basis. I mean I don't remember what our original DLC plan, but it wasn't 10 to 12 releases, which is where we ended up. So you can always invest more over time and you can obviously do that in a game where you've got a robust micro-transaction model. But what you can't do is you can't change the nature of the game. That would be suicide because the reason you have a hit is because people like the way it is. So if you get the audience going and you change the nature of the game surely with the motivation of creating -- of extracting economic value from the consumer, you run the risk of screwing up the franchise. And again, that's not something that we would do. \nOperator: Our next question is from Alex Giaimo with Jefferies. \nAlexander Giaimo: Just for Lainie, circling back to the earlier question on margins and how it relates to the full year guide, I understand the color around R&D expenses being up, but it also looks like the guidance is implying gross margins that are a bit lighter than we expected. Curious if that's just conservatism or something specific to call out. We would think that you would see some gross margin improvement especially with the accelerated shift we're seeing in digital right now. Any color there would be helpful. \nLainie Goldstein: Sure. So the gross margin is slightly down, but basically it's flat from last year. So we do have -- we are seeing it come up a little bit from the digital and the recurrent consumer spending mix because recurrent consumer spending is a higher-margin business for us, but that's being offset by having less new releases this year. So that's why we're seeing it flat. But it's early in the year. So we'll see how we go towards the latter part of the year and the recurrent consumer spending continues to stay strong for us. We should hopefully see that lift up a little bit towards the latter part of the year. \nOperator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call over to management for closing comments. \nStrauss Zelnick: Well, we just want to thank everyone for attending the call. Once again, we want to extend our best wishes to everyone who's listening today for your health, for your loved ones' health and our condolences for any losses that you or your loved ones have suffered. We know this is an incredibly challenging time. We feel blessed to be able to be of some small consolation by bringing light entertainment to people. We're proud of what we do. We're grateful to be able to do it. And once again, I want to express my gratitude to our colleagues for their dedication for showing up with smile on their face for doing such amazing work. The reason we're able to have these extraordinary results is solely a function of that work. So thank you so much for joining us, and our very best wishes. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Thanks, Strauss. I'd like to join Strauss in expressing our condolences to all those who have lost loved ones and are facing adversity during this global pandemic. We at Take-Two are very fortunate to have colleagues around the world who continue to dedicate themselves to our mission despite very difficult and uncertain times. I'll now discuss our recent and upcoming releases. On April 24, 2K and games released XCOM: Chimera Squad, an all-new standalone title in the award-winning, turn-based, XCOM tactical series. Set 5 years after the events of XCOM 2, Chimera Squad provides a dynamic and unique experience for fans and new players. The title has received strong reviews, including 4.5 out of 5 stars from Screen Rant, who said Chimera Squad is a worthy addition for any turn-based strategy fan collection. Comics & Gaming Magazine gave the title in 8.5 out of 10 and called it a whole new dimension of strategy. Yesterday, 2K launched the Mafia Trilogy for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC. The Trilogy combines all 3 previously released Mafia titles into a single package curated by 2K's Hangar 13 development studio. Mafia II and Mafia III are currently available with the purchase of the Trilogy, while Mafia I will be delivered on August 28, as the game is being completely remade from the ground up, including new technology, new voice acting, new game mechanics and more. \n Starting tomorrow and through March 2021, 2K and Firaxis Games will begin their bimonthly release of 6 downloadable content packs as part of the all-new Sid Meier's Civilization VI  New Frontier Pass for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and PC. Later this year, the new Frontier Pass will come to mobile platform and each pack will be available for individual purchase. The new Frontier Pass will provide 8 new civilizations, 9 new leaders and a variety of new gameplay modes and content. In addition, Firaxis Games will also provide free updates between packs that feature new maps, scenarios, balance updates and more. On May 29, 2K will continue to bolster our offerings for the Nintendo Switch with some of their most popular and successful franchises, including BioShock: The Collection, the Borderlands Legendary Collection and the XCOM 2 Collection. In addition, on June 5, Private Division will release the critically acclaimed player choice-driven RPG, the Outer Worlds for the Switch. On June 16, Private Division will launch Disintegration for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC. Developed by V1 Interactive, the independent studio founded by Halo co-creator, Marcus Lehto, disintegration is a Sci-Fi first person shooter that blends real-time tactical elements to create an entirely new experience featuring a thrilling single player campaign as well as frenetic multiplayer gameplay, Disintegration is currently available for preorder, including an array of bonus cosmetic digital content for use in multiplayer modes. \n Early this week, Private Division and Squad announced a partnership with the European Space Agency to launch a new Kerbal Space Program update entitled Shared Horizons, which is planned to launch on PC on July 1, 2020. The update will also be available later this year on consoles. Shared Horizons celebrates the European Space Agency's outstanding contribution to space exploration and will be a free update for all players of the critically acclaimed space simulation game. On August 21, 2K will release PGA Tour 2K21 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PC and Stadia. Developed by HB Studios, PGA Tour 2K21 will feature PGA Tour professional, Justin Thomas, on the cover; officially licensed pro players, courses and gear; the most realistic course scanning to date; play-by-play commentary by Luke Elvy and Rich Beem; a new PGA TOUR Career Mode, online and local multiplayer; course and player customization; and online societies. In addition, throughout the coming months, 2K will release additional content offerings for NBA 2K20 and Borderlands 3. Additional details will be revealed shortly. And Rockstar Games will continue to provide an array of content and gameplay experiences for the vast open worlds of Grand Theft Auto Online and Red Dead Online, which continues to set engagement records. \n Selectively expanding our sports offerings remains an exciting growth opportunity for our company. In March, 2K announced a partnership with the NFL, encompassing multiple games. The partnership marks the return of football theme games to 2K's stable of renowned sports titles as well as an expansion of video game properties for the NFL. While specific game titles, developers and release dates will be revealed over time, we can confirm that these projects will be non-simulation football game experiences and will launch starting in calendar year 2021, during fiscal 2022. We're thrilled to be back in business with the NFL, which is one of the most successful sports brands in the world. We're confident that our forthcoming NFL offerings will be extremely fun, highly engaging and deeply social experiences. Last month, 2K announced that it would be extending the production time line for the next WWE 2K franchise simulation game to ensure that the development team at visual concepts has the opportunity to create the best experience possible. We also believe that there is a meaningful opportunity to expand our WWE offerings. To that end, 2K announced WWE 2K Battlegrounds, a completely new gaming experience that will feature arcade-style action and over-the-top superstar designs, environments and moves. WWE 2K Battlegrounds is being developed by Saber Interactive, the studio behind NBA 2K Playgrounds, and is scheduled to launch this fall. 2K will have more to share about the games in the coming months. The team at Private Division's new Seattle studio remains hard at work on Kerbal Space Program 2, the next-generation of the popular space simulation franchise. Due to delays from COVID-19, we are moving the release of the game for fall 2021 in order to provide the team with the time they need to create the best Kerbal Space Program experience possible. \n Turning to eSports. On May 5, the NBA 2K league began its 2020 season, planning at least 6 weeks of remote gameplay. All 23 NBA 2K league teams are participating in regular-season gameplay in their local markets from their homes with games simulcast live on the NBA 2K League's Twitch and YouTube channels. Details surrounding the remainder of the 2020 season schedule and structure will be shared as information becomes available. We are very excited about the continued progress and growth of the league, which has a long-term potential to enhance engagement and to be a driver of profits for our company. In order to build the scale of our organization, we continue to make significant investments to enhance our industry-leading portfolio of intellectual property. I'll now provide visibility into our long-term pipeline which is the strongest in our company's history. Note that we are only including full game releases and not add on content. Across our internally-owned labels and outside development studio partners, we currently have 93 titles planned for release over the next 5 years through fiscal 2025. Of the 93 titles, 63, are core gaming experiences, including 15 platform extensions of existing titles; 17 are mid-core or arcade-style experiences and 13 titles are casual experiences. 47 of these 93 titles are from existing franchises and 46 are from new intellectual properties. In terms of platforms, 72 of the 93 titles are planned for console, PC and/or streaming, including 7 that will also be available on mobile and 21 are planned specifically for mobile. With respect to business models, 67 of the 93 are games that are required to be purchased and 26 are free-to-play. Note that these figures reflect a snapshot of our current pipeline as it stands today. It is likely that some of these titles will not be developed through completion, and we will undoubtedly be adding new titles to our slate. \n As Strauss mentioned, fiscal 2021 will be a light new release year; however, given our strong pipeline and expectations for increasing recurring consumer spending, we expect sequential growth to resume in fiscal 2022. In closing, we are incredibly excited about the many long-term opportunities for our company to deliver the most captivating and engaging experiences in all of entertainment to audiences around the world. Whether capitalizing on new platforms, embracing new business models and distribution channels and expanding into emerging markets, 2K is exceedingly well positioned to generate value to consumers as well as growth and margin expansion for our shareholders. \n I'll now turn the call over to Lainie. Just to answer the last part of your question first, we did not include add on content in those numbers. So those are all full game releases. And how we define is a bit of hard to, but how we define what our core experience is, what we really -- this is not necessarily to say to reflect that means the largest investments that we make. They tend to be bigger investments because core games tend to be bigger games and more engaging, targeting more core gamers, but it doesn't necessarily mean that. And as we said before, there is a lot of new IP. And generally speaking, you can really expect on the new IP front is much more risky. And generally speaking, our development budgets are going to be lower for new IP. So there'll be a wide range of investments across all of our types of releases we're doing, including core games. But the core games are really those looking for engaging experiences where you could play anywhere from 5 minutes to 5 hours at a time, right? So it's really things that set the -- AAA is probably the wrong way to commentate it because that does condensate investment. And that's not specifically what we're talking about here. Then the first part of the question, I forgot it was? Yes. I don't have a specific number there for you. Obviously, though, games that are coming out that are part of existing franchises, the rate of completion on that is obviously much, much higher. For new IPs, in various stages of development, I mean, for something that might be in a prototype stage, maybe you could be anywhere from -- it could be half the time or it could be 75% of the time, it really just depends. And we've got titles that are in various different stages of development in that pipeline that I suggested. And look, the more new projects that we have with new IP, you could probably expect that completion rate to be lower than if it was just all existing franchises. And we do have a lot of IP in there. And just to stress again, those numbers assume that all those things come out, which we know is not going to be the case, but it also assumes that nothing gets added to the release slate, which also is not going to be the case. So this is a larger pipeline than we've had before. We've been talking about this for quite some time. And our expectation is we'd like to keep up this velocity. It's really important for us to build scale, and this is one way that we're doing it. We need more to add that. Sure. This is Karl for NBA. Look, obviously, we're hoping that we're going to have an NBA season, and we have actually been through -- we've had history with NBA seasons not starting on time in the past. We've had a strike situation in the past. So we have familiarity with that. We don't want to say that it wouldn't impact the game at all, but we tend to be able to continue our business in a robust way even in the light of delays in season starting or in different kinds of season starting. So obviously, all of us, around the world, hope that we've got an NBA season. If we don't for some reason, I think the game as a standalone basis is a compelling experience, and we'll be fine. And in terms of the Mafia opportunity, Mafia has been an incredibly successful franchise for us over a long period of time between Mafia I, Mafia II and Mafia III. And just to give you an idea, Mafia III has already sold in -- about 7 million units or so. Mafia II is also incredibly successful and Mafia I as well. So it's been a significant contributor for us. We're really excited about the Trilogy. It is the same 3 games but it is -- there's obviously much more improvements that are occurring with the game. The Mafia I is going to be basically completely remade -- I mean it's not fully really remade but there's going to be new tech, there's going to be new voice acting, new game mechanics and a lot more than that. So there is quite a bit of work that's going into bringing out the Trilogy. And we've had great success with bringing out these collections. And again, even though they're not brand-new experiences, there's always a new audience to catch and then there's always a new experience depending on the generation that each of those individual titles came out where even existing fans can enjoy it in a different way. So it's been meaningful for us as a franchise, and we're really excited about the Trilogy coming out. It's Karl. In terms of engagement, I'm probably going to give you an answer that's not overly satisfying, but the answer to your question is it's really both. It's all of those things. It's new gamers. It's existing gamers. It's people coming back to the franchises. And we track all of that. We don't publicize it but we track all of that. And really, what keeps people coming -- if they're coming back -- and even keeps new people coming in, is a constant release of new content. I mean because every time we come out with new content, there is ultimately some publicity around that and it brings people back in the franchise. It keeps people engaged who are currently engaged with the franchise, and it also brings new folks in. So it really is all of the above. And I really haven't seen that change so much specifically as it relates to anything going on during the pandemic, but obviously, there are other avenues open to us to bring new folks in. I mean we're always playing with pricing models. We mentioned we're doing things like putting things into subscription-oriented services or getting things away for a certain time. All of that generates new excitement and engagement for our franchises and for our games. That is -- hopefully continues well into the future. It isn't just a temporary thing, and we've seen that time over time. \n And I'd like to point out we're still really in experimental mode. We're getting better and better and our investment in data analytics really allows us to show -- to see in real-time what these things do for us. Where do we get the most engagement? How does a new player coming in, in a free context or subscription service context or in a low price context compare to someone who came in paying full price? What does that cohort look like? And we're getting better and better at analyzing that so that we optimize all of our promotional activity to maximize our economic opportunities. It's Karl. The -- yes, you're right, we did not break it down by label but there are releases obviously from all of the labels. We don't really have anything to share in that regard, but there are quite a few releases from all of our labels, including Private Division, 2K, Rockstar and Social Point as well. \n And in terms of the breakdown, how that works, so if there is a sequel that comes out, if there's a franchise that -- something that comes out every year, this is our -- a view of our entire pipeline. So yes, that would be counted. Well, look, there are certain sports obviously that are not going to drive the audiences that you're going to get with, for example, NBA or FIFA or with football. Obviously, we're very excited about moving back into football. The NFL is one of the most powerful brands in the world. We've been in the NFL business before. We've excelled in the NFL business before. Although we're not going into the simulation space, we're very excited about what we can bring -- that we can bring to that market. So we think there's significant opportunity for us to expand within that market, just where we are now. But you're right, some of the other smaller sports, you're not going to be able to spend the kind of money that you can on the bigger sports to drive your economics. You need to balance it out. So by definition, smaller audiences, smaller sports, you're going to need to balance it with smaller development budgets. But that doesn't mean there's not a lot of opportunity to be -- to make -- to generate significant economics because once you actually get people into -- there -- obviously, there's correlation between the popularity of the sport and the game itself, but it's not necessarily limited to that. So people who aren't golf fans can play golf games. That -- we've seen that over and over again. And we think that there's an opportunity for us to go into some of these sports and do very, very well, of course, with a reasonable budget, but to bring best content we can to the consumer, engage them and then the economics will come. Yes. Well, I think what you're really talking about is how -- our approach to new IP because for the most part, we have leaned in the industry, generally speaking, and obviously at Take-Two as well because we've got such huge, powerful franchises. We've leaned into those franchises and generated significant economic results driven by the consumer engagement with them. But we still think it's critical to invest in new IP to keep that fresh pipeline going because you never know where your next hit is going to come from. But you can't -- but you're right, you can't invest in the same way that you do in your franchise. So you do have to take a different approach to it. We're always continuing to seek new, innovative ways to enhance our product portfolio, including bringing out new IP that has a chance to be successful. \n And it doesn't necessarily have to happen in the first iteration. I always like to use the example of Bruce Springsteen. It took him a long time to even hit a gold album. It took him a few releases to get there. You need to curate these front titles. So the idea is take as many shots as you can to do so in such a way that if it doesn't work out, you don't lose your shirt but then you create some kind of reaction. There's something great about something that you did. And maybe the first one isn't economically powerful, but the idea for us is always to grow iteration after iteration. So on the second one, when we know we've got an audience, we can invest a lot more and expand that marketing budget, expand that development budget and push that franchise forward. That's what franchise development is all about. You don't have to come out off the bat and be successful at the same level as a Grand Theft Auto or an NBA day 1. If you take that approach, you'll never launch anything new. I mean that's just shortsighted. And it's tempting. There's no doubt about it to do that because it's very, very efficient and the margin structures are enormous, but I think we're limiting ourselves creatively and economically if we take that path. And that's not what we're doing. But we have to be mindful about our investment levels and be patient and look at franchise development over the long term. I mean our franchise has -- almost in every single case, iteration -- release after release, have grown. They don't go the other way, and there's a reason for that because we take the long view. Well, to the extent that you've got a title that takes off unexpectedly, the -- you certainly can pivot resources on the go. And if there is a significant opportunity to do so through recurrent consumer spending, then you can absolutely do that and you can extend the life of a franchise. I mean Borderlands is actually a great example because when Borderlands 2 took off -- Borderlands 1 was successful. Borderlands 2 took off like crazy. Our DLC plan expanded on a daily basis. I mean I don't remember what our original DLC plan, but it wasn't 10 to 12 releases, which is where we ended up. So you can always invest more over time and you can obviously do that in a game where you've got a robust micro-transaction model. But what you can't do is you can't change the nature of the game. That would be suicide because the reason you have a hit is because people like the way it is. So if you get the audience going and you change the nature of the game surely with the motivation of creating -- of extracting economic value from the consumer, you run the risk of screwing up the franchise. And again, that's not something that we would do."

            "name": "Lainie Goldstein",
            "content": "Thanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal 2020 results and then review our financial outlook for the first quarter and fiscal year 2021. Please note that additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release. I would also like to express my deepest condolences to those who have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. I'm also immensely proud of my colleagues around the world, who continue to support our organization with the utmost level of professionalism and dedication to both our business and consumers. As Strauss mentioned, our significantly better-than-expected fourth quarter results finished a terrific year for Take-Two, during which we achieved record results. \n Starting with the fourth quarter, total net bookings grew 49% to $729 million, as compared to our outlook of $540 million to $590 million. This outstanding result was driven by the exceptional performance of our titles in the fourth quarter. Recurrent consumer spending grew 47% and accounted for 61% of total net bookings as compared to our outlook of over 10% growth. Recurrent consumer spending exceeded our outlook due primarily to the record performance of NBA 2K and Grand Theft Auto Online. Digitally delivered net bookings grew 60% and accounted for 92% of the total as compared to our outlook of over 20% growth. This result exceeded our outlook due to the outperformance of recurrent consumer spending and digitally delivered full game sales. During the fourth quarter, 65% of sales of current generation console games were delivered digitally, up from 57% last year. GAAP net revenue grew 41% to $761 million and cost of goods sold increased to $396 million. Operating expenses increased by 9% to $243 million, due primarily to higher R&D expense and GAAP net income grew to $123 million or $1.07 per share as compared to $57 million or $0.50 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. \n Turning to our fiscal 2020 results. Total net bookings grew to a new record of $2.99 billion. This extraordinary result was driven by growth from NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V and the record-breaking launch of Borderlands 3. Recurrent consumer spending grew 34% to a new record and accounted for 51% of total net bookings. This exceeded our outlook of 25% growth. Digitally delivered net bookings grew 35% to a new record of $2.4 billion and accounted for 82% of the total. This too exceeded our outlook of 25% growth due to better-than-expected recurring concur spending and digitally delivered full game sales. During fiscal 2020, 55% of sales of current generation console games were delivered digitally, up from 38% last year. Non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow was $615 million as compared to our outlook of over $500 million. During fiscal 2020, we spent $53 million in capital expenditures. At fiscal year-end, our cash and short-term investments balance was over $2 billion. GAAP net revenue grew 16% to $3.09 billion and cost of goods sold increased to $1.5 billion. Operating expenses increased by 20% to $1.1 billion due primarily to higher R&D and marketing expenses. And GAAP net income grew to $404 million or $3.54 per share. Today, we gave a strong initial outlook for fiscal 2021. Our operating results are currently expected to be lower than fiscal 2020 due to the likely reschedule, coupled with continued investments in our future pipeline that should enable us to scale further and improve margins over time. \n When people began the shelter-at-home, we saw an increase in consumer engagement with our titles due to the online accessibility and the social nature of our products. We're continuing to experience this positive trend, which is reflected in our first quarter outlook. We have not included any additional benefit from this trend in our outlook for the back half of the year nor we assumed a deep recession or further delays in releases, which could affect our results. Now to our guidance. Starting with the fiscal first quarter. We project net bookings to range from $800 million to $850 million, up 93% from $422 million in the first quarter last year. This increase is being driven primarily by expected growth from Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, NBA 2K, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online and the Borderlands franchise. The largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, NBA 2K20, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online and Borderlands 3. We project recurrent consumer spending to grow by approximately 75%. This growth is expected to be driven primarily by Grand Theft Auto Online and NBA 2K20. We also expect digitally delivered net bookings to double. Our forecast assumes that 81% of our current generation console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 75% in the same period last year. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $775 million to $825 million and cost of goods sold to range from $392 million to $480 million. Operating expenses are expected to range from $267 million to $277 million. At the midpoint, this represents a 10% increase over last year, driven primarily by higher R&D expense and charitable contribution. And GAAP net income is expected to range from $103 million to $116 million or $0.90 to $1 per share.  For management reporting purposes, we expect our tax rate to be 16% throughout fiscal 2021. \n Turning to our outlook for the full fiscal year. We project net bookings to range from $2.55 billion to $2.65 billion. We expect growth from NBA 2K to be offset by lower results from Borderlands 3, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Grand Theft Auto V. Grand Theft Auto Online and Red Dead Online, excluding digital content bundles with the premium addition, are projected to be approximately in line with fiscal 2020. The largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Social Point's mobile games, Borderlands 3, Civilization VI and The Outer Worlds. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our label to be roughly 55% 2K, 35% Rockstar Games and 10% Private Division and Social Point. And we forecast our geographic net booking split to be about 60% United States and 40% international. We expect recurrent consumer spending to be roughly flat as compared to fiscal 2020, driven primarily by growth from NBA 2K, offset by lower allocated recurrent consumer spending from the Borderlands 3 and Red Dead Redemption 2 premium edition. The current consumer spending as a percentage of our business is expected to grow to approximately 60% versus 51% last year. We project digitally-delivered net bookings to decline by about 8%. As a percent of our business, digital is projected to represent 86%, up from 82% last year. Our forecast assumes that 68% of current generation console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 55% last year. We expect to generate more than $350 million in non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow, and we plan to deploy approximately $75 million for capital expenditures. The increase in capital expenditures over the prior year was primarily due to spending on studio and office build-outs and IT expense. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $2.63 to $2.73 billion and cost of goods sold to range from $1.19 to $1.24 billion. Total operating expenses are expected to range from $1.10 to $1.12 billion. At the midpoint, this represents a 1% decrease over the prior year, driven by lower marketing and stock compensation expenses, partially offset by higher R&D expense and charitable contribution. And we expect GAAP net income to range from $299 million to $329 million or $2.60 to $2.85 per share. \n In closing, fiscal 2020 was a record year for Take-Two, whether delivering incredible stand-alone entertainment experiences or providing engaging live services that captivate and connect communities around the world, our ability to serve our audiences has never been better. Fiscal 2021 promises to be another great year for our organization, and we are well positioned to both capitalize on the many opportunities within our industry and to navigate the uncertainties of these times. We have the strongest development pipeline in our company's history, and we expect sequential growth to resume in fiscal 2022. With our world-class creative assets, focus on operational excellence and disciplined approach to capital allocation, Take-Two is positioned to generate significant growth and margin expansion over the long term. \n Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Strauss. Ryan, I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I can tell you off the top of my head, for sure. It's going to be higher R&D expense is going to definitely be one of those numbers that are much higher right now. As Karl talked about our release sched, our pipeline of titles has grown significantly over the last couple of years. And you've seen the detail about our titles and what we have coming out in the next 5 years. That has been something that we've worked on growing significantly. And as we look at the development, a lot of that is going to R&D expense, which has grown our operating expense line. And since that's going through the OpEx, that has affected our bottom line margin for the business and that -- as well as our overall G&A expense, which has grown for higher personnel and IT expense for cybersecurity as well as just overall IT expense for the business and our online games. I think that's probably where you're seeing the biggest increase for the overall business. Sure. So the gross margin is slightly down, but basically it's flat from last year. So we do have -- we are seeing it come up a little bit from the digital and the recurrent consumer spending mix because recurrent consumer spending is a higher-margin business for us, but that's being offset by having less new releases this year. So that's why we're seeing it flat. But it's early in the year. So we'll see how we go towards the latter part of the year and the recurrent consumer spending continues to stay strong for us. We should hopefully see that lift up a little bit towards the latter part of the year."

Before I begin, on behalf of our entire management team and colleagues around the world, I'd like to express our deep condolences for those who've lost their lives or lost family members during this pandemic. In every corner of the world, heroes in the form of first responders and health care workers put their lives at risk to take care of the ill, preserve life and enable societies to return to normal, for which we're all incredibly grateful. I'm also proud of our entire organization for seamlessly and successfully shifting to a work-from-home environment to keep our company moving forward and to continue to deliver the best entertainment experiences to our audiences. \n Turning to our business. Our significantly better-than-expected fourth quarter results concluded another extraordinary year for Take-Two, during which we achieved numerous milestones, including record net bookings of nearly $3 billion as well as record digitally delivered net bookings, o recurrent consumer spending and earnings. Nearly all of our titles outperformed in the fourth quarter, including NBA 2K20, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2, Borderlands 3 and Social Point's mobile games, to name just a few. During the fourth quarter, both recurrent consumer spending on and full game sales of NBA 2K20 significantly outperformed our expectations. Consumer engagement with NBA 2K remained at record levels throughout fiscal 2020 with daily active users growing 13% and MyTeam users increasing nearly 50%. During the fourth quarter, over 9 million hours of NBA 2K gameplay were watched on Twitch across more than 1,100 channels, representing a 40% increase over the third quarter. This strong engagement began prior to people sheltering at home and resulted in recurrent consumer spending growth of 18% in the fourth quarter, reversing our expectation of a decline. This positive trend was driven primarily by the success of February content drops for MyTeam. For the full year, recurrent consumer spending on the NBA 2K franchise grew nearly 30% to a new record and remained the largest contributor to that part of our business. To date, NBA 2K20 is sold in over 12 million units, up 33% over NBA 2K19 in the same period. We now expect the lifetime units recurrent consumer spending and net bookings for NBA 2K20 will be the highest ever for a 2K sports title. I'd like to thank visual concepts in 2K for doing an incredible job addressing the prior issues with NBA 2K20 and delivering another year of record results. \n As part of our broader support of those in need during the COVID-19 pandemic, 2K partnered with the NBA, NBA players association and ESPN to create the NBA 2K players tournament comprised of 16 NBA stars that raised funds for the Arizona Food Bank network. We are incredibly proud to include this unique program among our worldwide COVID-19 response initiatives. The positive momentum for Grand Theft Auto Online continues with superlative performance in both players and net bookings. Since the July launch of the Diamond Casino & Resort update, Grand Theft Auto Online achieved its best-ever monthly active users in both July and August 2019 and then grew sequentially each month from December 2019 through March 2020. This exceptional engagement helped to drive recurrent consumer spending growth of 87% during the fourth quarter and 40% for the full fiscal year, new records in both periods. In addition, sales of Grand Theft Auto V surpassed our expectations, and the title is now sold in over 130 million units, further cementing its position as the must-have title of the current console generation. Red Dead Redemption 2 also exceeded our expectations in the fourth quarter and to date has sold in more than 31 million units worldwide. Both engagement and recurrent consumer spending on Red Dead Online continue to gain momentum. Net bookings grew 62% in the fourth quarter and more than tripled for the full year, excluding digital content bundled with the Red Dead Redemption 2 premium additions. Throughout the coming year Rockstar Games will continue to support both Red Dead Online and Grand Theft Auto Online with more content updates to keep new and returning players excited and engaged. \n Borderlands 3, the latest installment in our genre-defining shooter-looter series outperformed our expectations in the fourth quarter and the title is now sold in over 10 million units, up 50% over Borderlands 2 in the same period. On March 13, Borderlands 3 was released on an array of PC retailers, including Steam, where sales of the game exceeded our projections. During the fourth quarter, 2K and Gearbox launched Guns, Love, and Tentacles: The Marriage of Wainwright & Hammerlock, the second of 4 announced paid campaigns that are included in the Borderlands 3 Super Deluxe Edition and the Season Pass or it can be purchased separately upon release. The Season Pass attach rate for Borderlands 3 continues to be the highest in 2Ks in the franchise's history, and there's more content coming. Borderline 3s monthly active users have steadily climbed in each month during the fourth quarter. And in March, we had the largest influx of new players since the launch due to its release on Steam. We attribute this success in part to 2K's and Gearbox software's continued effort to support Borderlands 3 as a live service game with weekly events, free content drops and consistent communication with fans that should continue to benefit the title and the series over the long term. \n During fiscal 2020, Private Division launched their most successful release to date with The Outer Worlds. The title is an immense critical and commercial success and has significantly exceeded our expectations with more than 2.5 million units sold in to-date. The Outer Worlds is a perfect example of how Private Division can complement our core portfolio selectively and contribute meaningful results to our bottom line. Our fiscal 2020 results were also enhanced by a variety of other offerings led by NBA 2K19, Sid Meiers Civilization VI, Social Point's mobile games and the WWE 2K series. In fiscal 2020, recurring consumer spending grew 34% to a new record and accounted for 51% of our total net bookings. In addition to virtual currency for NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Red Dead Online, recurring consumer spending was enhanced by a variety of other offerings. In the free-to-play category, Social Point outperformed our expectations in the fourth quarter and remains a significant contributor to our results through its 2 biggest games: Dragon City and Monster Legends as well as Word Life, Tasty Town and World Chef. Social Point continues to invest in its broad and innovate pipeline of more than 10 new games planned for launch in the coming years. \n WWE SuperCard also outperformed during the fourth quarter, growing 20%. The title has now been downloaded more than 20 million times and remains 2K's highest grossing mobile title. And NBA 2K Online in China significantly exceeded our expectations, growing 37% and 25% during the fourth quarter and full year, respectively. The title remains the #1 PC online sports game in China with more than 49 million registered users. Add-on content grew 85% in fiscal 2020, led by offerings for the Borderlands franchise, Sid Meiers Civilization VI and WWE 2K20.  Finally, sales of Borderlands 3 premium additions, which include additional content that is allocated to recurrent consumer spending, also contributed positively to our results. \n Looking ahead, our company has the strongest development pipeline in its history, including sequels from our biggest franchises as well as exciting new IP. While fiscal 2021 will be a light year for new releases, we expect to deliver strong results, due to the diversity and strength of our catalog and live service offerings. Transition to a new console cycle is always a very exciting time for our industry, and our development teams are already taking their creative aspirations to a new level by finding ways to push the limits of this new technology; however, the speed of these transitions can be unpredictable, particularly in a year upended by COVID-19. And our fiscal 2021 release slate reflects our strategy to bring our creative achievements to the largest possible audience. Our commitment to deliver the highest quality titles and give them optimal conditions to achieve success remains resolute. We have an array of titles that we'll begin to launch in fiscal 2022, which we expect to drive sequential growth that year. Karl will discuss this in more detail shortly. \n There's no doubt that our recent results have benefited from people sheltering at home as players have sought interactive entertainment to stay connected and engaged with friends and family. The connections and communities built will remain in place once people resume their normal activities and should continue to benefit our industry's results. We're fortunate to work in an industry that can bring some positivity in a difficult time. As previously mentioned, all of Take-Two's labels have come together to deliver a portion of proceeds from April and May to COVID-19 charities worldwide. Looking ahead, Take-Two remains superbly positioned creatively, operationally and financially, to capitalize on the many positive trends in our industry and to deliver continued growth and returns for our shareholders over the long term. \n I'll now turn the call over to Karl. Thanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for their hard work, their commitment to excellence and for delivering another outstanding year, particularly under these circumstances. For our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued support. We'll now take your questions. Operator? By linearity, I think what you're asking, Colin, is, should we expect a gentle constant upward sloping curve of our releases, net bookings and cash flow? And the answer is, we really are aiming to have a handful or greater of new significant releases every year from existing franchises and new intellectual property. And as you could tell from Karl's description, we have plenty of great content coming that reflects that desire. But it doesn't mean that in any given year, there'll be linearity as you put it. And this year, fiscal '21 reflects that. The good news is that with our strong catalog, with our live service offerings and with our annual releases, we can have great strength even in a light year, even though it's not our goal to have a light year and then do even better in the year where we have -- we're able to launch a number of titles, which is our strategy and even better than that, if we're fortunate enough to have a blockbuster title, and we have some of those as well. So the variability in our results, I don't think will ever go away, not when you have some of the biggest entertainment properties on earth that don't come out every year, that can't come out every year, if they are to remain the biggest titles. So that's my view on linearity. Definitely, our goal is to be smoother and to grow. There will still be some variability. And while I'd love to answer your question more broadly, I really think that's more a label question than anything else. As soon as we get into the nature of the content and what we're doing in the future, those questions are better answered by our labels. We aim to give as much visibility as we can on these calls. But when we get into specific core creative matters, we'll announce that at the label level in due time. And this is Strauss. Regarding engagement, Activate, which is a leading media consultancy, just provided us with some research. All groups, all age groups, all demographics during this COVID shelter-in-place time period, time spent with gaming has increased about 39%, while time spent with video, linear entertainment, has increased about 43%. So they're in the same ballpark, but linear entertainment did increase more. But what's interesting is their research shows that post-COVID, once people return to their normal routines, they expect time spent with gaming to grow at a greater rate, about 14%, a sustained increase of about 14% versus about an 8% sustained increase in time spent with linear entertainment with video compared to pre-COVID-19 levels. \n So I think it represents a sea change, a shift, and we're going to begin to see meaningful growth in interactive entertainment that meaningfully outstrips the growth in linear entertainment, a trend that we've seen of late, of course. But I think that the lines are going to begin to diverge in the favor of interactive entertainment. And why do I think that? I think that sheltering at home, tragic as it is, sad as it is, has caused people to look for entertainment. And people have returned to interactive entertainment, new people have come to it, and they realize not only is it beautiful, not only is it engaging, not only is it fun and potentially competitive depending on the game, not only are there great stories and characters, but you can also be engaged with friends and communities all around the world. You can create new friends and communities all around the world while you're playing those games, and you can play with those people because you can connect with them. You can talk to them while you're playing over chat clients. So this is not a moment for celebration. We're deeply saddened by what's going on in the world, but the view -- I think the smart view is that all pre-existing trends have been accelerated by this crisis. And the shift to interactive entertainment and the growth in the sector is one of those trends. Now with all that said, we still have to execute every day. The growth in the sector is not going to help us if we don't make great games, if we don't deliver hits. Thanks, Brian. I'm sorry for the delay. We're all working remotely. We don't see meaningful differences regionally. And so far, we have not seen meaningful changes as regions have gone back to work. For example, NBA 2K Online in China now has 49 million registered users, remains the #1 PC sports title in China, and it was up 25% year-over-year. I think it was up about 40% in the quarter. So we are not seeing meaningful differences. We are not seeing significant changes as people head back to work, but I think it is fully our expectation that -- and I just -- I reflected that in the research I just quoted, that this level of engagement will not stay the same as things return to normal, but we do think it will be higher than it was before. \n And in terms of working from home, look, we're very fortunate. We got a real wake-up call during Hurricane Sandy when we were not really particularly prepared and ever since then, which was quite some time ago. We've been a company, in addition to being a highly compliant company but a company that's on disaster recovery and we have state-of-the-art systems. In fact, we had planned, completely apart from this crisis, to have a work-from-home test day on March 12, and then it turns out -- we had to go live right about then. Anyhow, a week after that, we had 5,000 people effectively working from home, completely set up with all the equipment they needed. And because we know when people are connected online, of course, we could see that their productivity, if anything, had increased over working in the office and as people got used to sitting in one place with not much else to do in front of their desktops. We're fortunate. We have an incredibly talented, hardworking group of colleagues who really believe in this company's mission and who largely, I hope, mostly love working together. And we saw it as our mission to uplift people during this very difficult time. And we're very connected with our teams. We're talking to them all the time. I'm doing 3 town hall meetings next week on Zoom, 3 different time zones. I hope to connect with almost everyone who works at the company. \n So it's gone incredibly well and we really haven't missed a beat. Over time, I think it gets harder, but I still don't expect that we will miss a beat. But it does get harder. I'm not of the view that you start shutting down your real estate and everyone works from home and it's just as effective. I think it's pretty close to as effective in a pinch, in a crisis like this where you have no choice and people see it's their obligation to pull together and do great work, but there's no substitute for in-person collaboration and connection. I'm sure there are many things that we have learned already and can learn. We haven't seen a massive change in our approach. And remember, when we talk about monetization, our goal is always to deliver a phenomenal entertainment experience, first and foremost. And we figure that if we do that, monetization takes care of itself. Our goal is not to constantly build monetization. Naturally, we need to get paid appropriately so we can share the proceeds with our talented colleagues and create a return for our investors and it's our job to do both. And we care about all of our constituents. So we're not a charitable organization. We're a for-profit organization. Obviously, we wouldn't be on the call if we weren't. But monetization isn't a problem for this organization. When we put out the best entertainment on earth, people show up for it. If we give them something that's incredibly valuable, they pay for it. We take it as axiomatic that the nature of an experience is the intersection of the quality of the experience and whether you feel you receive value for that experience. If you go to a phenomenal restaurant and have an incredible meal but the bill \n [Audio Gap] \n it should have cost, you're not going back. Even if you can afford it, even if you're price-inelastic, you're not going back. It just doesn't feel good. So we need to make sure that we always deliver more than what we charge, and that's the goal of our company and that's the goal of all of our labels. With all that said, with increased engagement comes increased monetization. You're seeing the effects of that in these results and in this initial guidance. Thanks, Brian, for your question. I think your question was also pretty good answer. It's sort of all of the above. Grand Theft Auto V is a 7-year old title. Obviously, it's been offered at lower price points than its initial release price point. And we do have a -- obviously an online offering, and there are monetization opportunities within that offering. So specific promotions with specific outlets with specific deals behind them can make sense to us. And we do believe that it's a great idea, in general, to grow the audience, grow engagement, grow users. And with that will come more net bookings and will come more profits. So that was the thesis behind it. We're very, very selective in those kinds of promotions, and they typically are only available for limited periods of time when they make sense for catalog titles. And we haven't yet made any announcements that we -- that are reflected in today's release. And as you know, we don't talk about specific new titles at these calls. We leave those discussions to the labels. I thought you were going to ask do we have everything in place to develop, and we still will be building up our development teams. In terms of marketing and distribution, yes, I mean one of the reasons that we've talked about the need for scale in order to have competitive operating margins. We already have competitive gross margins, highly competitive gross margins. To have competitive operating margins, you need scale with the same level of success of your games, and that's our goal here. But the reason you get those higher operating margins with more net bookings is because you don't build up your fixed overhead and your fixed overhead would typically include marketing and distribution expenses. I fully expect that our distribution will become more efficient as the world moves more to digital distribution. We already have a highly efficient distribution mechanism. And yes, with volume, you might increase your marketing head count modestly but not all that significantly. Naturally, our development head count is part of the cost of making a game. And you should expect with volume that our development expense goes up, and you're already seeing that. We still feel that our capital is used best in 3 different ways: First, to support organic growth. It has been an incredibly successful story for this company. This year is no exception. We've really only done one meaningful acquisition, which is Social Point. The second is to support a return of capital to shareholders, and we've done a great deal of that selectively and we've done it through buybacks. They've been opportunistic, and I think the highest price we ever paid was around $99, if I'm not mistaken. So obviously, so far, we've called that reasonably well. And then we've reserved capital and incredibly strong balance sheet for the possibility of very selective inorganic growth driven by acquisition. We're very disciplined. We're looking only for accretive deals. And you're right, there aren't a lot of opportunities. We're hopeful that there will be some opportunity that would move our company forward, potentially diversify its operations a bit and bring in intellectual property and talent. Those have been our rubrics. \n We expect to stay squarely within interactive entertainment. You shouldn't expect us to diversify outside of it. And those opportunities are few and far between but they do exist. And done right, the benefit of that would be to have highly competitive operating margins. So we don't need scale for scale's sake. But if we want to be the best in the business, and we do, then our financial results have to reflect that. And that means we have to have highly competitive operating margins, and the only thing standing in the way of that for us is scale. But again, if you buy scale in a foolish way, it won't help you. And if you buy scale and then can't maintain the success of that organization, thereby ruining your gross margins, you obviously would not benefit your operating margin. Said another way, if you're going to do an acquisition, it has to be smart, it has to be accretive relatively quickly, if not immediately. And then post closing, you've got to integrate the business soundly and run the business successfully in order for it to make sense. That's a tall order. That's why most corporate acquisitions fail. That's why we're so incredibly disciplined. But we are of the view that there will be opportunities and, certainly coming out of this crisis, there may be more opportunities than we otherwise would have expected. And in terms of how we look at growth, good news is we're operators. We're also investors. We also are big shareholders. We look at it exactly the way you would. We're looking for growth in net bookings. We're looking for growth in EBITDA. We're looking for growth in recurrent consumer spending because it reflects solidity in the business. It's much less volatile than initial releases could be. And finally, we're looking for growth in our stock price. And that's how we're judged. So we're judged from an economic point of view, largely on total shareholder return, as we should be. We're not judged at all on EPS, which I think is a terrible way to judge a management team for obvious reasons because you can fiddle around with it. Total shareholder return, there's no place to hide and that's how we're judged. So I think in exactly the way you would look at it, scale, because it's correlated with operating margins in the way that I said earlier, the scale of your operating profit or your EBITDA or your operating cash flow and, of course, your stock price. And on those metrics, we've done very well indeed for quite some time. Thanks, Mike. We're -- our expectations for fiscal '21 have not been adjusted for the recent success that we've had in this tragic period in the back half of the year. So we're not counting on this level of engagement and spending to continue. Equally though, we are not planning for a deep, prolonged consumer recession. So I would say if you had to peg it, we're right there in the middle, where -- which is where we probably should be since we can't call it. My own personal view, which does not influence our numbers, is that we're going to see a relatively rapid consumer-driven recovery when the dust clears. And my own view is that dust is probably going to clear sooner than many people think. But I'm an optimist and we don't plan based on my opinions. So I would say we're right down the middle that we assume relatively stable economic conditions that if we were surprised and there were deep, ongoing consumer recession, we would not be [ influenced from it ] and our results could be negatively influenced by. And equally, if there was a massive unexpected expansion, that could benefit our results. So I think we're assuming relative stability. We are not assuming continued enhanced engagement and monetization, the likes of which we have seen recently. Yes. Sorry. I think probably not much to add. We expect sequential growth year-over-year in fiscal '22, and that is driven by the release schedule that Karl described in the pipeline that we're investing in. So we expect some releases coming out of that pipeline in fiscal '22, and we expect them to generate sequential growth, so as simple as that. Well, we just want to thank everyone for attending the call. Once again, we want to extend our best wishes to everyone who's listening today for your health, for your loved ones' health and our condolences for any losses that you or your loved ones have suffered. We know this is an incredibly challenging time. We feel blessed to be able to be of some small consolation by bringing light entertainment to people. We're proud of what we do. We're grateful to be able to do it. And once again, I want to express my gratitude to our colleagues for their dedication for showing up with smile on their face for doing such amazing work. The reason we're able to have these extraordinary results is solely a function of that work. So thank you so much for joining us, and our very best wishes."

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Throughout the 2019 holiday season, we experienced robust demand for our offerings that drove third quarter operating results solidly within our increased outlook. Our net bookings were substantially higher than what we included for the third quarter when we gave our original fiscal 2020 outlook last May as well as when we increased our outlook last August. Highlights are the performance of Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, NBA 2K20, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, The Outer Worlds and Borderlands 3, reflecting our ability to deliver some of the most captivating experiences in the entertainment industry. \n Grand Theft Auto Online once again exceeded our expectations, delivering its best holiday quarter ever for both audience size and net bookings. During the third quarter, recurrent consumer spending on Grand Theft Auto Online grew 54%, driven by Rockstar Games continued release of engaging new content. Grand Theft Auto Online had its biggest series of back-to-back updates ever in terms of player numbers, with records in audience size in December and the third quarter following the release of The Diamond Casino & Resort update in July and The Diamond Casino Heist in December. We're now on track to deliver a new record for Grand Theft Auto Online recurrent consumer spending in fiscal 2020. \n Sales of Grand Theft Auto V also exceeded our expectations, and the title has now sold in more than 120 million units. According to the NPD Group, Grand Theft Auto V was the best-selling game of the decade in the U.S. based on both unit and dollar sales. \n Red Dead Online continues to gain momentum, both in terms of engagement and recurrent consumer spending. Net bookings from Red Dead Online outperformed our expectations during the third quarter, almost tripling, both year-over-year and sequentially, excluding digital content bundled with the Red Dead Redemption 2 premium editions. Red Dead Online hit a new peak in player numbers in December following the release of the latest update, Moonshiners, and exceeded those numbers and set a new record in January. We remain as excited as ever about the long-term opportunity for Red Dead Online to be a significant driver of recurrent consumer spending. In November, Red Dead Redemption 2 launched for the PC and Google Stadia to date has sold in over 29 million units. According to the NPD Group, Red Dead Redemption 2 was the top title of the last 4 years based on U.S. dollar sales. \n There is noting that the collective lifetime selling of Grand Theft Auto V and Red Dead Redemption 2 is now -- more than 150 million units worldwide with over 250 million lifetime game accounts created across both titles. Rockstar Games total online audience is also its biggest to date, having recorded record numbers in the third quarter. \n On October 25, Private Division launched The Outer Worlds for Xbox One, Playstation 4 in PC. Developed by Obsidian Entertainment, The Outer Worlds has significantly exceeded our expectations and has sold in more than 2 million units to date. Critical response to the game has been outstanding, and The Outer Worlds has won more than 75 awards, including Game of the Year from the New York Video Game critic circle and Destructoid and Best RPG of the Year from IGN, Shacknews, Gamerex and others. The title is also a finalist for the DICE awards outstanding achievement and story and the RPG of the year. We're confident that The Outer Worlds will continue to expand its audience, including through its release on the Nintendo Switch, which is now planned for fiscal 2021. \n Unit sales of NBA 2K20, the latest installment in our industry-leading basketball series, has outperformed our expectations, and the title has sold in over 8 million units to date, up slightly over NBA 2K19 in the same period. In November, the title was released for Google Stadia. In addition, engagement with NBA 2K20 is reaching all-time highs with average daily active users growing and MyTeam users up more than 35%. In addition, NBA 2K20 has generated more than 276 million views on YouTube and over 8 million hours of content watched on Twitch across hundreds of channels. While this increased engagement led to strong growth in recurrent consumer spending in certain modes of NBA 2K20, we've not experienced the same positive benefits across the entire game due to some specific design changes, which we plan to address in future versions of NBA 2K. Because of this, we no longer expect lifetime net bookings for NBA 2K20 to be a record for the series. However, we continue to expect recurrent consumer spending for the NBA 2K franchise to grow in the strong double digits for fiscal 2020. Taking creative risk is part of Take-Two's DNA as we constantly strive to improve the game play experience for our audiences. More often than not, this results in enhancing our growth, which is reflected in the substantial long-term outperformance of NBA 2K. \n Turning to Borderlands 3, the latest installment in our genre defining shooter-looter series continues to expand its audience since its record-breaking launch in September, with more than 50% user growth in comparison to Borderlands 2, at the same time, in its life cycle. 2K and Gearbox are supporting the game with free content as well as 4 downloadable campaign expansions, which are included with the Borderlands 3 Super Deluxe Edition and the season pass or can be purchased separately upon release. The first of these expansions, Moxxi's Heist and The Handsome Jackpot was released during the third quarter and was positively received by critics and consumers alike, helping to drive a season pass attach rate for Borderlands 3 that was a record, both for the series and for 2K at the same point in the title's life cycle. In December, Borderlands 3 was released for Google Stadia, and will be available on Steam in the coming months. To date, Borderlands 3 has sold in nearly 8 million units, and we expect lifetime unit sales to be a record for the series. \n Earlier in the quarter, 2K launched WWE 2K20 for Playstation 4, Xbox One and PC. WWE 2K20 features several new gameplay modes that celebrate the WWE's thriving women's division, as well as an array of fan favorite superstars, legends and match types. While we're disappointed that WWE 2K20 did not meet our expectations, both in terms of sales and quality, 2K is actively working with visual concepts to ensure that these issues are addressed in the future, and they'll have more to share on their plans soon. The WWE brand continues to expand worldwide, and there remains a substantial long-term opportunity to grow our WWE 2K series by improving the quality of the game. \n Among Take-Two's core tenets is our aim to be the most creative and the most innovative company in the entertainment industry. Today, in addition to delivering the highest quality stand-alone entertainment experiences, we measure our success by our ability to captivate and engage audiences well beyond the title's initial release. To that end, during the third quarter, recurrent consumer spending grew 6% and accounted for 41% of our total net bookings. \n In addition to virtual currency for NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Red Dead Online, recurrent consumer spending was enhanced by a variety of other offerings. In the free-to-play category, Social Point continues to be a meaningful contributor to our results through its mobile titles Dragon City, Monster Legends, World Chef, Tasty Town and Word Life. During the quarter, Social Point added new content, special events and updates to these games. Our Barcelona based studio continues to invest in its broad and innovative pipeline of new games planned for launch in the coming years. \n 2K launched season 6 of WWE SuperCard featuring all new card tiers and upgraded features. The title has now been downloaded more than 20 million times and remains 2K's highest grossing mobile title. \n NBA 2K Online in China remains the #1 PC online sports game in China, with more than 48 million registered users. Add-on content grew 135%, led by offerings for Borderlands 3, Sid Meier's Civilization VI and WWE 2K20. \n Finally, sales of Borderlands 3 premium additions, which include additional content that is allocated to recurrent consumer spending, also contributed during the period. As a result of our solid third quarter results and outlook for the fourth quarter, we're increasing the low end of our fiscal 2020 operating outlook, while maintaining the high end. Fiscal 2020 is shaping up to be another terrific year for Take-Two. \n Looking ahead, our company has the strongest development pipeline in its history, and we're committed to supporting our titles with offerings designed to drive ongoing engagement. In addition, we're actively investing in emerging markets, platforms and business models that have significant potential to enhance our growth. Take-Two is exceedingly well positioned to capitalize on the many positive trends in our industry, and to generate returns for our shareholders over the long term. \n I'll now turn the call over to Karl. \nKarl Slatoff: Thanks, Strauss. I'll begin by discussing our upcoming releases. Throughout the coming months, 2K and Gearbox software will continue to support Borderlands 3 with a robust post-launch content strategy, including all new in-game mini events and 3 additional downloadable campaign expansions. Later this month at PAX East in Boston, 2K will unveil details about their future content offerings, Borderlands 3 upcoming release on Steam and more. In addition, Rockstar Games will continue to provide an array of content and gameplay experiences for the vast open worlds of Grand Theft Auto Online and Red Dead Online, which continue to set engagement records for the label. \n In fiscal 2021, Private Division will expand our offerings for the Nintendo Switch with the release of The Outer Worlds. As Strauss noted earlier, the title is incredibly well received by critics and consumers alike on its original launch platforms. And we are confident that we'll continue to thrill audiences as they immerse themselves in this player of choice-driven RPG on the switch. One of our organization's key priorities is building scale by growing the size of our development pipeline. Investing in our world class creative resources and partnering with the best independent studios in the industry enables Take-Two to enhance our industry-leading portfolio of intellectual property, which is the foundation of our strategy to grow our business and expand profitability. \n In December, 2K announced the formation of Cloud Chamber, which we'll be working on the next-generation of the globally acclaimed BioShock franchise for the next several years. Cloud Chamber is a collective of storytellers eager to push the limits of interactive entertainment by making unique, captivating and thoughtful experiences set in a rich immersive world. The team will be based in 2 locations, 2K's headquarters in Novato, California as well as in Montreal, Quebec, which marks the first ever 2K studio in Canada. \n Private Divisions is another example of our growing investment in new intellectual property. This year, we benefited from the exceptional performance of The Outer Worlds. Our new label is taking a strategic approach to working with some of the industry's best creative talent and is quickly amassing an impressive pipeline for the future.  During fiscal year 2021, Private Division plans to release Kerbal Space Program 2 and Disintegration, which just completed a successful technical beta. Private Division will have more announcements about their growing portfolio over time. \n Mobile, which continues to be the highest growing -- highest grossing and fastest growing segment in the interactive entertainment is an important opportunity for Take-Two. Social Point currently has 5 games active in the market, including Dragon City, Monster Legends, World Chef, Tasty Town and Word Life, and they have more than 10 new games in the various stages of development. In addition, we continue to pursue new mobile offerings and extensions of our existing franchises, such as WWE SuperCard and NBA 2K Mobile. The global proliferation of smart mobile devices and high-speed data networks represents an exciting entry point into emerging markets, particularly in China, Latin America, Africa and India. \n Take-Two's development pipeline over the next 5 years is the largest and most diverse in our company's history, including releases from our biggest franchises, exciting new IP, free-to-play offerings and a diverse mix of casual, mid-core and core gaming experiences. We will have much more to share on this exciting slate of titles in the months to come. \n In addition to our focus on growing existing and building new franchises, we have a number of emerging opportunities that have the potential to contribute to our growth and margin expansion.  Streaming may become a compelling distribution platform for our industry that could expand our market and increase margins. With our frontline of catalog offerings, the highest quality content drives consumer adoption and Take-Two's portfolio is a must-have for any new platform. During the holiday season, we released Red Dead Redemption 2, NBA 2K20 and Borderlands 3 for purchase on Google Stadia. eSports remains an exciting new segment for our industry and company. The NBA 2K League, our first foray into competitive gaming and partnership with the NBA, is gearing up for its third season that will begin at the end of this month. The league continues to expand with new teams joining this year, bringing the count to 23, including the first international and non-NBA team, the Gen.G Tigers of Shanghai. The launch of the Gen.G Tigers is the first step in the long-term effort to build a stronger global presence for the league. In January, the NBA 2K League hosted its global invitation match, a series of exhibition matches featuring APAC invitational players and the 2019 NBA 2K League Finals MVP playing against top representatives from NBA 2K Online 2. The games were live streamed in China on Tencent's Penguin Esports, Gen.G streaming partner Douyu and Huya, as well as on the NBA 2K League's Twitch and YouTube channels. We are very excited about the continued progress and growth of the league, which has a long-term potential to enhance engagement and to be a driver of profits for our company. \n In closing, as we begin a new decade, we enter an incredibly exciting period for our industry and company, which should bring technological advancements as well as compelling new platforms and business models. We remain steadfast in our commitment to deliver the highest quality entertainment experiences to captivate and engage our audiences throughout the world and to generate growth and margin expansion. \n I'll now turn the call over to Lainie. \nLainie Goldstein: Thanks, Karl. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, we'll discuss our third quarter results and then review our financial outlook for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020. Please note that additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release. \n As Strauss mentioned, we experienced robust demand for our offerings throughout the 2019 holiday season that enabled us to deliver third quarter operating results solidly within our increased outlook. Total net bookings were $888 million as compared to our outlook of $860 million to $910 million. Current consumer spending grew 6% and accounted for 41% of total net bookings as compared to our outlook of 5% growth. Digitally delivered net bookings decreased slightly by 2% and accounted for 78% of the total, as compared to our outlook of 5% growth. The decrease was due to very strong fiscal sales of our titles over the holidays. During the third quarter, 44% of current generation console games were delivered digitally, up from 31% last year. \n Turning to some details from our third quarter income statement. GAAP net revenue grew to $930 million and cost of goods sold decreased to $437 million. Operating expenses increased by 6% to $316 million, due primarily to higher personnel and R&D costs, offset by lower marketing expenses. And GAAP net income was $164 million or $1.43 per share as compared to $180 million or $1.57 per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. Adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow for the 9 months ended December 31, 2019, was $548 million, and we ended the period with approximately $2 billion in cash and short-term investments. \n Now I will review the highlights of our fiscal 2020 financial outlook. Starting with the fourth quarter. We project net bookings to range from $540 million to $590 million, up from $488 million in the fourth quarter last year. The largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, NBA 2K20, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Sid Meier's Civilization VI and Borderlands 3. We project our current consumer spending to grow by approximately 10%, driven primarily by growing Grand Theft Auto Online and Red Dead Online. We expect digitally delivered net bookings to increase by over 20%. Our forecast assumes that 66% of our current generation console games will be delivered digitally, up from 57% in the same period last year. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $635 million to $685 million and cost of goods sold to range from $274 million to $286 million. \n Operating expenses are expected to range from $247 million to $257 million. At the midpoint, this represents a 13% increase over last year, driven primarily by higher personnel costs and marketing expenses. And GAAP net income is expected to range from $105 million to $128 million or $0.92 to $1.12 per share. For management reporting purposes, we expect our tax rate to be 17% throughout fiscal 2020. \n Turning to our outlook for the full fiscal year. We are raising the low end of our net bookings outlook by $50 million and maintaining the high end. We now expect net bookings to range from $2.8 billion to $2.85 billion. The increase is driven by higher expectations for Grand Theft Auto Online, including record recurrent consumer spending on the title, Grand Theft Auto V and The Outer Worlds, partially offset by reduced expectations for Borderlands 3 and recurrent consumer spending on NBA 2K. The reduced expectations for Borderlands 3 are still consistent with our original high expectations for the title prior to launch. The largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K20 and NBA 2K19, Grand Theft Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Borderlands 3, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, The Outer Worlds and Sid Meier's Civilization VI. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 55% 2K, 35% Rockstar Games and 10% Private Division and Social Point. And we forecast our geographic net bookings split to be about 60% United States and 40% international. We are maintaining our forecast for recurrent consumer spending to increase by approximately 25%. \n We now project digitally delivered net bookings to grow by approximately 25% versus our prior expectation of nearly 30% growth due to a higher mix of physical sales. Note that this is still above our forecast given in August of high-teens growth. Our outlook assumes that 55% of current generation console games will be delivered digitally, up from 38% last year. We are increasing our outlook for adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow to over $500 million versus our prior expectation of over $450 million. We now plan to deploy approximately $60 million for capital expenditures versus a prior expectation of $75 million. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $2.96 billion to $3.01 billion and cost of goods sold to range from $1.42 billion to $1.43 billion. Total operating expenses are expected to range from $1.13 billion to $1.4 billion. At the midpoint, this represents a 20% increase over the prior year, driven primarily by higher marketing, R&D and personnel costs. And we expect GAAP net income to range from $387 million to $409 million or $3.38 to $3.58 per share. \n In closing, our focus on producing the highest quality entertainment delivered strong third quarter results and reaffirmed that Take-Two remains on pace to deliver another terrific year. Looking ahead with our world-class creative teams, firm commitment to operational excellence and solid financial foundation, our company is exceptionally well positioned to deliver value to our customers and returns to our shareholders. \n Thank you. I will now turn the call back to Strauss. \nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for their hard work and commitment to excellence. To our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued support. We'll now take your questions. Operator? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Todd Juenger with Sanford C. Bernstein. \nTodd Juenger: I hope you understand that I feel I have to ask this question. I'm sure you were expecting it. So you had a significant executive departure at Rockstar. Karl or Strauss, anything you can tell us about succession planning, impact on operations in the pipeline, culture, future plans and competition, whatever you can say on that matter? I'm sure we'd appreciate. \nStrauss Zelnick: Todd, thanks for your question. This is Strauss. So Dan Houser had been on an extended leave since early spring 2019. The company has been led since its founding by Sam Houser, who's President of the company, and it's an extraordinary team effort and Sam is a great player and coach. The results of Rockstar Games continue to be extraordinary with the launch of the new content for both Grand Theft Auto Online and for Red Dead Online, and it's amazingly gratifying to see Grand Theft Auto V selling at 120 million units and Red Dead Redemption 2 to be up to 29 million units with the launch on PC and Stadia as well as the really extraordinary results of Grand Theft Auto Online, which we now expect to have another record year, more than 6 years after its initial launch. And of course, Red Dead Online itself, was up something like 3x year-over-year and sequentially in the last quarter. So the label has really never been stronger. We're incredibly optimistic and excited. At the same time, we're grateful to Dan for his contributions, and we wish him well. \nTodd Juenger: If you don't mind, if I could ask just a follow-up then more on the business side. So Strauss, I think I've heard you say multiple times publicly that Take-Two aspires to launch an AAA game every year, at least 1 every year. Should we assume that, that includes calendar year 2020? I'm not asking for any formal announcements of anything, but with this year, should we expect an AAA release this year as well? And anything you could say about -- more about that would be appreciated. \nStrauss Zelnick: So as we always do, you're going to hear our initial outlook for fiscal '21 in May, and our labels, of course, always make our product releases. We have set our strategy, as you correctly pointed out, is to have a strong frontline release schedule, both iterations from beloved franchises. We have 11 franchises that have sold in at least 5 million units within one release as well as new intellectual property, and we are working on the most robust pipeline in our history. So we're amazingly excited about it. That said, we haven't always been able to achieve our goal of having a strong frontline release schedule in every year, or even in the recent past. What has been great, though, is we've now built a company that has these very strong underpinnings of catalog titles and ongoing titles that live on in the hearts and minds of our consumers, generating engagement and generating net bookings and profits. So right now, we have titles like Grand Theft Auto Online, Red Dead Online, all the Social Point titles, and there are 5 that are successfully in market, NBA 2K Online in China, WWE SuperCard, which has been downloaded more than 20 million times, and the list goes on. And in this past quarter, for example, catalog sales represented about 40% of our net bookings. So we now have a company that season in and season out, we feel confident can generate plenty of net bookings, can engage with consumers and can generate a great deal of profitability. And of course, at the same time, we'll build our business with those frontline new releases. Given that we're a company that depends on our creative teams to make as close to perfect products as possible, we have to be willing to live with the vagaries of product deliveries. And that means, sometimes, we will have thin frontline years. But even in those frontline years, we've been able to deliver really great financial results. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Creutz with Cowen & Company. \nDouglas Creutz: If I recall correctly, 2 years ago, you guys had a bit of a hiccup with NBA 2K, recurrent consumer spending. Obviously, last year was incredibly strong. It seems you're running into a little bit of an air pocket again this year. Could you talk about what's going on? Is that just sort of growing pains as you continue to sort of try to find new frontiers for the franchise to get consumers to spend money? Is it something with the process? Is it something with sort of in the engagement loops? Anything you can say on that would be helpful. \nStrauss Zelnick: Yes. First of all, I want to make sure that we distinguish between a problem and a high-class problem. So the high-class problem is that we had said in our revised outlook that we thought NBA 2K20 would set another record for net bookings. Then now we're realizing that to say we don't expect it to set another record, despite its very strong unit sales and the great engagement. And that's because one of the parts of the online version has recurrent consumer spending coming in somewhat lower than we had expected. And that's related to a design feature and one that we can address going forward. But it's not really a hiccup because our goal is first and foremost to captivate and engage consumers, and our engagement is up, and our unit sales are up, and the title quality is just phenomenal. It's also true that as a company that doesn't lead with monetization, we lead with entertainment and engagement. Now and then, our monetization may not be exactly what we think it will be. So let me take responsibility for the decision to focus first and foremost on the entertainment experience and the consumer and only secondarily on what the monetization is. And that means now and then, we may fall short of setting a record, but failing to set a record isn't exactly a problem when you have a title that is massively successful as NBA 2K20 is, it's an incredibly profitable title for the firm. And incidentally, recurrent consumer spending for the franchise will actually be up in the fiscal year in solid double digits. So the engagement is strong. The spending is strong, and at the same time, there were some design changes that didn't optimize specific recurrent consumer spending in certain modes. And we are confident we'll be able to address those. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel. \nAndrew Crum: What has led to the reduced view on Borderlands 3? Can you comment on how the game has performed on PC to date? And without getting into specific numbers, what are your expectations for the game once it's available on Steam? \nStrauss Zelnick: Well, Borderlands is actually performing better than our original outlook. It's sold in nearly 8 million units. We've launched one of the downloadable content packs. We have three more expected at the moment. And in fact, the season passes attach rate is a record for the series and a record for 2K at this point of the title's life cycle, and we expect that the Borderlands 3 will set a record in terms of net bookings for the franchise. So our expectations remain solid and very strong. It's a great big hit for us. \nLainie Goldstein: Right. When we went into the Christmas season, we had really seen real excitement for the title, and we've lifted our expectations a little bit higher than we had it at the very beginning of the year, which was very high to begin with. So we didn't meet those -- that higher expectations, but we did meet our original very high expectations for the title. So that's why we're bringing it down slightly, but it's very high from the beginning of the year. \nStrauss Zelnick: This is -- again, this is a massive hit by any standard. But we've always said this when we guide and when we revise, we aim to be accurate. And sometimes, the vagaries of the entertainment business will be that we don't exactly get it right. \nAndrew Crum: Okay, fair enough. And just a follow-up. I think in the initial press release, you indicated that the sell-through on PC was quite strong. Again, what are your expectations for the game once it launches on Steam? \nStrauss Zelnick: We continue to have very high expectations. As I said, we fully expect that Borderlands 3 will set a record for the franchise. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Uerkwitz with Oppenheimer. \nAndrew Uerkwitz: Let me ask a couple of questions here. The first one. Just how should we think about the next kind of next-generation console? Does it add more uncertainty? Or does it actually alleviate uncertainty as we think about the transition to the new console in terms of lot of service games, whether it's NBA or GTA Online or what have you? \nKarl Slatoff: It's Karl. We weren't really excited about the next-generation console. So I think the best part about it is that I think everyone now knows that we are going to have the next-generation console, and there's a lot of anticipation for it. I'll leave the details about what the expectations are to our partners, Microsoft and Sony. But I think so far the buzz about what the consoles are going to be able to do from a technological perspective, is very exciting for us. And so in that regard, I think it eliminates uncertainty because we know we're going to next console cycle and that we believe it will be very robust and a great thing for the industry. And again, anytime that you have these kinds of advancements in tech, it creates opportunities for our great -- incredible creative team to push the limits of those -- of that technology and create the experiences that we know consumers are going to -- want to engage with for very long periods of time, even after the initial sale. So to the extent that we've got the ability to do that, and all indications is that we will, and we expect this will lead to growth for our company. It's a very positive thing. \nAndrew Uerkwitz: Even for current ongoing live service games that you have now that were built for older gen? \nKarl Slatoff: Yes. I mean, look, how -- what exactly the transition is going to be from console -- from each game from console -- between the console cycles will vary. But there's no reason to believe that the success that we're experiencing with those services would be any less in the new generation than is in the old generation. \nAndrew Uerkwitz: Got it. And then just -- just a kind of higher level question. I think Outer Worlds was on Microsoft Xbox Game Pass. Do you think that helped or hurt the success of that franchise? \nStrauss Zelnick: It's hard to say. I think what we've said all along is that, generally speaking, we want to be where the consumer is. Generally speaking, we think subscription offerings to the extent they exist, are probably better suited to catalog, but we're willing to take experimental chances when it makes sense for a particular title and when the deal underlying that option also makes sense for us. And we're pleased that we have a great partnership with Microsoft, and we're mostly pleased that the title is such a big hit, it's sold in more than 2 million units and it's won 75 game awards. So it's early days for all of these platforms. It's obviously early days for many technologies, including streaming technology. Our goal is to be where the consumer is. We're ecumenical and we're open minded. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Thornton with SunTrust. \nMatthew Thornton: Maybe 2 quick housekeeping or triangulation questions, and then I'll come back to an earlier question. GTA versus NBA 2K in the back half of the year, I mean, could GTA Online actually be bigger than the NBA? Was it in December? Could it be in the fourth quarter? Similarly, Red Dead, I think the initial expectation this year was recurrent would be down year-on-year when you include some of the premium SKUs from last year's launch. Is that still the case given the success that, that sales having could recur and actually be up year-on-year? And then just coming back, Strauss, to your comment around the recent departure. I just want to paraphrase and make sure that we had the message, right? It sounds like this was a fairly isolated departure, no other plans for departure. The culture is still kind of -- as it has been. The pipeline as it has been, the progress is kind of where it has been. I just want to make sure that we have that messaging, right? Because obviously, a lot of investors are asking that question. Any color there would be helpful. \nLainie Goldstein: So in the first one, we have said that the NBA 2K is the highest contributor in recurrent consumer spending for all titles. So we have said that. What is your second question? Sorry, I've missed that one. \nMatthew Thornton: On Red Dead Online, if that could actually be up year-on-year, even including the premium SKU kind of contribution last year? \nLainie Goldstein: Now with including the special editions, it's not up. It's only without including the special edition. \nStrauss Zelnick: And in terms of your question about Rockstar, and I think your question -- I think your question will fall in the category of the stability of the team going forward as well as the culture of the label. So in terms of team stability, Sam Houser is President of Rockstar Games. He founded Rockstar Games. He's a great player, coach and he leads the team of thousands of people every day who are trying to make the most extraordinary entertainment experiences known to me. And that's -- those are their goals. And more often than not, they achieve or even exceed those goals, which is just amazing. It doesn't -- I don't typically speak for other people, but I confidently can speak and say that Sam is highly committed to the organization. And Sam and I work very closely together, and it's an enormous pleasure to be able to be in business with Sam and the entire team at Rockstar. \n Culturally, I've only seen ongoing improvements at Rockstar, frankly. I have only seen growth and engagement and innovation. And I think one of the great things about all of our labels and our company as a whole is that we're incredibly self critical, and we're -- we aim to be utterly transparent, and we always try to do better. And I think that's true everywhere, the Take-Two touches and Rockstar Games sets a standard for always trying to improve the quality of its operations, the quality of the way that they work and the quality of their culture. I frankly couldn't be more proud of how effectively that label is operating. I think this year has been one of amazing strength, I mean, dropping content on the same day for both Red Dead Online and Grand Theft Auto Online and delivering content that set records in terms of engagement and player excitement and incidentally revenue and profitability. So things couldn't be better. And to be very specific, no, we certainly don't expect other departures. As an organization as a whole, we have an extraordinarily low rate of attrition, vastly lower than the industry average. And I think that's because we offer great place to work at all of our labels and the Take-Two corporate as well. And to the extent that we ever fall short, we always aim to do better. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Gee with Bank of America. \nRyan Gee: So maybe first for Lainie. I guess, with over 60% of the business now coming from recurrent consumer spend, how has that impacted your ability to provide us guidance 1 quarter, 1 year out, especially as you consider NBA 2K and Borderlands coming in a bit lower? Should we have greater confidence now than in the past in your guidance? Or does this present other challenges for you? That's the first question. And then for Karl, you touched on Cloud Chamber. Can we maybe get an update on the 2K Silicon Valley Studio, maybe Hangar 13, are those likely to also have content out in the next 1 to 2 years? Anything you can say there? \nLainie Goldstein: Well, in terms of forecasting, with recurrent consumer spending, there are some things that I think are easier to predict, but it does present other challenges as well, especially when you have titles that are out in the market for such a long time, and you would expect them to decline. And then 1 year, they decline, and then the next year, they grow, and there's different content that comes out. It's still pretty difficult to predict that as well as different -- when we're making different -- when we're trying different things and different games, and you don't know how that's going to perform. That can also be another variable. So we're definitely getting better at it, and we have a lot more information and analytics that we can use to be more predictive. But there are different things that change every year, that can make it different from year-to-year. So I'd say we're getting better at it, but there are different things that we have in recurrent consumer spending each year. So I wouldn't say that it's a slam dunk, but it's definitely something that we're getting better at. \nKarl Slatoff: And in regards to your question about Hangar 13 and also Michael Condrey Studio, I wish I could tell you more about what they're working on because it's very exciting, both the studios. We're incredibly excited to have a team like Hangar 13 led by Haden and also Michael's yet to be named studio as well, working on new and setting projects. As I said before, our pipeline is very diverse and is very large, and we're going to share with you more about that in the coming months. And these 2 projects are obviously part of that. So you can certainly expect that there will be games coming out of those studios. I wish I could tell you more about them, but stay tuned because they're very exciting, and we're thrilled to be in business with both of those folks and their entire teams. So stay tuned. \nRyan Gee: Okay. And then if I could just follow-up on that, that last point. So BioShock, still several years out, Borderlands just came. Should we assume that your characterization of a robust slate ahead also includes Rockstar content, not just 2K studios? \nStrauss Zelnick: Yes, we're talking about the entire company, all of our labels Rockstar, Private Division, Social Point and 2K. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. \nEric Sheridan: Maybe a bigger picture one. You saw another player in the industry make a larger announcement with Google in the last couple of weeks. Curious how you're thinking about a couple of large secular themes that are playing out in the industry with respect to either owning or outsourcing your own technology infrastructure? How you think about the content you're producing being broadcast, broader over direct-to-consumer channels? And how to think about either owning that or partnering? And the same with respect to cloud computing as a distribution mechanism for gaming. How are you thinking about wrapping what you've been very good at over the years in terms of content creation and thinking about maybe amplifying that either through your own efforts or through partnerships and relationships? \nStrauss Zelnick: So I appreciate the question and the question points sort of points up our focus on expanding the company in this industry that has these extraordinary tailwinds through a focus on new technologies, new business models, new types of entertainment and new geographies or geographies where we're not currently represented. And so it's sort of for a multiple choice question, it would be all of the above. We're focusing on all of them. You specifically asked on the distribution side, how are we looking at that. And the answer is we are very engaged in looking at options that do include direct-to-consumer options. Our strategy has been to be where the consumer is. If I keep choking, Karl is going to have to dig on it. Our strategy has been -- apologies, to be where the consumer is and to be ecumenical about various distribution opportunities and to work with all of the players in the space, and I expect we'll continue to do all of that. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mario Lu with Barclays. \nX. Lu: I have a couple of questions, 1 on GTA and 1 on Red Dead. So GTA V have partnerships with Playstation now late last year and then Xbox's Game Pass in January, which I suspect it added millions of players. So any color you can provide regarding these types of partnerships? And specifically, how much of an uplift they provided to GTA Online bookings? And secondly, on Red Dead, glad to hear that Red Dead Online tripled year-on-year. So -- and then I know you mentioned before that GTA Online is in a world of its own. But how confident are you that Red Dead Online engagement can maintain or grow for 6 years plus as well? \nStrauss Zelnick: In terms of how specific arrangements with specific titles pan out, we typically don't go into that level of detail, except to say we enter into those arrangements with a view that they'll benefit the titles. They'll benefit us and that they'll benefit our partners. And more often than not, we are able to do all 3 of those things. In terms of the success of Red Dead Online, we are incredibly excited about the momentum that we're seeing in the quarter. We feel really good going forward. But as I said, when asked Grand Theft Auto Online early on and I was asked a lot about it, we really don't know how high up is. We really don't have any way of knowing where the consumer will take us. What we do know is that we're going to deliver a lot more great content. And so far, it does look like when we deliver great content into these beloved franchises, consumers show up and stay engaged. So we're very optimistic about the future of Red Dead Online, and we're excited about the momentum we see. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners. \nEric Handler: I actually got 2. For your first, wondered if you'd be willing to sort of lift the comodo on the development pipeline a little bit? And talk about how many AAA console games are currently in development and to the extent that maybe you could say how many of those might be released in the next 1 to 3 years and how many might be released in the next beyond 3 years? Anything to sort of give a little bit of a road map there would be greatly appreciated. And secondly, with Red Dead Online, when you originally launched GTA Online, you had a couple of big content drops that really help the development of that business, so gun runners and the first heist that you did. Wondered, have we seen that type of content drop yet for Red Dead Online? \nKarl Slatoff: Eric, it's Karl. Just regarding the pipeline, this question obviously comes up on every single call we had and every single meeting we have with investors. And we are -- like I said, we are going to share more about the pipeline, we do over the coming months. And exact -- give you some more color on exactly what constitutes that pipeline. So I'll give you a little bit more idea of between what we've got going on with new IP and existing franchises, free-to-play games, different business models, casual games, core games, mid-core games. And we're hoping to share a lot more information with you over the coming months regarding that. \nStrauss Zelnick: And in terms of Red Dead, I don't think you can compare content to content. The last content drops on Red Dead have been fantastically successful. And the latest update, Moonshiners did great and generated all of this excitement that we've seen reflected in the numbers. And then I'm confident that Rockstar Games will continue to deliver great content for Red Dead Online. But there's no real way to compare qualitatively to -- or I suppose, quantitatively to Grand Theft Auto Online content. They're just -- they are different games, and they have different types of content that's dropped. But the goal is to create content that consumers love and engage in and spend against. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. \nMichael Ng: I just have 1 on M&A for Strauss. As a group, it seems like video game publishers have been pretty resistant to making their frontline content available day and date on subscription products. Do you think that could eventually catalyze vertical consolidation to get that content in the future? And I'd also appreciate hearing your thoughts on the prospect of AAA horizontal consolidation as well? \nStrauss Zelnick: I think we're -- I'm proud of my crystal ball most of the time, where I really had a very bad crystal ball is when I've been predicting consolidation in the industry. I think I predicted meaningful consolidation in the industry about 10 years ago, and we're still waiting. So it seems that in an industry where you have these extraordinary tailwinds and weak players get washed out and really get sold for scrap, essentially, and strong players only get stronger, it's hard to imagine why you'd see a lot of horizontal consolidation. Horizontal consolidation tends to occur when the industries are under pressure or companies are under pressure, typically, certainly, in the entertainment industry, that's historically been the case. So I'm not sure what you expect. I think your question about vertical consolidation is interesting, even though first -- your first day at business school, they explained to you the vertical consolidation doesn't create value. One could imagine a powerful distributor that's anxious to build an audience could imagine that acquiring exclusive rights to key product would jump-start that. The track record of that going well in the linear entertainment business has been very poor, and has been tried over and over again. But I suppose it could be tried in the interactive entertainment business. Very hard for us, very hard for us to say. What we do every day is get up and try to do the best job we can, both from a creative point of view and a business point of view, and we try to be of service to our customers, our colleagues and our investors, and that's served us well. And in terms of our own approach to M&A, we have a significant cash balance, just shy of $2 billion. We don't have any debt. And we have a lot of cash flow. In fact, we've revised upward our expectations about adjusted operating cash flow for the year to $500 million up from $450 million. Our CapEx is down a little bit as well. So we certainly are in a position to pursue transactions. Our lens is, is it strategically powerful and is financially accretive, and that analysis led us to acquire Social Point several years ago. We're happy we did. And to the extent that an opportunity matches those criteria, we would hope to move forward as well. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Raymond Stochel with Consumer Edge Research. \nRaymond Stochel: One on retaining talent, and this isn't really meant to involve Dan Houser, but you can certainly comment on that as well. It's more in thinking about how you're opening up these new studios and even your equity investment in Proletariat. Can you talk about how the changing business models and the changing pipeline that you have as far as bringing new ideas to market is making you think differently about the way that you're incentivizing your employees? I know you think deeply about these matters. \nStrauss Zelnick: Yes. What we are trying always to think differently about is creativity. We know there will be a next new thing. You haven't seen the final expression of what interactive entertainment or entertainment is here in 2020. You're going to see big innovations, hopefully from us, but certainly from the industry, in the next 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20 years. And we're positioned so that we ought to be able to be at the front line of that, and shame on us if we're not. So the creative expression of what we do must evolve, will evolve. But the culture that underlies that here remains unchanged because it works. And part of the culture is compensation. In a for-profit enterprise, you can outline your culture verbally, but your compensation programs either will or will not drive that culture. And our culture is one of sharing, and our compensation programs are one of sharing. We emotionally share success. We all take responsibility for failure. And equally, our compensation programs align incentives with our shareholders by making sure that, essentially, we have profit shares, essentially. If we miss our goals, then incentive comp for the team is disappointing or 0. If we exceed our goals, it's good. If we massively exceed our goals, it's very good, but it's self-liquidating because it's driven by an increase in profits. And at the label level, we essentially, although we call it different things, have profit sharing arrangements. So the better the labels do, the better the human beings do, the better the shareholders do. That's our goal, and it's all formulaic because we don't believe in discretionary comp programs. We think they lead to politicking and other bad things. Our comp programs are almost entirely formulaic based on results versus plan and/or actual operational profitability at the divisional level. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Giaimo with Jefferies. \nAlexander Giaimo: Karl, you mentioned free-to-play as an opportunity in your remarks, you guys have a lot of valuable IP in your portfolio. So just curious if anything in your catalog could work on a free-to-play basis? Or if you were to launch a free-to-play offering, would it more likely be based on new IP? \nKarl Slatoff: Yes. I mean I think the short answer is, I'm sure there are lots of things in our catalog that would work on a free-to-play basis. And that doesn't necessarily mean that we pursue that. It really has to be the right mix of the creative goal and what the development team is trying to achieve from a creative perspective and then the business model, et cetera. In our free-to-play games, we tend to have the belief that you can't really invest at the same level on a free-to-play experience that you do in a standard ownership AAA type title. They're probably going to be examples in the future where that's not the case, but that's our general philosophy. So -- but that doesn't necessarily mean that an old franchise that was AAA ownership type model couldn't work in a free-to-play context. And certainly, new IP begets opportunities to pursue new business models and amongst those business models are free-to-play. So the answer really could be both. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Thornton with SunTrust. \nMatthew Thornton: My question was actually taken, but I'll ask a different one. I think it was Karl, you mentioned talking about the pipeline in the next couple of months here. I'm just curious, #1, is that just talking about the fiscal '21 slate? Or is that more of a multiyear outlook that you guys are thinking about providing? And then just kind of what venue is that on the next call? Is there a certain venue? Or is this kind of ad hoc by studio? Just how should we think about this information coming to us? Any color there? \nKarl Slatoff: Yes. I mean, our goal is, obviously -- look, we have insight into many years into the future what the pipeline is. And one thing we know for sure is that it will change. And not everything in the pipeline will see the light of day that's currently in the pipeline, and there'll be things that are not in the pipeline that will come out. But our goal is to share as much information as we can, to give you insight into what we see, which is a multiyear pipeline. And when exactly we do that, you'll have to wait and see, but really, it will be in the coming months, and when that information comes, you'll know it. \nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Jeff Cohen with Stephens Inc. \nJeffrey Cohen: Can you talk about engagement with the Rockstar Games Launcher since it went live back in September? And then could you eventually see adding games from other Take-Two studios or even games from third-party publishers? \nStrauss Zelnick: Yes, they've had very strong results with the Rockstar Game Launcher, and we're excited to see that. In terms of how the company will pursue it broadly, that's part of the work that we're doing now. We obviously do have a central site where you can buy games, and I would hope that our company would work together effectively to pursue various direct-to-consumer offerings. But equally, our labels are highly independent. So I think your expectations are probably that we're unlikely to have only 1 place of any sort to buy anything. We're likely to have multiple outlets. We're likely to have direct outlets. We're likely to be worked with third parties. And we're likely to have multiple opportunities throughout the organization. But the underpinnings within the organization, the technical underpinnings and the business underpinnings will be centralized. We will all work together cooperatively so we don't duplicate efforts. So you can see a consumer-facing approach that's quite varied. And then we have a highly efficient approach internally where we have all people working together productively in service of the same goals. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks. \nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We're very proud of the results driven by our creative teams and driven by our business teams as well. We're grateful to our colleagues all around the world. We're very grateful to our shareholders for their support and grateful to all of you who attended and took the time to be thoughtful and ask questions. \nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Karl Slatoff",
            "content": "Thanks, Strauss. I'll begin by discussing our upcoming releases. Throughout the coming months, 2K and Gearbox software will continue to support Borderlands 3 with a robust post-launch content strategy, including all new in-game mini events and 3 additional downloadable campaign expansions. Later this month at PAX East in Boston, 2K will unveil details about their future content offerings, Borderlands 3 upcoming release on Steam and more. In addition, Rockstar Games will continue to provide an array of content and gameplay experiences for the vast open worlds of Grand Theft Auto Online and Red Dead Online, which continue to set engagement records for the label. \n In fiscal 2021, Private Division will expand our offerings for the Nintendo Switch with the release of The Outer Worlds. As Strauss noted earlier, the title is incredibly well received by critics and consumers alike on its original launch platforms. And we are confident that we'll continue to thrill audiences as they immerse themselves in this player of choice-driven RPG on the switch. One of our organization's key priorities is building scale by growing the size of our development pipeline. Investing in our world class creative resources and partnering with the best independent studios in the industry enables Take-Two to enhance our industry-leading portfolio of intellectual property, which is the foundation of our strategy to grow our business and expand profitability. \n In December, 2K announced the formation of Cloud Chamber, which we'll be working on the next-generation of the globally acclaimed BioShock franchise for the next several years. Cloud Chamber is a collective of storytellers eager to push the limits of interactive entertainment by making unique, captivating and thoughtful experiences set in a rich immersive world. The team will be based in 2 locations, 2K's headquarters in Novato, California as well as in Montreal, Quebec, which marks the first ever 2K studio in Canada. \n Private Divisions is another example of our growing investment in new intellectual property. This year, we benefited from the exceptional performance of The Outer Worlds. Our new label is taking a strategic approach to working with some of the industry's best creative talent and is quickly amassing an impressive pipeline for the future.  During fiscal year 2021, Private Division plans to release Kerbal Space Program 2 and Disintegration, which just completed a successful technical beta. Private Division will have more announcements about their growing portfolio over time. \n Mobile, which continues to be the highest growing -- highest grossing and fastest growing segment in the interactive entertainment is an important opportunity for Take-Two. Social Point currently has 5 games active in the market, including Dragon City, Monster Legends, World Chef, Tasty Town and Word Life, and they have more than 10 new games in the various stages of development. In addition, we continue to pursue new mobile offerings and extensions of our existing franchises, such as WWE SuperCard and NBA 2K Mobile. The global proliferation of smart mobile devices and high-speed data networks represents an exciting entry point into emerging markets, particularly in China, Latin America, Africa and India. \n Take-Two's development pipeline over the next 5 years is the largest and most diverse in our company's history, including releases from our biggest franchises, exciting new IP, free-to-play offerings and a diverse mix of casual, mid-core and core gaming experiences. We will have much more to share on this exciting slate of titles in the months to come. \n In addition to our focus on growing existing and building new franchises, we have a number of emerging opportunities that have the potential to contribute to our growth and margin expansion.  Streaming may become a compelling distribution platform for our industry that could expand our market and increase margins. With our frontline of catalog offerings, the highest quality content drives consumer adoption and Take-Two's portfolio is a must-have for any new platform. During the holiday season, we released Red Dead Redemption 2, NBA 2K20 and Borderlands 3 for purchase on Google Stadia. eSports remains an exciting new segment for our industry and company. The NBA 2K League, our first foray into competitive gaming and partnership with the NBA, is gearing up for its third season that will begin at the end of this month. The league continues to expand with new teams joining this year, bringing the count to 23, including the first international and non-NBA team, the Gen.G Tigers of Shanghai. The launch of the Gen.G Tigers is the first step in the long-term effort to build a stronger global presence for the league. In January, the NBA 2K League hosted its global invitation match, a series of exhibition matches featuring APAC invitational players and the 2019 NBA 2K League Finals MVP playing against top representatives from NBA 2K Online 2. The games were live streamed in China on Tencent's Penguin Esports, Gen.G streaming partner Douyu and Huya, as well as on the NBA 2K League's Twitch and YouTube channels. We are very excited about the continued progress and growth of the league, which has a long-term potential to enhance engagement and to be a driver of profits for our company. \n In closing, as we begin a new decade, we enter an incredibly exciting period for our industry and company, which should bring technological advancements as well as compelling new platforms and business models. We remain steadfast in our commitment to deliver the highest quality entertainment experiences to captivate and engage our audiences throughout the world and to generate growth and margin expansion. \n I'll now turn the call over to Lainie. It's Karl. We weren't really excited about the next-generation console. So I think the best part about it is that I think everyone now knows that we are going to have the next-generation console, and there's a lot of anticipation for it. I'll leave the details about what the expectations are to our partners, Microsoft and Sony. But I think so far the buzz about what the consoles are going to be able to do from a technological perspective, is very exciting for us. And so in that regard, I think it eliminates uncertainty because we know we're going to next console cycle and that we believe it will be very robust and a great thing for the industry. And again, anytime that you have these kinds of advancements in tech, it creates opportunities for our great -- incredible creative team to push the limits of those -- of that technology and create the experiences that we know consumers are going to -- want to engage with for very long periods of time, even after the initial sale. So to the extent that we've got the ability to do that, and all indications is that we will, and we expect this will lead to growth for our company. It's a very positive thing. Yes. I mean, look, how -- what exactly the transition is going to be from console -- from each game from console -- between the console cycles will vary. But there's no reason to believe that the success that we're experiencing with those services would be any less in the new generation than is in the old generation. And in regards to your question about Hangar 13 and also Michael Condrey Studio, I wish I could tell you more about what they're working on because it's very exciting, both the studios. We're incredibly excited to have a team like Hangar 13 led by Haden and also Michael's yet to be named studio as well, working on new and setting projects. As I said before, our pipeline is very diverse and is very large, and we're going to share with you more about that in the coming months. And these 2 projects are obviously part of that. So you can certainly expect that there will be games coming out of those studios. I wish I could tell you more about them, but stay tuned because they're very exciting, and we're thrilled to be in business with both of those folks and their entire teams. So stay tuned. Eric, it's Karl. Just regarding the pipeline, this question obviously comes up on every single call we had and every single meeting we have with investors. And we are -- like I said, we are going to share more about the pipeline, we do over the coming months. And exact -- give you some more color on exactly what constitutes that pipeline. So I'll give you a little bit more idea of between what we've got going on with new IP and existing franchises, free-to-play games, different business models, casual games, core games, mid-core games. And we're hoping to share a lot more information with you over the coming months regarding that. Yes. I mean I think the short answer is, I'm sure there are lots of things in our catalog that would work on a free-to-play basis. And that doesn't necessarily mean that we pursue that. It really has to be the right mix of the creative goal and what the development team is trying to achieve from a creative perspective and then the business model, et cetera.

            "name": "Lainie Goldstein",
            "content": "Thanks, Karl. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, we'll discuss our third quarter results and then review our financial outlook for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020. Please note that additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release. \n As Strauss mentioned, we experienced robust demand for our offerings throughout the 2019 holiday season that enabled us to deliver third quarter operating results solidly within our increased outlook. Total net bookings were $888 million as compared to our outlook of $860 million to $910 million. Current consumer spending grew 6% and accounted for 41% of total net bookings as compared to our outlook of 5% growth. Digitally delivered net bookings decreased slightly by 2% and accounted for 78% of the total, as compared to our outlook of 5% growth. The decrease was due to very strong fiscal sales of our titles over the holidays. During the third quarter, 44% of current generation console games were delivered digitally, up from 31% last year. \n Turning to some details from our third quarter income statement. GAAP net revenue grew to $930 million and cost of goods sold decreased to $437 million. Operating expenses increased by 6% to $316 million, due primarily to higher personnel and R&D costs, offset by lower marketing expenses. And GAAP net income was $164 million or $1.43 per share as compared to $180 million or $1.57 per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. Adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow for the 9 months ended December 31, 2019, was $548 million, and we ended the period with approximately $2 billion in cash and short-term investments. \n Now I will review the highlights of our fiscal 2020 financial outlook. Starting with the fourth quarter. We project net bookings to range from $540 million to $590 million, up from $488 million in the fourth quarter last year. The largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, NBA 2K20, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Sid Meier's Civilization VI and Borderlands 3. We project our current consumer spending to grow by approximately 10%, driven primarily by growing Grand Theft Auto Online and Red Dead Online. We expect digitally delivered net bookings to increase by over 20%. Our forecast assumes that 66% of our current generation console games will be delivered digitally, up from 57% in the same period last year. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $635 million to $685 million and cost of goods sold to range from $274 million to $286 million. \n Operating expenses are expected to range from $247 million to $257 million. At the midpoint, this represents a 13% increase over last year, driven primarily by higher personnel costs and marketing expenses. And GAAP net income is expected to range from $105 million to $128 million or $0.92 to $1.12 per share. For management reporting purposes, we expect our tax rate to be 17% throughout fiscal 2020. \n Turning to our outlook for the full fiscal year. We are raising the low end of our net bookings outlook by $50 million and maintaining the high end. We now expect net bookings to range from $2.8 billion to $2.85 billion. The increase is driven by higher expectations for Grand Theft Auto Online, including record recurrent consumer spending on the title, Grand Theft Auto V and The Outer Worlds, partially offset by reduced expectations for Borderlands 3 and recurrent consumer spending on NBA 2K. The reduced expectations for Borderlands 3 are still consistent with our original high expectations for the title prior to launch. The largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K20 and NBA 2K19, Grand Theft Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Borderlands 3, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, The Outer Worlds and Sid Meier's Civilization VI. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 55% 2K, 35% Rockstar Games and 10% Private Division and Social Point. And we forecast our geographic net bookings split to be about 60% United States and 40% international. We are maintaining our forecast for recurrent consumer spending to increase by approximately 25%. \n We now project digitally delivered net bookings to grow by approximately 25% versus our prior expectation of nearly 30% growth due to a higher mix of physical sales. Note that this is still above our forecast given in August of high-teens growth. Our outlook assumes that 55% of current generation console games will be delivered digitally, up from 38% last year. We are increasing our outlook for adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow to over $500 million versus our prior expectation of over $450 million. We now plan to deploy approximately $60 million for capital expenditures versus a prior expectation of $75 million. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $2.96 billion to $3.01 billion and cost of goods sold to range from $1.42 billion to $1.43 billion. Total operating expenses are expected to range from $1.13 billion to $1.4 billion. At the midpoint, this represents a 20% increase over the prior year, driven primarily by higher marketing, R&D and personnel costs. And we expect GAAP net income to range from $387 million to $409 million or $3.38 to $3.58 per share. \n In closing, our focus on producing the highest quality entertainment delivered strong third quarter results and reaffirmed that Take-Two remains on pace to deliver another terrific year. Looking ahead with our world-class creative teams, firm commitment to operational excellence and solid financial foundation, our company is exceptionally well positioned to deliver value to our customers and returns to our shareholders. \n Thank you. I will now turn the call back to Strauss. Right. When we went into the Christmas season, we had really seen real excitement for the title, and we've lifted our expectations a little bit higher than we had it at the very beginning of the year, which was very high to begin with. So we didn't meet those -- that higher expectations, but we did meet our original very high expectations for the title. So that's why we're bringing it down slightly, but it's very high from the beginning of the year. So in the first one, we have said that the NBA 2K is the highest contributor in recurrent consumer spending for all titles. So we have said that. What is your second question? Sorry, I've missed that one. Now with including the special editions, it's not up. It's only without including the special edition. Well, in terms of forecasting, with recurrent consumer spending, there are some things that I think are easier to predict, but it does present other challenges as well, especially when you have titles that are out in the market for such a long time, and you would expect them to decline. And then 1 year, they decline, and then the next year, they grow, and there's different content that comes out. It's still pretty difficult to predict that as well as different -- when we're making different -- when we're trying different things and different games, and you don't know how that's going to perform. That can also be another variable. So we're definitely getting better at it, and we have a lot more information and analytics that we can use to be more predictive. But there are different things that change every year, that can make it different from year-to-year. So I'd say we're getting better at it, but there are different things that we have in recurrent consumer spending each year. So I wouldn't say that it's a slam dunk, but it's definitely something that we're getting better at."

            "name": "Strauss Zelnick",
            "content": "Thanks, Hank. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Throughout the 2019 holiday season, we experienced robust demand for our offerings that drove third quarter operating results solidly within our increased outlook. Our net bookings were substantially higher than what we included for the third quarter when we gave our original fiscal 2020 outlook last May as well as when we increased our outlook last August. Highlights are the performance of Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, NBA 2K20, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, The Outer Worlds and Borderlands 3, reflecting our ability to deliver some of the most captivating experiences in the entertainment industry. \n Grand Theft Auto Online once again exceeded our expectations, delivering its best holiday quarter ever for both audience size and net bookings. During the third quarter, recurrent consumer spending on Grand Theft Auto Online grew 54%, driven by Rockstar Games continued release of engaging new content. Grand Theft Auto Online had its biggest series of back-to-back updates ever in terms of player numbers, with records in audience size in December and the third quarter following the release of The Diamond Casino & Resort update in July and The Diamond Casino Heist in December. We're now on track to deliver a new record for Grand Theft Auto Online recurrent consumer spending in fiscal 2020. \n Sales of Grand Theft Auto V also exceeded our expectations, and the title has now sold in more than 120 million units. According to the NPD Group, Grand Theft Auto V was the best-selling game of the decade in the U.S. based on both unit and dollar sales. \n Red Dead Online continues to gain momentum, both in terms of engagement and recurrent consumer spending. Net bookings from Red Dead Online outperformed our expectations during the third quarter, almost tripling, both year-over-year and sequentially, excluding digital content bundled with the Red Dead Redemption 2 premium editions. Red Dead Online hit a new peak in player numbers in December following the release of the latest update, Moonshiners, and exceeded those numbers and set a new record in January. We remain as excited as ever about the long-term opportunity for Red Dead Online to be a significant driver of recurrent consumer spending. In November, Red Dead Redemption 2 launched for the PC and Google Stadia to date has sold in over 29 million units. According to the NPD Group, Red Dead Redemption 2 was the top title of the last 4 years based on U.S. dollar sales. \n There is noting that the collective lifetime selling of Grand Theft Auto V and Red Dead Redemption 2 is now -- more than 150 million units worldwide with over 250 million lifetime game accounts created across both titles. Rockstar Games total online audience is also its biggest to date, having recorded record numbers in the third quarter. \n On October 25, Private Division launched The Outer Worlds for Xbox One, Playstation 4 in PC. Developed by Obsidian Entertainment, The Outer Worlds has significantly exceeded our expectations and has sold in more than 2 million units to date. Critical response to the game has been outstanding, and The Outer Worlds has won more than 75 awards, including Game of the Year from the New York Video Game critic circle and Destructoid and Best RPG of the Year from IGN, Shacknews, Gamerex and others. The title is also a finalist for the DICE awards outstanding achievement and story and the RPG of the year. We're confident that The Outer Worlds will continue to expand its audience, including through its release on the Nintendo Switch, which is now planned for fiscal 2021. \n Unit sales of NBA 2K20, the latest installment in our industry-leading basketball series, has outperformed our expectations, and the title has sold in over 8 million units to date, up slightly over NBA 2K19 in the same period. In November, the title was released for Google Stadia. In addition, engagement with NBA 2K20 is reaching all-time highs with average daily active users growing and MyTeam users up more than 35%. In addition, NBA 2K20 has generated more than 276 million views on YouTube and over 8 million hours of content watched on Twitch across hundreds of channels. While this increased engagement led to strong growth in recurrent consumer spending in certain modes of NBA 2K20, we've not experienced the same positive benefits across the entire game due to some specific design changes, which we plan to address in future versions of NBA 2K. Because of this, we no longer expect lifetime net bookings for NBA 2K20 to be a record for the series. However, we continue to expect recurrent consumer spending for the NBA 2K franchise to grow in the strong double digits for fiscal 2020. Taking creative risk is part of Take-Two's DNA as we constantly strive to improve the game play experience for our audiences. More often than not, this results in enhancing our growth, which is reflected in the substantial long-term outperformance of NBA 2K. \n Turning to Borderlands 3, the latest installment in our genre defining shooter-looter series continues to expand its audience since its record-breaking launch in September, with more than 50% user growth in comparison to Borderlands 2, at the same time, in its life cycle. 2K and Gearbox are supporting the game with free content as well as 4 downloadable campaign expansions, which are included with the Borderlands 3 Super Deluxe Edition and the season pass or can be purchased separately upon release. The first of these expansions, Moxxi's Heist and The Handsome Jackpot was released during the third quarter and was positively received by critics and consumers alike, helping to drive a season pass attach rate for Borderlands 3 that was a record, both for the series and for 2K at the same point in the title's life cycle. In December, Borderlands 3 was released for Google Stadia, and will be available on Steam in the coming months. To date, Borderlands 3 has sold in nearly 8 million units, and we expect lifetime unit sales to be a record for the series. \n Earlier in the quarter, 2K launched WWE 2K20 for Playstation 4, Xbox One and PC. WWE 2K20 features several new gameplay modes that celebrate the WWE's thriving women's division, as well as an array of fan favorite superstars, legends and match types. While we're disappointed that WWE 2K20 did not meet our expectations, both in terms of sales and quality, 2K is actively working with visual concepts to ensure that these issues are addressed in the future, and they'll have more to share on their plans soon. The WWE brand continues to expand worldwide, and there remains a substantial long-term opportunity to grow our WWE 2K series by improving the quality of the game. \n Among Take-Two's core tenets is our aim to be the most creative and the most innovative company in the entertainment industry. Today, in addition to delivering the highest quality stand-alone entertainment experiences, we measure our success by our ability to captivate and engage audiences well beyond the title's initial release. To that end, during the third quarter, recurrent consumer spending grew 6% and accounted for 41% of our total net bookings. \n In addition to virtual currency for NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Red Dead Online, recurrent consumer spending was enhanced by a variety of other offerings. In the free-to-play category, Social Point continues to be a meaningful contributor to our results through its mobile titles Dragon City, Monster Legends, World Chef, Tasty Town and Word Life. During the quarter, Social Point added new content, special events and updates to these games. Our Barcelona based studio continues to invest in its broad and innovative pipeline of new games planned for launch in the coming years. \n 2K launched season 6 of WWE SuperCard featuring all new card tiers and upgraded features. The title has now been downloaded more than 20 million times and remains 2K's highest grossing mobile title. \n NBA 2K Online in China remains the #1 PC online sports game in China, with more than 48 million registered users. Add-on content grew 135%, led by offerings for Borderlands 3, Sid Meier's Civilization VI and WWE 2K20. \n Finally, sales of Borderlands 3 premium additions, which include additional content that is allocated to recurrent consumer spending, also contributed during the period. As a result of our solid third quarter results and outlook for the fourth quarter, we're increasing the low end of our fiscal 2020 operating outlook, while maintaining the high end. Fiscal 2020 is shaping up to be another terrific year for Take-Two. \n Looking ahead, our company has the strongest development pipeline in its history, and we're committed to supporting our titles with offerings designed to drive ongoing engagement. In addition, we're actively investing in emerging markets, platforms and business models that have significant potential to enhance our growth. Take-Two is exceedingly well positioned to capitalize on the many positive trends in our industry, and to generate returns for our shareholders over the long term. \n I'll now turn the call over to Karl. Thanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for their hard work and commitment to excellence. To our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued support. We'll now take your questions. Operator? Todd, thanks for your question. This is Strauss. So Dan Houser had been on an extended leave since early spring 2019. The company has been led since its founding by Sam Houser, who's President of the company, and it's an extraordinary team effort and Sam is a great player and coach. The results of Rockstar Games continue to be extraordinary with the launch of the new content for both Grand Theft Auto Online and for Red Dead Online, and it's amazingly gratifying to see Grand Theft Auto V selling at 120 million units and Red Dead Redemption 2 to be up to 29 million units with the launch on PC and Stadia as well as the really extraordinary results of Grand Theft Auto Online, which we now expect to have another record year, more than 6 years after its initial launch. And of course, Red Dead Online itself, was up something like 3x year-over-year and sequentially in the last quarter. So the label has really never been stronger. We're incredibly optimistic and excited. At the same time, we're grateful to Dan for his contributions, and we wish him well. So as we always do, you're going to hear our initial outlook for fiscal '21 in May, and our labels, of course, always make our product releases. We have set our strategy, as you correctly pointed out, is to have a strong frontline release schedule, both iterations from beloved franchises. We have 11 franchises that have sold in at least 5 million units within one release as well as new intellectual property, and we are working on the most robust pipeline in our history. So we're amazingly excited about it. That said, we haven't always been able to achieve our goal of having a strong frontline release schedule in every year, or even in the recent past. What has been great, though, is we've now built a company that has these very strong underpinnings of catalog titles and ongoing titles that live on in the hearts and minds of our consumers, generating engagement and generating net bookings and profits. So right now, we have titles like Grand Theft Auto Online, Red Dead Online, all the Social Point titles, and there are 5 that are successfully in market, NBA 2K Online in China, WWE SuperCard, which has been downloaded more than 20 million times, and the list goes on. And in this past quarter, for example, catalog sales represented about 40% of our net bookings. So we now have a company that season in and season out, we feel confident can generate plenty of net bookings, can engage with consumers and can generate a great deal of profitability. And of course, at the same time, we'll build our business with those frontline new releases. Given that we're a company that depends on our creative teams to make as close to perfect products as possible, we have to be willing to live with the vagaries of product deliveries. And that means, sometimes, we will have thin frontline years. But even in those frontline years, we've been able to deliver really great financial results. Yes. First of all, I want to make sure that we distinguish between a problem and a high-class problem. So the high-class problem is that we had said in our revised outlook that we thought NBA 2K20 would set another record for net bookings. Then now we're realizing that to say we don't expect it to set another record, despite its very strong unit sales and the great engagement. And that's because one of the parts of the online version has recurrent consumer spending coming in somewhat lower than we had expected. And that's related to a design feature and one that we can address going forward. But it's not really a hiccup because our goal is first and foremost to captivate and engage consumers, and our engagement is up, and our unit sales are up, and the title quality is just phenomenal. It's also true that as a company that doesn't lead with monetization, we lead with entertainment and engagement. Now and then, our monetization may not be exactly what we think it will be. So let me take responsibility for the decision to focus first and foremost on the entertainment experience and the consumer and only secondarily on what the monetization is. And that means now and then, we may fall short of setting a record, but failing to set a record isn't exactly a problem when you have a title that is massively successful as NBA 2K20 is, it's an incredibly profitable title for the firm. And incidentally, recurrent consumer spending for the franchise will actually be up in the fiscal year in solid double digits. So the engagement is strong. The spending is strong, and at the same time, there were some design changes that didn't optimize specific recurrent consumer spending in certain modes. And we are confident we'll be able to address those. Well, Borderlands is actually performing better than our original outlook. It's sold in nearly 8 million units. We've launched one of the downloadable content packs. We have three more expected at the moment. And in fact, the season passes attach rate is a record for the series and a record for 2K at this point of the title's life cycle, and we expect that the Borderlands 3 will set a record in terms of net bookings for the franchise. So our expectations remain solid and very strong. It's a great big hit for us. This is -- again, this is a massive hit by any standard. But we've always said this when we guide and when we revise, we aim to be accurate. And sometimes, the vagaries of the entertainment business will be that we don't exactly get it right. We continue to have very high expectations. As I said, we fully expect that Borderlands 3 will set a record for the franchise. It's hard to say. I think what we've said all along is that, generally speaking, we want to be where the consumer is. Generally speaking, we think subscription offerings to the extent they exist, are probably better suited to catalog, but we're willing to take experimental chances when it makes sense for a particular title and when the deal underlying that option also makes sense for us. And we're pleased that we have a great partnership with Microsoft, and we're mostly pleased that the title is such a big hit, it's sold in more than 2 million units and it's won 75 game awards. So it's early days for all of these platforms. It's obviously early days for many technologies, including streaming technology. Our goal is to be where the consumer is. We're ecumenical and we're open minded. And in terms of your question about Rockstar, and I think your question -- I think your question will fall in the category of the stability of the team going forward as well as the culture of the label. So in terms of team stability, Sam Houser is President of Rockstar Games. He founded Rockstar Games. He's a great player, coach and he leads the team of thousands of people every day who are trying to make the most extraordinary entertainment experiences known to me. And that's -- those are their goals. And more often than not, they achieve or even exceed those goals, which is just amazing. It doesn't -- I don't typically speak for other people, but I confidently can speak and say that Sam is highly committed to the organization. And Sam and I work very closely together, and it's an enormous pleasure to be able to be in business with Sam and the entire team at Rockstar. \n Culturally, I've only seen ongoing improvements at Rockstar, frankly. I have only seen growth and engagement and innovation. And I think one of the great things about all of our labels and our company as a whole is that we're incredibly self critical, and we're -- we aim to be utterly transparent, and we always try to do better. And I think that's true everywhere, the Take-Two touches and Rockstar Games sets a standard for always trying to improve the quality of its operations, the quality of the way that they work and the quality of their culture. I frankly couldn't be more proud of how effectively that label is operating. I think this year has been one of amazing strength, I mean, dropping content on the same day for both Red Dead Online and Grand Theft Auto Online and delivering content that set records in terms of engagement and player excitement and incidentally revenue and profitability. So things couldn't be better. And to be very specific, no, we certainly don't expect other departures. As an organization as a whole, we have an extraordinarily low rate of attrition, vastly lower than the industry average. And I think that's because we offer great place to work at all of our labels and the Take-Two corporate as well. And to the extent that we ever fall short, we always aim to do better. Yes, we're talking about the entire company, all of our labels Rockstar, Private Division, Social Point and 2K. So I appreciate the question and the question points sort of points up our focus on expanding the company in this industry that has these extraordinary tailwinds through a focus on new technologies, new business models, new types of entertainment and new geographies or geographies where we're not currently represented. And so it's sort of for a multiple choice question, it would be all of the above. We're focusing on all of them. You specifically asked on the distribution side, how are we looking at that. And the answer is we are very engaged in looking at options that do include direct-to-consumer options. Our strategy has been to be where the consumer is. If I keep choking, Karl is going to have to dig on it. Our strategy has been -- apologies, to be where the consumer is and to be ecumenical about various distribution opportunities and to work with all of the players in the space, and I expect we'll continue to do all of that. In terms of how specific arrangements with specific titles pan out, we typically don't go into that level of detail, except to say we enter into those arrangements with a view that they'll benefit the titles. They'll benefit us and that they'll benefit our partners. And more often than not, we are able to do all 3 of those things. In terms of the success of Red Dead Online, we are incredibly excited about the momentum that we're seeing in the quarter. We feel really good going forward. But as I said, when asked Grand Theft Auto Online early on and I was asked a lot about it, we really don't know how high up is. We really don't have any way of knowing where the consumer will take us. What we do know is that we're going to deliver a lot more great content. And so far, it does look like when we deliver great content into these beloved franchises, consumers show up and stay engaged. So we're very optimistic about the future of Red Dead Online, and we're excited about the momentum we see. And in terms of Red Dead, I don't think you can compare content to content. The last content drops on Red Dead have been fantastically successful. And the latest update, Moonshiners did great and generated all of this excitement that we've seen reflected in the numbers. And then I'm confident that Rockstar Games will continue to deliver great content for Red Dead Online. But there's no real way to compare qualitatively to -- or I suppose, quantitatively to Grand Theft Auto Online content. They're just -- they are different games, and they have different types of content that's dropped. But the goal is to create content that consumers love and engage in and spend against. I think we're -- I'm proud of my crystal ball most of the time, where I really had a very bad crystal ball is when I've been predicting consolidation in the industry. I think I predicted meaningful consolidation in the industry about 10 years ago, and we're still waiting. So it seems that in an industry where you have these extraordinary tailwinds and weak players get washed out and really get sold for scrap, essentially, and strong players only get stronger, it's hard to imagine why you'd see a lot of horizontal consolidation. Horizontal consolidation tends to occur when the industries are under pressure or companies are under pressure, typically, certainly, in the entertainment industry, that's historically been the case. So I'm not sure what you expect. I think your question about vertical consolidation is interesting, even though first -- your first day at business school, they explained to you the vertical consolidation doesn't create value. One could imagine a powerful distributor that's anxious to build an audience could imagine that acquiring exclusive rights to key product would jump-start that. The track record of that going well in the linear entertainment business has been very poor, and has been tried over and over again. But I suppose it could be tried in the interactive entertainment business. Very hard for us, very hard for us to say. What we do every day is get up and try to do the best job we can, both from a creative point of view and a business point of view, and we try to be of service to our customers, our colleagues and our investors, and that's served us well. And in terms of our own approach to M&A, we have a significant cash balance, just shy of $2 billion. We don't have any debt. And we have a lot of cash flow. In fact, we've revised upward our expectations about adjusted operating cash flow for the year to $500 million up from $450 million. Our CapEx is down a little bit as well. So we certainly are in a position to pursue transactions. Our lens is, is it strategically powerful and is financially accretive, and that analysis led us to acquire Social Point several years ago. We're happy we did. And to the extent that an opportunity matches those criteria, we would hope to move forward as well. Yes. What we are trying always to think differently about is creativity. We know there will be a next new thing. You haven't seen the final expression of what interactive entertainment or entertainment is here in 2020. You're going to see big innovations, hopefully from us, but certainly from the industry, in the next 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20 years. And we're positioned so that we ought to be able to be at the front line of that, and shame on us if we're not. So the creative expression of what we do must evolve, will evolve. But the culture that underlies that here remains unchanged because it works. And part of the culture is compensation. In a for-profit enterprise, you can outline your culture verbally, but your compensation programs either will or will not drive that culture. And our culture is one of sharing, and our compensation programs are one of sharing. We emotionally share success. We all take responsibility for failure. And equally, our compensation programs align incentives with our shareholders by making sure that, essentially, we have profit shares, essentially. If we miss our goals, then incentive comp for the team is disappointing or 0. If we exceed our goals, it's good. If we massively exceed our goals, it's very good, but it's self-liquidating because it's driven by an increase in profits. And at the label level, we essentially, although we call it different things, have profit sharing arrangements. So the better the labels do, the better the human beings do, the better the shareholders do. That's our goal, and it's all formulaic because we don't believe in discretionary comp programs. We think they lead to politicking and other bad things. Our comp programs are almost entirely formulaic based on results versus plan and/or actual operational profitability at the divisional level. Yes, they've had very strong results with the Rockstar Game Launcher, and we're excited to see that. In terms of how the company will pursue it broadly, that's part of the work that we're doing now. We obviously do have a central site where you can buy games, and I would hope that our company would work together effectively to pursue various direct-to-consumer offerings. But equally, our labels are highly independent. So I think your expectations are probably that we're unlikely to have only 1 place of any sort to buy anything. We're likely to have multiple outlets. We're likely to have direct outlets. We're likely to be worked with third parties. And we're likely to have multiple opportunities throughout the organization. But the underpinnings within the organization, the technical underpinnings and the business underpinnings will be centralized. We will all work together cooperatively so we don't duplicate efforts. So you can see a consumer-facing approach that's quite varied. And then we have a highly efficient approach internally where we have all people working together productively in service of the same goals. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We're very proud of the results driven by our creative teams and driven by our business teams as well. We're grateful to our colleagues all around the world. We're very grateful to our shareholders for their support and grateful to all of you who attended and took the time to be thoughtful and ask questions."

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that Take-Two's positive momentum continued in the second quarter, enabling our company to generate operating results that significantly exceeded our expectations. We delivered a strong net bookings, cash flow and earnings growth, fueled by the performance of NBA 2K, Borderlands 3, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, and Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online. \n Once again, our strategy of creating the highest-quality entertainment in the industry translated into outstanding results. On September 13, 2K and Gearbox Software launched Borderlands 3, the latest installment in our genre-defining shooter-looter series. The title has exceeded our expectations and sold more than 5 million units within its first 5 days of launch, making it the fastest selling title in 2K's history and the highest selling title for the label on PC. Within its first 5 days in market, retail sell-through Borderlands 3 was up more than 50% compared to its predecessor, and 70% of units were purchased digitally, setting a new record for a 2K cross-platform title. \n Borderlands 3 received resoundingly positive critical acclaim with Forbes, IGN, Shacknews, Destructoid, and Meristation, all scoring the title 9 out of 10. Today, Borderlands 3 has sold-in nearly 7 million units worldwide. I'd like to congratulate the teams at Gearbox and 2K on a stellar launch in taking this beloved series to new heights. Karl will share details about our post-launch content plan that will keep players engaged in the world of Borderlands 3. \n Our industry-leading basketball series continued to grow during the second quarter. With net bookings up approximately 9% despite a difficult comparison, driven by the successful September 6 launch of NBA 2K20. According to The NPD Group, NBA 2K20 is the best-selling game of 2019 to date, delivered the highest launch month sales for any sports game in history. And the NBA 2K series is now the sixth largest video game franchise in the industry based on dollar sales. \n Driven demand NBA 2K20 remained strong and the title has sold in nearly 6 million units to date, generating growth over the prior year's release. During the second quarter, recurrent consumer spending in NBA 2K grew 32% to a new record, and remained the single largest contributor to that category of our business. Engagement with the NBA 2K20 also increased driven by a consistent new content schedule with daily active users up almost 20% compared to NBA 2K19. And MyCAREER or MyTeam growing by more than 30% and 150% respectively. \n We expect lifetime net bookings for NBA 2K20 to set a new record for the series. In addition, 2K recently announced the NBA 2K20 x Nike Gamer Exclusive Program, an innovative first-of-its-kind gaming and sneaker partnership. This program provides players with the opportunity to unlock virtual Nike gamer exclusive sneakers for their MyPLAYER to wear in-game and to purchase real-life versions of the same shoes from Nike. I'd like to congratulate 2K and Visual Concepts for, once again, redefining what is possible in sports gaming and catching superbly every nuance of the NBA and the pop culture that envelops it. \n Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, once again, exceeded our expectations, delivering the best quarter yet with respect to daily, weekly and monthly active users and our best summer ever in terms of new online users and new users overall. Recurrent consumer spending on Grand Theft Auto Online grew 23% to a new record, driven by the July release of The Diamond Casino & Resort update. This update was Grand Theft Auto Online's biggest content launch ever, delivering record player engagement across daily, weekly and monthly active users in July and then again in August. \n As a result of the title's better-than-expected performance fiscal year-to-date and improved outlook for the balance of the year, we now expect Grand Theft Auto Online to grow in fiscal 2020. Grand Theft Auto V remains the standard bearer for excellence in our industry and one of the most revered and successful entertainment experiences of all time. The title continues to expand its audience around the world and has now sold in more than 115 million units. \n Grand Theft Auto Online continues to gain momentum and grew sequentially during the second quarter. Following the massive content drop in May when the title exited its beta phase, on September 10, the world of Red Dead Online evolved further with the release of the Frontier Pursuits update. This update introduced 3 specialist roles, including tracking down wanted criminals as a Bounty Hunter, searching the world for treasure and other exotic items to sell as a Collector, and building a business as a Trader. Rockstar Games intends to add more new roles in the future, enabling players fully to inhabit their characters as they carve out a life on the Frontier. \n Rockstar Games also introduced the popular Outlaw Pass, a way for Red Dead Online players to pay to access a wide array of ongoing upgrades, items and perks at a discounted value. Throughout the year, Rockstar Games will continue to support both Red Dead Online and Grand Theft Auto Online, with many more updates in order to drive engagement and player growth. We remain as excited as ever about the long-term opportunity for Red Dead Online to be a meaningful driver of recurrent consumer spending. In addition, Red Dead Redemption 2 continues to grow its audience, and to date, has sold an almost 26.5 million units worldwide. Earlier this week, the title launched on PC with an array of features designed specifically for that audience, including numerous graphical enhancements, a fully featured photo mode, new content additions for the game's story mode, and more. \n On August 27, Private Division launched Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey for digital download on PC. The title is the first release from Panache Digital Games, the studio cofounded by Patrice D\u00e9silets, the original creative director of the Assassin's Creed franchise. Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey was lauded by the media for its sophistication and unique approach to the survival category and will be available for digital download on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on December 6. \n Our second quarter results were also enhanced by Social Point's mobile games, the WWE 2K franchise and Sid Meier's Civilization VI. One of our key strategic priorities is to find new and innovative ways to drive growth and engagement with our titles after their initial purchase. From free-to-play open worlds to additional chapters and content, we aim to provide consumers with the highest-quality offerings that meaningfully add to their overall gameplay experience. \n To that end, during the second quarter, the recurrent consumer spending significantly exceeded our expectations, growing 39% and accounting for 45% of our total net bookings. In addition to virtual currency for NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Red Dead Online, recurrent consumer spending was enhanced by a variety of other offerings, including sales of the Borderlands 3 premium additions, which include additional content that is allocated to recurrent consumer spending. In the free-to-play category, Social Point remains a meaningful contributor to our results through its mobile titles, Dragon City and Monster Legends, World Chef and Tasty Town and Word Life. During the quarter, Social Point added new content, challenges and updates to these games. \n Our Barcelona-based studio continues to invest in its broad pipeline of new games planned for launch in the coming years. WWE SuperCard has now been downloaded nearly 20 million times and remains 2K's highest grossing mobile title. And recurrent consumer spending on NBA 2K online in China outperformed our expectations, growing 27% in the second quarter. The title remains the #1 PC online sports game in China with more than 47 million registered users. \n Lastly, add-on content grew more than 60%, led by offering for Sid Meier's Civilization VI and the Borderlands franchise. As a result of our better-than-expected second quarter operating results, we're once again raising our operating outlook for fiscal 2020. Looking ahead, we have the strongest development pipeline in our history. We're continuing to grow our portfolio with the highest-quality entertainment experiences, including sequels from our biggest franchises as well as exciting new IP. \n In addition, we're actively investing in emerging markets, platforms and business models such as mobile, streaming, direct-to-consumer and subscription in order to expand our audience around the world. With the promise of new consoles and continuous technological advances, our creative teams have an increasingly robust canvas on which to achieve their vision and set new benchmarks for excellence. Take-Two's exceedingly well positioned to generate growth and margin expansion for our shareholders over the long term. \n I'll now turn the call over to Karl. \nKarl Slatoff: Thanks, Strauss. I'd like to begin by thanking our teams for delivering another strong quarter that exceeded our expectations. I'll now discuss our recent and upcoming releases. \n On October 22, 2K launched WWE 2K20, the latest offering in our flagship WWE franchise for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC. Developed by Visual Concepts, WWE 2K20 features several new gameplay modes that celebrate the WWE's thriving women's division, as well as an array of fan-favorite superstars, legends and match types. Earlier this year, 2K announced the philanthropic partnership with Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, in conjunction with WWE Superstar Roman Reigns, who is a leukemia survivor that helps raise awareness and $500,000 for this important cause. \n While we are disappointed with the reviews and consumer feedback for WWE 2K20, last week, Visual Concepts released a patch that should address many of the concerns, and they will continue to make further enhancements to the gameplay experience. The WWE brand continues to expand worldwide, and we believe there remains a substantial long-term opportunity to grow our WWE 2K series by improving the quality of the game. \n On October 25, Private Division launched The Outer World for Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and PC. Developed by Obsidian Entertainment, The Outer Worlds marks the reunion of Tim Cain and Leonard Boyarsky, the original creators of Fallout, who have introduced an entirely new single player, sci-fi, RPG experience. A critical and commercial success, The Outer Worlds is exceeding our expectations and reviews have been outstanding, with GameStop giving the game 9 out of 10; Game Informer, 9.25 out of 10; and EGM, a perfect 5 out of 5. In early 2020, The Outer Worlds will be released for Nintendo Switch. \n As noted by Strauss, on November 5, Rockstar Games launched Red Dead Redemption 2 for PC, which is the first title in the Red Dead series to be offered on PC. The release of the game also marked the debut of Rockstar Games Launcher, a new Windows desktop application that enables consumers to quickly and easily access their Rockstar Games PC collection in a single place across both digital and disk-based titles, including purchases from other visual stores, managed cloud saves and more. \n Players will also be able to use the Launcher to shop for new Rockstar Games PC titles. The introduction of the Rockstar Games Launcher underscores our commitment to investing to deliver great entertainment experiences in new ways for audiences. \n Later this month, Borderlands 3, NBA 2K20 and Red Dead Redemption 2 will be available as part of Google Stadia's initial offering as a full-priced games. Streaming represents an exciting opportunity and has the potential to become a compelling distribution channel of our industry that could expand our market and increase our margins. \n On November 22, Sid Meier's Civilization VI will come to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, marking the first time since 2008 that a Civilization game has been available for PlayStation or Xbox consoles. In addition, 2K for-access games will launch the separate Civilization VI expansion model, which includes all content from the Rise and Fall and Gathering Storm expansion packs. Civilization VI is the fastest selling title in the history of the series, with sell-in to date of nearly 6 million units worldwide. \n Rounding out our holiday lineup will be Private Division's December 6 release of Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey, for digital download on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. \n Throughout fiscal 2020, we will continue to support our titles with innovative post-launch content designed to drive engagement and player growth, including many more updates from Rockstar Games for both Red Dead Online and Grand Theft Auto Online. On October 24, 2K and Gearbox Software launched the Bloody Harvest, free seasonal event for Borderlands 3, the first offering in the robust post-launch content plans for the title. We will continue to support Borderlands 3 with free seasonal content updates and raid-like events called takedowns. In addition, 2K and Gearbox plan to release 4 major downloadable campaign expansions, available collectively with the purchase of a season pass or individually upon release. \n The first of these DLC patch is scheduled to launch this winter. In December, Private Division will launch the Kerbal Space Program: Breaking Ground expansion to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, which was previously released for PC in May. And throughout the year, 2K will continue to release additional content for WWE 2K20 and other titles. \n We also continue to broaden our slate for mobile devices, including the November 13 launch of season 6 of our popular WWE SuperCard series. \n Looking ahead to fiscal year 2021, Private Division announced that Disintegration, a new sci-fi, first-person shooter will launch in calendar 2020. In Disintegration, players command their troops as they battle through a thrilling single-player campaign and compete in frenetic multiplayer against other pilots and their crews. Disintegration is being developed by V1 Interactive, a new independent studio cofounded by Marcus Lehto, former creative director at Bungie, and co-creator of Halo. \n Also from Private Division, Kerbal Space Program 2, the sequel to the beloved original space sim, is now planned for the launch on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in fiscal 2021, in order to allow more time to make the experience as terrific as possible. The original Kerbal Space Program has sold in over 3.5 million units and earned Metacritic rating of 88 and a Steam user score of 91%. Private Division will have more exciting news and announcements in the coming months. \n Turning to eSports. Qualifying rounds for season 3 of the NBA 2K league, our joint venture with the NBA, will conclude this week followed by the combine that will end in December, and the official player draft and start of the season in the spring. The NBA 2K League announced that Gen.G, the global eSports organization, will launch a new franchise from Shanghai that will join the League for the upcoming season, marking the first team from outside of North America. \n The team will join the previously announced Charlotte Hornets Venom GT as the 2 new teams for season 3, bringing the League total to 23 franchises. We are very excited about the continued progress and growth of the League, which has a long-term potential to enhance engagement and to be a driver of profits for our company. \n In closing, we remain focused on delivering the highest-quality entertainment and providing new and innovative ways for our consumers to stay immersed and engaged with their favorite experiences. We are investing heavily in opportunities to grow our scale, increase our presence in mobile and capitalize on emerging distribution channels and business models. The successful execution of this strategy will provide value to our customers and generate strong returns for our shareholders. \n I'll now turn the call over to Lainie. \nLainie Goldstein: Thanks Karl, good afternoon, everyone. Today we'll discuss our second quarter results and then review our financial outlook for the third quarter and fiscal year 2020. Please note that additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release. \n As Strauss mentioned, our positive momentum continued in the second quarter, enabling us to generate operating results that significantly exceeded our expectations. Total net bookings grew 63% to $951 million as compared to our outlook of $860 million to $910 million. This outperformance is driven primarily by better-than-expected results from Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online and Borderlands 3. Recurrent consumer spending grew 39% and accounted for 45% of total net bookings as compared to our outlook of over 20% growth. Recurrent consumer spending exceeded our expectations due primarily to the outperformance of Grand Theft Auto Online. \n Digitally delivered net bookings grew 63% and accounted for 73% of the total as compared to our outlook of over 40% growth. This result exceeded our expectations due to the outperformance of recurrent consumer spending and the higher than forecasted mix of digital sales of Borderlands 3 and Grand Theft Auto V. During the second quarter, 51% of current generation console games were delivered digitally, up from 47% last year. \n Turning to some details from our second quarter income statement. GAAP net revenue grew to $858 million and cost of goods sold increased to $468 million. Operating expenses increased by 36% to $315 million, due primarily to higher marketing, personnel and R&D costs. And GAAP net income was $72 million or $0.63 per share as compared to $25 million or $0.22 per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow for the 6 months ended September 30, 2019, increased to $41 million, and we ended the period with $1.5 billion in cash and short-term investments. \n Now I will review the highlights of our fiscal 2020 financial outlook starting with the third quarter. We project net bookings to range from $860 million to $910 million. The largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K20, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, The Outer Worlds, Borderlands 3 and the WWE 2K series. We project recurrent consumer spending to grow by approximately 5%. This growth is affected by the difficult comparisons due to the allocation from the Red Dead Redemption 2 premium edition last year. \n Growth is expected to be driven by Grand Theft Auto Online, Red Dead Online, excluding last year's allocation, and NBA 2K. We are currently projecting single-digit growth in recurrent consumer spending from NBA 2K due the strength of the title in the third quarter last year. We expect digitally delivered net bookings to increase by about 5%. Our forecast assumes that 50% of our current generation console games will be delivered digitally, up from 31% in the same period last year. \n We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $915 million to $965 million, and cost of goods sold to range from $425 million to $452 million. Operating expenses are expected to range from $312 million to $322 million. At the midpoint, this represents a 6% increase over last year driven primarily by higher R&D, the personnel costs, partially offset by lower marketing expense. And GAAP net income is expected to range from $159 million to $170 million or $1.39 to $1.49 per share. For management reporting purposes, we expect our tax rate to be 17% throughout fiscal 2020. \n Turning to our outlook for the full fiscal year. We are raising our operating outlook as a result of our better-than-expected second quarter operating results and improved net bookings outlook for the balance of the year. We now expect net bookings to range from $2.75 billion to $2.85 billion, up from our prior outlook of $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion. \n The increase beyond the second quarter beat is driven primarily by improved expectations for Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V and Borderlands 3, partially offset by the move of Kerbal Space Program 2 into fiscal 2021. The largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Borderlands 3, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, The Outer Worlds, Sid Meier's Civilization VI and the WWE 2K series. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 60%, 2K; 30%, Rockstar Games; and 10%, Private Division, Social Point and other. And we forecast our geographic net bookings split to be about 60%, United States; and 40%, international. \n We now expect recurrent consumer spending to increase by 25%, up from our prior outlook of the mid-teens growth, driven primarily by higher expectations for Grand Theft Auto Online. We now expect Grand Theft Auto Online to grow in fiscal 2020 as a result of its better-than-expected performance, fiscal year-to-date and improved outlook for the balance of the year. \n We project digitally delivered net bookings to grow by nearly 30%. This is up from our prior outlook of high-teens growth due primarily to our increased forecast for recurrent consumer spending and a higher mix of digital sales of Borderlands 3 and Grand Theft Auto V. Our outlook assumes that 57% of current generation console games will be delivered digitally, up from 38% last year. \n We expect to generate more than $450 million in adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow, and we now plan to deploy approximately $75 million for capital expenditures. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $2.93 billion to $3.03 billion, and cost of goods sold to range from $1.39 billion to $1.43 billion. Total operating expenses are expected to range from $1.12 billion to $1.14 billion. At the midpoint, this represents a 20% increase over the prior year, driven primarily by higher marketing, R&D and personnel costs. \n And we expect GAAP net income to range from $388 million to $416 million or $3.38 to $3.63 per share. We have not flowed through the entire   second quarter management reporting EPS beat to our implied management reporting EPS outlook for fiscal 2020, due to marketing expenses that shifted from the second quarter, and to balance of the year, a higher forecast for marketing, IP and R&D expense and the move of Kerbal Space Program 2 into fiscal 2021. \n In closing, our strong performance during the second quarter has enabled us to increase further our operating outlook for fiscal 2020, which is poised to be another great year for Take-Two. Our positive momentum continues and with our industry-leading creative assets, coupled with our management focus on operational excellence and sound financial foundation, our company is in the perfect position to deliver strong results for shareholders over the long term. \n Thank you. I will now turn the call back to Strauss. \nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for their dedication, their hard work, their commitment to excellence. And to our shareholders, I'd like to express our appreciation for your continued support. \n We'll now take your questions. Operator? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first comes from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners. \nEric Handler: Two quick things. First, with Outer Worlds, I believe you said it was selling ahead of expectations, wonder if you might be able to put some actual numbers to that, if you don't mind? And then secondly, with Red Dead Online, wondered -- obviously, you don't talk about revenue for that game, but wondered if you might be able to at least talk about the some of the trajectory, how it compares to RCS for other games? Or how you have found that game to be tracking? \nStrauss Zelnick: Eric, it's Strauss. On Outer Worlds, we're not releasing any specific numbers yet. It's outperforming our expectations handily. It got amazing reviews, we're super excited about it. But it's very, very early. So as we learn more, we'll disclose more. \n And on Red Dead Online, we did say that we're up sequentially in the quarter. We have a lot of momentum. The new content is definitely performing. People really like it, they're engaged with it. We feel great about it, and that's pretty much where we're at, at the moment. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Giaimo with Jefferies. \nDavid Lustberg: This is David on for Alex. Hoping to get a little bit of color on Social Point. Last quarter, you said you had 10 number of games in development. Is that still the number we should be thinking about or that changed at all? \nStrauss Zelnick: Yes. Thanks for your question. I think a couple of notes about Social Point. First of all, there are 5 live games that are doing well in the market. So Dragon City and Monster Legends but also World Chef, Tasty Town and Word Life. So that's super exciting. And at any given time, we have 8 to 10 new titles in development at Social Point. So yes, that's roughly correct. We're really excited about what is coming to us in the future. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Since there are no further questions left in the queue, I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing remarks. \nStrauss Zelnick: Obviously, we've had a great quarter. We raised our outlook for the year. We're really excited about how the company is doing. This company is all about creativity, innovation and efficiency. Our goal is to make the highest-quality entertainment in the business and, in fact, in the entertainment business. More often than not, our creative teams succeed at that, and we couldn't be more grateful to them than we are. So thank you so much for joining us today. We're looking forward to the rest of our fiscal year and then beyond that as well. \nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

I'll now discuss our recent and upcoming releases. \n On October 22, 2K launched WWE 2K20, the latest offering in our flagship WWE franchise for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC. Developed by Visual Concepts, WWE 2K20 features several new gameplay modes that celebrate the WWE's thriving women's division, as well as an array of fan-favorite superstars, legends and match types.

            "name": "Strauss Zelnick",
            "content": "Thanks, Hank. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that Take-Two's positive momentum continued in the second quarter, enabling our company to generate operating results that significantly exceeded our expectations. We delivered a strong net bookings, cash flow and earnings growth, fueled by the performance of NBA 2K, Borderlands 3, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, and Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online. \n Once again, our strategy of creating the highest-quality entertainment in the industry translated into outstanding results. On September 13, 2K and Gearbox Software launched Borderlands 3, the latest installment in our genre-defining shooter-looter series. The title has exceeded our expectations and sold more than 5 million units within its first 5 days of launch, making it the fastest selling title in 2K's history and the highest selling title for the label on PC. Within its first 5 days in market, retail sell-through Borderlands 3 was up more than 50% compared to its predecessor, and 70% of units were purchased digitally, setting a new record for a 2K cross-platform title. \n Borderlands 3 received resoundingly positive critical acclaim with Forbes, IGN, Shacknews, Destructoid, and Meristation, all scoring the title 9 out of 10. Today, Borderlands 3 has sold-in nearly 7 million units worldwide. I'd like to congratulate the teams at Gearbox and 2K on a stellar launch in taking this beloved series to new heights. Karl will share details about our post-launch content plan that will keep players engaged in the world of Borderlands 3. \n Our industry-leading basketball series continued to grow during the second quarter. With net bookings up approximately 9% despite a difficult comparison, driven by the successful September 6 launch of NBA 2K20. According to The NPD Group, NBA 2K20 is the best-selling game of 2019 to date, delivered the highest launch month sales for any sports game in history. And the NBA 2K series is now the sixth largest video game franchise in the industry based on dollar sales. \n Driven demand NBA 2K20 remained strong and the title has sold in nearly 6 million units to date, generating growth over the prior year's release. During the second quarter, recurrent consumer spending in NBA 2K grew 32% to a new record, and remained the single largest contributor to that category of our business. Engagement with the NBA 2K20 also increased driven by a consistent new content schedule with daily active users up almost 20% compared to NBA 2K19. And MyCAREER or MyTeam growing by more than 30% and 150% respectively. \n We expect lifetime net bookings for NBA 2K20 to set a new record for the series. In addition, 2K recently announced the NBA 2K20 x Nike Gamer Exclusive Program, an innovative first-of-its-kind gaming and sneaker partnership. This program provides players with the opportunity to unlock virtual Nike gamer exclusive sneakers for their MyPLAYER to wear in-game and to purchase real-life versions of the same shoes from Nike. I'd like to congratulate 2K and Visual Concepts for, once again, redefining what is possible in sports gaming and catching superbly every nuance of the NBA and the pop culture that envelops it. \n Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, once again, exceeded our expectations, delivering the best quarter yet with respect to daily, weekly and monthly active users and our best summer ever in terms of new online users and new users overall. Recurrent consumer spending on Grand Theft Auto Online grew 23% to a new record, driven by the July release of The Diamond Casino & Resort update. This update was Grand Theft Auto Online's biggest content launch ever, delivering record player engagement across daily, weekly and monthly active users in July and then again in August. \n As a result of the title's better-than-expected performance fiscal year-to-date and improved outlook for the balance of the year, we now expect Grand Theft Auto Online to grow in fiscal 2020. Grand Theft Auto V remains the standard bearer for excellence in our industry and one of the most revered and successful entertainment experiences of all time. The title continues to expand its audience around the world and has now sold in more than 115 million units. \n Grand Theft Auto Online continues to gain momentum and grew sequentially during the second quarter. Following the massive content drop in May when the title exited its beta phase, on September 10, the world of Red Dead Online evolved further with the release of the Frontier Pursuits update. This update introduced 3 specialist roles, including tracking down wanted criminals as a Bounty Hunter, searching the world for treasure and other exotic items to sell as a Collector, and building a business as a Trader. Rockstar Games intends to add more new roles in the future, enabling players fully to inhabit their characters as they carve out a life on the Frontier. \n Rockstar Games also introduced the popular Outlaw Pass, a way for Red Dead Online players to pay to access a wide array of ongoing upgrades, items and perks at a discounted value. Throughout the year, Rockstar Games will continue to support both Red Dead Online and Grand Theft Auto Online, with many more updates in order to drive engagement and player growth. We remain as excited as ever about the long-term opportunity for Red Dead Online to be a meaningful driver of recurrent consumer spending. In addition, Red Dead Redemption 2 continues to grow its audience, and to date, has sold an almost 26.5 million units worldwide. Earlier this week, the title launched on PC with an array of features designed specifically for that audience, including numerous graphical enhancements, a fully featured photo mode, new content additions for the game's story mode, and more. \n On August 27, Private Division launched Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey for digital download on PC. The title is the first release from Panache Digital Games, the studio cofounded by Patrice De\u0301silets, the original creative director of the Assassin's Creed franchise. Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey was lauded by the media for its sophistication and unique approach to the survival category and will be available for digital download on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on December 6. \n Our second quarter results were also enhanced by Social Point's mobile games, the WWE 2K franchise and Sid Meier's Civilization VI. One of our key strategic priorities is to find new and innovative ways to drive growth and engagement with our titles after their initial purchase. From free-to-play open worlds to additional chapters and content, we aim to provide consumers with the highest-quality offerings that meaningfully add to their overall gameplay experience. \n To that end, during the second quarter, the recurrent consumer spending significantly exceeded our expectations, growing 39% and accounting for 45% of our total net bookings. In addition to virtual currency for NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Red Dead Online, recurrent consumer spending was enhanced by a variety of other offerings, including sales of the Borderlands 3 premium additions, which include additional content that is allocated to recurrent consumer spending. In the free-to-play category, Social Point remains a meaningful contributor to our results through its mobile titles, Dragon City and Monster Legends, World Chef and Tasty Town and Word Life. During the quarter, Social Point added new content, challenges and updates to these games. \n Our Barcelona-based studio continues to invest in its broad pipeline of new games planned for launch in the coming years. WWE SuperCard has now been downloaded nearly 20 million times and remains 2K's highest grossing mobile title. And recurrent consumer spending on NBA 2K online in China outperformed our expectations, growing 27% in the second quarter. The title remains the #1 PC online sports game in China with more than 47 million registered users. \n Lastly, add-on content grew more than 60%, led by offering for Sid Meier's Civilization VI and the Borderlands franchise. As a result of our better-than-expected second quarter operating results, we're once again raising our operating outlook for fiscal 2020. Looking ahead, we have the strongest development pipeline in our history. We're continuing to grow our portfolio with the highest-quality entertainment experiences, including sequels from our biggest franchises as well as exciting new IP. \n In addition, we're actively investing in emerging markets, platforms and business models such as mobile, streaming, direct-to-consumer and subscription in order to expand our audience around the world. With the promise of new consoles and continuous technological advances, our creative teams have an increasingly robust canvas on which to achieve their vision and set new benchmarks for excellence. Take-Two's exceedingly well positioned to generate growth and margin expansion for our shareholders over the long term. \n I'll now turn the call over to Karl. Thanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for their dedication, their hard work, their commitment to excellence. And to our shareholders, I'd like to express our appreciation for your continued support. \n We'll now take your questions. Operator? Eric, it's Strauss. On Outer Worlds, we're not releasing any specific numbers yet. It's outperforming our expectations handily. It got amazing reviews, we're super excited about it. But it's very, very early. So as we learn more, we'll disclose more. \n And on Red Dead Online, we did say that we're up sequentially in the quarter. We have a lot of momentum. The new content is definitely performing. People really like it, they're engaged with it. We feel great about it, and that's pretty much where we're at, at the moment. Yes. Thanks for your question. I think a couple of notes about Social Point. First of all, there are 5 live games that are doing well in the market. So Dragon City and Monster Legends but also World Chef, Tasty Town and Word Life. So that's super exciting. And at any given time, we have 8 to 10 new titles in development at Social Point. So yes, that's roughly correct. We're really excited about what is coming to us in the future. Obviously, we've had a great quarter. We raised our outlook for the year. We're really excited about how the company is doing. This company is all about creativity, innovation and efficiency. Our goal is to make the highest-quality entertainment in the business and, in fact, in the entertainment business. More often than not, our creative teams succeed at that, and we couldn't be more grateful to them than we are. So thank you so much for joining us today. We're looking forward to the rest of our fiscal year and then beyond that as well."

[Operator Instructions]\n As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\n I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Hank Diamond, SVP of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. \nHenry Diamond: Good afternoon. Welcome, and thank you for joining Take-Two's conference call to discuss its results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 ended June 30, 2019.\n Today's call will be led by Strauss Zelnick, Take-Two's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Karl Slatoff, our President; and Lainie Goldstein, our Chief Financial Officer. We will be available to answer your questions during the Q&A session following our prepared remarks.\n Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that statements made during this call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs of our management as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to us. We have no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Actual operating results may vary significantly from these forward-looking statements based on a variety of factors.

Our press release and filings with the SEC may be obtained from our website at www.take2games.com.\n And now I'll turn the call over to Strauss. \nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks, Hank. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that fiscal 2020 is off to a terrific start with first quarter operating results that exceeded our expectations. We delivered significant net bookings and cash flow growth driven by the performance of Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, NBA 2K19, the Borderlands franchise and Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online.\n As we approach the sixth anniversary of their initial launch, sales of Grand Theft Auto V and recurrent consumer spending on Grand Theft Auto Online once again exceeded our expectations in the first quarter. Net bookings from Grand Theft Auto Online grew year-over-year driven by the increased installed base of Grand Theft Auto V units as well as numerous reward bonus programs tied to game mode events and promotions. Grand Theft Auto V also continued its unprecedented level of success, charting in the top 10 games in 5 out of the past 6 months in the U.S. based on combined physical and digital sales according to The NPD Group. The title has now sold in more than 110 million units and remains one of the most revered and successful entertainment experiences across all art forms of all time.\n Our industry-leading basketball series continues to set new benchmarks for excellence. NBA 2K19 is now our highest-selling sports game ever with sell-in to date of nearly 12 million units. During the first quarter, net bookings from NBA 2K19 more than doubled driven by strong recurrent consumer spending and increased unit sales. Recurrent consumer spending on NBA 2K grew more than 140% and was the single-largest contributor to that part of our business. Moreover, engagement with NBA 2K19 continues to increase with average games played and daily active users growing 12% and 23%, respectively. This was driven by a variety of factors, including an enhanced mix of game modes that appeals to a broader audience and play styles, the strong performance of recent sales promotions, new player virtual currency bundles and engaging late-cycle MyTeam content. We expect the lifetime net bookings from NBA 2K19 will be the highest ever for a 2K sports title, including both record unit sales and recurrent consumer spending.\n Leading up to the eagerly anticipated September launch of Borderlands 3, which Karl will discuss shortly, we've seen a significant increase in sales of our Borderlands catalog offerings. During the quarter, 2K and Gearbox Software released the Borderlands: Game of the Year Edition for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC, which features all-new Ultra HD visuals, numerous gameplay improvements and all previously released add-on packs. In addition, we launched the Ultra HD Texture Pack that increases the visual fidelity of Borderlands: The Handsome Collection on consoles and provides a graphical upgrade for Borderlands 2, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel and all of the add-ons for both titles on PC.\n Turning to Rockstar Games' latest creative and commercial masterpiece. Red Dead Redemption 2 continues to expand its audience and to date has sold-in approximately 25 million units worldwide. On May 14, Red Dead Online exited its beta phase with a massive update that brought a host of new gameplay modes, including new cooperative story missions, free roam activities and the introduction of poker, along with a range of updates and improvements that strengthen and stabilize the foundational world of the Red Dead Online experience. In addition, throughout the quarter, Rockstar Games released additional content such as numerous new weapons, clothing, emotes and more. Both engagement and recurrent consumer spending on the game continue to gain momentum and Rockstar plans to continue to enhance and evolve the world of Red Dead Online with ongoing updates to drive growth over time.\n On July 1, Rockstar Games and Twitch announced an exciting new program through which Rockstar Games Social Club members and Twitch Prime subscribers receive free in-game rewards, bonuses and exclusive discounts in both Grand Theft Auto Online and Red Dead Online simply by linking their Twitch Prime and Social Club accounts. Benefits continue for months to come and include special in-game benefits for both Red Dead Online and Grand Theft Auto Online. Rockstar Games plans to support both Red Dead Online and Grand Theft Auto Online with much more content moving forward, and we now expect combined results from these titles to grow in fiscal 2020.\n Our first quarter results were also enhanced by Social Point's mobile games, WWE SuperCard and WWE 2K19 as well as Sid Meier's Civilization VI. One of our key strategic priorities is to continue to drive growth and engagement with our titles after their initial purchase. Our ability to achieve this goal consistently results from our firm commitment to providing consumers with opportunities that are compelling, of the highest quality and that meaningfully add to their overall gameplay experience. To that end, during the first quarter, recurrent consumer spending exceeded our expectations, growing 55% and accounting for 67% of our total net bookings.\n In addition to virtual currency for NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Red Dead Online, recurrent consumer spending was enhanced by a variety of other offerings. In the free-to-play category, Social Point remains a meaningful contributor to our results through its 2 biggest mobile titles, Dragon City and Monster Legends as well as World Chef and Tasty Town. In May, our Barcelona-based studio successfully launched Word Life, a new crossword game and continues to invest in its broad and innovative pipeline of new games planned for launch in the coming years.\n Recurrent consumer spending on WWE SuperCard exceeded our expectations and the title has now been downloaded nearly 19.5 million times and remains 2K's highest-grossing mobile title.\n And recurrent consumer spending on NBA 2K Online in China also outperformed, growing 75%, driven by the launch of NBA 2K Online 2 in August last year. Total combined registered users for NBA 2K Online 2 and its predecessor currently stand at 46 million, and the franchise remains the #1 PC online sports game in China. Asia and China in particular continues to be a significant, long-term growth opportunity for our business.\n Lastly, add-on content grew nearly 135%, led by offerings for the Borderlands franchise and Sid Meier's Civilization VI.\n As a result of our better-than-expected first quarter operating results and increased forecast for the balance of the year, we're raising our outlook for fiscal 2020, which is anticipated to be another great year for our organization. Looking ahead, we have the strongest development pipeline in our history, including sequels from our biggest franchises as well as exciting new IP.\n Take-Two remains exceedingly well positioned creatively, strategically and financially to capitalize on our industry's many opportunities and to deliver growth and returns for our shareholders over the long term. With the promise of new consoles, along with emerging platforms, distribution channels, business models and markets, we have tremendous potential to engage and expand further our global audience through our development team's passion and vision for creative excellence.\n I'll now turn the call over to Karl. \nKarl Slatoff: Thanks, Strauss. I'd like to begin by thanking our teams for delivering a strong start to the fiscal year.\n Turning now to our recent and upcoming releases. On July 23, Rockstar Games held the grand opening of The Diamond Casino & Resort for Grand Theft Auto Online. The Diamond is the one-stop destination for quality entertainment, high-end living and a range of experiences that you won't find anywhere else. Players can engage in classic casino activities such as 3-card poker, blackjack, roulette and a variety of slot machines or watch virtual horse racing at the inside track lounge. Guests looking for high-end fashion can choose from a variety of new clothing accessories in the casino store. Diamond also offers the most luxurious penthouse residences in all of Los Santos and owners have the ability to customize their penthouse and enjoy VIP memberships at the resort, including exclusive lounges, high-limit tables, aircraft and limousine services and more. This highly engaging update also features a series of new story-based cooperative missions, open more activities and additional opportunities to earn special rewards. The Diamond Casino & Resort update was Grand Theft Auto Online's biggest launch ever, delivering record player engagement and daily active users, weekly active users and monthly active users.\n Now that Red Dead Online has exited the beta phase, Rockstar Games will continue to add more free content to the game. Following the massive content drop in May, later this summer, the world will evolve again with the introduction of specialist roles, including tracking down wanted criminals as a bounty hunter, searching the world for treasure and other exotic items to sell as a collector or building a business as a trader. Throughout the year, Rockstar Games will continue to support both Red Dead Online and Grand Theft Auto Online with many more updates in order to drive engagement and player growth.\n On July 23, 2K released the Rise and Fall expansion pack for Sid Meier's Civilization VI on iOS through Aspyr. 2K also announced that they will bring all of the previously released add-on content for Sid Meier's Civilization VI to both iOS and Nintendo Switch later this year. Civilization VI is the fastest-selling title in the history of the series with sell-in to date of more than 5.5 million units worldwide.\n On August 27, Private Division will release Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey for digital download on PC. The title is the first release from Panache Digital Games, the studio cofounded by Patrice D\u00e9silets, the original Creative Director of the Assassin's Creed franchise. In the Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey, players are challenged to survive and evolve in the harsh yet beautiful land of Africa, spanning from 10 million to 2 million years ago. Ancestors will also be available for digital download on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in December.\n On September 6, 2K and Visual Concepts will launch NBA 2K20, the next annual offering from our industry-leading basketball simulation for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and PC. The title will also be available for Google Stadia when the platform launches in November 2019. The NBA 2K20 Standard and digital Deluxe Editions will feature 6-time NBA All-Star, 3-time All-NBA First Team, 3-time NBA All-Defensive Team and 2012 Olympic gold medalist, Anthony Davis, on the cover. The NBA 2K20 Legend Edition will feature 3-time NBA Champion, 13-time NBA All-Star, 2008 Olympic gold medalist and 2006 NBA Finals MVP Dwyane Wade on the cover. NBA 2K20 will feature the most expansive soundtrack in the history of the series with 50 tracks from artists such as Drake, Meek Mill, Billie Eilish, Post Malone and the late Nipsey Hussle. Additional songs will be dynamically added throughout the year across genres, spanning hip-hop, R&B, electronic pop and rock.\n On September 13, 2K and Gearbox Software will launch Borderlands 3 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC. The title will also be available for Google Stadia when the platform launches in November 2019. The Borderlands franchise, which combines the exhilarating action of a first-person shooter with the rich progression and loot systems of a role-playing game, has sold-in more than 48 million units worldwide to date. In June, at E3, more than 8,000 consumers were able to experience Borderlands 3 and their reaction was phenomenal. Throughout the show, there was enormous excitement around our massive, high-energy booth which featured larger-than-life statues and photo ops, 100 gameplay stations and 100-seat demo theater. The global media in attendance lauded Borderlands 3 with more than 50 E3 award wins and nominations, including best in show nods from IGN, GameSpot, Destructoid, Ars Technica, the E3 game critics and more.\n In addition, during the month of June, 2K worked with our first-party partners to offer an array of low to no-cost engagement opportunities, including the release of a new DLC campaign for Borderlands 2 entitled Commander Lilith & the Fight for Sanctuary, which provide the narrative lead-in to the events of Borderlands 3. In addition, Borderlands: The Handsome Collection was added to Xbox Game Pass and was included in the PlayStation Instant Game Collection for the month. On PC, our entire Borderlands back catalog was made available at a deep discount for our retail partners. These efforts, together with the launch of the Borderlands: Game of the Year Edition in April, has resulted in sell-in of over 6 million units of Borderland titles and over 4 million players enjoying the critically acclaimed Commander Lilith DLC.\n Later this month, Borderlands 3 will be at gamescom in Germany and PAX West in Seattle where we will share details on an expansive post-launch content plan that will keep players engaged with new experiences well past September 13. The consumer excitement leading up to next month's launch of Borderlands 3 is incredibly strong and we very much look forward to the next chapter in the highly successful Borderlands franchise.\n On October 22, 2K's popular WWE series will be back when WWE 2K20 launches for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC. Developed by Visual Concepts, WWE 2K20 includes several franchise firsts, alongside streamlined gameplay and a variety of popular modes. Current Raw Women's Champion Becky Lynch and WWE Superstar Roman Reigns will serve as the game's cover Superstars and ambassadors for its worldwide marketing campaign Step Inside, which invites players to enter the world of WWE Superstars and face a variety of new and exciting challenges in the virtual ring.\n On October 25, Private Division will release The Outer Worlds. Developed by Obsidian Entertainment, The Outer Worlds marks the reunion of Tim Cain and Leonard Boyarsky, the original creators of Fallout, who are introducing an entirely new single-player sci-fi RPG experience. Launching on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC, The Outer Worlds is a dark and witty player-driven story set in the colony at the farthest reaches of the galaxy. In addition, the title will be coming to Nintendo Switch following the launch on the other platforms. At E3 in June, The Outer Worlds received 4 nominations from the Game Critics Award for Best of E3, more than any other game and won the award for Best Original Game.\n Throughout fiscal year 2020, we will continue to support our titles with innovative, post-launch content designed to drive engagement. In addition, Social Point and 2K will continue to broaden our offerings for mobile devices.\n Looking ahead to fiscal year 2021, Private Division announced Disintegration, a new sci-fi first-person shooter from V1 Interactive, the studio cofounded by Marcus Lehto, former Creative Director at Bungie and co-creator of Halo. The title will be fully unveiled later this month at gamescom. Private Division will have more exciting news and announcements in the coming months.\n Turning to eSports. The second season of the NBA 2K League, our joint venture with the NBA, concluded this past weekend. Just prior to playoffs, the League announced that Tencent would be their first distribution partner in China and stream condensed playoffs and finals games to their hundreds of millions of daily users across Tencent Sports, Tencent Video and Tencent News. NBA 2K League content has generated more than 243 million video views across all NBA and NBA 2K League social media platforms.\n In addition, NBA 2K League viewership both live and on-demand continues to rise with the second season seeing a 34% increase in views over Season 1. We are very excited about the continued progress and growth of the league which has a long-term potential to enhance engagement and to be a driver of profits for our company.\n Looking ahead, we will continue to focus on delivering the highest-quality entertainment and to provide new and innovative ways to enhance players' experiences with our games. To that end, we are investing heavily in opportunities to grow our scale, increase our presence in mobile and capitalize on emerging distribution channels and business models such as free-to-play, streaming and subscription.\n The successful execution of the strategy will continue to engage our customers and generate growth and profits for our company over the long term.\n I'll now turn the call over to Lainie. \nLainie Goldstein: Thanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we'll discuss our first quarter results and then review our financial outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year 2020. Please note that additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release.\n As Strauss mentioned, fiscal 2020 is off to a terrific start with first quarter operating results that exceeded our expectations. Total net bookings grew 46% to $422 million as compared to our outlook of $310 million to $360 million. This outperformance is driven primarily by better-than-expected results from Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, NBA 2K19 and the Borderlands franchise. Recurrent consumer spending grew 55% and accounted for 67% of total net bookings as compared to our outlook of over 20% growth. Recurrent consumer spending exceeded our expectations due primarily to the outperformance of Grand Theft Auto Online and NBA 2K.\n Digitally delivered net bookings grew 51% and accounted for 91% of the total as compared to our outlook of over 20% growth. This result exceeded expectations due to the outperformance of recurrent consumer spending and a higher-than-forecasted mix of digitally delivered full-game sales. During the first quarter, 75% of current generation console games were delivered digitally, up from 53% last year.\n Turning to some details from our first quarter income statement. GAAP net revenue grew to $540 million and cost of goods sold increased to $241 million. Operating expenses increased by 33% to $247 million due primarily to higher marketing and R&D cost. And GAAP net income was $46 million or $0.41 per share as compared to $72 million or $0.62 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Adjusted operating cash flow increased to nearly $47 million, and we ended the period with $1.54 billion in cash and short-term investments.\n Now I will review the highlights of our fiscal 2020 financial outlook. Starting with the second quarter. We project net bookings to range from $860 million to $910 million, up from $583 million in the second quarter last year. The increase is driven primarily by the release of Borderlands 3. The largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K20, Borderlands 3, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online and Social Point's mobile offerings. We project recurrent consumer spending to grow by over 20%. This growth is expected to be driven by NBA 2K, Borderlands 3 and Red Dead Online as well as modest growth from Grand Theft Auto Online. We expect digitally delivered net bookings to increase by more than 40%. Our forecast assumes that 48% of our current generation console games will be delivered digitally, up from 47% in the same period last year.\n We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $855 million to $905 million and cost of goods sold to range from $415 million to $442 million. Operating expenses are expected to range from $312 million to $322 million. At the midpoint, this represents a 37% increase over last year driven primarily by higher marketing and R&D costs. And GAAP net income is expected to range from $118 million to $130 million or $1.04 to $1.14 per share. For management reporting purposes, we expect our tax rate to be 17% throughout fiscal 2020.\n Turning to our outlook for the full fiscal year. We are raising our outlook as a result of better-than-expected first quarter operating results and increased forecast for the balance of the year. We now expect net bookings to range from $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion, up from our prior outlook of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion. Compared to the prior year, we expect NBA 2K and WWE 2K to grow, offset by lower results from Red Dead Redemption 2 and Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Borderlands 3, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, The Outer Worlds and WWE 2K. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 60% 2K, 30% Rockstar Games and 10% Private Division, Social Point and other. And we forecast our geographic net bookings split to be about 65% United States and 35% international.\n We now expect recurrent consumer spending to increase in the mid-teens, up from our prior outlook of low single-digit growth driven primarily by higher expectations for Grand Theft Auto online and NBA 2K. Importantly, we now expect combined results from Grand Theft Auto Online and Red Dead Online to grow in fiscal 2020. This growth excludes the value that was allocated to recurrent consumer spending from the Red Dead Redemption 2 Premium Edition. We now project digitally delivered net bookings to grow in the high teens. This is up from our prior outlook of low double-digit growth driven primarily by our increased forecast for recurrent consumer spending and a higher mix of digitally delivered full-game sales. Our outlook assumes that 55% of current generation console games will be delivered digitally, up from 38% last year.\n We expect to generate more than $450 million in adjusted operating cash flow and we plan to deploy approximately $90 million for capital expenditures. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $2.83 billion to $2.93 billion and cost of goods sold to range from $1.3 billion to $1.34 billion. Total operating expenses are expected to range from $1.07 billion to $1.09 billion. At the midpoint, this represents a 15% increase over the prior year driven primarily by higher marketing, R&D and personnel costs. And we expect GAAP net income to range from $425 million to $454 million or $3.71 to $3.96 per share.\n In closing, fiscal 2020 is off to a fantastic start and is poised to be another outstanding year for Take-Two driven by the talent of our creative teams and our management's unwavering commitment to operational excellence. We have a strong financial foundation that enables us to pursue a variety of opportunities to enhance our strategic positioning and increase our ability to deliver growth and margin expansion over the long term.\n Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Strauss. \nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of the entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for their hard work in delivering an excellent start to the year. To our shareholders, I'd like to express our appreciation for your continued support. And we'll now take your questions. Operator? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners. \nEric Handler: Two things. First, I wondered if you could talk about Red Dead Redemption Online and maybe you could give a few metrics about engagement or the ramp in revenue that you have seen since the game has come out of beta and gone live. And then secondly, wondered if you could give a little color about the Private Division. Obviously, you made a recent announcement for one game coming out in fiscal '21. But at this point, how many games have you signed up for Private Division and how big of an opportunity do you see that to be over the next 12 months? \nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks, Eric. This is Strauss. So on Red Dead Online, we exited the beta phase on May 14 with a huge update and created a lot of opportunity to enjoy the online world. We also introduced poker at that time. In addition, throughout the first quarter, Rockstar released additional content, including new weapons, clothing, emotes and others which I mentioned earlier. We're not giving out any statistics. However, we're really thrilled with the sales of Red Dead Redemption 2 at over 25 million units and we're excited about the continuing momentum with Red Dead Online. We've also said that we expect that Rockstar Online, which is both Red Dead Online and Grand Theft Auto Online, should be setting a new record this year. So couldn't be more excited. And Karl will talk about Private Division. \nKarl Slatoff: So for Private Division, we've announced 3 titles to date. Private Division has been in existence for quite some time, and we tend to only announce things when we are ready to announce things about games themselves. We have a lot of other activity that we haven't talked about with Private Division, but those are the 3 games that we've announced. Ancestors with Patrice D\u00e9silets at Panache Games. We have The Outer Worlds with Obsidian. And we just announced recently Disintegration with V1, which is Marcus Lehto's studio. So that's all we have to say at the moment, but you should expect more in the future. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Thornton with SunTrust. \nMatthew Thornton: Congrats on the strong results. Maybe first on Borderlands. Can you help us maybe as we think about recurrent revenue on Borderlands 3, how can we think about or maybe compare and contrast Borderlands versus Red Dead this year? Obviously, last year, you talked about Red Dead having about a 17% attach rate of premium SKUs. Obviously, the beta took a couple of quarters, although there wasn't a lot of MTX per se. I sounds like Borderlands 3 will get a deal. But just any comparing and contrasting on the recurrent revenue for the Q front line release there would be really helpful. And then just I'll throw it out there, any high-level commentary you'd be willing to offer on the out-years plays would be great as well. \nKarl Slatoff: It's Karl. In terms of Borderlands 3, we haven't discussed too much about our plan for recurrent consumer spending, but as with most our games if not all our games, we have a robust plan around delivering post-launch and game content to engage with consumers. And it will be a bit different than Red Dead Online. For the most part, we've talked about DLC content, so story-driven, mission-based content. There'll be some cosmetics with Borderlands 3, but it is a different kind of experience. As we said before, 2K is going to be announcing more about that in the not-too-distant future. So you'll get a little bit more clarity on exactly what we have to offer. But if history -- and we don't really talk about engagement and attach, but I think most of the people on the call know that Borderlands has a very strong history of delivering a lot of downloadable content and having great success with that. So obviously we're very excited about that plan. \nLainie Goldstein: The R&D expense be. \nKarl Slatoff: Yes. In terms of our out-years release schedule, we basically disclosed everything that -- we've already disclosed everything we've been talking about now. So there's nothing more to say about that other than the fact that we do have -- and you can see it in our numbers, we have talked about our R&D expenses going up, particularly this year, which will be indicative of investment in new titles. So that is, in fact, what's going on, and we've got a very robust -- and maybe our most robust pipeline of all time for new IP. A lot of that's driven by Private Division, but there's new IP throughout the entire company as well. So again, you'll be hearing more about that soon in the future. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ben Schachter with Macquarie Group. \nBenjamin Schachter: Congrats on the continued great execution. Few questions. One, you raised the year by more than the beat on the quarter. So what specifically are you seeing? And then perhaps related to that, Rockstar stated that the casino expansion was the biggest effort ever, and I think they were referring to overall players on Day 1 and during the week. Can you help translate that into how it impacts the monetization and then how that influences guidance for the year?\n And then separately, Strauss, heading into the launch of cloud services, the new consoles next year and obviously, the continued growth in mobile, how do you think platform fees may evolve? Should we expect the platform owners to operate similarly to what we've seen in the past or do you think things are going to change? \nLainie Goldstein: For the fiscal year guidance increase, it is driven primarily by the first quarter beat, but we've also updated our forecast for the remainder of the year. And the primary increases are GTA V, GTA Online and Borderlands 3. \nStrauss Zelnick: And in terms of the new casino update, this has been our biggest ever for Grand Theft Auto Online, which is saying a lot. And what we've seen already is record player engagement in daily, weekly and monthly active users with a lot of more content coming. So it's looking just fantastic. And of course, we're up year-over-year in the quarter, which is great. \n Turning to the platform fees. Look, with competition, I think you have to expect that we will do much better in terms of take rates. You're already seeing that some recently launched platforms have announced lower fees. And if you go from an oligopoly environment to a broadly competitive environment, I think that has to be your expectation. And I would just note that, that obviously, that benefits the company directly as those fees decline. And that's how we've been counting. That doesn't even count, of course, the volumes. So I think it's going to be sort of the food is both tasty and plentiful which is nice. \nBenjamin Schachter: Good. If I could sneak one more in. Just, Lainie, I think you mentioned CapEx was $90 million. Can you remind me where it was last year and what are you spending the bulk on this year? \nLainie Goldstein: Last year, it was $60 million for the year. This year, the increase is driven by some development kits as well as some build-outs with some new office throughout the organization. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel. \nAndrew Crum: So Strauss, understand you guys don't provide specific guidance on individual titles, but coming off a very strong performance for NBA 2K19, just conceptually, what are your thoughts around perennial titles and I guess sports included and how they perform late in the hardware cycle and whether or not they're more susceptible to weaker sales as consumers look ahead to purchasing new consoles?\n And I guess separately for Lainie, maybe I'll ask Ben's question a little bit differently here. You're guiding Rockstar Online to be up in fiscal '20. Does that include growth for GTA Online? \nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks, Drew, for your question. Yes, we've been blessed by the amazing work that Visual Concepts and 2K do on NBA 2K, and we're having a record-setting year again this year with NBA 2K19, which has sold-in over 12 million units and recurrent consumer spending was up 140% in the quarter. Just amazing with extraordinary growth in average games played and daily active users really across the board. And I attribute that to not only that we have the industry-leading sim game, but that you can inhabit this game and enjoy its -- sort of the lifestyle that it offers for -- in addition to playing the sim game itself.\n I think 6, 7 years ago, basketball was a 3-month experience. And now it's a 9-, 10-month experience, and we think it's going to grow to be a full 1-year experience. To address your question particularly, the last console cycle had no negative influence on us and frankly, not really much on the industry because the entire platform business is diversifying. And the PC format particularly since that's now all digital has transformed that business. That can be 40%, 50% of a release, of a console release now if you're out on all those platforms. And that'll continue to grow. So we expect that the new console generation will be a significant net positive, and there's nothing about an annualized sports title that would play out differently. \nLainie Goldstein: For Rockstar Online, for fiscal year '20 growth, yes, we expect the 2 games together to grow, but GTA Online for the full year will be down over last year. Q1 and Q2 are up over the prior year. So still really early in the year, so we'll see how the rest of the year plays out, but right now the 2 together are up. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. \nBrian Nowak: I have 2. Just to come back to Red Dead Online. Another incredible quarter out of GTA Online. I was wondering, could talk to us at all about any differences you notice in player engagement or player behavior in Red Dead Online that could change the way you think about the long-term monetization opportunity for a game like Red Dead as opposed to a game like GTA, which just continues to surprise to the upside.\n And the second one on mobile, Karl, I think last quarter, you talked about there were 10 games in development at Social Point. Just any update there on how you think about the timing of those releases and what's the impact from those in the full year guide for this year? \nStrauss Zelnick: Well, thanks. With a game like Red Dead where you can engage significantly with the characters in the games, we think there are wonderful opportunities for players to experience the Red Dead Online world on an ongoing basis, especially as new content is dropped. And we tend to focus on the experience first. We want to make something that consumers love and engage with and then monetization follows. But we do feel there are and will be plenty of opportunities to create recurrent consumer spending based on the format of the Red Dead Online world. \nKarl Slatoff: In terms of Social Point, as you know, our 2 main titles continue to perform very, very well. And we have announced the we've had approximately 10 games in development. That hasn't really changed. Games can come in, can come out, but that sort of reflects where the capacity is for that division in terms of having things in different stages of the pipeline in any given point. We did launch Tasty Town in January to a global launch and we also launched Word Life in May. So not every game makes it, but the good news is, we've got games that are actually coming out and are worthy of global launch. So we continue down that path. And like I said, you can expect to see new games coming out of Social Point all the time, but that 10 number is still a good number. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein. \nTodd Juenger: Notwithstanding the long list of sort of double-digit growth rates in the quarter, I did see those, but I'd love to talk a little bit about growth over the horizon. And I guess Strauss or Karl or whoever wants to take it, there's not that many examples I can think of, of companies in your business of your size or bigger that are able to organically grow over time consistently. I just wonder, do you guys subscribe to a view that at a certain size, it gets harder and harder for a company in your business to grow or do you think that's a false view? And it begs a follow-on, I'll just keep it to 1 or 2. But does it mean that you guys will have to, perhaps, start introducing more than one front line title other than NBA 2K a year? Does online services sort of change that need or replace extra releases and that sort of growth algorithm? And what does that mean for your organization? Just thinking over the horizon of how you keep this going. \nStrauss Zelnick: Well, really appreciate it. And yes, you're right, law of big numbers. As the numbers get bigger, of course, growing at the same rate will become more challenging. But we have this wonderful situation in the marketplace, which is that the sector has extraordinary tailwinds. And we expect those to continue. And that's driven by the growth in the cohort that enjoys video games. Remember, people consume for the rest of their lives the entertainment that they loved at the age of 17. The video game business is about 30 years old, 35 years old effectively. And the average player age today is around 37 or 38. So plenty of room for growth. As people age, more people come into the market, but people don't stop playing video games.\n So for 20 or 25 years, demographics will grow, will cause the industry to grow and the industry participants who do a good job will benefit from that. We're also seeing growth from geographies that we're currently not involved in, for example, Africa and India, to a lesser extent, Russia, the Middle East and of course, China, where we currently have a meaningful business, but we think there's a lot of growth opportunity there as well.\n And third, growth in new business models, new technologies such as streaming. And new kinds of games, I would just observe 10 years ago, there was no mobile business. And today, that's a $60 billion marketplace. And at the same time that, that has sprung up and grown, the core console and PC businesses continue to grow at a rapid clip. So this industry is the most rapidly growing industry in entertainment, and that's not going to change for the next 10, 20, 25 years.\n Now with that backdrop, can we fail to execute? Of course, we can. So what are we doing about it? First, our focus is on being the most creative, the most innovative and the most efficient company in the business. We take that incredibly seriously. And the reflection of that are the quality of what we do most of the time and the reflection of that is in the financial results that we're able to deliver more often than not. Right now, we are increasing -- to your specific question, we are increasing our investment in development. We are increasing our R&D investment. We do expect to enhance our release schedule. We launched Private Division. We bought Social Point. And I think you can expect opportunities are both driven organically and driven inorganically.\n So finally, when we took over this company roughly 12 years ago, we had $700 million in net revenue. This year, we're projecting to $2.5 billion, $2.6 billion in net bookings. That is primarily organic growth. We've done a few acquisitions, but primarily, that's organic growth. And I'd be loath to give you a prediction of an annual growth rate. I can't really do that. But what I can tell you is, we're duty-bound to deliver new IP every year and new releases of franchise IP. We're duty-bound to deliver the biggest and best titles in the business and it's our job to create hits. And more often than not, we do that. If we do that, we're going to have a great set of results. And if we can add on somehow some inorganic growth, which is also a part of our current strategy, selectively and in a highly disciplined way, then we could deliver even more growth. I always like to say, you can listen to the words, but it's always better to look at the actions because that's probably what will be repeated. And our actions are, we deliver hits and we deliver organic growth. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. \nMichael Olson: As you mentioned, GTA is performing better than expected, and I'm sure the majority of that outperformance has to do with development of compelling content from Rockstar. But just curious, while you don't directly monetize some of the things that have been going on with modding, et cetera, how much of the strong, recent interest in the title is from those types of kind of outside activities positively impacting GTA Online and also helping maintain player engagement or re-engage the base? \nStrauss Zelnick: We do think it's had a big impact along with the exposure of GTA and the popularity of GTA and Twitch, which has led to this relationship with Twitch Prime that we're super excited about. So we're all astonished and delighted that 6 years after the initial release, Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online are even bigger cultural phenomena than ever. But as you pointed out, what's that driven by? That's driven by the content that Rockstar continues to deliver the audience and the respect that Rockstar shows its audience and the desire to keep being on the cutting edge of entertainment. That's our goal around here and Rockstar personifies the execution of that. \nMichael Olson: Absolutely. And then as previously discussed on the call here, you've got some interesting Private Division titles coming out this year and next. I know it's really hard to say and you don't want to give specific guidance. But maybe just qualitatively, what's kind of the best way for investors to think about potential contribution from those titles? Like how additive do you think they can be versus some of your other titles? \nStrauss Zelnick: Yes. The structure of those titles economically are, if we are able to create hits, they have the same pound-for-pound economic benefit than any of our other titles around here. So there's a great opportunity, but that opportunity will be delivered to the extent that we deliver hits. And we never claim success before we have it, ever. That said, our expectations are high. The buzz is very strong. The team there, led by Michael Worosz, takes the quality part of our strategy exceedingly seriously. They are very disciplined and very, very selective. And we're grateful that we get to work with some of the best creators on Earth. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Gee with BAM. \nRyan Gee: So I wanted to understand the accelerating growth for NBA 2K. I know unit sales are up. But beyond that, how much has performance there been really a function of getting more players to go online versus really growth in ARPU for the existing players? And if it is the latter, what were some of the significant changes you guys have done and how much room do you think there is to push that ARPU button higher?\n And then a follow-up. I know you guys called out GTA Online has performed really well since the casino update in terms of player engagement and users, but I don't recall if you said anything specifically about Red Dead coming out of the beta. So 2 months on, what are you guys seeing in terms of players and engagement for that title? \nKarl Slatoff: So yes, NBA 2K19 is, in fact, it's actually exceeding our expectations. And it's really changed over the year. I don't know if you'll recall that we weren't necessarily projecting that units would be higher than they were iteration over iteration. Now we are significantly. We're already nearly 12 million units at this point. So it is certainly growth in units. That always helps. When you've got a higher base of people playing the game that creates this virtual circle that's obviously had a positive effect on RCS as well.\n So RCS is up 140% quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year for this quarter. That's a huge change for us. And yes, of course, the number of units and getting more players in had a lot to do with that, but also I think how we're more effectively engaging folks because if people are engaged and we give them more things to do, then ultimately that leads to positive things from an economic standpoint. And some of the things that we've done because we've learned from the past is that, and Strauss mentioned this before, is that we're focused on trying to keep people engaged throughout the entire year, through the entire season, certainly through the summer and the playoffs, through the end of the season and then also through the summer. And the way that we do that is, first of all, I think the NBA 2K League has driven more interest, and that engages folks ultimately and the league just ended a few weeks ago. And also just a different mix of game modes that appeals to a broader audience and play styles. There's promotional activity that we've tried over the past few months, new player virtual currency bundles and also some late-cycle MyTeam content. So it's really a combination of a lot of things that helps drive people to the game but also getting them more engaged in the game. And if they're more engaged in the game, they're going to spend more money ultimately. And there's a lot of dry powder there. I would say we're still in the early innings of learning how to do this the best way. \nStrauss Zelnick: Yes. And with regard to Red Dead Online, we said that post coming out of beta in May, the title has been performing better and better and gaining momentum. We don't have any more statistics to share except to say that it's going well, continuing to go better and that we're very, very optimistic. \nRyan Gee: Okay. Great. And if I can just sneak one more in there. Lainie, I believe that Borderlands 3, you guys feel better about it. How should we think about the opportunity for that in fiscal '20 relative to the 25 million-plus that, I think, has sold in life-to-date that you guys recently disclosed? \nLainie Goldstein: So Borderlands 2, we've sold-in to date 22 million units, and it's always our aim to grow each sequel of our franchises from iteration to iteration. And the consumer excitement is incredibly strong so we're really excited about the title. And when we looked at our numbers for the remainder of the year, we were able to bring up the forecast based on what we've been seeing. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. \nMichael Ng: I just have one for Karl and one for Lainie. Karl, you mentioned that the Borderlands franchise sold in about 48 million units to date, and I think that's up from 41 million as recently as February. Could you talk a little bit about how the 7 million units or so sold in the last 5 to 6 months inform your view about Borderlands 3, if at all? And has that increased your confidence about the title?\n And then for Lainie, I think you mentioned the combined results for RCS for GTA Online and RDR will grow this year, excluding the premium unit headwind. Including that, would it still grow? \nKarl Slatoff: So for Borderlands 3, we are very excited about where things are right now from a buzz perspective, but also from an economic performance perspective. We probably would have never anticipated that our catalog sales from the previous Borderland releases would have accelerated as much as they did. Now that didn't come without real effort and real planning, but I think the response has certainly outweighed our expectations. So I would say, if anything, the past couple of months of activity would not -- starting with the various marketing beats that the marketing team at 2K has undertaken, but the actual just the promotional activity that we've had and the reaction from consumers where they're actually opening up their checkbooks and spending money, that bodes very, very well for Borderlands 3. So we're very excited about that. \nLainie Goldstein: So in terms of Rockstar Online, yes, we said it would grow without the special edition VC allocation. And it's not growing at this moment including it, but it's still early in the year. So we'll see how the year susses out. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ray Stochel with Consumer Edge. \nRaymond Stochel: So digital grew and recurrent spending grew a lot. Is there any way that we can think about the gross margin contraction in the quarter? It looks like some heavy software development costs and royalties.\n And then separately, on the expense side, is there any timing that you're calling out around marketing either pushed or pulled forward in the period? \nLainie Goldstein: So in terms of the digital and recurrent consumer spending, it is continuing to help grow the gross margin, and you'll see that on the full year. In the quarter, we have a new release coming out. And with that, we have additional cap software expense and development costs. So that would be a little bit higher in the quarter.\n In terms of the expenses, in Q1, there was a little bit of marketing that didn't happen during the quarter that's going to get pushed out to the remainder of the year. You'll see the biggest marketing in Q2 and Q3 around our biggest releases and then they'll come down a little bit in Q4. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Clay Griffin with Deutsche Bank. \nClay Griffin: Look, I know you all like for your labels to take the lead in announcing new content and fully appreciate all the color you guys have given on GTA Online for the year. But I guess can you just help us think about maybe the relative scale and scope of the content that's planned for this year perhaps relative to the past couple of years? \nStrauss Zelnick: Lots more. \nClay Griffin: Okay. Great. And then I guess just with Stadia, can you maybe talk about the relative ease or difficulty in taking Red Dead and even Grand Theft Auto to that platform from a technical perspective? It would seem like the single-player experience at the very least could potentially be very successful there. \nStrauss Zelnick: Yes. It's technically there -- it's relatively seamless. There are some minor challenges, nothing that we can't surmount. We are supportive of Stadia. We feel really good about that release. We've always said that you want to distinguish a distribution technology from a business model. The business model that we're using is one that's tried and true which is downloading for sale or streaming for sale. And there's not a lot of friction to make our titles available and Google's been exceedingly helpful. We feel very good about the opportunity. It remains to be seen how the platform works. They're awfully talented and they're very, very committed. So fingers crossed that it meets and exceeds consumers' expectations. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Creutz with Cowen and Company. \nDouglas Creutz: One of the interesting things about this new console cycle is that you and your peers are going to face the need to migrate these large online gaming communities from one gen to another, and one could think there might be some challenges with that, especially for titles that don't come out on an annual basis. As far as Red Dead Online and GTA Online, how are you thinking about that transition? Do you see any particular challenges or opportunities? Is separating the client for the online from the base game something you consider to kind of ease that transition for players? Anything you can say on that would be helpful. \nKarl Slatoff: It's Karl. From a tech perspective, one thing to keep in mind is generations, if you look at the releases that happen in the early part of a new generation versus the later part of a new generation, it's not necessarily a huge leap. And what you see is generation -- the releases at the end of a generation tend to look very different than the releases in the beginning of the generation. So when you're talking about trends, like putting games onto -- releasing games that are pre-existing games or even games that existed before and you're doing a sequel, bringing them to the next early on in the generation, there is certainly a technical challenge, but you're not necessarily going to be taking advantage of everything that the new generation has to offer. So it's not as disruptive as you may think. It also presents an opportunity to do something more with something that you've got out before. Because one thing is for sure, if you just take something and try to port it over, it's not necessarily going to generate any buzz. And most of the platforms are really talking about backward compatibility this time around as well. So that certainly is not going to resonate. So it is -- there are challenges, but it's not as disruptive as you may think. \nStrauss Zelnick: Right. And just, I mean, while it's maybe not a perfect analogy, we launched NBA 2K Online 2 in China and NBA 2K Online, the first version, is still in market. They're both in market simultaneously. And our recurrent consumer spending is way, way up year-over-year. We have the highest registered user base we've ever had. So again, I'm not sure it's a perfect analogy, but when you give people something they love and then you continue to support it and then potentially offer a new version for whether it's a new version of the title itself or a new version to reflect a new distribution platform or technology or console cycle, your audience is going to expand.\n And your second question about, would you ever consider splitting your purchase of a game from an online community. When you use the word ever, we'll consider anything that's good for the consumer and makes sense for us. We're not a rule-based organization. I would just observe though that the metrics around free-to-play are very different than the metrics around a console or a PC release with a subsequent online event that's ongoing. And it's nice to be in a position where we deliver something that's of such high quality that consumers are prepared happily to pay an entry price. And then we'll stay engaged with a title that on a stand-alone basis could look a lot like a free-to-play title. But by tethering it to the initial release, we've prequalified the consumer and the economics are obviously vastly more powerful.\n So we're open-minded about any business model in the fullness of time, but I think our current business model is very receptive to the needs of consumers and also speaks to the needs of the producing organization and our creative folks. And as I've said on numerous occasions, whenever you're trying to assess whether a particular business model works in entertainment, look for that intersection of what's good, first and foremost, for the consumer and then secondly, what's good for the producer and the distributor. You have to find the sweet spot that encompasses both of those things or you'll have an unstable environment, an environment that either can't support the consumer or can't support the producer or distributor. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Giaimo with Jefferies. \nAlexander Giaimo: Maybe just going back to the question on annualized releases. Do you see an opportunity in the future to bring forward more annualized content outside of WWE and NBA? I know, historically, you said you don't necessarily believe in non-sports annualized content. But maybe on the sports side, are there any opportunities you're seeing in maybe some other under-monetized sports that might make sense to pursue?\n And then quickly, if you guys can just provide an update on what you're seeing from the NBA initiative in China. \nStrauss Zelnick: So what we've said is, we wouldn't expect to annualize any titles other than sports titles. We have represented other sports in the past. We've had baseball. We've had boxing. We've had hockey. We currently have golf, and we're excited about expanding that business to the extent it makes sense for us and for the consumer. But there really aren't that many powerful sports. And right now, the rights are spoken for by some of our competitors. So I don't think you should expect that you're going to see a big array of new titles in the sports environment for us. But we are ambitious and we are open-minded, and if rights became available, I believe we would be at the front of the line given the quality of our development.\n In terms of NBA in China, look, NBA's beloved in China, and NBA 2K Online in China reflects that. And we think there's a lot of opportunity for growth, particularly in mobile. And as I've said before, I'm of the view, and this has got to be a particularly unpopular view today, that the Chinese market will soften, will open up, will be more congenial to all forms of Western entertainment. And while that won't happen overnight, we're good participants in the market. We have great local partners, including Tencent. We comply with government restrictions. And we think that it is possible that, that market will open up, and we intend to be first in line to the extent that it does. We also would love to see some engagement with regard to the NBA 2K League in China. We think there is some potential opportunity there with Tencent. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I would like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks. \nStrauss Zelnick: We'd like to thank you all for your interest and for joining the call. And I think it bears repeating that all of these results are a reflection of the work done by some 5,000 people in our organization worldwide, first and foremost, our extraordinary creative folks across all 4 of our label groups. And then, of course, our business folks who distribute and market the products and account for the numbers and provide legal services and keep all the trains running on time. We have an amazing culture here. We have an amazing array of colleagues. We're all aligned. We're all heading in the same direction. We love what we do. We do so with a smile on our faces. And all of us here are so grateful for the work of all of our colleagues around the world, and I hope that comes across.\n I just want to also say if it's not clear from this call, we're immensely optimistic about our prospects for the remainder of this year and for the years ahead. It's a challenge every day, but it's a challenge that we relish. And we're proud of what we've been able to do so far, and we all firmly believe this is just the beginning. So thanks for joining us today. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Thanks, Strauss. I'd like to begin by thanking our teams for delivering a strong start to the fiscal year.\n Turning now to our recent and upcoming releases. On July 23, Rockstar Games held the grand opening of The Diamond Casino & Resort for Grand Theft Auto Online. The Diamond is the one-stop destination for quality entertainment, high-end living and a range of experiences that you won't find anywhere else. Players can engage in classic casino activities such as 3-card poker, blackjack, roulette and a variety of slot machines or watch virtual horse racing at the inside track lounge. Guests looking for high-end fashion can choose from a variety of new clothing accessories in the casino store. Diamond also offers the most luxurious penthouse residences in all of Los Santos and owners have the ability to customize their penthouse and enjoy VIP memberships at the resort, including exclusive lounges, high-limit tables, aircraft and limousine services and more. This highly engaging update also features a series of new story-based cooperative missions, open more activities and additional opportunities to earn special rewards. The Diamond Casino & Resort update was Grand Theft Auto Online's biggest launch ever, delivering record player engagement and daily active users, weekly active users and monthly active users.\n Now that Red Dead Online has exited the beta phase, Rockstar Games will continue to add more free content to the game. Following the massive content drop in May, later this summer, the world will evolve again with the introduction of specialist roles, including tracking down wanted criminals as a bounty hunter, searching the world for treasure and other exotic items to sell as a collector or building a business as a trader. Throughout the year, Rockstar Games will continue to support both Red Dead Online and Grand Theft Auto Online with many more updates in order to drive engagement and player growth.\n On July 23, 2K released the Rise and Fall expansion pack for Sid Meier's Civilization VI on iOS through Aspyr. 2K also announced that they will bring all of the previously released add-on content for Sid Meier's Civilization VI to both iOS and Nintendo Switch later this year. Civilization VI is the fastest-selling title in the history of the series with sell-in to date of more than 5.5 million units worldwide.\n On August 27, Private Division will release Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey for digital download on PC. The title is the first release from Panache Digital Games, the studio cofounded by Patrice De\u0301silets, the original Creative Director of the Assassin's Creed franchise. In the Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey, players are challenged to survive and evolve in the harsh yet beautiful land of Africa, spanning from 10 million to 2 million years ago. Ancestors will also be available for digital download on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in December.\n On September 6, 2K and Visual Concepts will launch NBA 2K20, the next annual offering from our industry-leading basketball simulation for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and PC. The title will also be available for Google Stadia when the platform launches in November 2019. The NBA 2K20 Standard and digital Deluxe Editions will feature 6-time NBA All-Star, 3-time All-NBA First Team, 3-time NBA All-Defensive Team and 2012 Olympic gold medalist, Anthony Davis, on the cover. The NBA 2K20 Legend Edition will feature 3-time NBA Champion, 13-time NBA All-Star, 2008 Olympic gold medalist and 2006 NBA Finals MVP Dwyane Wade on the cover.

Additional songs will be dynamically added throughout the year across genres, spanning hip-hop, R&B, electronic pop and rock.\n On September 13, 2K and Gearbox Software will launch Borderlands 3 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC. The title will also be available for Google Stadia when the platform launches in November 2019. The Borderlands franchise, which combines the exhilarating action of a first-person shooter with the rich progression and loot systems of a role-playing game, has sold-in more than 48 million units worldwide to date. In June, at E3, more than 8,000 consumers were able to experience Borderlands 3 and their reaction was phenomenal. Throughout the show, there was enormous excitement around our massive, high-energy booth which featured larger-than-life statues and photo ops, 100 gameplay stations and 100-seat demo theater. The global media in attendance lauded Borderlands 3 with more than 50 E3 award wins and nominations, including best in show nods from IGN, GameSpot, Destructoid, Ars Technica, the E3 game critics and more.\n In addition, during the month of June, 2K worked with our first-party partners to offer an array of low to no-cost engagement opportunities, including the release of a new DLC campaign for Borderlands 2 entitled Commander Lilith & the Fight for Sanctuary, which provide the narrative lead-in to the events of Borderlands 3. In addition, Borderlands: The Handsome Collection was added to Xbox Game Pass and was included in the PlayStation Instant Game Collection for the month. On PC, our entire Borderlands back catalog was made available at a deep discount for our retail partners. These efforts, together with the launch of the Borderlands: Game of the Year Edition in April, has resulted in sell-in of over 6 million units of Borderland titles and over 4 million players enjoying the critically acclaimed Commander Lilith DLC.\n Later this month, Borderlands 3 will be at gamescom in Germany and PAX West in Seattle where we will share details on an expansive post-launch content plan that will keep players engaged with new experiences well past September 13. The consumer excitement leading up to next month's launch of Borderlands 3 is incredibly strong and we very much look forward to the next chapter in the highly successful Borderlands franchise.\n On October 22, 2K's popular WWE series will be back when WWE 2K20 launches for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC. Developed by Visual Concepts, WWE 2K20 includes several franchise firsts, alongside streamlined gameplay and a variety of popular modes. Current Raw Women's Champion Becky Lynch and WWE Superstar Roman Reigns will serve as the game's cover Superstars and ambassadors for its worldwide marketing campaign Step Inside, which invites players to enter the world of WWE Superstars and face a variety of new and exciting challenges in the virtual ring.\n On October 25, Private Division will release The Outer Worlds. Developed by Obsidian Entertainment, The Outer Worlds marks the reunion of Tim Cain and Leonard Boyarsky, the original creators of Fallout, who are introducing an entirely new single-player sci-fi RPG experience. Launching on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC, The Outer Worlds is a dark and witty player-driven story set in the colony at the farthest reaches of the galaxy. In addition, the title will be coming to Nintendo Switch following the launch on the other platforms. At E3 in June, The Outer Worlds received 4 nominations from the Game Critics Award for Best of E3, more than any other game and won the award for Best Original Game.\n Throughout fiscal year 2020, we will continue to support our titles with innovative, post-launch content designed to drive engagement. In addition, Social Point and 2K will continue to broaden our offerings for mobile devices.\n Looking ahead to fiscal year 2021, Private Division announced Disintegration, a new sci-fi first-person shooter from V1 Interactive, the studio cofounded by Marcus Lehto, former Creative Director at Bungie and co-creator of Halo. The title will be fully unveiled later this month at gamescom. Private Division will have more exciting news and announcements in the coming months.\n Turning to eSports. The second season of the NBA 2K League, our joint venture with the NBA, concluded this past weekend. Just prior to playoffs, the League announced that Tencent would be their first distribution partner in China and stream condensed playoffs and finals games to their hundreds of millions of daily users across Tencent Sports, Tencent Video and Tencent News. NBA 2K League content has generated more than 243 million video views across all NBA and NBA 2K League social media platforms.\n In addition, NBA 2K League viewership both live and on-demand continues to rise with the second season seeing a 34% increase in views over Season 1. We are very excited about the continued progress and growth of the league which has a long-term potential to enhance engagement and to be a driver of profits for our company.\n Looking ahead, we will continue to focus on delivering the highest-quality entertainment and to provide new and innovative ways to enhance players' experiences with our games. To that end, we are investing heavily in opportunities to grow our scale, increase our presence in mobile and capitalize on emerging distribution channels and business models such as free-to-play, streaming and subscription.\n The successful execution of the strategy will continue to engage our customers and generate growth and profits for our company over the long term.\n I'll now turn the call over to Lainie. So for Private Division, we've announced 3 titles to date. Private Division has been in existence for quite some time, and we tend to only announce things when we are ready to announce things about games themselves. We have a lot of other activity that we haven't talked about with Private Division, but those are the 3 games that we've announced. Ancestors with Patrice De\u0301silets at Panache Games. We have The Outer Worlds with Obsidian. And we just announced recently Disintegration with V1, which is Marcus Lehto's studio. So that's all we have to say at the moment, but you should expect more in the future. It's Karl. In terms of Borderlands 3, we haven't discussed too much about our plan for recurrent consumer spending, but as with most our games if not all our games, we have a robust plan around delivering post-launch and game content to engage with consumers. And it will be a bit different than Red Dead Online. For the most part, we've talked about DLC content, so story-driven, mission-based content. There'll be some cosmetics with Borderlands 3, but it is a different kind of experience. As we said before, 2K is going to be announcing more about that in the not-too-distant future. So you'll get a little bit more clarity on exactly what we have to offer. But if history -- and we don't really talk about engagement and attach, but I think most of the people on the call know that Borderlands has a very strong history of delivering a lot of downloadable content and having great success with that. So obviously we're very excited about that plan. Yes. In terms of our out-years release schedule, we basically disclosed everything that -- we've already disclosed everything we've been talking about now. So there's nothing more to say about that other than the fact that we do have -- and you can see it in our numbers, we have talked about our R&D expenses going up, particularly this year, which will be indicative of investment in new titles. So that is, in fact, what's going on, and we've got a very robust -- and maybe our most robust pipeline of all time for new IP. A lot of that's driven by Private Division, but there's new IP throughout the entire company as well. So again, you'll be hearing more about that soon in the future. In terms of Social Point, as you know, our 2 main titles continue to perform very, very well. And we have announced the we've had approximately 10 games in development. That hasn't really changed. Games can come in, can come out, but that sort of reflects where the capacity is for that division in terms of having things in different stages of the pipeline in any given point. We did launch Tasty Town in January to a global launch and we also launched Word Life in May. So not every game makes it, but the good news is, we've got games that are actually coming out and are worthy of global launch. So we continue down that path. And like I said, you can expect to see new games coming out of Social Point all the time, but that 10 number is still a good number. So yes, NBA 2K19 is, in fact, it's actually exceeding our expectations. And it's really changed over the year. I don't know if you'll recall that we weren't necessarily projecting that units would be higher than they were iteration over iteration. Now we are significantly. We're already nearly 12 million units at this point. So it is certainly growth in units. That always helps. When you've got a higher base of people playing the game that creates this virtual circle that's obviously had a positive effect on RCS as well.\n So RCS is up 140% quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year for this quarter. That's a huge change for us. And yes, of course, the number of units and getting more players in had a lot to do with that, but also I think how we're more effectively engaging folks because if people are engaged and we give them more things to do, then ultimately that leads to positive things from an economic standpoint. And some of the things that we've done because we've learned from the past is that, and Strauss mentioned this before, is that we're focused on trying to keep people engaged throughout the entire year, through the entire season, certainly through the summer and the playoffs, through the end of the season and then also through the summer. And the way that we do that is, first of all, I think the NBA 2K League has driven more interest, and that engages folks ultimately and the league just ended a few weeks ago. And also just a different mix of game modes that appeals to a broader audience and play styles. There's promotional activity that we've tried over the past few months, new player virtual currency bundles and also some late-cycle MyTeam content. So it's really a combination of a lot of things that helps drive people to the game but also getting them more engaged in the game. And if they're more engaged in the game, they're going to spend more money ultimately. And there's a lot of dry powder there. I would say we're still in the early innings of learning how to do this the best way. So for Borderlands 3, we are very excited about where things are right now from a buzz perspective, but also from an economic performance perspective. We probably would have never anticipated that our catalog sales from the previous Borderland releases would have accelerated as much as they did. Now that didn't come without real effort and real planning, but I think the response has certainly outweighed our expectations. So I would say, if anything, the past couple of months of activity would not -- starting with the various marketing beats that the marketing team at 2K has undertaken, but the actual just the promotional activity that we've had and the reaction from consumers where they're actually opening up their checkbooks and spending money, that bodes very, very well for Borderlands 3. So we're very excited about that. It's Karl. From a tech perspective, one thing to keep in mind is generations, if you look at the releases that happen in the early part of a new generation versus the later part of a new generation, it's not necessarily a huge leap. And what you see is generation -- the releases at the end of a generation tend to look very different than the releases in the beginning of the generation. So when you're talking about trends, like putting games onto -- releasing games that are pre-existing games or even games that existed before and you're doing a sequel, bringing them to the next early on in the generation, there is certainly a technical challenge, but you're not necessarily going to be taking advantage of everything that the new generation has to offer. So it's not as disruptive as you may think. It also presents an opportunity to do something more with something that you've got out before. Because one thing is for sure, if you just take something and try to port it over, it's not necessarily going to generate any buzz. And most of the platforms are really talking about backward compatibility this time around as well. So that certainly is not going to resonate. So it is -- there are challenges, but it's not as disruptive as you may think."

            "name": "Lainie Goldstein",
            "content": "Thanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we'll discuss our first quarter results and then review our financial outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year 2020. Please note that additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release.\n As Strauss mentioned, fiscal 2020 is off to a terrific start with first quarter operating results that exceeded our expectations. Total net bookings grew 46% to $422 million as compared to our outlook of $310 million to $360 million. This outperformance is driven primarily by better-than-expected results from Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, NBA 2K19 and the Borderlands franchise. Recurrent consumer spending grew 55% and accounted for 67% of total net bookings as compared to our outlook of over 20% growth. Recurrent consumer spending exceeded our expectations due primarily to the outperformance of Grand Theft Auto Online and NBA 2K.\n Digitally delivered net bookings grew 51% and accounted for 91% of the total as compared to our outlook of over 20% growth. This result exceeded expectations due to the outperformance of recurrent consumer spending and a higher-than-forecasted mix of digitally delivered full-game sales. During the first quarter, 75% of current generation console games were delivered digitally, up from 53% last year.\n Turning to some details from our first quarter income statement. GAAP net revenue grew to $540 million and cost of goods sold increased to $241 million. Operating expenses increased by 33% to $247 million due primarily to higher marketing and R&D cost. And GAAP net income was $46 million or $0.41 per share as compared to $72 million or $0.62 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Adjusted operating cash flow increased to nearly $47 million, and we ended the period with $1.54 billion in cash and short-term investments.\n Now I will review the highlights of our fiscal 2020 financial outlook. Starting with the second quarter. We project net bookings to range from $860 million to $910 million, up from $583 million in the second quarter last year. The increase is driven primarily by the release of Borderlands 3. The largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K20, Borderlands 3, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online and Social Point's mobile offerings. We project recurrent consumer spending to grow by over 20%. This growth is expected to be driven by NBA 2K, Borderlands 3 and Red Dead Online as well as modest growth from Grand Theft Auto Online. We expect digitally delivered net bookings to increase by more than 40%. Our forecast assumes that 48% of our current generation console games will be delivered digitally, up from 47% in the same period last year.\n We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $855 million to $905 million and cost of goods sold to range from $415 million to $442 million. Operating expenses are expected to range from $312 million to $322 million. At the midpoint, this represents a 37% increase over last year driven primarily by higher marketing and R&D costs. And GAAP net income is expected to range from $118 million to $130 million or $1.04 to $1.14 per share. For management reporting purposes, we expect our tax rate to be 17% throughout fiscal 2020.\n Turning to our outlook for the full fiscal year. We are raising our outlook as a result of better-than-expected first quarter operating results and increased forecast for the balance of the year. We now expect net bookings to range from $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion, up from our prior outlook of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion. Compared to the prior year, we expect NBA 2K and WWE 2K to grow, offset by lower results from Red Dead Redemption 2 and Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Borderlands 3, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, The Outer Worlds and WWE 2K. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 60% 2K, 30% Rockstar Games and 10% Private Division, Social Point and other. And we forecast our geographic net bookings split to be about 65% United States and 35% international.\n We now expect recurrent consumer spending to increase in the mid-teens, up from our prior outlook of low single-digit growth driven primarily by higher expectations for Grand Theft Auto online and NBA 2K. Importantly, we now expect combined results from Grand Theft Auto Online and Red Dead Online to grow in fiscal 2020. This growth excludes the value that was allocated to recurrent consumer spending from the Red Dead Redemption 2 Premium Edition. We now project digitally delivered net bookings to grow in the high teens. This is up from our prior outlook of low double-digit growth driven primarily by our increased forecast for recurrent consumer spending and a higher mix of digitally delivered full-game sales. Our outlook assumes that 55% of current generation console games will be delivered digitally, up from 38% last year.\n We expect to generate more than $450 million in adjusted operating cash flow and we plan to deploy approximately $90 million for capital expenditures. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $2.83 billion to $2.93 billion and cost of goods sold to range from $1.3 billion to $1.34 billion. Total operating expenses are expected to range from $1.07 billion to $1.09 billion. At the midpoint, this represents a 15% increase over the prior year driven primarily by higher marketing, R&D and personnel costs. And we expect GAAP net income to range from $425 million to $454 million or $3.71 to $3.96 per share.\n In closing, fiscal 2020 is off to a fantastic start and is poised to be another outstanding year for Take-Two driven by the talent of our creative teams and our management's unwavering commitment to operational excellence. We have a strong financial foundation that enables us to pursue a variety of opportunities to enhance our strategic positioning and increase our ability to deliver growth and margin expansion over the long term.\n Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Strauss. The R&D expense be. For the fiscal year guidance increase, it is driven primarily by the first quarter beat, but we've also updated our forecast for the remainder of the year. And the primary increases are GTA V, GTA Online and Borderlands 3. Last year, it was $60 million for the year. This year, the increase is driven by some development kits as well as some build-outs with some new office throughout the organization. For Rockstar Online, for fiscal year '20 growth, yes, we expect the 2 games together to grow, but GTA Online for the full year will be down over last year. Q1 and Q2 are up over the prior year. So still really early in the year, so we'll see how the rest of the year plays out, but right now the 2 together are up. So Borderlands 2, we've sold-in to date 22 million units, and it's always our aim to grow each sequel of our franchises from iteration to iteration. And the consumer excitement is incredibly strong so we're really excited about the title. And when we looked at our numbers for the remainder of the year, we were able to bring up the forecast based on what we've been seeing. So in terms of Rockstar Online, yes, we said it would grow without the special edition VC allocation. And it's not growing at this moment including it, but it's still early in the year. So we'll see how the year susses out. So in terms of the digital and recurrent consumer spending, it is continuing to help grow the gross margin, and you'll see that on the full year. In the quarter, we have a new release coming out. And with that, we have additional cap software expense and development costs. So that would be a little bit higher in the quarter.\n In terms of the expenses, in Q1, there was a little bit of marketing that didn't happen during the quarter that's going to get pushed out to the remainder of the year. You'll see the biggest marketing in Q2 and Q3 around our biggest releases and then they'll come down a little bit in Q4."

            "name": "Strauss Zelnick",
            "content": "Thanks, Hank. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that fiscal 2020 is off to a terrific start with first quarter operating results that exceeded our expectations. We delivered significant net bookings and cash flow growth driven by the performance of Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, NBA 2K19, the Borderlands franchise and Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online.\n As we approach the sixth anniversary of their initial launch, sales of Grand Theft Auto V and recurrent consumer spending on Grand Theft Auto Online once again exceeded our expectations in the first quarter. Net bookings from Grand Theft Auto Online grew year-over-year driven by the increased installed base of Grand Theft Auto V units as well as numerous reward bonus programs tied to game mode events and promotions. Grand Theft Auto V also continued its unprecedented level of success, charting in the top 10 games in 5 out of the past 6 months in the U.S. based on combined physical and digital sales according to The NPD Group. The title has now sold in more than 110 million units and remains one of the most revered and successful entertainment experiences across all art forms of all time.\n Our industry-leading basketball series continues to set new benchmarks for excellence. NBA 2K19 is now our highest-selling sports game ever with sell-in to date of nearly 12 million units. During the first quarter, net bookings from NBA 2K19 more than doubled driven by strong recurrent consumer spending and increased unit sales. Recurrent consumer spending on NBA 2K grew more than 140% and was the single-largest contributor to that part of our business. Moreover, engagement with NBA 2K19 continues to increase with average games played and daily active users growing 12% and 23%, respectively. This was driven by a variety of factors, including an enhanced mix of game modes that appeals to a broader audience and play styles, the strong performance of recent sales promotions, new player virtual currency bundles and engaging late-cycle MyTeam content. We expect the lifetime net bookings from NBA 2K19 will be the highest ever for a 2K sports title, including both record unit sales and recurrent consumer spending.\n Leading up to the eagerly anticipated September launch of Borderlands 3, which Karl will discuss shortly, we've seen a significant increase in sales of our Borderlands catalog offerings. During the quarter, 2K and Gearbox Software released the Borderlands: Game of the Year Edition for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC, which features all-new Ultra HD visuals, numerous gameplay improvements and all previously released add-on packs. In addition, we launched the Ultra HD Texture Pack that increases the visual fidelity of Borderlands: The Handsome Collection on consoles and provides a graphical upgrade for Borderlands 2, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel and all of the add-ons for both titles on PC.\n Turning to Rockstar Games' latest creative and commercial masterpiece. Red Dead Redemption 2 continues to expand its audience and to date has sold-in approximately 25 million units worldwide. On May 14, Red Dead Online exited its beta phase with a massive update that brought a host of new gameplay modes, including new cooperative story missions, free roam activities and the introduction of poker, along with a range of updates and improvements that strengthen and stabilize the foundational world of the Red Dead Online experience. In addition, throughout the quarter, Rockstar Games released additional content such as numerous new weapons, clothing, emotes and more. Both engagement and recurrent consumer spending on the game continue to gain momentum and Rockstar plans to continue to enhance and evolve the world of Red Dead Online with ongoing updates to drive growth over time.\n On July 1, Rockstar Games and Twitch announced an exciting new program through which Rockstar Games Social Club members and Twitch Prime subscribers receive free in-game rewards, bonuses and exclusive discounts in both Grand Theft Auto Online and Red Dead Online simply by linking their Twitch Prime and Social Club accounts. Benefits continue for months to come and include special in-game benefits for both Red Dead Online and Grand Theft Auto Online. Rockstar Games plans to support both Red Dead Online and Grand Theft Auto Online with much more content moving forward, and we now expect combined results from these titles to grow in fiscal 2020.\n Our first quarter results were also enhanced by Social Point's mobile games, WWE SuperCard and WWE 2K19 as well as Sid Meier's Civilization VI. One of our key strategic priorities is to continue to drive growth and engagement with our titles after their initial purchase. Our ability to achieve this goal consistently results from our firm commitment to providing consumers with opportunities that are compelling, of the highest quality and that meaningfully add to their overall gameplay experience. To that end, during the first quarter, recurrent consumer spending exceeded our expectations, growing 55% and accounting for 67% of our total net bookings.\n In addition to virtual currency for NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Red Dead Online, recurrent consumer spending was enhanced by a variety of other offerings. In the free-to-play category, Social Point remains a meaningful contributor to our results through its 2 biggest mobile titles, Dragon City and Monster Legends as well as World Chef and Tasty Town. In May, our Barcelona-based studio successfully launched Word Life, a new crossword game and continues to invest in its broad and innovative pipeline of new games planned for launch in the coming years.\n Recurrent consumer spending on WWE SuperCard exceeded our expectations and the title has now been downloaded nearly 19.5 million times and remains 2K's highest-grossing mobile title.\n And recurrent consumer spending on NBA 2K Online in China also outperformed, growing 75%, driven by the launch of NBA 2K Online 2 in August last year. Total combined registered users for NBA 2K Online 2 and its predecessor currently stand at 46 million, and the franchise remains the #1 PC online sports game in China. Asia and China in particular continues to be a significant, long-term growth opportunity for our business.\n Lastly, add-on content grew nearly 135%, led by offerings for the Borderlands franchise and Sid Meier's Civilization VI.\n As a result of our better-than-expected first quarter operating results and increased forecast for the balance of the year, we're raising our outlook for fiscal 2020, which is anticipated to be another great year for our organization. Looking ahead, we have the strongest development pipeline in our history, including sequels from our biggest franchises as well as exciting new IP.\n Take-Two remains exceedingly well positioned creatively, strategically and financially to capitalize on our industry's many opportunities and to deliver growth and returns for our shareholders over the long term. With the promise of new consoles, along with emerging platforms, distribution channels, business models and markets, we have tremendous potential to engage and expand further our global audience through our development team's passion and vision for creative excellence.\n I'll now turn the call over to Karl. Thanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of the entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for their hard work in delivering an excellent start to the year. To our shareholders, I'd like to express our appreciation for your continued support. And we'll now take your questions. Operator? Thanks, Eric. This is Strauss. So on Red Dead Online, we exited the beta phase on May 14 with a huge update and created a lot of opportunity to enjoy the online world. We also introduced poker at that time. In addition, throughout the first quarter, Rockstar released additional content, including new weapons, clothing, emotes and others which I mentioned earlier. We're not giving out any statistics. However, we're really thrilled with the sales of Red Dead Redemption 2 at over 25 million units and we're excited about the continuing momentum with Red Dead Online. We've also said that we expect that Rockstar Online, which is both Red Dead Online and Grand Theft Auto Online, should be setting a new record this year. So couldn't be more excited. And Karl will talk about Private Division. And in terms of the new casino update, this has been our biggest ever for Grand Theft Auto Online, which is saying a lot. And what we've seen already is record player engagement in daily, weekly and monthly active users with a lot of more content coming. So it's looking just fantastic. And of course, we're up year-over-year in the quarter, which is great. \n Turning to the platform fees. Look, with competition, I think you have to expect that we will do much better in terms of take rates. You're already seeing that some recently launched platforms have announced lower fees. And if you go from an oligopoly environment to a broadly competitive environment, I think that has to be your expectation. And I would just note that, that obviously, that benefits the company directly as those fees decline. And that's how we've been counting. That doesn't even count, of course, the volumes. So I think it's going to be sort of the food is both tasty and plentiful which is nice. Thanks, Drew, for your question. Yes, we've been blessed by the amazing work that Visual Concepts and 2K do on NBA 2K, and we're having a record-setting year again this year with NBA 2K19, which has sold-in over 12 million units and recurrent consumer spending was up 140% in the quarter. Just amazing with extraordinary growth in average games played and daily active users really across the board. And I attribute that to not only that we have the industry-leading sim game, but that you can inhabit this game and enjoy its -- sort of the lifestyle that it offers for -- in addition to playing the sim game itself.\n I think 6, 7 years ago, basketball was a 3-month experience. And now it's a 9-, 10-month experience, and we think it's going to grow to be a full 1-year experience. To address your question particularly, the last console cycle had no negative influence on us and frankly, not really much on the industry because the entire platform business is diversifying. And the PC format particularly since that's now all digital has transformed that business. That can be 40%, 50% of a release, of a console release now if you're out on all those platforms. And that'll continue to grow. So we expect that the new console generation will be a significant net positive, and there's nothing about an annualized sports title that would play out differently. Well, thanks. With a game like Red Dead where you can engage significantly with the characters in the games, we think there are wonderful opportunities for players to experience the Red Dead Online world on an ongoing basis, especially as new content is dropped. And we tend to focus on the experience first. We want to make something that consumers love and engage with and then monetization follows. But we do feel there are and will be plenty of opportunities to create recurrent consumer spending based on the format of the Red Dead Online world. Well, really appreciate it. And yes, you're right, law of big numbers. As the numbers get bigger, of course, growing at the same rate will become more challenging. But we have this wonderful situation in the marketplace, which is that the sector has extraordinary tailwinds. And we expect those to continue. And that's driven by the growth in the cohort that enjoys video games. Remember, people consume for the rest of their lives the entertainment that they loved at the age of 17. The video game business is about 30 years old, 35 years old effectively. And the average player age today is around 37 or 38. So plenty of room for growth. As people age, more people come into the market, but people don't stop playing video games.\n So for 20 or 25 years, demographics will grow, will cause the industry to grow and the industry participants who do a good job will benefit from that. We're also seeing growth from geographies that we're currently not involved in, for example, Africa and India, to a lesser extent, Russia, the Middle East and of course, China, where we currently have a meaningful business, but we think there's a lot of growth opportunity there as well.\n And third, growth in new business models, new technologies such as streaming. And new kinds of games, I would just observe 10 years ago, there was no mobile business. And today, that's a $60 billion marketplace. And at the same time that, that has sprung up and grown, the core console and PC businesses continue to grow at a rapid clip. So this industry is the most rapidly growing industry in entertainment, and that's not going to change for the next 10, 20, 25 years.\n Now with that backdrop, can we fail to execute? Of course, we can. So what are we doing about it? First, our focus is on being the most creative, the most innovative and the most efficient company in the business. We take that incredibly seriously. And the reflection of that are the quality of what we do most of the time and the reflection of that is in the financial results that we're able to deliver more often than not. Right now, we are increasing -- to your specific question, we are increasing our investment in development. We are increasing our R&D investment. We do expect to enhance our release schedule. We launched Private Division. We bought Social Point. And I think you can expect opportunities are both driven organically and driven inorganically.\n So finally, when we took over this company roughly 12 years ago, we had $700 million in net revenue. This year, we're projecting to $2.5 billion, $2.6 billion in net bookings. That is primarily organic growth. We've done a few acquisitions, but primarily, that's organic growth. And I'd be loath to give you a prediction of an annual growth rate. I can't really do that. But what I can tell you is, we're duty-bound to deliver new IP every year and new releases of franchise IP. We're duty-bound to deliver the biggest and best titles in the business and it's our job to create hits. And more often than not, we do that. If we do that, we're going to have a great set of results. And if we can add on somehow some inorganic growth, which is also a part of our current strategy, selectively and in a highly disciplined way, then we could deliver even more growth. I always like to say, you can listen to the words, but it's always better to look at the actions because that's probably what will be repeated. And our actions are, we deliver hits and we deliver organic growth. We do think it's had a big impact along with the exposure of GTA and the popularity of GTA and Twitch, which has led to this relationship with Twitch Prime that we're super excited about. So we're all astonished and delighted that 6 years after the initial release, Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online are even bigger cultural phenomena than ever. But as you pointed out, what's that driven by? That's driven by the content that Rockstar continues to deliver the audience and the respect that Rockstar shows its audience and the desire to keep being on the cutting edge of entertainment. That's our goal around here and Rockstar personifies the execution of that. Yes. The structure of those titles economically are, if we are able to create hits, they have the same pound-for-pound economic benefit than any of our other titles around here. So there's a great opportunity, but that opportunity will be delivered to the extent that we deliver hits. And we never claim success before we have it, ever. That said, our expectations are high. The buzz is very strong. The team there, led by Michael Worosz, takes the quality part of our strategy exceedingly seriously. They are very disciplined and very, very selective. And we're grateful that we get to work with some of the best creators on Earth. Yes. And with regard to Red Dead Online, we said that post coming out of beta in May, the title has been performing better and better and gaining momentum. We don't have any more statistics to share except to say that it's going well, continuing to go better and that we're very, very optimistic. Lots more. Yes. It's technically there -- it's relatively seamless. There are some minor challenges, nothing that we can't surmount. We are supportive of Stadia. We feel really good about that release. We've always said that you want to distinguish a distribution technology from a business model. The business model that we're using is one that's tried and true which is downloading for sale or streaming for sale. And there's not a lot of friction to make our titles available and Google's been exceedingly helpful. We feel very good about the opportunity. It remains to be seen how the platform works. They're awfully talented and they're very, very committed. So fingers crossed that it meets and exceeds consumers' expectations. Right. And just, I mean, while it's maybe not a perfect analogy, we launched NBA 2K Online 2 in China and NBA 2K Online, the first version, is still in market. They're both in market simultaneously. And our recurrent consumer spending is way, way up year-over-year. We have the highest registered user base we've ever had. So again, I'm not sure it's a perfect analogy, but when you give people something they love and then you continue to support it and then potentially offer a new version for whether it's a new version of the title itself or a new version to reflect a new distribution platform or technology or console cycle, your audience is going to expand.\n And your second question about, would you ever consider splitting your purchase of a game from an online community. When you use the word ever, we'll consider anything that's good for the consumer and makes sense for us. We're not a rule-based organization. I would just observe though that the metrics around free-to-play are very different than the metrics around a console or a PC release with a subsequent online event that's ongoing. And it's nice to be in a position where we deliver something that's of such high quality that consumers are prepared happily to pay an entry price. And then we'll stay engaged with a title that on a stand-alone basis could look a lot like a free-to-play title. But by tethering it to the initial release, we've prequalified the consumer and the economics are obviously vastly more powerful.\n So we're open-minded about any business model in the fullness of time, but I think our current business model is very receptive to the needs of consumers and also speaks to the needs of the producing organization and our creative folks. And as I've said on numerous occasions, whenever you're trying to assess whether a particular business model works in entertainment, look for that intersection of what's good, first and foremost, for the consumer and then secondly, what's good for the producer and the distributor. You have to find the sweet spot that encompasses both of those things or you'll have an unstable environment, an environment that either can't support the consumer or can't support the producer or distributor. So what we've said is, we wouldn't expect to annualize any titles other than sports titles. We have represented other sports in the past. We've had baseball. We've had boxing. We've had hockey. We currently have golf, and we're excited about expanding that business to the extent it makes sense for us and for the consumer. But there really aren't that many powerful sports. And right now, the rights are spoken for by some of our competitors. So I don't think you should expect that you're going to see a big array of new titles in the sports environment for us. But we are ambitious and we are open-minded, and if rights became available, I believe we would be at the front of the line given the quality of our development.\n In terms of NBA in China, look, NBA's beloved in China, and NBA 2K Online in China reflects that. And we think there's a lot of opportunity for growth, particularly in mobile. And as I've said before, I'm of the view, and this has got to be a particularly unpopular view today, that the Chinese market will soften, will open up, will be more congenial to all forms of Western entertainment. And while that won't happen overnight, we're good participants in the market. We have great local partners, including Tencent. We comply with government restrictions. And we think that it is possible that, that market will open up, and we intend to be first in line to the extent that it does. We also would love to see some engagement with regard to the NBA 2K League in China. We think there is some potential opportunity there with Tencent. We'd like to thank you all for your interest and for joining the call. And I think it bears repeating that all of these results are a reflection of the work done by some 5,000 people in our organization worldwide, first and foremost, our extraordinary creative folks across all 4 of our label groups. And then, of course, our business folks who distribute and market the products and account for the numbers and provide legal services and keep all the trains running on time. We have an amazing culture here. We have an amazing array of colleagues. We're all aligned. We're all heading in the same direction. We love what we do. We do so with a smile on our faces. And all of us here are so grateful for the work of all of our colleagues around the world, and I hope that comes across.\n I just want to also say if it's not clear from this call, we're immensely optimistic about our prospects for the remainder of this year and for the years ahead. It's a challenge every day, but it's a challenge that we relish. And we're proud of what we've been able to do so far, and we all firmly believe this is just the beginning. So thanks for joining us today."

Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Our strong fourth quarter performance concluded an exceptional year for our organization. We delivered net bookings of approximately $3.6 billion, which grew nearly 20% from fiscal 2020 and were the highest ever in our company's history. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank all of our colleagues around the world for helping us achieve these results despite such significant unforeseen and prolonged challenges. It's truly a reflection of our collective resilience and singular commitment to excellence. Our thoughts are with those who have been and continue to be affected by COVID-19. We hope that better days and comfort will come to you soon. Throughout the pandemic, our creative teams have delivered consistently superlative entertainment experiences giving players opportunities to have fun in the most difficult of times and stay connected with family and friends through shared experiences. We grew our online communities meaningfully, including new and returning players, which helped drive recurrent consumer spending growth of 48% to reach a record high and represents 63% of our total net bookings for fiscal 2021. During the year, we enhanced our organization for the long-term. We bolstered the depth of our creative teams by hiring more than 700 new developers, including through the acquisition of several talented studios, which will help us expand our capabilities and grow our business. We also broadened our portfolio of offerings capitalized on diverse business models and made significant investments in our operations and infrastructure. Nearly all of our titles outperformed during the fourth quarter, including NBA 2K21, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online and Sid Meier's Civilization VI. The NBA 2K series is known throughout the world for being the most authentic the most realistic and the most engaging basketball simulation experience in our industry. In addition to giving consumers the ability to step onto the court of their favorite NBA players or as themselves, 2K and Visual Concepts have created various game modes that offer interactive experiences and enable players to build deeper social connections. NBA 2K21 was our first offering built from the ground up for Gen 9 platforms. To-date, the title has exceeded our expectations and sold in over 10 million units. During the fourth quarter, net bookings for the series grew 37% and recurrent consumer spending exceeded our expectations significantly growing 32% and 73% in the period and fiscal year respectively. Consumer engagement with NBA 2K remains incredibly strong with more than 2.3 million users playing the game daily. We see a significant opportunity to grow the franchise further as we provide unique and innovative experiences throughout the game. Once again, Rockstar Games' iconic Grand Theft Auto series exceeded our expectations, expanded its audience and set new benchmarks in fiscal 2021. Driven by an array of new free content updates and sustained interest in last holidays Cayo Perico Heist, Grand Theft Auto Online benefited from strong engagement trends during the fourth quarter, including a record number of active players and the second highest quarter of recurrent consumer spending on record. For the full year, participation levels reached an all-time high from both new and returning players and recurrent consumer spending grew 31% achieving a new annual record. Sales of Grand Theft Auto V also surpassed our expectations, and to-date, the title has sold in more than 145 million units worldwide. Red Dead Online exceeded our expectations during the fourth quarter with active players increasing significantly in recurrent consumer spending performing above our plans due in part to the success of the recently released standalone version of the game. Throughout the period Rockstar Games released new content updates for Red Dead Online including brand-new missions for solo players the Outlaw Pass No. 5 and its new rewards and more. Red Dead Redemption 2 continued to perform very well and, to date, has sold-in over 37 million units worldwide. During the fourth quarter, 2K announced their acquisition of HB Studios, the developers of our highly successful golf game, PGA TOUR 2K21, which, to-date, has sold-in more than 2 million units. We are very excited about the growth potential for the PGA TOUR 2K series, especially as 2K has entered into an exclusive, long-term agreement with golf legend and icon, Tiger Woods, to serve as its Executive Director and consultant, which we believe will enhance the series' ongoing innovation and authenticity. During the period, 2K and Firaxis Games released the Vietnam & Kublai Khan and Portugal Packs for Sid Meier's Civilization VI that were the final offerings for the game's incredibly successful New Frontier Pass. Civilization VI's daily active users have grown steadily since the game's release more than five years ago and, to-date, the title has sold in over 11 million units. As a result of the engagement from the Pass, as well as the success of XCOM: Chimera Squad and XCOM 2 on Switch, Firaxis Games had one of its best years ever. We expect this growth to continue, as the studio has several exciting projects in development that will be revealed this year. During the fourth quarter, Private Division released Murder on Eridanos, the final add-on for their highly successful game, The Outer Worlds, which has sold-in more than 3 million units. The add-on will also be coming to Switch later this year. Private Division's 2019 release, Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey, has now sold-in over 1 million units, marking the third title from the label to achieve the million-unit milestone, joining The Outer Worlds and Kerbal Space Program. Providing new and innovative ways for audiences to stay engaged with our titles after their initial launch is a key strategic priority of our organization and represents an important long-term growth and margin opportunity. Our record levels of recurrent consumer spending were largely driven by NBA 2K and Grand Theft Auto Online during the fourth quarter, and were enhanced by the following offerings. Social Point's live games, led by Dragon City and Monster Legends exceeded our expectations. Strong seasonal content and features, as well as increased marketing investments, helped drive net bookings growth of nearly 30% for the period and 44% for the year. The studio is planning to release three new titles during the second half of fiscal 2022. Playdots had a strong fourth quarter, driven by the outstanding performance of Two Dots, which achieved sequential growth over the third quarter. We expect Playdots to be a significant contributor to our results over the long-term and look forward to its new release planned for the Fall. WWE SuperCard also outperformed, growing 24% during the fourth quarter and 28% during the year. The title has now been downloaded more than 23 million times and remains 2K\u2019s highest-grossing mobile title. NBA 2K Online in China grew 6% and 9% during the fourth quarter and year, respectively, and remains a significant contributor to our results. The title is the number one PC online sports game in China with more than 52 million registered users. Turning to our outlook, we believe that the pandemic initiated a transformational shift in entertainment consumption, revealing the possibilities of interactive entertainment to a much broader market, with interactive entertainment becoming the number one entertainment vertical. We anticipate that the overall addressable market for our industry will be notably larger going forward than it was pre-pandemic. However, as the world returns to a new normal, we expect a moderation of the trends that benefitted our industry over the past year. We currently expect our fiscal 2022 net bookings to range from $3.2 to $3.3 billion, marking the second year in a row with net bookings in excess of $3 billion. We expect to achieve sequential growth in fiscal 2023, and over the next few years, we believe that we will establish new record levels of operating results, even above the spectacular performance we delivered this past year. Lainie will share more details about our outlook. As Karl will discuss in greater detail, in fiscal 2022, we plan to deliver an exciting array of offerings, including four immersive core releases from proven and new franchises. With the strongest pipeline in our company\u2019s history, including many new releases planned for fiscal 2023 and 2024, we are highly optimistic about our growth trajectory and we will be making significant investments this year to enhance our enterprise in key areas such as creative talent, IT, and other infrastructure. In closing, we remain confident in our proven strategy and talented teams around the world. As we continue to grow our business, we believe that Take-Two is exceedingly well-positioned to deliver long-term growth for our shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Karl.\nKarl Slatoff: Thanks, Strauss. I\u2019d like to begin by thanking our teams around the world for delivering a record year for our organization. Since joining Take-Two in 2007, I can\u2019t remember a year during which we were tested more greatly and performed as exceptionally as we did in this past year. Our colleagues' commitment, professionalism, and talent are among the best in our industry, and I could not be prouder of what we have achieved together. In addition, I want to thank our player communities for engaging with our experiences and making our games part of their lives. I\u2019ll now discuss our recent releases. On April 2, 2K and Visual Concepts, once again expanded the breadth and depth of the NBA 2K franchise with the release of NBA 2K21 for Apple Arcade, our first offering for the platform. NBA 2K21 is the most advanced basketball simulation game available on Apple devices, featuring an all-new graphics engine that offers the highest possible resolution, updated rosters and a variety of exciting game modes. NBA 2K21 is currently the most popular game on Apple Arcade. On April 7, 2K and HB Studios released the TravisMathew and PUMA Golf gear update for PGA TOUR 2K21, which keeps players swinging with swag on the cutting edge of modern golf fashion. The TravisMathew Collection includes new polo shirts, hats and shoes, marking the brand's PGA TOUR 2K21 debut, while PUMA Golf introduces an all-new oversized hat and new footwear. On April 8, 2K and Gearbox Software continued to enhance the Borderlands franchise, with the release of the Director\u2019s Cut, the sixth add-on for Borderlands 3. 2K and Gearbox will release two additional vault cards that will become available for owners of the Director\u2019s Cut before the end of calendar 2021 and all players can look forward to returning in-game events like Revenge of the Cartels. In addition, the teams are continuing to explore cross-play functionality that will enable fans to play Borderlands 3 with their friends across multiple platforms and we expect to have more to share in the coming months. Anticipation is growing for Lionsgate's full-length live-action film based on Borderlands. The film is directed by Eli Roth and will feature some of Hollywood favorite stars including Cate Blanchett, Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Hart, Jack Black and Edgar Ramirez. We believe that the film promises to capture the thrills and distinct personality of the series and has the potential to introduce new audiences to the beloved world of Borderlands. Looking ahead, we are very optimistic about our growth opportunities in fiscal 2022 and beyond. As Strauss mentioned, we have an exciting array of offerings planned for this year and our long-term development pipeline represents the strongest in Take-Two's history. For fiscal 2022, we have 21 titles planned for release, including four immersive core releases for purchase, which include two releases from new franchises and two titles from existing franchises. One new independent title, OlliOlli World from Private Division, which will be available for purchase; 10 free-to-play mobile games, including six titles from new franchises, and four from existing franchises; and six new iterations of previously released titles, which will all be available for purchase. While we are very excited to once again be working with the NFL and NFLPA, our first title under these new partnerships is no longer expected to be released during fiscal year 2022. 2K will have more to share on their plans for our football offerings going forward. I'll now discuss details on our announced offerings for this year. Rockstar Games has massive new updates coming this summer to both Red Dead Online and Grand Theft Auto Online, and will deliver fans' most heavily requested additions in a host of new items, including quality of life updates. On May 25, Red Dead Online will deliver eight new races spanning iconic locations across the game's five states, including Standard, Open, Target and Open Target Races. Later this summer, fans can look forward to a host of new missions for skilled outlaws involving everything from quick holdups to larger high state robberies for big rewards. Grand Theft Auto Online continues to expand and evolve. On May 27, Rockstar Games will release eight new stunt races, which will introduce an array of white-knuckled for racers in an assortment of vehicle classes. Fans of the futuristic Deadline Mode will be happy to have seven new arenas for combat coming soon. Survival mode will also expand to new locations throughout Los Santos and Blaine County. And later this summer, car culture will return to Los Santos in new ways in Grand Theft Auto Online's next major update, offering fans of performance and customization upgrades new opportunities to get together and show off their rides. This includes a new social space for car meets alongside new races and race types, new vehicles to acquire and a series of new vehicle themed multipart robbery missions. Notably, these major summer updates will continue to deliver additional surprises in the weeks and months after launch, including special benefits for players when the enhanced version of Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online arrive on Gen nine consoles this November 11. Rockstar Games will have more details to share about these eagerly anticipated launches in the coming months. This year we will have two sports releases from our popular franchises. 2K and Visual Concepts are once again aiming to raise the bar for excellence with NBA 2K22, the latest offering in our industry-leading basketball simulation series. In addition to making the On-court action even more authentic, fans can look forward to new and fun ways to engage with various game modes. Additionally, WWE 2K22 will mark the rebirth of our popular wrestling series. During the broadcast of WrestleMania 37, 2K and Visual Concepts revealed the very first teaser video for the game, featuring both live action and stunning in-game footage of WWE Superstar Rey Mysterio, a high-flying Lucha Libre legend and one of the most exciting and decorated superstars in WWE history. The teaser also highlighted WWE 2K22's tagline, it hits different, which is reflective of both the new direction of the game, and its supporting marketing campaign. We're very excited about the team's fresh approach to the series. And last week our WWE 2K22 development team at Visual Concepts kicked off a social media campaign presently behind the scenes, sneak peaks of the game and developer diary videos. 2K will continue to unveil details in the coming months. 2K will also introduce two releases from new franchises this year including one from Gearbox. On June 24 Private Division will celebrate the tenth anniversary of the release of Kerbal Space Program. Private Division intends to mark the occasion with a week-long celebration including free content updates and more. This winter Private Division and Roll7 will release OlliOlli World digitally for consoles and PC. OlliOlli World marks a bold new direction for this critically acclaimed skateboarding franchise and is bursting with personality. Players slip and flow through Radlandia, a vibrant world of full color characters as they search for the mystical Skate God on their quest for Nirvana. Radlandia and its dwellers are charming weird and crafted with a unique art style. Players can enjoy the game's deep combo system and everything it has to offer, while pros can really prove their skills and master a vast number of moves with access to millions of unique levels in the game's sandbox mode. In addition players can also compete against similarly skilled rivals around the globe in player leagues. Fiscal 2022 will be a big year for mobile with 10 new free-to-play offerings including new titles from 2K, Social Point and PlayDots. We'll also have six iterations of previous release titles including enhanced versions of Grand Theft Auto V and the stand-alone version of Grand Theft Auto Online for Gen nine consoles available for free three months for PlayStation five players. Both of which will launch in the second half of this calendar year. Looking ahead, we expect to deliver over 40 titles across fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024 which gives us confidence in our ability to reach new record levels of operating results in the next few years. Our current expected pipeline for fiscal 2023 and '24 includes 19 immersive core releases, 7 of which are sports simulation games, 15 of these will be available for purchase, while 4 will be free-to-play. 5 independent titles which will all be available for purchase, 10 free-to-play mobile games, 4 mid-core games which will all be available purchase and 3 of which will be sports oriented and 3 new iterations of previously released titles which will all be available for purchase. It bears noting that these titles are a snapshot of our current development pipeline. It is likely that some of these titles will not be developed through completion or some may be delayed and we will also be adding new titles to our slate. In the coming months you'll start to see our titles come to market and we'll aim to share similar updates going forward when we provide our year-end results. In addition to our title releases we'll also continue to have significant long-term opportunity to increase engagement and recurrent consumer spending. Our focus on enhancing our data analytics is enabling us to deepen our understanding of our player base and how they prefer to interact with our games which is helping us to develop the most desirable products expansions and new content updates. Turning to eSports. The NBA 2K League will kick off its fourth season on May 19 and continue for 16 weeks. The 23 teams will play 28 regular season games with each team beginning the 2021 season playing remotely in its local market. For the first time, the NBA 2K League will be aligned into the Eastern and Western conferences games will be simulcast live on the NBA 2K League's Twitch and YouTube channels and will be available on Dash Radio, ES Revolution, Local in India and Sport1 in Europe. Additionally, the league recently announced a landmark multiyear partnership with Sony Interactive Entertainment that makes the PlayStation V, its official console that will be used by all teams and their 138 players doing all games and events. The partnership marks the first of its kind for PlayStation V with an eSports league and the first console partnership for the NBA 2K League. We remain very excited about the continued success and growth of the NBA 2K League which has the long-term potential to enhance engagement and to be a driver of profits for our company. In closing, we remain incredibly excited about the vast potential for our company to captivate and engage audiences around the world by delivering the very best entertainment experiences where they're broadening the reach of our portfolio through new platforms, business models and distribution channels, pursuing organic and inorganic growth opportunities and expanding into emerging markets, Take-Two is superbly positioned to capitalize on the many positive trends in our industry and to provide continued value and returns for our shareholders over the long term. I'll now turn the call over to Lainie.\nLainie Goldstein: Thanks Karl and good afternoon everyone. Today I'll discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 results and then review our financial outlook for the full year and first quarter of fiscal 2022. Please note that additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release. As Strauss mentioned, our strong momentum continued into the fourth quarter and we significantly exceeded our net bookings guidance for the fourth quarter and the year. I'd like to thank our talented colleagues around the world for their passion and dedication which has been inspiring especially given the challenges that COVID-19 has presented us with. Starting with our fourth quarter results. Total net bookings grew 8% to $785 million as compared to our outlook of $602 million to $652 million. These outstanding results marked our highest level of fourth quarter net bookings on record. During the period, recurrent consumer spending grew 17% and accounted for 67% of total net bookings, as compared to our outlook of 5% growth. Our outperformance was primarily due to the incredible performance of NBA 2K. Digitally-delivered net bookings grew 8% and accounted for 92% of the total. This result exceeded our outlook of a 10% decline, due to the outperformance of both recurrent consumer spending and digitally-delivered full game sales. During the fourth quarter, 74% of console game sales were delivered digitally, up from 63% last year. GAAP net revenue grew 10% to $839 million, while cost of goods sold decreased to $280 million, including a reversal of expense of $65 million related to forfeitures of previously granted stock awards. Operating expenses increased by 25% to $304 million, driven by higher marketing, research and development and IT expenses, as well as the addition of Playdots. And, GAAP net income grew 78% to $219 million or $1.88 per share, as compared to $123 million, or $1.07 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Turning to our fiscal 2021 results, total net bookings grew 19% to a new record of $3.55 billion. This exceeded our initial guidance by approximately $1 billion. We experienced exceptional engagement during the shelter-in-place conditions and delivered extraordinary results across many of our franchises, including NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption, Borderlands, Social Point\u2019s mobile games, and Sid Meier\u2019s Civilization. Recurrent consumer spending grew 48%, establishing a new record, and accounted for 63% of total net bookings. This exceeded our prior outlook of 45% growth. Digitally-delivered net bookings grew 27% to a new record of approximately $3.1 billion, and accounted for 87% of the total. This also exceeded our prior outlook of 20% growth due to better-than expected recurrent consumer spending and digitally-delivered full game sales. During fiscal 2021, 64% of console game sales were delivered digitally, up from 55% last year. Non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow was $920 million, as compared to our previous outlook of over $750 million, and marked a record level for our company. During fiscal 2021, we spent $69 million on capital expenditures. At fiscal year end, our cash and short-term investments balance exceeded $2.7 billion. GAAP net revenue grew 9% to $3.37 billion, while cost of goods sold was flat at $1.5 billion. Operating expenses increased by 8% to $1.2 billion, driven primarily by the addition of Playdots, higher headcount, IT, research and development expense and charitable contributions, partially offset by lower marketing expenses. And, GAAP net income grew 46% to $589 million, or $5.09 per share. Our GAAP net income benefited from a $40.6 million gain on the sale of a long-term investment and a reversal of expense of $70 million related to forfeitures of previously granted stock awards. Today, we gave our initial outlook for fiscal 2022. We -- net bookings to range from $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion, the second-highest level of net bookings in our company\u2019s history. This is partly driven by the exciting pipeline of new releases that we have planned for the year, with the majority of our titles coming in the second half of fiscal 2022. Additionally, we expect that engagement trends will be notably higher than they were pre-pandemic; however, as the return to normalcy continues, we expect a moderation of the trends that benefitted our industry over the past year. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, as well as some of our new releases that are yet to be announced. We expect the Net Bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 55% 2K, 35% Rockstar Games, and 10% Private Division, Social Point and Playdots. And, we forecast our geographic net bookings split to be about 60% United States and 40% International. We expect recurrent consumer spending to decline by 15%, as a result of the challenging comparisons from last year. Recurrent consumer spending as a percentage of our business is expected to be approximately 59% versus 63% last year, due to more new releases this year. We project digitally-delivered net bookings to decline by about 8%. As a percentage of our business, digital is projected to represent 87%, which in line with last year. Our forecast assumes that 74% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 64% last year. We expect to generate more than $400 million in non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow, and we plan to deploy approximately $100 million for capital expenditures. The increase in capital expenditures over the prior year is primarily due to continued spending on studio and office build-outs, and IT expense to support our investment in talent. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $3.14 billion to $3.24 billion and cost of goods sold to range from $1.41 billion to $1.46 billion. Our total operating expenses are expected to range from $1.46 billion to $1.48 billion. At the midpoint, this represents a 22% increase over the prior year. As Karl mentioned, we have over 60 titles that we plan to deliver over the next three years and we are making significant investments in key areas, such as marketing, personnel and IT to bring our pipeline to market. Additionally, we will have a full year of expenses for Playdots. While these investments will impact our operating results this year, we are confident that our growing pipeline will enable us to scale our business further and improve our margins in the next few years. And we expect GAAP net income to range from $228 million to $257 million, or $1.95 to $2.20 per share. For management reporting purposes, we expect our tax rate to be 16% throughout fiscal 2022. Now moving on to our guidance for the fiscal first quarter. We project net bookings to range from $625 million to $675 million, as compared to $996 million in the first quarter last year, which was the first full quarter of the COVID-related shelter-in-place conditions when we experienced a strong initial surge in engagement. The largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, NBA 2K21, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online and Borderlands 3. We project recurrent consumer spending to decline by 30%, as we will start to compare against the record levels of engagement that we experienced in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. We also expect digitally delivered net bookings to decline by approximately 30%. Our forecast assumes that 80% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 71% in the same period last year. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $730 million to $780 million and cost of goods sold to range from $277 million to $303 million. Operating expenses are expected to range from $316 million to $326 million. At the midpoint, this represents an 18% increase over last year, driven primarily by higher personnel and stock compensation expenses and the inclusion of Playdots. And GAAP net income is expected to range from $116 million to $129 million, or $1 to $1.10 per share. In closing, fiscal 2021 was a record year for our business and we believe that we can exceed these levels of financial results and establish new record levels of performance in the coming years. Our pipeline is robust and we couldn't be more excited about our new releases for fiscal 2022 and beyond. As we continue to enhance our business by investing in talent, including growing our development headcount and building our infrastructure, we are positioning our company for long-term growth and success, and we expect to deliver sustainable profitable growth for our shareholders. Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Strauss.\nStrauss Zelnick: Thank you, Lainie. We will now take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Ng: Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks for the question. I just have two. First, I was just wondering if you could offer some thoughts about opportunities you see in user-generated content, creator economies, low code and no code game development. Put simply, with the success of platforms like Roblox that pay independent developers, do you see an opportunity for some of your games to go down that avenue? And then, second, now that we have the release date for the expanded and enhanced version of GTA V and GTA Online, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about whether or not you'd expect this to usher in the next seven-year cycle for GTA Online content updates and RCS growth, or is the scope more narrow than that? Thank you very much.\nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks for your questions. You're right. There's an awful lot of interesting things going on in the world of user-generated content and there have been for some time. And we're open-minded and we want to support the community. At the same time, it's terribly important that we and others protect our intellectual property. So that's the rub. The rub is to find a way to engage consumers on the one hand and enable them to express their interest and even their creative desires in the context of our properties. And there are numerous ways to go about that. And I believe we will explore many of those ways, again, in the context of protecting our intellectual property. With regards to Grand Theft Auto, it may shock you to learn that I'm probably not going to comment much on content to come from Rockstar Games. We're so grateful for the extraordinary results that we've had with all Rockstar titles. And in fact, all titles coming from throughout the organization. Grand Theft Auto Online set another record past fiscal year. We sold in over 145 million. So we're very optimistic about what there is to come, including more content. And stay tuned, because Rockstar Games will be talking more about that in the future.\nMike Ng: Great. Thank you for the thoughts, Strauss.\nOperator: And our next question is from Mario Lu with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nMario Lu: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I have one on the full year guide and one on GTA. So the first one on the full year guide, the bookings number when I compare it to fiscal 2019 and 2020 is much higher than what you reported, but non-GAAP EPS guidance is well below those at less than $4. So just hoping if you could help provide any additional color to kind of bridge the booking strength to the EPS guidance. I know you mentioned investments in creative talent and IT, but any additional commentary would be helpful?\nLainie Goldstein: It's really what I said in my prepared remarks, it's really coming from the operating expense increases, and those are really being driven by our investment in marketing personnel and IT. Specifically about 55% of the increase in the expenses is coming from increases in direct marketing for our titles. So we're really investing in marketing our new titles this year and also marketing for our fiscal 2023 titles as well.\nMario Lu: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, Lainie. And then just a clarification question on GTA. Excited to play the enhanced version on November 11. So just curious if the exclusion of the PC version simply means there's no additional purchase to play that version, or is it just coming at a later date? Thanks.\nStrauss Zelnick: We haven't announced anything about a changed PC version.\nMario Lu: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: And our next question is from Brian Fitzgerald with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Fitzgerald: Thanks guys. Maybe two quick ones. On the Private Division, Outer World's Peril on Gorgon came in February on Switch and then Murder on Eridanos released in the middle of March on the consoles and PCs. It's coming later on Switch. How are you feeling about -- and it released in Steam I think in October. So wondering how you're thinking of that particular franchise and in general, how you feel about the breadth and progress with all the studios you have in private label?\nKarl Slatoff: Obviously we're incredibly pleased with Outer Worlds and everything that it's brought. It was -- I can't say that it was a complete surprise out of the gate, but it was certainly was something pleasant for us and a little bit unexpected. The downloadable content has been really very well received and we think the franchise is in outstanding shape at this point. And we will be participating in the franchise and whatever the future holds for that franchise. So we feel really good about it. And we think that it's still building audience and this game itself has a lot of life left in it. And in the future -- we'll see what the future holds for it. But we do think it's a long-term franchise and it is certainly something that we're pleased with the results. In terms of Private Division, we really couldn't be more pleased with the way Private Division is going. As Strauss said, we've already had three titles that have sold in excess of one million units each, which is unusual for independent releases. We have a lot of titles in process. We've got one coming up this year with OlliOlli World. There are a lot of other deals in the pipeline. We've talked about some of them most of them we have not talked about yet and they're varied. There are different scales, different sizes, different shapes, different kinds of experiences which make makes them very exciting. That team is growing, not only from a creative talent perspective in support of Kerbal Space Program, but also from a marketing and publishing perspective. So we expect the best is yet to come from Private Division and we love how we're positioned right now.\nBrian Fitzgerald: Awesome. Thanks, Karl.\nOperator: And our next question is from Matthew Thornton with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nMatthew Thornton: Hey, good afternoon, Strauss, Karl and Lainie. The comment around sequential growth in fiscal 2023 and the next few years and establishing new records I thought was pretty interesting and sounded very confident for a team that I usually think of as being pretty conservative. So I thought that was very interesting. In that context, can you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about the pipeline given kind of the prolonged stay-at-home COVID impact, tight labor market. Curious just to see how you think you're kind of progressing against those headwinds? Secondly, and somewhat related also just curious your appetite around M&A at this point and just $2.7 billion on the balance sheet at this point, just how that opportunity landscape maybe looks now versus three or six or nine months ago? And then just finally, a quick one on console shortages or tightness this year. I'm just kind of thinking about how impactful that was to your outlook for fiscal 2022 or not. Any color there would be great. Thanks guys.\nStrauss Zelnick: So thanks for your three questions. In terms of how we're doing despite the pandemic, look the team has just performed so well. We were very fortunate. Our IT group had us fully prepared for a disaster and we could never predict the pandemic, but a week after we had to start working from home, we were all set up remotely and we were highly productive and we stayed highly productive ever since. We had virtually no slippage. The only title that actually moved as a result of the pandemic was Kerbal Space Program 2 which moved out of this fiscal year and we're super excited about that title and it will be coming. The rest of our production stayed on target and the quality has been amazing as you've seen in our results. We are highly confident in our pipeline going forward. As Karl said though the price that we pay for being as transparent about our future pipeline is that certain things will change. We hope that certain things will change to the good, certain things may also disappoint us. At this point in time, we feel very good about the way our production is unfolding and we don't see any concerns on the horizon. With regard to M&A our strategy remains the same. We have a very strong balance sheet. We have the ability to do everything from modest add-on acquisitions. For example, we acquired HB Studios. Two more substantial acquisitions such as the acquisition of Playdots last calendar year, and prior to that the acquisition of Social Point. There's no secret in that we wish to bulk up our mobile offerings. We're certainly trying to do that organically. We have many titles coming from mobile from Social Point and Playdots and 2K. And at the same time, we're open-minded with regard to acquisitions. Our lens is pretty disciplined. And the result of that disciplined lens is that in 14-years we haven't had one failed acquisition. I'm sure we've also missed some opportunities by being overly disciplined. But on balance it's worked out well for us. Our capital is used for three purposes; returning capital to our shareholders, which we've aggressively done over many years although opportunistically supporting organic growth which is our story around here and allowing us to pursue inorganic growth opportunities on a selective and disciplined basis. And I think that will continue to be the case. Finally with regard to console shortages there's no doubt that supply chains were disrupted in the pandemic. They still remain disruptive. There is a chip shortage. But it's, sort of, a good news bad news thing. The bad news I suppose is that you can't get a console for lower money. The good news is that people really want these new consoles. We had a limited selection of releases for Next Gen, NBA 2K21, which is built from the ground up for Next Gen and Borderlands 3. We have obviously many more titles coming in the future. We think the supply shortages will be resolved and consumers would be able to buy their dream console. So overtime, we're not worried about it and it didn't really hurt us short term either.\nOperator: And our next question is from Gerrick Johnson BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nGerrick Johnson: Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you. I just want to dig into the marketing spend in the quarter a little bit more up to 30%. It's the highest it's ever been in the fourth quarter with really no major releases coming. So what comprised that? And then a second question on the pipeline update. Just to be clear immersive core versus mid-core et cetera, can you just give us an example of what a mid-core game you have in your portfolio is now so we know how -- what that would look like in the future? Thank you.\nLainie Goldstein: So the marketing in Q4 and into next year it's really to support the pipeline of titles that we talked about. It's for our recurrent consumer spending titles and also for our titles going into next year. So we're looking at our head count and the -- a need for our teams to really look at our pipeline in the future. It's become more and more important for us to have the right support around the current titles that are out and the titles -- because it's not just titles that are coming out and releasing they're being supported all throughout their life cycle now. So it's a very different type of marketing than it was in the past where we would just market on release. Now the titles are being marketed all throughout their life cycle. So you'll probably see higher marketing going forward.\nGerrick Johnson: Understood. That makes sense. Thank you.\nKarl Slatoff: And in terms of just, sort of, some examples around what immersive core versus mid-core would be. I'll start with the mid-core. The mid-core will be something like the WWE 2K Battlegrounds would be a good example of a mid-core game. In terms of immersive core that really is a little more varied, but we do look at it as games that have highly engaging gameplay. People who spend hours and hours and hours at it at a time. So these would be examples things like obviously Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption Borderlands, but also things like our strategy games from Firaxis and also of our sports simulations.\nGerrick Johnson: Perfect. Thanks, Karl.\nOperator: Our next question is from Doug Creutz with Cowen & and Company. Please proceed with your question.\nDoug Creutz: Hi. Thanks. It's been interesting if you look at Twitch viewership of Grand Theft Auto over the last several months it's really exploded. It's now the most viewed game on Twitch by I think a factor of two over League of Legends. Is this something that the Rockstar teams have been leaning into at all? Has it sort of sparked any discussions about what Grand Theft Auto Online might become or thoughts about maybe the next iteration of it? Because it is a very interesting trend. Thanks.\nStrauss Zelnick: Yes, unfortunately to answer the question implies some information that we haven't provided and don't expect to provide any time soon. That said, we're gratified by exactly what you talked about which is how popular Grand Theft Auto is on Twitch. We think the Twitch platform is amazing and it's a reflection of the popularity of the title. And Rockstar has said they'll continue to support Grand Theft Online with more content to come.\nDoug Creutz: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Drew Crum with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nDrew Crum: Okay, sir. Thanks. Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Wondered if you'd be willing to discuss your expectations for the GTA 5 franchise in fiscal '22. You typically say this is going to be the year that it declines and you're also lapping looks to be about 15 million units of the full game, but you also have some new content later in the year. So a number of puts and takes here where does that net out? And then separately, Strauss you noted that you've added 700 new developers over the last year. You've turned your investment and creative talent for fiscal '22 is significant. On an organic basis should we assume an uptick in fiscal '22? And I know in the past you guys have noted the scarcity of quality developers. Has that dynamic changed, or is it changing where the labor market is more favorable and conducive to accelerating hiring, or is it more where you are in your content cycle? Thanks.\nStrauss Zelnick:  Yes. Thank you for your question. There is more content coming for Grand Theft Auto Online. And at the same time as we have said in the past, we do expect recurrent consumer spending to moderate in the year. And we'll see how that unfolds. Title has been around for a very long time. And at some time generally speaking, there is moderation. We've been so fortunate to have had another record year this past year, but it was an awfully unusual year.\nKarl Slatoff:  And in terms of development capacity, we have been investing for years in our development capacity and both from organic hires and also through acquisition. And we fully expect that that will continue into the future. And it is our plan. We have it baked into our plan to bring on more developers. And again we have -- you're right. Labor markets do get -- they do tighten up. These folks are highly sought after. But we have a really strong track record of attracting and retaining the best talent in the industry. And part of that reason is because we provide a creative environment where these folks can flourish. And then we compensate them well in success and we align that conversation with our shareholders. And we think that's a recipe that works really, really well. And people love coming to take to across all of our labels because that culture permeates the entire organization. So it is tough to hire and retain key talent. But that is what we do. And that's the most important strategic advantage I think that we have as a company and that's where we focus.\nDrew Crum: Okay. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: And our next question is from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Nowak:  Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask just about marketing a little bit and landing maybe go back to one of your earlier answers. So the first one is on, now that you've brought on so many new users in the ecosystem throughout shelter-in. I'd be curious to hear about learnings you've had of how you're going to have higher marketing efficiency from all the user data and ways in which you've actually exposed more people to your brands and to your great games? Then the second one just to sort of go back to that comment you made about 55% of OpEx being tied to marketing, more recurring marketing spend for the titles. So are you saying that you think the marketing intensity for your games is actually going to go up going forward, or are you more saying that you're spending ahead of new releases to kind of bring new users? And what are you sort of intimating about higher spend even with older games?\nKarl Slatoff:  So I'll take the first part. You're right, there are a ton more users in our ecosystem and that's just -- and not only just a number of users, but they're more engaged. So every time somebody is engaging with one of our games, we've got more data points. And the more data points that we have, the more information that we have to know what consumers want, when they want it, what kind of offers are going to make sense for them, when -- to make sure that we give the consumer exactly what they're looking for. So the bigger that database and the stronger analytics capabilities get and we've invested significantly in those kinds of resources not just tech, but also human beings. People who really -- data scientists who know how to analyze this data. And we -- in my opinion, we're just scratching the surface. We're pretty good at it, but I think there's a lot of room for us to get a lot better. And the bigger that database gets and the more information we get and the more we invest, it has just been returning our investment tenfold. So we expect that to continue this year and well into the future.\nLainie Goldstein: And when it comes to what I was saying about the 55% of the increase of the OpEx this year was for direct marketing that's because we have a lot of new releases in this year. So when we have new releases, we tend to have big campaigns around the newer releases. So since we have more new releases this year that's why we would have more marketing this year. And our marketing is very efficient around our titles. We also have a lot of marketing around our mobile titles. So we have a big portfolio of mobile titles as well and mobile titles coming out. So that's also been driving our marketing spend as well.\nBrian Nowak: Perfect. Very clear. Thank you, this is mobile. Thank you very much for that.\nOperator: Our next question is from Eric Handler with MKM Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nEric Handler: Good afternoon. Thank you for the question. Wondering if you just could drill down on your mobile business a little bit, since it is the fastest-growing segment within -- in the community space. I'm curious is all your mobile development currently within PlayDots and Social Point, or do you have studios within Rockstar and 2K that are also working on the mobile -- on their own mobile games?\nStrauss Zelnick:  We have work going on throughout the organization. Obviously, Social Point and PlayDots are dedicated to mobile experiences both mid-core and casual. We have some mobile titles at 2K as well. In fact, one of our biggest titles is their WWE SuperCard and we have ongoing development throughout, some of which is announced, some of which is not yet.\nEric Handler: Okay. And just as a follow-up, the term metaverse has been used a lot in the last three to five months or so. And when you think about all of the people that are playing GTA Online and GTA V, but also Red Dead Online. How are you thinking five years plus down the road in aggregating this pool of players and thinking about how you can create a bigger type of platform experience for them?\nStrauss Zelnick: We're going to create bigger experiences by encouraging our creative folks as always to pursue their passions and to always think of that thing that no one thought of before, which is why our strategy is to be the most creative, the most innovative and the most efficient company in the entertainment business. I'm always allergic to buzzwords. The buzzword of virtual reality didn't get this industry very far. AR has not really improved matters, either 3D hasn't really done much for us. What moves the dial in our business is amazing creativity, great characters, great stories, great graphics, great gameplay, the ability to enjoy those experiences with other people all around the world. That's what really matters. I think what the metaverse implies is what we already do with Grand Theft Auto Online and with what Red Dead Online what we do with NBA 2K, and what we aim to do with some upcoming titles an opportunity to exist in that fictional world and express yourself in ways that are challenging, fun, competitive and new and find ourselves in places doing things that we can't really do usually in the real world. I think that's what it means. I think when you get into conversations around -- are people going to do conference calls in titles? Well, the answer is they can now. But who -- we're not -- like we could, I guess do this conference call inside one of our titles, but it's a bit more efficient to do it this way. So the problem I have is that if you take metaverse SPAC and cryptocurrency put them all together in five years will any of this matter? I'm not sure it will.\nEric Handler: Thanks Strauss.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question is with Benjamin Black with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nBenjamin Black: Great. Thank you for the question. I just have one on Apple Arcade. Curious to hear your takeaway so far on NBA 2K21, has it had positive implications for game sales elsewhere on the platforms. I know you, obviously, support many platforms, but how do you frame the opportunity set for potentially publishing more gains on Arcade? Thank you.\nKarl Slatoff: Yeah. As I said in my remarks, we're very happy how NBA is doing on Apple Arcade. It's the most popular game on the service right now. So we can't ask for anything more than that. It's still pretty early ultimately. So is it having a huge impact on selling games across other platforms, hard to tell at this point. Do we think that that certainly is a possibility? I think absolutely because every time you get people exposed to the game through new platforms or platforms where they otherwise may not have exposure to it that's a positive thing from a marketing perspective. So stay tuned on that.\nBenjamin Black: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is with Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Ju: Thank you. So Strauss, I think, I heard Lainie say that I think the forward guidance parameter is baked in, I think 80% of sales of gains I think coming from download. So now that brick-and-mortar retail has completely de-indexed as a relative contributor to your business over the last console cycle. I remember when it was agreeing to have it be greater than 50% and match where the PC industry is today in terms of the mix. So do you think this opens up the possibility for you to be more experimental with your pricing, particularly for those titles outside the core Rockstar and the 2K property, especially as you think about expanding potential audience, particularly now that there is really a greater ability to monetize those users with recurrent consumer spend? Thanks.\nStrauss Zelnick: I think it's a really excellent point, and I think you're right. There is a bit more flexibility when you can move quickly and you don't have to worry about stock that you shipped in or price protection for example, which can be costly. Undoubtedly we can move more -- with more agility in terms of promotions, so I think there's a benefit. But of course that benefit is swamped by the simple benefit that our margins are much higher with regard to digital distribution and physical. That's the big difference. And I think the other difference, which we haven't really talked about, but it was obviously something that's going on in the market right now is we expect that the cost of distribution will decline for any number of reasons and that also will go directly to the bottom line.\nStephen Ju: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is with Andrew Marok with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Marok: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So with another great quarter in NBA 2K in the fourth quarter and as the pandemic engagement surge starts to level out a bit, and pardon me for mixing my sports metaphors here. But what inning are we in for monetization of the existing NBA player base? And how much of the franchise's growth, comes from audience expansion? Thanks.\nKarl Slatoff: Thanks for the question. We get that question a lot. And it's tough to answer because every time, our perspective seems to change. My answer is, I feel like, we're in the early innings. I'm not going to give you an exact inning. We're certainly not in the seventh inning stretch. And we're not in the first inning. It's somewhere in between. But I do think like, I mentioned before, our analytics capabilities are getting much more sophisticated. And not to mention, we do have -- we have a lot of modes, in our NBA game. And we have different ways for people to engage. And therefore, we have different ways for it to monetize in those modes. And just getting people to play, people more deeply engage in the game and play across those modes, there's a lot of opportunity right there in and of itself. So we're not just stuck to one type of monetization for card packs, et cetera like that. We've got a lot of other opportunities. So that and also the fact that, we've still got a long way to go in terms of mastering our analytics capabilities, makes me believe we're pretty early.\nAndrew Marok: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question is from Mike Hickey with The Benchmark Company. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Hickey: Thanks, Strauss, Karl, Lainie and Nicole thanks for taking my question guys and congratulations on a great quarter. Strauss just curious this maybe sensitive, but wondering on your view on sort of the Epic Apple Live debate on revenue share. And if you think that, this could encourage maybe structural teams into digital stores mobile and console, when you think about revenue share and competition similar to what we've seen on PC?\nStrauss Zelnick: Yeah. I think I alluded to that, in my last remark Mike. So I think we're on the same wavelength. I do believe that, distribution costs will decline. Of course, I can't opine, specifically, on that action, because I don't have any particular insight. However, between regulatory authorities investigations and private concerns clearly take rates are being examined. But at the end of the day, it's the economy that governs. And we are in a broadly competitive distribution environment. And the goal of this organization has always been and remains be, where the consumer is, which means we'll employ, a broad array of distribution platforms including our own direct-to-consumer platform. And what that means overtime is, it's going to be hard to have a take rate for distributors that is economically too high. That leads to an unstable system. And that's what you're seeing now in my opinion. I think this will be resolved relatively soon. And it will be resolved in a favorable way. And I think that take rates will decline meaningfully. And that will of course benefit us. It's not in any of our guidance, but it is in my expectations. Of course, we don't organize the company around my expectations. But you asked my opinion. And so I shared it.\nMike Hickey: Okay. Thanks guys. Good luck.\nOperator: And we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I'll now turn the call over to Chairman and CEO, Strauss Zelnick, for closing remarks.\nStrauss Zelnick: First of all, I want to thank all of our colleagues, all around the world, nearly 7,000 people for these amazing results. Imagine, if you will, the extraordinary work and commitment it has taken to deliver in these difficult times. And our team has just been stellar and has been smiling the whole time, despite the challenges and the privations. And in certain instances, tragedies as well which I know many of you have had also. So thank you, from the bottom of our collective hearts. And at the same time, we're so optimistic going forward. We're in a better place, than we've ever been in before. And we're in a pretty good place now. We're incredibly excited about the upcoming products. We work in an organization, where we love to show up every day. And we're blessed, to be able to do so, with great colleagues all around the world. So thank you, to our colleagues. Thank you, to our shareholders for your support. And thank you all for joining us today.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference. And you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Thanks, Strauss. I'd like to begin by thanking our teams around the world for delivering a record year for our organization. Since joining Take-Two in 2007, I can't remember a year during which we were tested more greatly and performed as exceptionally as we did in this past year. Our colleagues' commitment, professionalism, and talent are among the best in our industry, and I could not be prouder of what we have achieved together. In addition, I want to thank our player communities for engaging with our experiences and making our games part of their lives. I'll now discuss our recent releases. On April 2, 2K and Visual Concepts, once again expanded the breadth and depth of the NBA 2K franchise with the release of NBA 2K21 for Apple Arcade, our first offering for the platform. NBA 2K21 is the most advanced basketball simulation game available on Apple devices, featuring an all-new graphics engine that offers the highest possible resolution, updated rosters and a variety of exciting game modes. NBA 2K21 is currently the most popular game on Apple Arcade. On April 7, 2K and HB Studios released the TravisMathew and PUMA Golf gear update for PGA TOUR 2K21, which keeps players swinging with swag on the cutting edge of modern golf fashion. The TravisMathew Collection includes new polo shirts, hats and shoes, marking the brand's PGA TOUR 2K21 debut, while PUMA Golf introduces an all-new oversized hat and new footwear. On April 8, 2K and Gearbox Software continued to enhance the Borderlands franchise, with the release of the Director's Cut, the sixth add-on for Borderlands 3. 2K and Gearbox will release two additional vault cards that will become available for owners of the Director's Cut before the end of calendar 2021 and all players can look forward to returning in-game events like Revenge of the Cartels. In addition, the teams are continuing to explore cross-play functionality that will enable fans to play Borderlands 3 with their friends across multiple platforms and we expect to have more to share in the coming months. Anticipation is growing for Lionsgate's full-length live-action film based on Borderlands. The film is directed by Eli Roth and will feature some of Hollywood favorite stars including Cate Blanchett, Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Hart, Jack Black and Edgar Ramirez. We believe that the film promises to capture the thrills and distinct personality of the series and has the potential to introduce new audiences to the beloved world of Borderlands. Looking ahead, we are very optimistic about our growth opportunities in fiscal 2022 and beyond. As Strauss mentioned, we have an exciting array of offerings planned for this year and our long-term development pipeline represents the strongest in Take-Two's history. For fiscal 2022, we have 21 titles planned for release, including four immersive core releases for purchase, which include two releases from new franchises and two titles from existing franchises. One new independent title, OlliOlli World from Private Division, which will be available for purchase; 10 free-to-play mobile games, including six titles from new franchises, and four from existing franchises; and six new iterations of previously released titles, which will all be available for purchase. While we are very excited to once again be working with the NFL and NFLPA, our first title under these new partnerships is no longer expected to be released during fiscal year 2022. 2K will have more to share on their plans for our football offerings going forward. I'll now discuss details on our announced offerings for this year. Rockstar Games has massive new updates coming this summer to both Red Dead Online and Grand Theft Auto Online, and will deliver fans' most heavily requested additions in a host of new items, including quality of life updates. On May 25, Red Dead Online will deliver eight new races spanning iconic locations across the game's five states, including Standard, Open, Target and Open Target Races. Later this summer, fans can look forward to a host of new missions for skilled outlaws involving everything from quick holdups to larger high state robberies for big rewards. Grand Theft Auto Online continues to expand and evolve. On May 27, Rockstar Games will release eight new stunt races, which will introduce an array of white-knuckled for racers in an assortment of vehicle classes. Fans of the futuristic Deadline Mode will be happy to have seven new arenas for combat coming soon. Survival mode will also expand to new locations throughout Los Santos and Blaine County. And later this summer, car culture will return to Los Santos in new ways in Grand Theft Auto Online's next major update, offering fans of performance and customization upgrades new opportunities to get together and show off their rides. This includes a new social space for car meets alongside new races and race types, new vehicles to acquire and a series of new vehicle themed multipart robbery missions. Notably, these major summer updates will continue to deliver additional surprises in the weeks and months after launch, including special benefits for players when the enhanced version of Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online arrive on Gen nine consoles this November 11. Rockstar Games will have more details to share about these eagerly anticipated launches in the coming months. This year we will have two sports releases from our popular franchises. 2K and Visual Concepts are once again aiming to raise the bar for excellence with NBA 2K22, the latest offering in our industry-leading basketball simulation series. In addition to making the On-court action even more authentic, fans can look forward to new and fun ways to engage with various game modes. Additionally, WWE 2K22 will mark the rebirth of our popular wrestling series. During the broadcast of WrestleMania 37, 2K and Visual Concepts revealed the very first teaser video for the game, featuring both live action and stunning in-game footage of WWE Superstar Rey Mysterio, a high-flying Lucha Libre legend and one of the most exciting and decorated superstars in WWE history. The teaser also highlighted WWE 2K22's tagline, it hits different, which is reflective of both the new direction of the game, and its supporting marketing campaign. We're very excited about the team's fresh approach to the series. And last week our WWE 2K22 development team at Visual Concepts kicked off a social media campaign presently behind the scenes, sneak peaks of the game and developer diary videos. 2K will continue to unveil details in the coming months. 2K will also introduce two releases from new franchises this year including one from Gearbox. On June 24 Private Division will celebrate the tenth anniversary of the release of Kerbal Space Program. Private Division intends to mark the occasion with a week-long celebration including free content updates and more. This winter Private Division and Roll7 will release OlliOlli World digitally for consoles and PC. OlliOlli World marks a bold new direction for this critically acclaimed skateboarding franchise and is bursting with personality. Players slip and flow through Radlandia, a vibrant world of full color characters as they search for the mystical Skate God on their quest for Nirvana. Radlandia and its dwellers are charming weird and crafted with a unique art style. Players can enjoy the game's deep combo system and everything it has to offer, while pros can really prove their skills and master a vast number of moves with access to millions of unique levels in the game's sandbox mode. In addition players can also compete against similarly skilled rivals around the globe in player leagues. Fiscal 2022 will be a big year for mobile with 10 new free-to-play offerings including new titles from 2K, Social Point and PlayDots. We'll also have six iterations of previous release titles including enhanced versions of Grand Theft Auto V and the stand-alone version of Grand Theft Auto Online for Gen nine consoles available for free three months for PlayStation five players. Both of which will launch in the second half of this calendar year. Looking ahead, we expect to deliver over 40 titles across fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024 which gives us confidence in our ability to reach new record levels of operating results in the next few years. Our current expected pipeline for fiscal 2023 and '24 includes 19 immersive core releases, 7 of which are sports simulation games, 15 of these will be available for purchase, while 4 will be free-to-play. 5 independent titles which will all be available for purchase, 10 free-to-play mobile games, 4 mid-core games which will all be available purchase and 3 of which will be sports oriented and 3 new iterations of previously released titles which will all be available for purchase. It bears noting that these titles are a snapshot of our current development pipeline. It is likely that some of these titles will not be developed through completion or some may be delayed and we will also be adding new titles to our slate. In the coming months you'll start to see our titles come to market and we'll aim to share similar updates going forward when we provide our year-end results. In addition to our title releases we'll also continue to have significant long-term opportunity to increase engagement and recurrent consumer spending. Our focus on enhancing our data analytics is enabling us to deepen our understanding of our player base and how they prefer to interact with our games which is helping us to develop the most desirable products expansions and new content updates. Turning to eSports. The NBA 2K League will kick off its fourth season on May 19 and continue for 16 weeks. The 23 teams will play 28 regular season games with each team beginning the 2021 season playing remotely in its local market. For the first time, the NBA 2K League will be aligned into the Eastern and Western conferences games will be simulcast live on the NBA 2K League's Twitch and YouTube channels and will be available on Dash Radio, ES Revolution, Local in India and Sport1 in Europe. Additionally, the league recently announced a landmark multiyear partnership with Sony Interactive Entertainment that makes the PlayStation V, its official console that will be used by all teams and their 138 players doing all games and events. The partnership marks the first of its kind for PlayStation V with an eSports league and the first console partnership for the NBA 2K League. We remain very excited about the continued success and growth of the NBA 2K League which has the long-term potential to enhance engagement and to be a driver of profits for our company. In closing, we remain incredibly excited about the vast potential for our company to captivate and engage audiences around the world by delivering the very best entertainment experiences where they're broadening the reach of our portfolio through new platforms, business models and distribution channels, pursuing organic and inorganic growth opportunities and expanding into emerging markets, Take-Two is superbly positioned to capitalize on the many positive trends in our industry and to provide continued value and returns for our shareholders over the long term. I'll now turn the call over to Lainie. Obviously we're incredibly pleased with Outer Worlds and everything that it's brought. It was -- I can't say that it was a complete surprise out of the gate, but it was certainly was something pleasant for us and a little bit unexpected. The downloadable content has been really very well received and we think the franchise is in outstanding shape at this point. And we will be participating in the franchise and whatever the future holds for that franchise. So we feel really good about it. And we think that it's still building audience and this game itself has a lot of life left in it. And in the future -- we'll see what the future holds for it. But we do think it's a long-term franchise and it is certainly something that we're pleased with the results. In terms of Private Division, we really couldn't be more pleased with the way Private Division is going. As Strauss said, we've already had three titles that have sold in excess of one million units each, which is unusual for independent releases. We have a lot of titles in process. We've got one coming up this year with OlliOlli World. There are a lot of other deals in the pipeline. We've talked about some of them most of them we have not talked about yet and they're varied. There are different scales, different sizes, different shapes, different kinds of experiences which make makes them very exciting. That team is growing, not only from a creative talent perspective in support of Kerbal Space Program, but also from a marketing and publishing perspective. So we expect the best is yet to come from Private Division and we love how we're positioned right now. And in terms of just, sort of, some examples around what immersive core versus mid-core would be. I'll start with the mid-core. The mid-core will be something like the WWE 2K Battlegrounds would be a good example of a mid-core game. In terms of immersive core that really is a little more varied, but we do look at it as games that have highly engaging gameplay. People who spend hours and hours and hours at it at a time. So these would be examples things like obviously Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption Borderlands, but also things like our strategy games from Firaxis and also of our sports simulations. And in terms of development capacity, we have been investing for years in our development capacity and both from organic hires and also through acquisition. And we fully expect that that will continue into the future. And it is our plan. We have it baked into our plan to bring on more developers. And again we have -- you're right. Labor markets do get -- they do tighten up. These folks are highly sought after. But we have a really strong track record of attracting and retaining the best talent in the industry. And part of that reason is because we provide a creative environment where these folks can flourish. And then we compensate them well in success and we align that conversation with our shareholders. And we think that's a recipe that works really, really well. And people love coming to take to across all of our labels because that culture permeates the entire organization. So it is tough to hire and retain key talent. But that is what we do. And that's the most important strategic advantage I think that we have as a company and that's where we focus. So I'll take the first part. You're right, there are a ton more users in our ecosystem and that's just -- and not only just a number of users, but they're more engaged. So every time somebody is engaging with one of our games, we've got more data points. And the more data points that we have, the more information that we have to know what consumers want, when they want it, what kind of offers are going to make sense for them, when -- to make sure that we give the consumer exactly what they're looking for. So the bigger that database and the stronger analytics capabilities get and we've invested significantly in those kinds of resources not just tech, but also human beings. People who really -- data scientists who know how to analyze this data. And we -- in my opinion, we're just scratching the surface. We're pretty good at it, but I think there's a lot of room for us to get a lot better. And the bigger that database gets and the more information we get and the more we invest, it has just been returning our investment tenfold. So we expect that to continue this year and well into the future. Yeah. As I said in my remarks, we're very happy how NBA is doing on Apple Arcade. It's the most popular game on the service right now. So we can't ask for anything more than that. It's still pretty early ultimately. So is it having a huge impact on selling games across other platforms, hard to tell at this point. Do we think that that certainly is a possibility? I think absolutely because every time you get people exposed to the game through new platforms or platforms where they otherwise may not have exposure to it that's a positive thing from a marketing perspective. So stay tuned on that. Thanks for the question. We get that question a lot. And it's tough to answer because every time, our perspective seems to change. My answer is, I feel like, we're in the early innings. I'm not going to give you an exact inning. We're certainly not in the seventh inning stretch. And we're not in the first inning. It's somewhere in between. But I do think like, I mentioned before, our analytics capabilities are getting much more sophisticated. And not to mention, we do have -- we have a lot of modes, in our NBA game. And we have different ways for people to engage. And therefore, we have different ways for it to monetize in those modes. And just getting people to play, people more deeply engage in the game and play across those modes, there's a lot of opportunity right there in and of itself. So we're not just stuck to one type of monetization for card packs, et cetera like that. We've got a lot of other opportunities. So that and also the fact that, we've still got a long way to go in terms of mastering our analytics capabilities, makes me believe we're pretty early."

            "name": "Lainie Goldstein",
            "content": "Thanks Karl and good afternoon everyone. Today I'll discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 results and then review our financial outlook for the full year and first quarter of fiscal 2022. Please note that additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release. As Strauss mentioned, our strong momentum continued into the fourth quarter and we significantly exceeded our net bookings guidance for the fourth quarter and the year. I'd like to thank our talented colleagues around the world for their passion and dedication which has been inspiring especially given the challenges that COVID-19 has presented us with. Starting with our fourth quarter results. Total net bookings grew 8% to $785 million as compared to our outlook of $602 million to $652 million. These outstanding results marked our highest level of fourth quarter net bookings on record. During the period, recurrent consumer spending grew 17% and accounted for 67% of total net bookings, as compared to our outlook of 5% growth. Our outperformance was primarily due to the incredible performance of NBA 2K. Digitally-delivered net bookings grew 8% and accounted for 92% of the total. This result exceeded our outlook of a 10% decline, due to the outperformance of both recurrent consumer spending and digitally-delivered full game sales. During the fourth quarter, 74% of console game sales were delivered digitally, up from 63% last year. GAAP net revenue grew 10% to $839 million, while cost of goods sold decreased to $280 million, including a reversal of expense of $65 million related to forfeitures of previously granted stock awards. Operating expenses increased by 25% to $304 million, driven by higher marketing, research and development and IT expenses, as well as the addition of Playdots. And, GAAP net income grew 78% to $219 million or $1.88 per share, as compared to $123 million, or $1.07 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Turning to our fiscal 2021 results, total net bookings grew 19% to a new record of $3.55 billion. This exceeded our initial guidance by approximately $1 billion. We experienced exceptional engagement during the shelter-in-place conditions and delivered extraordinary results across many of our franchises, including NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption, Borderlands, Social Point's mobile games, and Sid Meier's Civilization. Recurrent consumer spending grew 48%, establishing a new record, and accounted for 63% of total net bookings. This exceeded our prior outlook of 45% growth. Digitally-delivered net bookings grew 27% to a new record of approximately $3.1 billion, and accounted for 87% of the total. This also exceeded our prior outlook of 20% growth due to better-than expected recurrent consumer spending and digitally-delivered full game sales. During fiscal 2021, 64% of console game sales were delivered digitally, up from 55% last year. Non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow was $920 million, as compared to our previous outlook of over $750 million, and marked a record level for our company. During fiscal 2021, we spent $69 million on capital expenditures. At fiscal year end, our cash and short-term investments balance exceeded $2.7 billion. GAAP net revenue grew 9% to $3.37 billion, while cost of goods sold was flat at $1.5 billion. Operating expenses increased by 8% to $1.2 billion, driven primarily by the addition of Playdots, higher headcount, IT, research and development expense and charitable contributions, partially offset by lower marketing expenses. And, GAAP net income grew 46% to $589 million, or $5.09 per share. Our GAAP net income benefited from a $40.6 million gain on the sale of a long-term investment and a reversal of expense of $70 million related to forfeitures of previously granted stock awards. Today, we gave our initial outlook for fiscal 2022. We -- net bookings to range from $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion, the second-highest level of net bookings in our company's history. This is partly driven by the exciting pipeline of new releases that we have planned for the year, with the majority of our titles coming in the second half of fiscal 2022. Additionally, we expect that engagement trends will be notably higher than they were pre-pandemic; however, as the return to normalcy continues, we expect a moderation of the trends that benefitted our industry over the past year. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, as well as some of our new releases that are yet to be announced. We expect the Net Bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 55% 2K, 35% Rockstar Games, and 10% Private Division, Social Point and Playdots. And, we forecast our geographic net bookings split to be about 60% United States and 40% International. We expect recurrent consumer spending to decline by 15%, as a result of the challenging comparisons from last year. Recurrent consumer spending as a percentage of our business is expected to be approximately 59% versus 63% last year, due to more new releases this year. We project digitally-delivered net bookings to decline by about 8%. As a percentage of our business, digital is projected to represent 87%, which in line with last year. Our forecast assumes that 74% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 64% last year. We expect to generate more than $400 million in non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow, and we plan to deploy approximately $100 million for capital expenditures. The increase in capital expenditures over the prior year is primarily due to continued spending on studio and office build-outs, and IT expense to support our investment in talent. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $3.14 billion to $3.24 billion and cost of goods sold to range from $1.41 billion to $1.46 billion. Our total operating expenses are expected to range from $1.46 billion to $1.48 billion. At the midpoint, this represents a 22% increase over the prior year. As Karl mentioned, we have over 60 titles that we plan to deliver over the next three years and we are making significant investments in key areas, such as marketing, personnel and IT to bring our pipeline to market. Additionally, we will have a full year of expenses for Playdots. While these investments will impact our operating results this year, we are confident that our growing pipeline will enable us to scale our business further and improve our margins in the next few years. And we expect GAAP net income to range from $228 million to $257 million, or $1.95 to $2.20 per share. For management reporting purposes, we expect our tax rate to be 16% throughout fiscal 2022. Now moving on to our guidance for the fiscal first quarter. We project net bookings to range from $625 million to $675 million, as compared to $996 million in the first quarter last year, which was the first full quarter of the COVID-related shelter-in-place conditions when we experienced a strong initial surge in engagement. The largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, NBA 2K21, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online and Borderlands 3. We project recurrent consumer spending to decline by 30%, as we will start to compare against the record levels of engagement that we experienced in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. We also expect digitally delivered net bookings to decline by approximately 30%. Our forecast assumes that 80% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 71% in the same period last year. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $730 million to $780 million and cost of goods sold to range from $277 million to $303 million. Operating expenses are expected to range from $316 million to $326 million. At the midpoint, this represents an 18% increase over last year, driven primarily by higher personnel and stock compensation expenses and the inclusion of Playdots. And GAAP net income is expected to range from $116 million to $129 million, or $1 to $1.10 per share. In closing, fiscal 2021 was a record year for our business and we believe that we can exceed these levels of financial results and establish new record levels of performance in the coming years. Our pipeline is robust and we couldn't be more excited about our new releases for fiscal 2022 and beyond. As we continue to enhance our business by investing in talent, including growing our development headcount and building our infrastructure, we are positioning our company for long-term growth and success, and we expect to deliver sustainable profitable growth for our shareholders. Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Strauss. It's really what I said in my prepared remarks, it's really coming from the operating expense increases, and those are really being driven by our investment in marketing personnel and IT. Specifically about 55% of the increase in the expenses is coming from increases in direct marketing for our titles. So we're really investing in marketing our new titles this year and also marketing for our fiscal 2023 titles as well. So the marketing in Q4 and into next year it's really to support the pipeline of titles that we talked about. It's for our recurrent consumer spending titles and also for our titles going into next year. So we're looking at our head count and the -- a need for our teams to really look at our pipeline in the future. It's become more and more important for us to have the right support around the current titles that are out and the titles -- because it's not just titles that are coming out and releasing they're being supported all throughout their life cycle now. So it's a very different type of marketing than it was in the past where we would just market on release. Now the titles are being marketed all throughout their life cycle. So you'll probably see higher marketing going forward. And when it comes to what I was saying about the 55% of the increase of the OpEx this year was for direct marketing that's because we have a lot of new releases in this year. So when we have new releases, we tend to have big campaigns around the newer releases. So since we have more new releases this year that's why we would have more marketing this year. And our marketing is very efficient around our titles. We also have a lot of marketing around our mobile titles. So we have a big portfolio of mobile titles as well and mobile titles coming out. So that's also been driving our marketing spend as well."

            "name": "Strauss Zelnick",
            "content": "Thanks Nicole. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Our strong fourth quarter performance concluded an exceptional year for our organization. We delivered net bookings of approximately $3.6 billion, which grew nearly 20% from fiscal 2020 and were the highest ever in our company's history. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank all of our colleagues around the world for helping us achieve these results despite such significant unforeseen and prolonged challenges. It's truly a reflection of our collective resilience and singular commitment to excellence. Our thoughts are with those who have been and continue to be affected by COVID-19. We hope that better days and comfort will come to you soon. Throughout the pandemic, our creative teams have delivered consistently superlative entertainment experiences giving players opportunities to have fun in the most difficult of times and stay connected with family and friends through shared experiences. We grew our online communities meaningfully, including new and returning players, which helped drive recurrent consumer spending growth of 48% to reach a record high and represents 63% of our total net bookings for fiscal 2021. During the year, we enhanced our organization for the long-term. We bolstered the depth of our creative teams by hiring more than 700 new developers, including through the acquisition of several talented studios, which will help us expand our capabilities and grow our business. We also broadened our portfolio of offerings capitalized on diverse business models and made significant investments in our operations and infrastructure. Nearly all of our titles outperformed during the fourth quarter, including NBA 2K21, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online and Sid Meier's Civilization VI. The NBA 2K series is known throughout the world for being the most authentic the most realistic and the most engaging basketball simulation experience in our industry. In addition to giving consumers the ability to step onto the court of their favorite NBA players or as themselves, 2K and Visual Concepts have created various game modes that offer interactive experiences and enable players to build deeper social connections. NBA 2K21 was our first offering built from the ground up for Gen 9 platforms. To-date, the title has exceeded our expectations and sold in over 10 million units. During the fourth quarter, net bookings for the series grew 37% and recurrent consumer spending exceeded our expectations significantly growing 32% and 73% in the period and fiscal year respectively. Consumer engagement with NBA 2K remains incredibly strong with more than 2.3 million users playing the game daily. We see a significant opportunity to grow the franchise further as we provide unique and innovative experiences throughout the game. Once again, Rockstar Games' iconic Grand Theft Auto series exceeded our expectations, expanded its audience and set new benchmarks in fiscal 2021. Driven by an array of new free content updates and sustained interest in last holidays Cayo Perico Heist, Grand Theft Auto Online benefited from strong engagement trends during the fourth quarter, including a record number of active players and the second highest quarter of recurrent consumer spending on record. For the full year, participation levels reached an all-time high from both new and returning players and recurrent consumer spending grew 31% achieving a new annual record. Sales of Grand Theft Auto V also surpassed our expectations, and to-date, the title has sold in more than 145 million units worldwide. Red Dead Online exceeded our expectations during the fourth quarter with active players increasing significantly in recurrent consumer spending performing above our plans due in part to the success of the recently released standalone version of the game. Throughout the period Rockstar Games released new content updates for Red Dead Online including brand-new missions for solo players the Outlaw Pass No. 5 and its new rewards and more. Red Dead Redemption 2 continued to perform very well and, to date, has sold-in over 37 million units worldwide. During the fourth quarter, 2K announced their acquisition of HB Studios, the developers of our highly successful golf game, PGA TOUR 2K21, which, to-date, has sold-in more than 2 million units. We are very excited about the growth potential for the PGA TOUR 2K series, especially as 2K has entered into an exclusive, long-term agreement with golf legend and icon, Tiger Woods, to serve as its Executive Director and consultant, which we believe will enhance the series' ongoing innovation and authenticity. During the period, 2K and Firaxis Games released the Vietnam & Kublai Khan and Portugal Packs for Sid Meier's Civilization VI that were the final offerings for the game's incredibly successful New Frontier Pass. Civilization VI's daily active users have grown steadily since the game's release more than five years ago and, to-date, the title has sold in over 11 million units. As a result of the engagement from the Pass, as well as the success of XCOM: Chimera Squad and XCOM 2 on Switch, Firaxis Games had one of its best years ever. We expect this growth to continue, as the studio has several exciting projects in development that will be revealed this year. During the fourth quarter, Private Division released Murder on Eridanos, the final add-on for their highly successful game, The Outer Worlds, which has sold-in more than 3 million units. The add-on will also be coming to Switch later this year. Private Division's 2019 release, Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey, has now sold-in over 1 million units, marking the third title from the label to achieve the million-unit milestone, joining The Outer Worlds and Kerbal Space Program. Providing new and innovative ways for audiences to stay engaged with our titles after their initial launch is a key strategic priority of our organization and represents an important long-term growth and margin opportunity. Our record levels of recurrent consumer spending were largely driven by NBA 2K and Grand Theft Auto Online during the fourth quarter, and were enhanced by the following offerings. Social Point's live games, led by Dragon City and Monster Legends exceeded our expectations. Strong seasonal content and features, as well as increased marketing investments, helped drive net bookings growth of nearly 30% for the period and 44% for the year. The studio is planning to release three new titles during the second half of fiscal 2022. Playdots had a strong fourth quarter, driven by the outstanding performance of Two Dots, which achieved sequential growth over the third quarter. We expect Playdots to be a significant contributor to our results over the long-term and look forward to its new release planned for the Fall. WWE SuperCard also outperformed, growing 24% during the fourth quarter and 28% during the year. The title has now been downloaded more than 23 million times and remains 2K's highest-grossing mobile title. NBA 2K Online in China grew 6% and 9% during the fourth quarter and year, respectively, and remains a significant contributor to our results. The title is the number one PC online sports game in China with more than 52 million registered users. Turning to our outlook, we believe that the pandemic initiated a transformational shift in entertainment consumption, revealing the possibilities of interactive entertainment to a much broader market, with interactive entertainment becoming the number one entertainment vertical. We anticipate that the overall addressable market for our industry will be notably larger going forward than it was pre-pandemic. However, as the world returns to a new normal, we expect a moderation of the trends that benefitted our industry over the past year. We currently expect our fiscal 2022 net bookings to range from $3.2 to $3.3 billion, marking the second year in a row with net bookings in excess of $3 billion. We expect to achieve sequential growth in fiscal 2023, and over the next few years, we believe that we will establish new record levels of operating results, even above the spectacular performance we delivered this past year. Lainie will share more details about our outlook. As Karl will discuss in greater detail, in fiscal 2022, we plan to deliver an exciting array of offerings, including four immersive core releases from proven and new franchises. With the strongest pipeline in our company's history, including many new releases planned for fiscal 2023 and 2024, we are highly optimistic about our growth trajectory and we will be making significant investments this year to enhance our enterprise in key areas such as creative talent, IT, and other infrastructure. In closing, we remain confident in our proven strategy and talented teams around the world. As we continue to grow our business, we believe that Take-Two is exceedingly well-positioned to deliver long-term growth for our shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Karl. Thank you, Lainie. We will now take your questions. Operator? Thanks for your questions. You're right. There's an awful lot of interesting things going on in the world of user-generated content and there have been for some time. And we're open-minded and we want to support the community. At the same time, it's terribly important that we and others protect our intellectual property. So that's the rub. The rub is to find a way to engage consumers on the one hand and enable them to express their interest and even their creative desires in the context of our properties. And there are numerous ways to go about that. And I believe we will explore many of those ways, again, in the context of protecting our intellectual property. With regards to Grand Theft Auto, it may shock you to learn that I'm probably not going to comment much on content to come from Rockstar Games. We're so grateful for the extraordinary results that we've had with all Rockstar titles. And in fact, all titles coming from throughout the organization. Grand Theft Auto Online set another record past fiscal year. We sold in over 145 million. So we're very optimistic about what there is to come, including more content. And stay tuned, because Rockstar Games will be talking more about that in the future. We haven't announced anything about a changed PC version. So thanks for your three questions. In terms of how we're doing despite the pandemic, look the team has just performed so well. We were very fortunate. Our IT group had us fully prepared for a disaster and we could never predict the pandemic, but a week after we had to start working from home, we were all set up remotely and we were highly productive and we stayed highly productive ever since. We had virtually no slippage. The only title that actually moved as a result of the pandemic was Kerbal Space Program 2 which moved out of this fiscal year and we're super excited about that title and it will be coming. The rest of our production stayed on target and the quality has been amazing as you've seen in our results. We are highly confident in our pipeline going forward. As Karl said though the price that we pay for being as transparent about our future pipeline is that certain things will change. We hope that certain things will change to the good, certain things may also disappoint us. At this point in time, we feel very good about the way our production is unfolding and we don't see any concerns on the horizon. With regard to M&A our strategy remains the same. We have a very strong balance sheet. We have the ability to do everything from modest add-on acquisitions. For example, we acquired HB Studios. Two more substantial acquisitions such as the acquisition of Playdots last calendar year, and prior to that the acquisition of Social Point. There's no secret in that we wish to bulk up our mobile offerings. We're certainly trying to do that organically. We have many titles coming from mobile from Social Point and Playdots and 2K. And at the same time, we're open-minded with regard to acquisitions. Our lens is pretty disciplined. And the result of that disciplined lens is that in 14-years we haven't had one failed acquisition. I'm sure we've also missed some opportunities by being overly disciplined. But on balance it's worked out well for us. Our capital is used for three purposes; returning capital to our shareholders, which we've aggressively done over many years although opportunistically supporting organic growth which is our story around here and allowing us to pursue inorganic growth opportunities on a selective and disciplined basis. And I think that will continue to be the case. Finally with regard to console shortages there's no doubt that supply chains were disrupted in the pandemic. They still remain disruptive. There is a chip shortage. But it's, sort of, a good news bad news thing. The bad news I suppose is that you can't get a console for lower money. The good news is that people really want these new consoles. We had a limited selection of releases for Next Gen, NBA 2K21, which is built from the ground up for Next Gen and Borderlands 3. We have obviously many more titles coming in the future. We think the supply shortages will be resolved and consumers would be able to buy their dream console. So overtime, we're not worried about it and it didn't really hurt us short term either. Yes, unfortunately to answer the question implies some information that we haven't provided and don't expect to provide any time soon. That said, we're gratified by exactly what you talked about which is how popular Grand Theft Auto is on Twitch. We think the Twitch platform is amazing and it's a reflection of the popularity of the title. And Rockstar has said they'll continue to support Grand Theft Online with more content to come. Yes. Thank you for your question. There is more content coming for Grand Theft Auto Online. And at the same time as we have said in the past, we do expect recurrent consumer spending to moderate in the year. And we'll see how that unfolds. Title has been around for a very long time. And at some time generally speaking, there is moderation. We've been so fortunate to have had another record year this past year, but it was an awfully unusual year. We have work going on throughout the organization. Obviously, Social Point and PlayDots are dedicated to mobile experiences both mid-core and casual. We have some mobile titles at 2K as well. In fact, one of our biggest titles is their WWE SuperCard and we have ongoing development throughout, some of which is announced, some of which is not yet. We're going to create bigger experiences by encouraging our creative folks as always to pursue their passions and to always think of that thing that no one thought of before, which is why our strategy is to be the most creative, the most innovative and the most efficient company in the entertainment business. I'm always allergic to buzzwords. The buzzword of virtual reality didn't get this industry very far. AR has not really improved matters, either 3D hasn't really done much for us. What moves the dial in our business is amazing creativity, great characters, great stories, great graphics, great gameplay, the ability to enjoy those experiences with other people all around the world. That's what really matters. I think what the metaverse implies is what we already do with Grand Theft Auto Online and with what Red Dead Online what we do with NBA 2K, and what we aim to do with some upcoming titles an opportunity to exist in that fictional world and express yourself in ways that are challenging, fun, competitive and new and find ourselves in places doing things that we can't really do usually in the real world. I think that's what it means. I think when you get into conversations around -- are people going to do conference calls in titles? Well, the answer is they can now. But who -- we're not -- like we could, I guess do this conference call inside one of our titles, but it's a bit more efficient to do it this way. So the problem I have is that if you take metaverse SPAC and cryptocurrency put them all together in five years will any of this matter? I'm not sure it will. I think it's a really excellent point, and I think you're right. There is a bit more flexibility when you can move quickly and you don't have to worry about stock that you shipped in or price protection for example, which can be costly. Undoubtedly we can move more -- with more agility in terms of promotions, so I think there's a benefit. But of course that benefit is swamped by the simple benefit that our margins are much higher with regard to digital distribution and physical. That's the big difference. And I think the other difference, which we haven't really talked about, but it was obviously something that's going on in the market right now is we expect that the cost of distribution will decline for any number of reasons and that also will go directly to the bottom line. Yeah. I think I alluded to that, in my last remark Mike. So I think we're on the same wavelength. I do believe that, distribution costs will decline. Of course, I can't opine, specifically, on that action, because I don't have any particular insight. However, between regulatory authorities investigations and private concerns clearly take rates are being examined. But at the end of the day, it's the economy that governs. And we are in a broadly competitive distribution environment. And the goal of this organization has always been and remains be, where the consumer is, which means we'll employ, a broad array of distribution platforms including our own direct-to-consumer platform. And what that means overtime is, it's going to be hard to have a take rate for distributors that is economically too high. That leads to an unstable system. And that's what you're seeing now in my opinion. I think this will be resolved relatively soon. And it will be resolved in a favorable way. And I think that take rates will decline meaningfully. And that will of course benefit us. It's not in any of our guidance, but it is in my expectations. Of course, we don't organize the company around my expectations. But you asked my opinion. And so I shared it. First of all, I want to thank all of our colleagues, all around the world, nearly 7,000 people for these amazing results. Imagine, if you will, the extraordinary work and commitment it has taken to deliver in these difficult times. And our team has just been stellar and has been smiling the whole time, despite the challenges and the privations. And in certain instances, tragedies as well which I know many of you have had also. So thank you, from the bottom of our collective hearts. And at the same time, we're so optimistic going forward. We're in a better place, than we've ever been in before. And we're in a pretty good place now. We're incredibly excited about the upcoming products. We work in an organization, where we love to show up every day. And we're blessed, to be able to do so, with great colleagues all around the world. So thank you, to our colleagues. Thank you, to our shareholders for your support. And thank you all for joining us today."

On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to acknowledge those who have been and continue to be affected by the global pandemic. No words can bring comfort to those who have suffered. However, we do remain hopeful that better days lie ahead and that we all may return to an enjoy our lives as we once did. We remain immensely grateful to frontline workers who are caring selflessly for those in need ensuring the vaccines are being delivered and administered and helping the world navigate further in these troubling times. Turning to Take-Two, due to an incredibly strong holiday season coupled with our ability to provide consistently the highest quality entertainment experiences, especially as many individuals continued to shelter home Take-Two delivered operating results that significantly exceeded our expectations. The outperformance of Grand Theft Auto Online, Grand Theft Auto V, NBA 2K, the Mafia Definitive Editions and Mafia Trilogy and Red Dead Redemption 2 reflects our development team\u2019s boundless passion, creativity and commitment to captivate and engage audiences. In the history of the entertainment industry, there's perhaps no experience that's more loved, more expansive, more critically acclaimed and more successful than Rockstar Games Grand Theft Auto. Grand Theft Auto V remains one of the most iconic titles ever released and continues to exceed our expectations, having sold in over 140 million units. In fact, in calendar 2020, more copies of Grand Theft Auto V were sold than in any other year except for 2013 when it first launched on PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. In addition, recurrent consumer spending on Grand Theft Auto Online outperformed our third quarter forecast and grew 28% year-over-year. In December, Rockstar Games released Grand Theft Auto Online\u2019s biggest update to-date, The Cayo Perico Heist, featuring a radical new approach to Heist design, as well as a new tropical island to explore The Cayo Perico Heist is an all new Grand Theft Auto Online adventure in which players can choose to take on a Heist with a crew of up to four or for the first time plan, prepare and execute the daring Island Heist all on their own. Notably, more than 50% of those playing The Cayo Perico Heist are engaging with this as a new single player experience. Cayo Perico Heist also introduces an array of exciting new weapons and vehicles, a new virtual nightclub and social space for players to get together and experience the world's best DJs plus a host of updates across the entire world. In addition, overall engagement with Grand Theft Auto Online continues to set new benchmarks as the title had more players in every month and for the entirety of calendar 2020 than in any other year since its launch. 2020 also marked Grand Theft Auto Online highest participation rate ever by both new players and reactivated players who returned to experience Rockstar Games array of new content offerings. Grand Theft Auto Online is expected to achieve a new net bookings record in fiscal 2021. Red Dead Redemption 2 also outperformed and to-date has sold in over 36 million units worldwide. In December, Rockstar Games released a standalone version of Red Dead Online on PlayStation 4, Xbox 1 and PC that for the first time allows new players who do not already own Red Dead Redemption 2 to experience everything Red Dead Online has to offer, including access to all future content updates. Players also have the option to unlock Red Dead Redemption 2 story mode via an array via an additional purchase. In addition, during the quarter, Rockstar Games released an array of content updates for Red Dead Online including new legendary animals and sightings missions for the naturalist role action pack new missions for the Bounty Hunter Role with the addition of the prestigious Bounty Hunter license, plus Outlaw Pass No. 4 and an assortment of new clothing, weapons enhancements and more. As a result of these offerings, engagement with Red Dead Online reached new heights and there were more players including more new players in the month of December than in any other month since its beta launch in 2018. In addition, Red Dead Online grew its audience and had more overall players in calendar 2020 than 2019. Rockstar Games will continue to support both Red Dead Online and Grand Theft Auto Online with more content updates to our calendar 2021 to keep new and returning players excited and engaged. Another beloved franchise that's both a perennial favorite among consumers and an integral contributor to our ongoing success is NBA 2K from 2K and Visual Concepts. Renowned for being our industry's leading basketball simulation series each year NBA 2K continues to reinvent how people experience basketball and its rich culture and influence. NBA 2K21 once again raised the bar for the series and was our first offering that was built from the ground up for next generation consoles. The title boasts groundbreaking technological advancements, new modes and many exclusive robust features. To-date, NBA 2K21 has exceeded our expectations and is sold in over 8 million units across all platforms. In addition, during the third quarter net bookings for the NBA 2K series grew 48% and recurrent consumer spending significantly exceeded our expectations growing 67%. Furthermore, consumer engagement with NBA 2K remains incredibly strong across daily active users, my career users and my team users. Moreover, NBA 2K21 users have been more deeply engaged with the game with average games played per user up 14% as compared to NBA 2K20 in the same period. During the quarter 2K expanded further the breadth of its NBA 2K offerings with the releases of NBA\u2019s SuperCard and NBA 2K Mobile Season 3 for iOS and Android devices. During the third quarter, 2K bolstered our initial offerings for PlayStation 5 and Xbox series X with our beloved shooter looter titled Borderlands 3. The title was fully optimized for next generation consoles, making mayhem bigger and bolder than ever before. All players who own or purchase the game of prior consoles will be able to download the new platform upgrade within the same console family for free. This free upgrade will add several exclusive features including 4K resolution at 60 frames per second in single player and online co-op plus support for three and four players split screen co-op. Borderlands 3 is launched for next generation platforms it was well received and we've seen the games user base grow steadily. 2K is supporting the title within game events and new content including the release of the Designer\u2019s Cut, which is the first of two offerings as part of the Season Pass 2 for all versions of the game. Our third quarter results were also enhanced by a variety of other offerings led by the Mafia Definitive Editions and Mafia Trilogy, the WWE series, Sid Meier\u2019s Civilization VI and PGA TOUR 2K21. Driving engagement with our titles after initial launch remains among our most important long-term growth and margin opportunities and is a key strategic priority of our organization. We now support virtually all our new releases with innovative offerings to achieve this goal. That said, we're highly mindful that first and foremost, we're an entertainment company and we're in the service of our audience. We strive to give consumers more of what they love and the ability to stay captivated and engaged within their favorite experiences and passionate communities. To that end, during the third quarter, we released an array of free and paid add-on content for our popular hit releases, including Kerbal Space Program PGA TOUR 2K21, Sid Meier\u2019s Civilization VI and WWE 2K Battlegrounds. During the third quarter recurrent consumer spending exceeded our expectations growing 30% which was double our original outlook and accounted for 58% of net bookings. In addition to NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Red Dead Online the recurrent consumer spending was enhanced by the following offerings. Social Point\u2019s live games including Dragon City, Monster Legends, World Life, World Chef and Tasty Town outperformed during the third quarter and exceeded our expectations. Live games delivered new fresh content events and experiences to boost engagement and enhance players\u2019 enjoyment and net bookings grew 39%. The studio continues to invest in its broad and innovative pipeline of new games planned for launch in the coming years. Playdots completed the rollout of their biggest feature update of the year for their popular Two Dots title including competitive leaderboards. This update played a key role in driving average revenue per daily active user up 12% as compared with the second quarter of fiscal \u201821. Two Dots is now experiencing its highest player conversion rate ever. As a result of these new and expanded live ops features, which continue to perform very well. We expect Playdots to be a significant contributor to our results and expect growth over the long-term. WWE SuperCard also outperformed during the third quarter growing 16%. During the period 2K launch Season 7 of this popular free-to-play sports entertainment mobile game. The title has now been downloaded more than 22 million times and remains 2K\u2019s highest grossing mobile title. And NBA 2K Online in China grew 49% and remains a significant contributor to our results. The title is the number one PC online sports game in China with more than 51 million registered users. Add-on content grew [8%] and outperformed expectations led by offerings for the Borderlands series and Sid Meier\u2019s Civilization VI. As a result of our better than expected third quarter performance and increased forecasts for the remainder of the year, we're once again raising our outlook for fiscal year 2021. And we expect to achieve record net bookings of $3.37 billion to $3.42 billion. In closing, Take-Two is exceedingly well positioned to capitalize further on the positive trends of our industry to pursue our core mission to become the most innovative, creative and efficient entertainment company in the world and to deliver growth and returns for our shareholders over the long-term. I'll now turn the call over to Karl.\nKarl Slatoff: Thanks, Strauss. I'd like to begin by recognizing the ongoing work of our teams around the world and continue to deliver incredible results that are a testament to this unwavering commitment to quality, our deeply rooted culture of collaboration and the singular drive to achieve our goals. Our unique ability to captivate and engage audiences has never been more evident nor more important than in these challenging times. And we remain immensely grateful to our player communities for making our games part of their lives. I\u2019ll now discuss our recent and upcoming releases. On January 27, 2K released the fourth roster update for WWE 2K Battlegrounds, which adds to the games outrageous in and out of the ring action. The update, which features many popular superstars and legends including China, Mark Henry, Christian and more. On Wednesday 2K will release the fifth update that will feature even more fan favorites and we will share details shortly. On January 28, 2K and Firaxis Games released the Vietnam & Kublai Khan Pack for Sid Meier's Civilization VI as part of the new frontier paths for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and PC. Each pack in the past features new civilizations and leaders and is also available for individual purchase. The Final Frontier Pass pack will be released next month and 2K will have more to share about that in the coming weeks. In addition, last week, private division launched their beloved space simulation Kerbal Space Program on Tencent's WeGame platform in China. We are very pleased to build upon our successful partnership with Tencent and believe that releasing Kerbal Space Program on WeGame represents a great opportunity to expand the global community and bolster our offerings in China. On February 10, Private Division and Obsidian Entertainment will release The Outer Worlds: Peril on Gorgon, the first narrative-led expansion for the critically acclaimed darkly humorous sci-fi RPG for the Nintendo Switch. The expansion was released previously for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC and it's available individually or at a discount as part of The Outer Worlds Expansion Pass, which will also include the Outer Worlds Murder on Eridanos, the second expansion set to launch on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC this fiscal year and on Nintendo Switch in calendar 2021. This spring 3K will release the Director's Cut the new add-on content for Season Pass 2 for Borderlands 3 that will be available for all released versions of the game. The Director's Cut add-on will include new missions and game content and behind the scenes extras. On behalf of our team, I would like to congratulate Gearbox Software on their recently announced merger with Embracer. This marks an exciting new chapter in the studio's history. And we look forward to continuing our successful partnership with Gearbox, including the long-term publishing relationship for the Borderlands franchise going forward and some unannounced projects that will be revealed over time. Throughout the year, Rockstar Games will continue to support both Grand Theft Auto Online and Red Dead online with more content updates to keep new and returning players excited and engaged. In addition, during the second half of calendar 2021, Rockstar Games will bring the blockbuster hit Grand Theft Auto V to the latest generation of consoles.

There will also be a new standalone version of Grand Theft Auto Online coming in the second half of calendar 2021 which will be available for free exclusively on PlayStation 5 during the first three months. Rockstar Games will share more details on the new versions of Grand Theft Auto V in the months ahead. Turning to eSports, the NBA 2K league is gearing up for its fourth season that will take place later this year. After a series of Pro Game tournament and they first of its kind league combined during the fall, the league is currently prepping for this year's upcoming player draft. As part of the league's continued commitment to identifying the best players in the world this offseason, the league is hosting a series of online qualifying events for international players and will award draft eligibility to top performers from each event. In addition, I'm pleased to share that for the second consecutive year, the NBA 2K league was given top honors at the Tempus awards as part of the Annual eSports Business Summit. I'd like to congratulate League President Brendan Donohue and his team on these honors. We remain very excited about the continued success and growth of the NBA 2K league which has the long-term potential to enhance engagement to be a driver of profits for a company. Looking ahead, our organization is currently undertaking numerous initiatives that we believe will add scale to our business and drive continued success. As an entertainment company, our Life World is our world renowned creative talent and portfolio of owned intellectual property. With nearly 4,900 colleagues around the world in our development studios that are home to some of the most commercially and critically successful brands in our industry. We are significantly expanding the breadth and depth of our offerings, and currently have the largest most diverse long-term product pipeline in our history. While we are excited by the potential of these future releases, we are still pursuing our goal of creating a more consistent release schedule and increasing our development capacity. To that end, we continually explore both organic and inorganic opportunities and maintain a highly disciplined approach to ensure that our investments will be accretive to our shareholders and consistent with our strategy. In addition, we have always maintained a willingness to explore and experiment with new markets and business models that can both expand the reach of our content and broaden the scope of our audience. We are investing prudently to enhance our global infrastructure and resources that support our creative endeavors, including data analytics and endgame engagement with players. Through all these efforts, we believe that Take-Two is poised to generate growth and margin expansion over the long-term. I'll now turn the call over Lainie.\nLainie Goldstein: Thanks, Karl. And good afternoon, everyone. Today I\u2019ll discuss our third quarter results and then review our financial outlook for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021. Please note that additional details regarding our actual results and outlets are contained in our press release. Net bookings were $814 million this results exceeded our outlook of $675 million to $725 million, driven primarily by the outperformance of Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, the Mafia Definitive Edition and Mafia Trilogy, NBA 2K and Red Dead Redemption 2. Digitally delivered net bookings declined by 4% as compared to our outlook of a 15% decline and accounted for 82% of the total. This has also exceeded our outlook primarily due to the outperformance of recurrent consumer spending. Our third quarter results last year benefited from the launches of Red Dead Redemption 2 on PC and the Outer World. During the third quarter 56% of sales of console games were delivered digitally up from 44% last year. Recurrent consumer spending grew 30% as compared to our outlook of 5% growth and accounted for 58% of total net bookings. This growth was driven primarily by Grand Theft Auto Online and NBA 2K. GAAP net revenue was $861 million and cost of goods sold was $346 million. Operating expenses increased by 7% to $339 million due primarily to the addition of Playdots, higher personnel costs and IT expenses partially offset by lower marketing expenses. And GAAP net income grew 11% to $182 million or $1.57 per share as compared to $164 million or $1.43 per share in the third quarter last year. Our GAAP net income benefited from $40.6 million of realized and unrealized gains on a long-term investment. We ended the quarter with $2.42 billion of cash into our term investments. Not Included in this balance is the cash portion of our offer to acquire Codemasters which was included in restricted cash. As this amount not been considered still restricted as of December 31, our cash and short-term investments for this quarter end would have been $2.7 billion. As of January 13, 2021, the offer lapsed and the cash was no longer restricted. Now to our guidance, starting with the fiscal fourth quarter, we projected net bookings to range from $602 million to $652 million compared to $729 million in the fourth quarter last year. Last year's fourth quarter benefited from the recognition of higher license fees from Digital Partners to provide free downloads of certain games on their platform and from the launch of Borderlands 3 and [it\u2019s team] this decline is also due to the initial surge in digital downloads at the onset of shelter at home orders in March 2020. We expect digitally delivered net bookings to be down approximately 10%. Digital is projected to represent 93% of total net bookings which is in line with last year. Forecast assumes that 73% of console game sales will be delivered digitally up from 63% last year. The current consumer spending to be up approximately 5% due to continued engagement in our titles. Virtual currency is driving this increase and is partially offset by lower add-on content due to last year launch of the [indiscernible] for Borderlands 3. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K21, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Social points mobile games, Two Dots, Borderlands 3 and Sid Meier's Civilization VI. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $702 million to $752 million and cost of goods sold to range from $267 million to $293 million. Operating expenses are expected to range from $316 million to $326 million. As at the midpoint this represents a 32% increase over last year, driven primarily by higher marketing and research and development expenses and the addition of Playdots. And GAAP net income is expected to range from $102 million to $113 million or $0.88 to $0.98 per share. For management reporting purposes, we expect our tax rate to be 16% throughout fiscal 2021. We are again increasing our full year outlook which now includes record net bookings and operating results. This will be the fifth consecutive year that these two metrics have grown. Our net bookings outlook range is now $3.37 billion to $3.42 billion, up from our previous guidance of $3.15 billion to $3.25 billion and original guidance of $2.55 billion to $2.65 billion. This is being driven by our third quarter outperformance along with an updated forecast for the fourth quarter, which has improved primarily due to higher recurrent consumer spending from Grand Theft Auto Online and NBA 2K as well as strong performance from Grand Theft Auto V and Red Dead Redemption 2. We expect growth from the prior year from NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V and Social Point\u2019s mobile games to be offset primarily by lower results from Borderlands 3. The largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Social Point\u2019s mobile games, Borderlands 3 Sid Meier\u2019s Civilization VI, the Mafia Definitive Edition and Mafia Trilogy and PGA TOUR 2K21. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 55% 2K, 35% Rockstar Games and 10% Private Division, Social Point and Playdots. And we forecast our geographic net bookings split to be about 60% United States and 40% International. We now project digitally delivered net bookings to increase by approximately 20% as compared to our prior outlook of 15% growth. As a percentage of our business digital projected to represent 87% of net bookings from 82% last year. A forecast assumes that 63% of console game sales will be delivered digitally up from 55% last year. We now expect recurrent consumer spending to grow by approximately 45% as compared to our prior outlook of 30% growth and represent approximately 64% of net bookings as compared to 51% last year. Growth is being driven primarily by NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online, the Addition of Playdots and Social Point\u2019s mobile games. We are increasing our non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow outlet to more than $750 million up from our prior outlets of more than $650 million. We've planned to deploy approximately $75 million for capital expenditures. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $3.24 billion to $3.29 billion and cost of goods sold to range from $1.52 billion to $1.55 billion. Total operating expenses are expected to range from $1.22 billion to $1.23 billion. The midpoint this represents a 9% increase over the prior year driven by the addition to Playdots higher headcount, IT, research and development expense and charitable contributions, partially offset by lower marketing expenses. And we expect GAAP net income to range from $472 million to $484 million or $4.08 to $4.18 per share. In closing, we are very pleased with the ongoing momentum that we have experienced so far in fiscal 2021, including our expectations to deliver both record net bookings and operating results for the full year. We remain extremely confident in our long-term growth trajectory and our ability to deliver shareholder value driven by our key competitive advantages, our incredible portfolio of creative assets, our strong fundamentals and healthy balance sheet and of course our industry leading talent. Thank you. I'll now turn the call back this Strauss.\nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for their hard work, commitment to excellence and for delivering another outstanding quarter. To our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued support. We'll now take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] One moment please while we pull for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from Mario Lu with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nMario Lu: Great, thanks for taking the question. So I have one high level strategy M&A question and the second one on GTA. So the first one, you guys mentioned, more copies of GTA 5 sold in 2020 than in any year since launch. And then similarly, Red Dead Online saw more players in December since launch. So it seems like you guys are benefiting well on the trend that gamers are gravitating towards the largest gaming franchises. So that being said, curious to hear what your overall view is on growing your core franchises, and potentially expanding them into new platforms and business models versus expanding your portfolio with new IP either organically or through M&A? And I have the follow up.\nStrauss Zelnick: Great, thanks, Mario, it's sort of all of the above. So it's exciting that we have these extraordinary franchises that keep captivating and engaging consumers many years after launch. And the reason that that's occurring is first of all the initial quality, which is unmatched in our business. And second, because our labels, both Rockstar Games and 2K continue to deliver content on an ongoing basis that further causes captivation and engagement. And if we keep doing that, then we'll continue we think to have similar results. I think you're right that consumers get really comfortable within excited by specific franchises. And if you keep delivering great content, they will maintain their involvement on an ongoing basis, we're seeing that in all forms of the entertainment business. At the same time, we always have to create new titles both new iterations of existing beloved franchises, and new intellectual property. And if we don't do that, then we're burning the furniture. So to that end, in the next five years, we expect to bring 93 new releases to market which is more than double what our development capacity was just a few years ago. So we're both excited by the continued growing engagement in our existing entities as well as what the future can bring with new releases.\nMario Lu: Great. And then the second question on GTA Online, you guys mentioned, over half of your players did the recent high solo. So I'm personally surprised that number since more and more players are playing games as a means of social connection. So how did that percentage, compare versus your internal expectations? And does that change how you do single player opportunity, even in an existing online environment like GTA Online?\nStrauss Zelnick: Well, no, this wasn't coincidental. I mean, the folks at Rockstar Games intended to create a powerful single player experience a story driven experience. And Rockstar has always been known for great stories and great single player experiences and then developed in addition, a massive multiplayer opportunity over the past years. And I think it's a reminder not that we needed one, the Rockstar Games can do both of those things at the highest possible level of execution in our business. There was a, I think there was an argument just a couple years ago, not around here, not in this shop. But in some of our competitors offices, that single player is dead, that it's all about multiplayer. We didn't believe that I said specifically and publicly that we didn't believe that, our labels don't believe that. And we deliver an array of experiences that range from hyper casual mobile, to the most complex, the most robust, single player and multiplayer experiences. And we intend to continue doing that.\nMario Lu: That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Ng: Great. Thank you very much for the question. I was hoping you could talk about how the success of GTA 5 units this year, as well as any learnings from the standalone Red Dead Online experience, informs your view about what GTA Enhanced Edition and the standalone GTA Online should look like or will look like next year and perhaps how it should perform? Thanks.\nStrauss Zelnick: Well, I really appreciate the sentiment behind the question. But I sort of put it in the category of how high is up? We don't tend to speculate and we haven't offered any initial guidance for next fiscal year either. So we'll sharpen our pencil in the coming months and of course we will create initial guidance and that will reflect partially that performance. But in general, if history is any guide, it will be very successful indeed. And I would -- that wouldn't surprise me.\nMike Ng: Great. Thanks, I can certainly appreciate that. And just as another question, can you talk a little bit about the Music Locker experience within GTA Online? Obviously, it's -- it feels like it's someone's unique? Is there an opportunity for Rockstar 2K to incorporate even more use for lack of better words, real world elements or real world partners into virtual worlds like GTA Online? Thanks.\nKarl Slatoff: Hi, it\u2019s Karl speaking. Yes, obviously the Music Locker experience is very unique. It's a terrific application and then in GTA. Music has always been a really, really important part of the Grand Theft Auto franchise and it will continue to be; it's always been part of the culture of the Grand Theft Auto franchise, and people explore it and enjoy the found new music through the franchise over-and-over again, I don't want to speculate about what's in Rockstars plans as it relates to music, but rest assured music is always has always been and will always be a large part of what GTA is all about.\nMike Ng: Great. Thanks, Karl. Thanks, Strauss.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nColin Sebastian: Great. Good afternoon, everyone. Two questions from me. First-off, as you look back at the pricing strategy for NBA over the holidays, is it safe to say you feel that that was the right strategy and I guess does it set a new bar for AAA frontline content on next-gen platforms? And then secondly, bigger picture, just given the ongoing industry consolidation Strauss and the interest you've shown in participating activity are you seeing still compelling opportunities out there in the market even as competition for deals seems pretty intense and valuations look like they're also on the rise, any commentary there will be helpful? Thanks.\nStrauss Zelnick: Yes, in terms of frontline pricing for NBA 2K21, I think that worked out very much as expected. And as planned, it's in a premium offering at the highest possible level, the title was built from the ground up for next-gen, so first title here that has been created that way. And the acceptance by consumers has been nothing short of extraordinary, the title sold in over 8 million units. Now, we haven't talked about pricing on other titles. So it would be premature to discuss that we'll talk about that and title-by-title basis going forward. In terms of consolidation, you've seen a lot of deals out there, most recently Embracer is, is merging with Gearbox, a company near and dear to our heart and we're grateful that we'll still be in business with Gearbox and they'll still be working with us on Borderlands and on other titles. We acquired Playdots just a few months ago and we're excited about how that deals gone. We lost the Codemasters deal to our friends out west that was disappointing but reflects our discipline in such matters. So there is an awful lot going on, I tend to agree Colin that pricing can be pretty heavy. And we have a stated strategy and a disciplined approach. It served us well. We have yet to make an acquisition that that hasn't worked out. And we're looking for great teams, great intellectual property and for an arrangement that would be accretive to shareholder value. And we will -- we'll look for that and at times aggressively. But, we have a sort of firm -- we have a firm grasp on hand calculator in one hand and on our approach strategy and tactics in the other.\nColin Sebastian: All right, thanks, Strauss.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Creutz with Cowen & Co. Please proceed with your question.\nDoug Creutz: Hey, thanks. You've always been known for Take-Two\u2019s always been known for putting out some of the deepest and most complex games in the market. And there's been a debate, I think, emerging in the industry about whether the current pace of AAA game development and sustainable both, I think for getting games out the door, and then the sense that life services are becoming more and more of an arms race in terms of who can put the most content out the quickest. There was a competing game that came out recently that was highly anticipated where I think it was a clear case of that studios reach exceeding their grasp, what have you been doing? And what are you doing sort of operationally, structurally, to make sure that your ability to keep raising the bar and your entertainment experiences doesn't run afoul of some of these issues? Thanks.\nStrauss Zelnick: Well, first of all you never want to sit back and just say, we've always been able to do it's totally fine. It'll be fine going forward. We're always looking over our shoulders. We're always trying to figure out what we can do better. We're, I think the most self critical group I've ever run into. How do we maintain our commitment to quality by making sure that our creative teams pursue what they're passionate is about, and don't pursue something they're not passionate about and by maintaining operational and financial discipline at the same time. And the effect of that is we can have long development cycles. And we've been criticized for that. But I think the case that you're alluding to reflects the fact that you're always better served to wait for perfection if you can create perfection. And all of our labels are seeking perfection. And we don't always succeed, sometimes we fall short. But that's the goal. And if anything in these times cause us to sharpen our minds further and sharpen our discipline further and try harder. So yes right and it's great that Rockstar Games continues to put out add-on content and additional content for Grand Theft Auto Online and for Red Dead Online. But they've put out material that they really believe in that they're passionate about and that is of the highest possible quality. And that means we're not on a weekly cadence and we're not going to be in that means we don't necessarily know the exact release date. But what we do know is that we will wait for it to be as close to perfect as anything can be. And that's true 2K. That's true, it's Social Point and that's true a Private Division. And that's an unwavering commitment. And it's part of our strategy. And it comes from the top of the company. And we are prepared to accept the results when we fall short in terms of timing or when we sometimes spend a little more than we would like because it always pays-off.\nDoug Creutz: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Nowak: Thanks for taking my question. I just -- Strauss wanted to dig a little more into the 93 pipeline number you mentioned earlier tonight again. I think it's very similar to what you guys said last year. So I guess the question is, is this the same 93 titles we had a year ago or some being shutdown and you have new ones in there? And then just the way that we kind of better understand, how do we think about breaking that apart? Anyway, you'd like to between categories, between mobile, between AAA, between more mid-tier games just how should we think about what within this 93 titles?\nKarl Slatoff: Hey, Brain, it's Karl, I'll take this one. So to answer the first part of the question, we -- the 93 titles that we put out, there was a snapshot, it was a moment in time and we really haven't given any updates on that since then. Of course, things move in and out all the time. It hasn't really been that long since then. So you can't really expect that there's going to be a significant amount of movement, but I can tell you for sure. There's something that have fallen on, something that are back end. But generally speaking, these are still pretty good numbers in general. But, again we do expect that this pipeline will be fluid, as we get things through various milestones. So it will be changing overtime. But we haven't provided any additional updates, other than the 93 initial announcement that we made. And just to break it down a little bit for you, in terms of what comprises that 93. So on a high level, 63 of those titles of the 93 are, we would consider core gaming experiences. And 17 of them are sort of mid core arcade style experiences and 13 of them are what we would consider to be casual experiences. About half of them 47 of the titles are from existing IP or sequels. And the rest of them are for our new intellectual property. So we are making investments in new IP, very important, so I spoke about that earlier. And then in terms of platforms, 72 of the 93 titles are planned for console PC or streaming, including seven of those that will also be available on mobile. So that would leave 21 that are that are on the list for specifically for mobile. And also from a business model perspective 67 of the 93 are -- they required the purchase and 26 are completely free to play. So that's the breakdown as it was the last time we did it. But we do expect that that will be moving around as we as we go deeper into that pipeline and over the next few years.\nBrian Nowak: Okay. Thanks, Karl.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nBryan Kraft: Hi, good afternoon, we'd love to understand at this point, your latest thinking about the mobile gaming opportunity for you in terms of what kinds of IP and games are likely to succeed, how much capital and resources and make sense to put behind mobile. And what the broader strategy is going forward in the mobile space? Thank you.\nKarl Slatoff: It's a Karl again. So obviously, the mobile component of our business has becoming more and more important with our acquisition of Social Point and Playdots. So we're very committed to it. Not to mention mobile activity our label levels, specifically 2K with WWE, SuperCard, et cetera and some NBA properties. So we are, we are highly invested in the mobile business and we expect that it will be a even growing part of our investment going forward. But it really does boil -- our strategy boils down to a few components. And the first really is focuses around new -- creating new IP for the mobile space. And that's around our Social Point and Playdots business. So it's IP that's created specifically for the mobile environment. And, we've been investing in that obviously over the past couple years, specifically to M&A but also now organically now that we've got a pretty sizable platform between those two acquisitions. The second component is bringing our core franchises to the mobile platforms. So these are games that are more or less ports or they could be slight variations of games, existing content that exists. So we've done that quite successfully for many, many years. And will continue to do so where it's appropriate. And then the third component is really just bringing our core is integrating a mobile experience with our core experiences. So these are things like companion apps, which we've done effectively with Red Dead Redemption, we've done it with Mafia\u2019s, we've done it with a number of our franchises, where you can have a separate mobile experience that you can use. And it can be used to enhance your core experience, pretty much at the same time or maybe offline, when you're not in front of your television set of your console. So those are really are the components of our strategy. But obviously it's a growing part of the industry. We're very tapped into it. And we're investing more and more.\nBryan Kraft: Thanks, Karl.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Matthew Thornton with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nMatthew Thornton: Hey, good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe, two if I could, maybe for either Strauss or Karl. First one is just higher level, you referred to the pipeline, the 93 projects a little earlier. I'm just wondering if there's any color if you can offer just as to how we're kind of progressing and maybe it's a little bit early, but just any incremental thoughts as to what the linearity is shaping up to look like there any color around the pipeline would be helpful there. And then just secondly, PGA TOUR, it's fairly small game but it was well reviewed. So it looks like successful by all accounts, I am curious if that was successful number are large enough where it could actually become a recurring title and join NBA and WWE in that regard, any thoughts there? Thanks, guys.\nStrauss Zelnick: So on the first part of the pipeline, I really don't have more information I can give you in terms of the pace of that pipeline and when the titles coming out, but rest assured, you will be hearing a lot more about that in the coming months. And as we talk about our release schedule. So unfortunately, I don't have any more to give you on that. And then in terms of the PGA TOUR 2K, we are incredibly excited about that the performance of that title. And I'd like to say that, that we're not surprised. But I am personally a little bit surprised we -- it's done fantastically well, we've sold around 2 million units or so which is a fantastic result. And we're just really getting started. So we do think that there's a future in this franchise for us. We haven't really announced much about what specifically that means. But what that is out there, this is something that we feel like it merits investment from our side. And that's something that we can really turn into very profitable and exciting franchise for us going forward for many years.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Benjamin Black with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nBenjamin Black: Great, thank you for the question. So obviously the gaming category as a whole has benefited from these extended stay-at-home provisions, but as we look to the account of \u201821, I'm really curious to hear what data points or trends you're seeing that could give us, some confidence and the sustainability as one of the trends we're seeing today. And then secondly, I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about the decision to disaggregate Red Dead Online from the core game, what are some of the key findings you have there? And I am curious to hear how Red Dead Online is deferring relative to GTA online at a comfortable stage with lifecycle? Thank you.\nStrauss Zelnick: Sorry, on the first question I, I'm hard pressed to know what data that would be except that we continue to do very well. And an engagement is very high. We had not planned in our numbers for the fourth quarter to see growth driven by the pandemic that has not been our approach. But of course, we continue to outperform and the net bookings that we're guiding to for the fiscal now are $800 million higher than our original guidance. So we're grateful for the growth. I think, under any circumstances, post-pandemic and hopefully there will be post-pandemic demand will be higher than pre-pandemic demand. I think it's quite clear that, that there's been a systemic shift in favor of Interactive Entertainment and activate a media consultancy confirm that. But I don't know whether there'll be some fall-off as people are out and about and doing, doing things outside of the home, it wouldn't surprise me if there were, but as long as we continue to deliver great experiences, I think we'll see continued growth. What was your second question again?\nBenjamin Black: Second question was really around the decision to desegregate Red Dead Online. And also, how Red Dead Online now is fairing relative to GTA online of the comparable stage of its lifecycle?\nStrauss Zelnick: So they're very different titles and they're really not comparable in any way. So both massive hits. And the decision I think was based on offering more opportunities to engage with the title, titles been in market for some time. And Rockstar has shown a willingness to experiment with different marketing models, all in an effort to enhance the size of the audience and to increase customer engagement and enjoyment. And I think it's working out really well. And I'm looking forward to seeing how Grand Theft Auto Online sales when the two is available as a standalone experience in fiscal \u201822.\nBenjamin Black: Excellent. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Hickey with the Benchmark Company. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Hickey: Strauss, Lainie, Karl, Nicole thanks for taking my questions, guys. Congrats on an incredible quarter and guide. I know it's early, but as we sort of think about fiscal year \u201822 here, obviously you've got a lot of momentum in your life service. Looks like a step up here and engagement is going to be lasting. You do have some visibility on the pipeline. Obviously, you have more, I am just curious if you think you can grow the fiscal year \u201822 and you sort of -- you can't exactly answer that. Maybe just [indiscernible] grow obviously grow [indiscernible] looking forward to? And the second question is, the work from home scenario or duration is continued to sort of expand here and just sort of curious the impact that has had on the developer culture and productivity when you look sort of in the medium-term of your pipeline? Thanks, guys.\nLainie Goldstein: Hey, Mike. So for fiscal year \u201822, At this point, it's a little early for us to provide fiscal \u201822 guidance. We're also currently in the process of completing our detailed budget for fiscal \u201822. And as you know, we typically guide for the next fiscal year, when we report our fourth quarter earnings in May. But it's important to keep in mind that this is clearly a record year for us, partly driven by the benefit of individuals sheltering at home and it remains to be seen how long these trends will go on. And when we originally projected sequential growth for fiscal \u201822 versus fiscal \u201821, our fiscal \u201821 guidance was projecting a decrease from fiscal 2020. And now we're expecting record net bookings for fiscal \u201821 which represents 30% growth over our original guidance and year-over-year growth compared to fiscal \u201820. Also, we expect record adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow over $750 million, which is more than double our original estimate. So we'll see in May, will give you a little bit of an update at that point. So that's when we'll give you some more details on \u201822.\nStrauss Zelnick: And Mike with regard to working from home, I can't predict how much longer that'll be the case. We follow, what government requirements and suggestions are and we follow the science and the facts. Some of our offices are open, no one is obligated to come to the office, if they're uncomfortable in doing so. That said, we've been extraordinarily productive. Our IT team did an A plus job making remote work possible for our company. We moved over to remote work within a week of needing to shelter at home. And we haven't missed a beat not even not at all, we have one title that was delayed Kerbal Space Program 2 that was hit. And more importantly, the quality of our releases has been extraordinary. I appreciate the question about culture. I think it's actually difficult to build a culture in a remote work environment. But I don't think it's impossible to do that, when you've already gotten to know each other. When you build a powerful company with a powerful business model and a powerful team. I think, to the contrary, in a challenging time, everyone pulled together and knew that it was our collective job to make sure the company didn't -- you didn't have any issues, and in fact, continued to grow. And that's exactly what happened. But, and so if any -- in any case, I think moral may actually be stronger, but it's not something that can or should last forever. And it has been taxing and I think people are actually working harder at home than they did in offices, even though there is no commute. I think it creates a lot of challenges. And I'm looking forward to it ending. So I know you're not -- we're not one of those companies where we believe like, oh this is a great idea everyone will just work from home. I think certain people may be able to work from home or if that's truly their interest, I think generally speaking will benefit from being together as a group.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Handler with MKM Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nEric Handler: Yes, thank you. I appreciate the question. Thinking about, the Grand Theft Auto franchise and the fact that we've now sold over 140 million units of the game. And granted there's probably some overlap, where people have more than one copy of the game. But it seems like there is a huge audience of people that have probably never played GTA IV or any of the other prior GTA games that came out before that. And I just wonder, how do you think about obviously there's a huge appetite for GTA content and how -- what's your perspective there in terms of thinking about remastering pre-prior games.\nStrauss Zelnick: I'd say it's a great and encouraging question. I'm kind of inclined to leave it more as a statement than a question. And any updates on our release schedule will come from Rockstar Games.\nEric Handler: Fair enough. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Ju: Okay. Thank you so much. Strauss, over the last few years, I think the industry has gone from needing to acquire customers with massive advertising campaigns every time there was a new iteration of a game to that was set up where you are in front of your user base all the time. And he just called out, I think, in a prior answer, again the captivation and engagement with what is now basically a perpetual service model. So do you anticipate going forward potentially further operating margin benefits due to what might be a decreased need for marketing spend? And I guess, building on one of the M&A questions earlier and this is definitely not an either or question. But do you think your time and Take-Two\u2019s capital are probably better served adding to the teams you already have at Rockstar 2K, where there already seems to be a pretty good culture of excellence there? Thanks.\nStrauss Zelnick: It's a -- thank you for the question. I don't think you're going to see a reduction in our marketing spend, because we're launching new iterations of existing franchises. And we're launching new intellectual property in a highly competitive market. And I think we'll continue to spend support those releases. So I don't think you'll see leverage there. You see leverage, though, of course, is when you sell more units. So if you make bigger hits, and we make bigger hits than anyone else in the market, then obviously you're amortizing that marketing spend across a larger number of units. So a marketing spend as a percent of your net bookings can be lower to be accepted you have greater success. And that's certainly our goal. And in that event, of course, we'd have higher operating margins. And you've seen that reflected in the growth in our operating margins, as you've seen the growth in our hits in the last 14 years. And I would hope that that will continue, but we entirely driven by whatever success we have or don't have. I think where you can, have a little more confidence around growth in the margins would be in the shift to digital distribution, which is an extra [mile] and which is happening and digitally distributed products were 82% of our net bookings in the quarter. And we think that the world is heading towards more than that. And that will help our margins as well as our competitors\u2019 margins. Also, of course, our recurrent consumer spending is higher margin because the cost associated with the content that drives recurrent consumer spending is lower than the costs related to an initial large release. So to the extent that we continue to deliver add-on content, to beloved titles, which is our goal, you could see an increase in operating margins coming from that as well. But again, that's reliant upon creating hits. And that won't occur if we don't create more hits. So everything comes down to creating bigger and bigger hits. And that's our goal and our strategy.\nKarl Slatoff: [indiscernible].\nStrauss Zelnick: Sorry and I think on your second question, thanks for the reminder, Karl, it's all of the above, we're adding to the team's 2K and Rockstar as they work on more properties and bigger properties. We are adding to the teams at Social Point and Private Division selectively as we work on new properties. And we have shown a willingness to acquire companies and add that way as well very, very selectively. So we're a growth business. And you'll see that on our headcount. I'm hopeful that our headcount essentially goes to production capacity, engineering capacity and doesn't go to fixed corporate overhead.\nStephen Ju: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Ryan Gee with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nRyan Gee: Hey, guys, thanks for squeezing me in right there. First one for Lainie, we're about a month away from last year when most of us were all sent indoors. And we saw that increased demand for gaming content. So just so we're all on the same page here. Do you mind refreshing us how much maybe GTA online NBA 2K online, I mean NBA 2K perhaps outperformed your expectations in the March quarter last year or maybe it's actually more in the June quarter? But if you could try and quantify that, so that we can have our model set accordingly. That would be a fantastic. And then a question for either Strauss or Karl. You guys acquired a Ruffian Games or Rockstar acquired Ruffian late last year. I believe that they have a history in the shooter category with the Halo franchise specifically. So are they coming on board to broaden Rockstar\u2019s reached designers like that or what role do you anticipate they'll play in the future of that studio either supporting or more and more lead development role? Thanks.\nStrauss Zelnick: We're thrilled to welcome the Ruffian team to Rockstar Games and to Take-Two and we think they're an extraordinarily talented team. And we're looking forward to them becoming a part of Rockstar Games. And beyond that they'll be more announcements in due time.\nLainie Goldstein: And Ryan on the title-by-title on that -- for the fourth quarter last year I don't have that information in front of me, but we can follow up with you on that. But we -- all of our titles, I think over performed in that quarter but on a title-by-title basis. It was a significant overachievement specifically on GTA online and for NBA 2K.\nRyan Gee: Very nice. Thanks, guys.\nStrauss Zelnick: Well, thank you all very much for joining us today. Obviously, we're really proud of what the entire team has achieved. The results are extraordinary. And all of us are so grateful to our colleagues around the world.

            "content": "Thanks, Strauss. I'd like to begin by recognizing the ongoing work of our teams around the world and continue to deliver incredible results that are a testament to this unwavering commitment to quality, our deeply rooted culture of collaboration and the singular drive to achieve our goals. Our unique ability to captivate and engage audiences has never been more evident nor more important than in these challenging times. And we remain immensely grateful to our player communities for making our games part of their lives. I'll now discuss our recent and upcoming releases. On January 27, 2K released the fourth roster update for WWE 2K Battlegrounds, which adds to the games outrageous in and out of the ring action. The update, which features many popular superstars and legends including China, Mark Henry, Christian and more. On Wednesday 2K will release the fifth update that will feature even more fan favorites and we will share details shortly. On January 28, 2K and Firaxis Games released the Vietnam & Kublai Khan Pack for Sid Meier's Civilization VI as part of the new frontier paths for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and PC. Each pack in the past features new civilizations and leaders and is also available for individual purchase. The Final Frontier Pass pack will be released next month and 2K will have more to share about that in the coming weeks. In addition, last week, private division launched their beloved space simulation Kerbal Space Program on Tencent's WeGame platform in China. We are very pleased to build upon our successful partnership with Tencent and believe that releasing Kerbal Space Program on WeGame represents a great opportunity to expand the global community and bolster our offerings in China. On February 10, Private Division and Obsidian Entertainment will release The Outer Worlds: Peril on Gorgon, the first narrative-led expansion for the critically acclaimed darkly humorous sci-fi RPG for the Nintendo Switch. The expansion was released previously for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC and it's available individually or at a discount as part of The Outer Worlds Expansion Pass, which will also include the Outer Worlds Murder on Eridanos, the second expansion set to launch on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC this fiscal year and on Nintendo Switch in calendar 2021. This spring 3K will release the Director's Cut the new add-on content for Season Pass 2 for Borderlands 3 that will be available for all released versions of the game. The Director's Cut add-on will include new missions and game content and behind the scenes extras. On behalf of our team, I would like to congratulate Gearbox Software on their recently announced merger with Embracer. This marks an exciting new chapter in the studio's history. And we look forward to continuing our successful partnership with Gearbox, including the long-term publishing relationship for the Borderlands franchise going forward and some unannounced projects that will be revealed over time. Throughout the year, Rockstar Games will continue to support both Grand Theft Auto Online and Red Dead online with more content updates to keep new and returning players excited and engaged. In addition, during the second half of calendar 2021, Rockstar Games will bring the blockbuster hit Grand Theft Auto V to the latest generation of consoles. The new version will feature a range of technical improvements, visual upgrades and performance enhancements to take full advantage of the latest hardware making the game more beautiful and more responsive than ever.

There will also be a new standalone version of Grand Theft Auto Online coming in the second half of calendar 2021 which will be available for free exclusively on PlayStation 5 during the first three months. Rockstar Games will share more details on the new versions of Grand Theft Auto V in the months ahead. Turning to eSports, the NBA 2K league is gearing up for its fourth season that will take place later this year. After a series of Pro Game tournament and they first of its kind league combined during the fall, the league is currently prepping for this year's upcoming player draft. As part of the league's continued commitment to identifying the best players in the world this offseason, the league is hosting a series of online qualifying events for international players and will award draft eligibility to top performers from each event. In addition, I'm pleased to share that for the second consecutive year, the NBA 2K league was given top honors at the Tempus awards as part of the Annual eSports Business Summit. I'd like to congratulate League President Brendan Donohue and his team on these honors. We remain very excited about the continued success and growth of the NBA 2K league which has the long-term potential to enhance engagement to be a driver of profits for a company. Looking ahead, our organization is currently undertaking numerous initiatives that we believe will add scale to our business and drive continued success. As an entertainment company, our Life World is our world renowned creative talent and portfolio of owned intellectual property. With nearly 4,900 colleagues around the world in our development studios that are home to some of the most commercially and critically successful brands in our industry. We are significantly expanding the breadth and depth of our offerings, and currently have the largest most diverse long-term product pipeline in our history. While we are excited by the potential of these future releases, we are still pursuing our goal of creating a more consistent release schedule and increasing our development capacity. To that end, we continually explore both organic and inorganic opportunities and maintain a highly disciplined approach to ensure that our investments will be accretive to our shareholders and consistent with our strategy. In addition, we have always maintained a willingness to explore and experiment with new markets and business models that can both expand the reach of our content and broaden the scope of our audience. We are investing prudently to enhance our global infrastructure and resources that support our creative endeavors, including data analytics and endgame engagement with players. Through all these efforts, we believe that Take-Two is poised to generate growth and margin expansion over the long-term. I'll now turn the call over Lainie. Hi, it's Karl speaking. Yes, obviously the Music Locker experience is very unique. It's a terrific application and then in GTA. Music has always been a really, really important part of the Grand Theft Auto franchise and it will continue to be; it's always been part of the culture of the Grand Theft Auto franchise, and people explore it and enjoy the found new music through the franchise over-and-over again, I don't want to speculate about what's in Rockstars plans as it relates to music, but rest assured music is always has always been and will always be a large part of what GTA is all about. Hey, Brain, it's Karl, I'll take this one. So to answer the first part of the question, we -- the 93 titles that we put out, there was a snapshot, it was a moment in time and we really haven't given any updates on that since then. Of course, things move in and out all the time. It hasn't really been that long since then. So you can't really expect that there's going to be a significant amount of movement, but I can tell you for sure. There's something that have fallen on, something that are back end. But generally speaking, these are still pretty good numbers in general. But, again we do expect that this pipeline will be fluid, as we get things through various milestones. So it will be changing overtime. But we haven't provided any additional updates, other than the 93 initial announcement that we made. And just to break it down a little bit for you, in terms of what comprises that 93. So on a high level, 63 of those titles of the 93 are, we would consider core gaming experiences. And 17 of them are sort of mid core arcade style experiences and 13 of them are what we would consider to be casual experiences. About half of them 47 of the titles are from existing IP or sequels. And the rest of them are for our new intellectual property. So we are making investments in new IP, very important, so I spoke about that earlier. And then in terms of platforms, 72 of the 93 titles are planned for console PC or streaming, including seven of those that will also be available on mobile. So that would leave 21 that are that are on the list for specifically for mobile. And also from a business model perspective 67 of the 93 are -- they required the purchase and 26 are completely free to play. So that's the breakdown as it was the last time we did it. But we do expect that that will be moving around as we as we go deeper into that pipeline and over the next few years. It's a Karl again. So obviously, the mobile component of our business has becoming more and more important with our acquisition of Social Point and Playdots. So we're very committed to it. Not to mention mobile activity our label levels, specifically 2K with WWE, SuperCard, et cetera and some NBA properties. So we are, we are highly invested in the mobile business and we expect that it will be a even growing part of our investment going forward. But it really does boil -- our strategy boils down to a few components. And the first really is focuses around new -- creating new IP for the mobile space. And that's around our Social Point and Playdots business. So it's IP that's created specifically for the mobile environment. And, we've been investing in that obviously over the past couple years, specifically to M&A but also now organically now that we've got a pretty sizable platform between those two acquisitions. The second component is bringing our core franchises to the mobile platforms. So these are games that are more or less ports or they could be slight variations of games, existing content that exists. So we've done that quite successfully for many, many years. And will continue to do so where it's appropriate. And then the third component is really just bringing our core is integrating a mobile experience with our core experiences. So these are things like companion apps, which we've done effectively with Red Dead Redemption, we've done it with Mafia's, we've done it with a number of our franchises, where you can have a separate mobile experience that you can use. And it can be used to enhance your core experience, pretty much at the same time or maybe offline, when you're not in front of your television set of your console. So those are really are the components of our strategy. But obviously it's a growing part of the industry. We're very tapped into it. And we're investing more and more. [indiscernible]."

            "name": "Lainie Goldstein",
            "content": "Thanks, Karl. And good afternoon, everyone. Today I'll discuss our third quarter results and then review our financial outlook for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021. Please note that additional details regarding our actual results and outlets are contained in our press release. Net bookings were $814 million this results exceeded our outlook of $675 million to $725 million, driven primarily by the outperformance of Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, the Mafia Definitive Edition and Mafia Trilogy, NBA 2K and Red Dead Redemption 2. Digitally delivered net bookings declined by 4% as compared to our outlook of a 15% decline and accounted for 82% of the total. This has also exceeded our outlook primarily due to the outperformance of recurrent consumer spending. Our third quarter results last year benefited from the launches of Red Dead Redemption 2 on PC and the Outer World. During the third quarter 56% of sales of console games were delivered digitally up from 44% last year. Recurrent consumer spending grew 30% as compared to our outlook of 5% growth and accounted for 58% of total net bookings. This growth was driven primarily by Grand Theft Auto Online and NBA 2K. GAAP net revenue was $861 million and cost of goods sold was $346 million. Operating expenses increased by 7% to $339 million due primarily to the addition of Playdots, higher personnel costs and IT expenses partially offset by lower marketing expenses. And GAAP net income grew 11% to $182 million or $1.57 per share as compared to $164 million or $1.43 per share in the third quarter last year. Our GAAP net income benefited from $40.6 million of realized and unrealized gains on a long-term investment. We ended the quarter with $2.42 billion of cash into our term investments. Not Included in this balance is the cash portion of our offer to acquire Codemasters which was included in restricted cash. As this amount not been considered still restricted as of December 31, our cash and short-term investments for this quarter end would have been $2.7 billion. As of January 13, 2021, the offer lapsed and the cash was no longer restricted. Now to our guidance, starting with the fiscal fourth quarter, we projected net bookings to range from $602 million to $652 million compared to $729 million in the fourth quarter last year. Last year's fourth quarter benefited from the recognition of higher license fees from Digital Partners to provide free downloads of certain games on their platform and from the launch of Borderlands 3 and [it's team] this decline is also due to the initial surge in digital downloads at the onset of shelter at home orders in March 2020. We expect digitally delivered net bookings to be down approximately 10%. Digital is projected to represent 93% of total net bookings which is in line with last year. Forecast assumes that 73% of console game sales will be delivered digitally up from 63% last year. The current consumer spending to be up approximately 5% due to continued engagement in our titles. Virtual currency is driving this increase and is partially offset by lower add-on content due to last year launch of the [indiscernible] for Borderlands 3. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K21, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Social points mobile games, Two Dots, Borderlands 3 and Sid Meier's Civilization VI. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $702 million to $752 million and cost of goods sold to range from $267 million to $293 million. Operating expenses are expected to range from $316 million to $326 million. As at the midpoint this represents a 32% increase over last year, driven primarily by higher marketing and research and development expenses and the addition of Playdots. And GAAP net income is expected to range from $102 million to $113 million or $0.88 to $0.98 per share. For management reporting purposes, we expect our tax rate to be 16% throughout fiscal 2021. We are again increasing our full year outlook which now includes record net bookings and operating results. This will be the fifth consecutive year that these two metrics have grown. Our net bookings outlook range is now $3.37 billion to $3.42 billion, up from our previous guidance of $3.15 billion to $3.25 billion and original guidance of $2.55 billion to $2.65 billion. This is being driven by our third quarter outperformance along with an updated forecast for the fourth quarter, which has improved primarily due to higher recurrent consumer spending from Grand Theft Auto Online and NBA 2K as well as strong performance from Grand Theft Auto V and Red Dead Redemption 2. We expect growth from the prior year from NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V and Social Point's mobile games to be offset primarily by lower results from Borderlands 3. The largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Social Point's mobile games, Borderlands 3 Sid Meier's Civilization VI, the Mafia Definitive Edition and Mafia Trilogy and PGA TOUR 2K21. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 55% 2K, 35% Rockstar Games and 10% Private Division, Social Point and Playdots. And we forecast our geographic net bookings split to be about 60% United States and 40% International. We now project digitally delivered net bookings to increase by approximately 20% as compared to our prior outlook of 15% growth. As a percentage of our business digital projected to represent 87% of net bookings from 82% last year. A forecast assumes that 63% of console game sales will be delivered digitally up from 55% last year. We now expect recurrent consumer spending to grow by approximately 45% as compared to our prior outlook of 30% growth and represent approximately 64% of net bookings as compared to 51% last year. Growth is being driven primarily by NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online, the Addition of Playdots and Social Point's mobile games. We are increasing our non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow outlet to more than $750 million up from our prior outlets of more than $650 million. We've planned to deploy approximately $75 million for capital expenditures. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $3.24 billion to $3.29 billion and cost of goods sold to range from $1.52 billion to $1.55 billion. Total operating expenses are expected to range from $1.22 billion to $1.23 billion. The midpoint this represents a 9% increase over the prior year driven by the addition to Playdots higher headcount, IT, research and development expense and charitable contributions, partially offset by lower marketing expenses. And we expect GAAP net income to range from $472 million to $484 million or $4.08 to $4.18 per share. In closing, we are very pleased with the ongoing momentum that we have experienced so far in fiscal 2021, including our expectations to deliver both record net bookings and operating results for the full year. We remain extremely confident in our long-term growth trajectory and our ability to deliver shareholder value driven by our key competitive advantages, our incredible portfolio of creative assets, our strong fundamentals and healthy balance sheet and of course our industry leading talent. Thank you. I'll now turn the call back this Strauss. Hey, Mike. So for fiscal year \u201822, At this point, it's a little early for us to provide fiscal \u201822 guidance. We're also currently in the process of completing our detailed budget for fiscal \u201822. And as you know, we typically guide for the next fiscal year, when we report our fourth quarter earnings in May. But it's important to keep in mind that this is clearly a record year for us, partly driven by the benefit of individuals sheltering at home and it remains to be seen how long these trends will go on. And when we originally projected sequential growth for fiscal \u201822 versus fiscal \u201821, our fiscal \u201821 guidance was projecting a decrease from fiscal 2020. And now we're expecting record net bookings for fiscal \u201821 which represents 30% growth over our original guidance and year-over-year growth compared to fiscal \u201820. Also, we expect record adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow over $750 million, which is more than double our original estimate. So we'll see in May, will give you a little bit of an update at that point. So that's when we'll give you some more details on \u201822. And Ryan on the title-by-title on that -- for the fourth quarter last year I don't have that information in front of me, but we can follow up with you on that. But we -- all of our titles, I think over performed in that quarter but on a title-by-title basis. It was a significant overachievement specifically on GTA online and for NBA 2K."

            "name": "Strauss Zelnick",
            "content": "I'd like to welcome Nicole to our team. And I am confident that she will enhance our investor relations efforts going forward. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to acknowledge those who have been and continue to be affected by the global pandemic. No words can bring comfort to those who have suffered. However, we do remain hopeful that better days lie ahead and that we all may return to an enjoy our lives as we once did. We remain immensely grateful to frontline workers who are caring selflessly for those in need ensuring the vaccines are being delivered and administered and helping the world navigate further in these troubling times. Turning to Take-Two, due to an incredibly strong holiday season coupled with our ability to provide consistently the highest quality entertainment experiences, especially as many individuals continued to shelter home Take-Two delivered operating results that significantly exceeded our expectations. The outperformance of Grand Theft Auto Online, Grand Theft Auto V, NBA 2K, the Mafia Definitive Editions and Mafia Trilogy and Red Dead Redemption 2 reflects our development team's boundless passion, creativity and commitment to captivate and engage audiences. In the history of the entertainment industry, there's perhaps no experience that's more loved, more expansive, more critically acclaimed and more successful than Rockstar Games Grand Theft Auto. Grand Theft Auto V remains one of the most iconic titles ever released and continues to exceed our expectations, having sold in over 140 million units. In fact, in calendar 2020, more copies of Grand Theft Auto V were sold than in any other year except for 2013 when it first launched on PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. In addition, recurrent consumer spending on Grand Theft Auto Online outperformed our third quarter forecast and grew 28% year-over-year. In December, Rockstar Games released Grand Theft Auto Online's biggest update to-date, The Cayo Perico Heist, featuring a radical new approach to Heist design, as well as a new tropical island to explore The Cayo Perico Heist is an all new Grand Theft Auto Online adventure in which players can choose to take on a Heist with a crew of up to four or for the first time plan, prepare and execute the daring Island Heist all on their own. Notably, more than 50% of those playing The Cayo Perico Heist are engaging with this as a new single player experience. Cayo Perico Heist also introduces an array of exciting new weapons and vehicles, a new virtual nightclub and social space for players to get together and experience the world's best DJs plus a host of updates across the entire world. In addition, overall engagement with Grand Theft Auto Online continues to set new benchmarks as the title had more players in every month and for the entirety of calendar 2020 than in any other year since its launch. 2020 also marked Grand Theft Auto Online highest participation rate ever by both new players and reactivated players who returned to experience Rockstar Games array of new content offerings. Grand Theft Auto Online is expected to achieve a new net bookings record in fiscal 2021. Red Dead Redemption 2 also outperformed and to-date has sold in over 36 million units worldwide. In December, Rockstar Games released a standalone version of Red Dead Online on PlayStation 4, Xbox 1 and PC that for the first time allows new players who do not already own Red Dead Redemption 2 to experience everything Red Dead Online has to offer, including access to all future content updates. Players also have the option to unlock Red Dead Redemption 2 story mode via an array via an additional purchase. In addition, during the quarter, Rockstar Games released an array of content updates for Red Dead Online including new legendary animals and sightings missions for the naturalist role action pack new missions for the Bounty Hunter Role with the addition of the prestigious Bounty Hunter license, plus Outlaw Pass No. 4 and an assortment of new clothing, weapons enhancements and more. As a result of these offerings, engagement with Red Dead Online reached new heights and there were more players including more new players in the month of December than in any other month since its beta launch in 2018. In addition, Red Dead Online grew its audience and had more overall players in calendar 2020 than 2019. Rockstar Games will continue to support both Red Dead Online and Grand Theft Auto Online with more content updates to our calendar 2021 to keep new and returning players excited and engaged. Another beloved franchise that's both a perennial favorite among consumers and an integral contributor to our ongoing success is NBA 2K from 2K and Visual Concepts. Renowned for being our industry's leading basketball simulation series each year NBA 2K continues to reinvent how people experience basketball and its rich culture and influence. NBA 2K21 once again raised the bar for the series and was our first offering that was built from the ground up for next generation consoles. The title boasts groundbreaking technological advancements, new modes and many exclusive robust features. To-date, NBA 2K21 has exceeded our expectations and is sold in over 8 million units across all platforms. In addition, during the third quarter net bookings for the NBA 2K series grew 48% and recurrent consumer spending significantly exceeded our expectations growing 67%. Furthermore, consumer engagement with NBA 2K remains incredibly strong across daily active users, my career users and my team users. Moreover, NBA 2K21 users have been more deeply engaged with the game with average games played per user up 14% as compared to NBA 2K20 in the same period. During the quarter 2K expanded further the breadth of its NBA 2K offerings with the releases of NBA's SuperCard and NBA 2K Mobile Season 3 for iOS and Android devices. During the third quarter, 2K bolstered our initial offerings for PlayStation 5 and Xbox series X with our beloved shooter looter titled Borderlands 3. The title was fully optimized for next generation consoles, making mayhem bigger and bolder than ever before. All players who own or purchase the game of prior consoles will be able to download the new platform upgrade within the same console family for free. This free upgrade will add several exclusive features including 4K resolution at 60 frames per second in single player and online co-op plus support for three and four players split screen co-op. Borderlands 3 is launched for next generation platforms it was well received and we've seen the games user base grow steadily. 2K is supporting the title within game events and new content including the release of the Designer's Cut, which is the first of two offerings as part of the Season Pass 2 for all versions of the game. Our third quarter results were also enhanced by a variety of other offerings led by the Mafia Definitive Editions and Mafia Trilogy, the WWE series, Sid Meier's Civilization VI and PGA TOUR 2K21. Driving engagement with our titles after initial launch remains among our most important long-term growth and margin opportunities and is a key strategic priority of our organization. We now support virtually all our new releases with innovative offerings to achieve this goal. That said, we're highly mindful that first and foremost, we're an entertainment company and we're in the service of our audience. We strive to give consumers more of what they love and the ability to stay captivated and engaged within their favorite experiences and passionate communities. To that end, during the third quarter, we released an array of free and paid add-on content for our popular hit releases, including Kerbal Space Program PGA TOUR 2K21, Sid Meier's Civilization VI and WWE 2K Battlegrounds. During the third quarter recurrent consumer spending exceeded our expectations growing 30% which was double our original outlook and accounted for 58% of net bookings. In addition to NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Red Dead Online the recurrent consumer spending was enhanced by the following offerings. Social Point's live games including Dragon City, Monster Legends, World Life, World Chef and Tasty Town outperformed during the third quarter and exceeded our expectations. Live games delivered new fresh content events and experiences to boost engagement and enhance players' enjoyment and net bookings grew 39%. The studio continues to invest in its broad and innovative pipeline of new games planned for launch in the coming years. Playdots completed the rollout of their biggest feature update of the year for their popular Two Dots title including competitive leaderboards. This update played a key role in driving average revenue per daily active user up 12% as compared with the second quarter of fiscal \u201821. Two Dots is now experiencing its highest player conversion rate ever. As a result of these new and expanded live ops features, which continue to perform very well. We expect Playdots to be a significant contributor to our results and expect growth over the long-term. WWE SuperCard also outperformed during the third quarter growing 16%. During the period 2K launch Season 7 of this popular free-to-play sports entertainment mobile game. The title has now been downloaded more than 22 million times and remains 2K's highest grossing mobile title. And NBA 2K Online in China grew 49% and remains a significant contributor to our results. The title is the number one PC online sports game in China with more than 51 million registered users. Add-on content grew [8%] and outperformed expectations led by offerings for the Borderlands series and Sid Meier's Civilization VI. As a result of our better than expected third quarter performance and increased forecasts for the remainder of the year, we're once again raising our outlook for fiscal year 2021. And we expect to achieve record net bookings of $3.37 billion to $3.42 billion. In closing, Take-Two is exceedingly well positioned to capitalize further on the positive trends of our industry to pursue our core mission to become the most innovative, creative and efficient entertainment company in the world and to deliver growth and returns for our shareholders over the long-term. I'll now turn the call over to Karl. Thanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for their hard work, commitment to excellence and for delivering another outstanding quarter. To our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued support. We'll now take your questions. Operator? Great, thanks, Mario, it's sort of all of the above. So it's exciting that we have these extraordinary franchises that keep captivating and engaging consumers many years after launch. And the reason that that's occurring is first of all the initial quality, which is unmatched in our business. And second, because our labels, both Rockstar Games and 2K continue to deliver content on an ongoing basis that further causes captivation and engagement. And if we keep doing that, then we'll continue we think to have similar results. I think you're right that consumers get really comfortable within excited by specific franchises. And if you keep delivering great content, they will maintain their involvement on an ongoing basis, we're seeing that in all forms of the entertainment business. At the same time, we always have to create new titles both new iterations of existing beloved franchises, and new intellectual property. And if we don't do that, then we're burning the furniture. So to that end, in the next five years, we expect to bring 93 new releases to market which is more than double what our development capacity was just a few years ago. So we're both excited by the continued growing engagement in our existing entities as well as what the future can bring with new releases. Well, no, this wasn't coincidental. I mean, the folks at Rockstar Games intended to create a powerful single player experience a story driven experience. And Rockstar has always been known for great stories and great single player experiences and then developed in addition, a massive multiplayer opportunity over the past years. And I think it's a reminder not that we needed one, the Rockstar Games can do both of those things at the highest possible level of execution in our business. There was a, I think there was an argument just a couple years ago, not around here, not in this shop. But in some of our competitors offices, that single player is dead, that it's all about multiplayer. We didn't believe that I said specifically and publicly that we didn't believe that, our labels don't believe that. And we deliver an array of experiences that range from hyper casual mobile, to the most complex, the most robust, single player and multiplayer experiences. And we intend to continue doing that. Well, I really appreciate the sentiment behind the question. But I sort of put it in the category of how high is up? We don't tend to speculate and we haven't offered any initial guidance for next fiscal year either. So we'll sharpen our pencil in the coming months and of course we will create initial guidance and that will reflect partially that performance. But in general, if history is any guide, it will be very successful indeed. And I would -- that wouldn't surprise me. Yes, in terms of frontline pricing for NBA 2K21, I think that worked out very much as expected. And as planned, it's in a premium offering at the highest possible level, the title was built from the ground up for next-gen, so first title here that has been created that way. And the acceptance by consumers has been nothing short of extraordinary, the title sold in over 8 million units. Now, we haven't talked about pricing on other titles. So it would be premature to discuss that we'll talk about that and title-by-title basis going forward. In terms of consolidation, you've seen a lot of deals out there, most recently Embracer is, is merging with Gearbox, a company near and dear to our heart and we're grateful that we'll still be in business with Gearbox and they'll still be working with us on Borderlands and on other titles. We acquired Playdots just a few months ago and we're excited about how that deals gone. We lost the Codemasters deal to our friends out west that was disappointing but reflects our discipline in such matters. So there is an awful lot going on, I tend to agree Colin that pricing can be pretty heavy. And we have a stated strategy and a disciplined approach. It served us well. We have yet to make an acquisition that that hasn't worked out. And we're looking for great teams, great intellectual property and for an arrangement that would be accretive to shareholder value. And we will -- we'll look for that and at times aggressively. But, we have a sort of firm -- we have a firm grasp on hand calculator in one hand and on our approach strategy and tactics in the other. Well, first of all you never want to sit back and just say, we've always been able to do it's totally fine. It'll be fine going forward. We're always looking over our shoulders. We're always trying to figure out what we can do better. We're, I think the most self critical group I've ever run into. How do we maintain our commitment to quality by making sure that our creative teams pursue what they're passionate is about, and don't pursue something they're not passionate about and by maintaining operational and financial discipline at the same time. And the effect of that is we can have long development cycles. And we've been criticized for that. But I think the case that you're alluding to reflects the fact that you're always better served to wait for perfection if you can create perfection. And all of our labels are seeking perfection. And we don't always succeed, sometimes we fall short. But that's the goal. And if anything in these times cause us to sharpen our minds further and sharpen our discipline further and try harder. So yes right and it's great that Rockstar Games continues to put out add-on content and additional content for Grand Theft Auto Online and for Red Dead Online. But they've put out material that they really believe in that they're passionate about and that is of the highest possible quality. And that means we're not on a weekly cadence and we're not going to be in that means we don't necessarily know the exact release date. But what we do know is that we will wait for it to be as close to perfect as anything can be. And that's true 2K. That's true, it's Social Point and that's true a Private Division. And that's an unwavering commitment. And it's part of our strategy. And it comes from the top of the company. And we are prepared to accept the results when we fall short in terms of timing or when we sometimes spend a little more than we would like because it always pays-off. So on the first part of the pipeline, I really don't have more information I can give you in terms of the pace of that pipeline and when the titles coming out, but rest assured, you will be hearing a lot more about that in the coming months. And as we talk about our release schedule. So unfortunately, I don't have any more to give you on that. And then in terms of the PGA TOUR 2K, we are incredibly excited about that the performance of that title. And I'd like to say that, that we're not surprised. But I am personally a little bit surprised we -- it's done fantastically well, we've sold around 2 million units or so which is a fantastic result. And we're just really getting started. So we do think that there's a future in this franchise for us. We haven't really announced much about what specifically that means. But what that is out there, this is something that we feel like it merits investment from our side. And that's something that we can really turn into very profitable and exciting franchise for us going forward for many years. Sorry, on the first question I, I'm hard pressed to know what data that would be except that we continue to do very well. And an engagement is very high. We had not planned in our numbers for the fourth quarter to see growth driven by the pandemic that has not been our approach. But of course, we continue to outperform and the net bookings that we're guiding to for the fiscal now are $800 million higher than our original guidance. So we're grateful for the growth. I think, under any circumstances, post-pandemic and hopefully there will be post-pandemic demand will be higher than pre-pandemic demand. I think it's quite clear that, that there's been a systemic shift in favor of Interactive Entertainment and activate a media consultancy confirm that. But I don't know whether there'll be some fall-off as people are out and about and doing, doing things outside of the home, it wouldn't surprise me if there were, but as long as we continue to deliver great experiences, I think we'll see continued growth. What was your second question again? So they're very different titles and they're really not comparable in any way. So both massive hits. And the decision I think was based on offering more opportunities to engage with the title, titles been in market for some time. And Rockstar has shown a willingness to experiment with different marketing models, all in an effort to enhance the size of the audience and to increase customer engagement and enjoyment. And I think it's working out really well. And I'm looking forward to seeing how Grand Theft Auto Online sales when the two is available as a standalone experience in fiscal \u201822. And Mike with regard to working from home, I can't predict how much longer that'll be the case. We follow, what government requirements and suggestions are and we follow the science and the facts. Some of our offices are open, no one is obligated to come to the office, if they're uncomfortable in doing so. That said, we've been extraordinarily productive. Our IT team did an A plus job making remote work possible for our company. We moved over to remote work within a week of needing to shelter at home. And we haven't missed a beat not even not at all, we have one title that was delayed Kerbal Space Program 2 that was hit. And more importantly, the quality of our releases has been extraordinary. I appreciate the question about culture. I think it's actually difficult to build a culture in a remote work environment. But I don't think it's impossible to do that, when you've already gotten to know each other. When you build a powerful company with a powerful business model and a powerful team. I think, to the contrary, in a challenging time, everyone pulled together and knew that it was our collective job to make sure the company didn't -- you didn't have any issues, and in fact, continued to grow. And that's exactly what happened. But, and so if any -- in any case, I think moral may actually be stronger, but it's not something that can or should last forever. And it has been taxing and I think people are actually working harder at home than they did in offices, even though there is no commute. I think it creates a lot of challenges. And I'm looking forward to it ending. So I know you're not -- we're not one of those companies where we believe like, oh this is a great idea everyone will just work from home. I think certain people may be able to work from home or if that's truly their interest, I think generally speaking will benefit from being together as a group. I'd say it's a great and encouraging question. I'm kind of inclined to leave it more as a statement than a question. And any updates on our release schedule will come from Rockstar Games. It's a -- thank you for the question. I don't think you're going to see a reduction in our marketing spend, because we're launching new iterations of existing franchises. And we're launching new intellectual property in a highly competitive market. And I think we'll continue to spend support those releases. So I don't think you'll see leverage there. You see leverage, though, of course, is when you sell more units. So if you make bigger hits, and we make bigger hits than anyone else in the market, then obviously you're amortizing that marketing spend across a larger number of units. So a marketing spend as a percent of your net bookings can be lower to be accepted you have greater success. And that's certainly our goal. And in that event, of course, we'd have higher operating margins. And you've seen that reflected in the growth in our operating margins, as you've seen the growth in our hits in the last 14 years. And I would hope that that will continue, but we entirely driven by whatever success we have or don't have. I think where you can, have a little more confidence around growth in the margins would be in the shift to digital distribution, which is an extra [mile] and which is happening and digitally distributed products were 82% of our net bookings in the quarter. And we think that the world is heading towards more than that. And that will help our margins as well as our competitors' margins. Also, of course, our recurrent consumer spending is higher margin because the cost associated with the content that drives recurrent consumer spending is lower than the costs related to an initial large release. So to the extent that we continue to deliver add-on content, to beloved titles, which is our goal, you could see an increase in operating margins coming from that as well. But again, that's reliant upon creating hits. And that won't occur if we don't create more hits. So everything comes down to creating bigger and bigger hits. And that's our goal and our strategy. Sorry and I think on your second question, thanks for the reminder, Karl, it's all of the above, we're adding to the team's 2K and Rockstar as they work on more properties and bigger properties. We are adding to the teams at Social Point and Private Division selectively as we work on new properties. And we have shown a willingness to acquire companies and add that way as well very, very selectively. So we're a growth business. And you'll see that on our headcount. I'm hopeful that our headcount essentially goes to production capacity, engineering capacity and doesn't go to fixed corporate overhead. We're thrilled to welcome the Ruffian team to Rockstar Games and to Take-Two and we think they're an extraordinarily talented team. And we're looking forward to them becoming a part of Rockstar Games. And beyond that they'll be more announcements in due time. Well, thank you all very much for joining us today. Obviously, we're really proud of what the entire team has achieved. The results are extraordinary. And all of us are so grateful to our colleagues around the world. And of course, we're grateful to you for joining us today. Thanks so much."

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. I'd like to begin by acknowledging those who have been affected by the global pandemic. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to express our deepest sympathies and shared hope that in time, this crisis shall pass. We remain immensely grateful to everyone who serves on the front lines caring for those in need and helping the world navigate these challenging times.\n I'm pleased to report that our positive momentum continued in the second quarter with operating results that significantly exceeded our expectations. Our stellar results were highlighted by the outperformance of NBA 2K, PGA Tour 2K21 and the Mafia Definitive Editions and Mafia: Trilogy. \n Our ability to deliver the highest quality entertainment experiences to our audiences during these challenging times is a reflection of the professionalism and the passion of our entire organization. I'm immensely proud of our teams throughout the world that embody our core tenets of creativity, innovation and efficiency. \n On September 4, 2K and Visual Concepts launched NBA 2K21, the latest installment in our industry-leading basketball simulation series for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PC and Stadia. The title is off to a remarkable start, and net bookings from the title have outperformed our expectations. To date, NBA 2K21 has sold in over 5 million units.\n As compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2020, net bookings for the NBA 2K series grew 28%, and recurrent consumer spending significantly exceeded our expectations, growing an incredible 76%. Consumer engagement with NBA 2K continues to increase with daily active users, MyCAREER users and MyTeam users growing significantly. Moreover, NBA 2K21 users have been more deeply engaged with the game, with average games played per user up 21% as compared to NBA 2K20 in the same period. \n Next week, NBA 2K21 will launch for next-gen platforms, which Karl will discuss shortly. I'd like to congratulate 2K and Visual Concepts for delivering another outstanding entry in this beloved franchise.\n Seven years after its initial release, Grand Theft Auto V continues to grow its audience. The title has now sold in over 135 million units and remains one of the most successful and iconic experiences in all of entertainment. In addition, recurrent consumer spending on Grand Theft Auto Online outperformed our second quarter forecast and was entitled the best second quarter ever in terms of both active players and new players. \n During the month of August, Rockstar Games released the Los Santos Summer Special for Grand Theft Auto Online, featuring a ray of new vehicles, co-op missions, business battles, racetrack, the open-wheel race creator and more. We continue to expect Grand Theft Auto Online to establish a new net bookings record in fiscal 2021.\n Red Dead Redemption 2 also outperformed, and to date, has sold in over 34 million units worldwide. Net bookings from Red Dead Redemption 2 grew an outstanding 124%, including 106% growth in full game sales. Engagement with and recurrent consumer spending on Red Dead Online continues to increase, with net bookings from the title surpassing expectations, growing 96%.\n Furthermore, the title grew 28% in audience, and growth in new players was 47%. During the second quarter, Rockstar Games added new content to Red Dead Online, including the natural list update, a new specialist role, including the ability to hunt, track and study legendary animals as well as new poaching missions and free roam events, 2 new weapons, the advanced camera and more, including the latest addition of Outlaw Pass, The Outlaw Pass #3.\n Throughout the coming year, Rockstar Games will continue to support both Red Dead Online and Grand Theft Auto Online with more content updates to keep new and returning players excited and engaged.\n In late summer, 2K enhanced further our sports simulation offerings with the release of PGA TOUR 2K21 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PC and Stadia. Developed by HB Studios, PGA TOUR 2K21 was universally lauded by consumers and critics, including game and former Golf Digest in U.S. day to day for being an incredibly fun, realistic and engaging entry into the category. The title has exceeded our expectations and to date has sold in over 1 million units. \n According to the MTD Group, PGA TOUR 2K21 was the fastest-selling golf game by units over the past 10 years. And in addition, according to Metacritic, the title is the highest-rated golf simulation of the current console generation. I'd like to congratulate the teams AT 2K and HB Studios who are continuing to support the game with additional post-launch content.\n During the second quarter, 2K also released WWE 2 Battlegrounds, a completely new WWE game featuring arcade-style brawling action for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PC and Stadia. We're very pleased to expand our WWE offerings with a title that provides both casual gamers and die-hard wrestling fans with an over-the-top, pick-up-and-play experience. The title has exceeded our expectations and is being supported with post-launch content. \n In addition, during the period, 2K released Mafia Definitive Edition for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC. The title, which has exceeded our sales expectations and received significant critical acclaim, was comprehensively remade from the ground up. The release of Mafia Definitive Edition completes the full Mafia: Trilogy, a collection featuring definitive editions of all 3 Mafia titles. The definitive additions of Mafia, Mafia 2 and Mafia 3 are available individually or as part of the trilogy. To date, these titles collectively sold in over 2 million units.\n Turning to Private Division. During the second quarter, the label released Peril on Gorgon, a narrative expansion for their award-winning RPG, The Outer Worlds, from Obsidian Entertainment. Peril on Gorgon is the first of 2 expansions that can be purchased individually or bundled at a discount in The Outer World's expansion pass. The Outer World's continues to outperform our expectations and has now sold in over 3 million units.\n Our second quarter results were also enhanced by a variety of other offerings, led by Borderlands 3, Social Point's mobile games and Sid Meier's Civilization VI.\n During the second quarter, recurrent consumer spending exceeded our expectations, growing 43% and accounted for 64% of net bookings. In addition to virtual currency for NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Red Dead Online, recurrent consumer spending was enhanced by the following offerings: in the free-to-play category, Social Point's live games, including Dragon City, Monster Legends, World Chef, Tasty Town and Word Life outperformed during the second quarter, matching the net bookings record achieved in the previous quarter. Live games delivered new fresh content, events and experiences to boost engagement and enhance the customer experience, and net bookings grew 55%. The studio continues to invest in its broad and innovative pipeline of more than 10 new games planned for launch in the coming years.\n WWE SuperCard also outperformed during the second quarter, growing 24%. The title has now been downloaded more than 22 million times and remains 2K's highest-grossing mobile title. Later this month, 2K will deliver season 7 of our popular free-to-play sports entertainment mobile game. \n And NBA 2K Online in China grew 13% and remains a significant contributor to our results. The title is the #1 PC online sports game in China with more than 50 million registered users. Add-on content grew 254% and outperformed expectations, led by offerings for the Borderlands Series and Sid Meier's Civilization VI.\n As a result of our better-than-expected second quarter performance and improved outlook for the back half of the year, we're increasing our outlook for fiscal 2021, which we expect to deliver a new record for net bookings of over $3 billion.\n In September, as part of our ongoing strategy to expand selectively our portfolio of owned intellectual property and to diversify and strengthen further our mobile offerings, we acquired Playdots, a long-standing leader in the mobile puzzle genre. Founded in 2013 and based in New York City, Playdots builds mobile games with unique and thoughtful designs. The studios created 3 hits, Dots, Two-Dots and Dots & Co., which have collectively been downloaded over 100 million times. They're best known for Two-Dots, which has been downloaded over 80 million times since its launch 6 years ago, and that continues to engage deeply audiences throughout the world. \n Playdot's near-term strategy for growth includes live ops technology and the addition of numerous features to its core games, such as scavenger hunts and social leader boards, which are driving meaningful long-term consumer engagement. \n In addition, Playdots will remain focused on existing IP and will continue to create new properties as they've done since their inception. We're very pleased to welcome Nir Efrat and the entire team at Playdots to the Take-Two family and are excited by the potential of their development pipeline and positive long-term contributions to our business.\n It bears noting that next week, we'll enter in an exciting new era in the history of our industry. The eagerly anticipated launches of 2 new gaming platforms from Microsoft and Sony marked the latest technological advances that promise to provide our world-class development teams with better platforms on which to captivate and engage our audiences. We're both prepared and thrilled to take this next step, and Karl will have more to share about our offerings for this next generation.\n As we've seen over the past several months, consumers' appetite for and participation in interactive entertainment has never been stronger. We believe that this trend, coupled with the fervor for new gaming platforms, bodes well for the upcoming holiday season, and that interactive entertainment will be among the most popular gift-giving items. \n Looking ahead, Take-Two has the strongest development pipeline in its history, including sequels from our biggest franchises as well as exciting new IP. We continue to make great strides to increase the scale of our enterprise, both organically and through selective inorganic accretive opportunities.\n In closing, our company remains superbly positioned creatively, operationally and financially to capitalize on the many positive trends in our industry and to deliver growth and returns for our shareholders over the long term. \n I'll now turn the call over to Karl. \nKarl Slatoff: Thanks, Strauss. I'd like to begin by thanking our teams for continuing their stellar work in achieving strong results that are lining up to deliver a record year for net bookings. Our culture of collaboration, coupled with the company's commitment to creating the best entertainment experiences, is driving our ongoing success and the ability to engage with audiences more deeply than ever before.\n I'll now discuss our recent and upcoming releases. As Strauss mentioned, we are very excited about next week's introduction of 2 new leading-edge gaming platforms. Through these new robust platforms, our development teams have an even greater ability to captivate and engage audiences with our renowned franchises and new intellectual properties. We are thrilled to deliver at launch 2 of 2K's most successful and popular franchises, NBA 2K and Borderlands for both platforms. \n NBA 2K21 was built from the ground up for next-generation consoles and will once again redefine the standard for sports simulations. In addition to unparalleled graphics and loading speeds, NBA 2K21 will introduce several initiatives to bridge current and new console generations of the game, including MyTeam cross-progression and the shared VC wallet within the same console families. \n Furthermore, NBA legend Kobe Bryant's lifetime achievement of basketball excellence is celebrated with the NBA 2K21 Mamba Forever Edition, which will provide players with seamless access to both current and next-generation versions of the game.\n Just yesterday, 2K released the trailer for The City, featuring a completely overhauled park experience, exclusive to NBA 2K21 on next-gen consoles. Originally introduced in NBA 2K14 for Xbox One and PS4, The Park helped push 2K forward by creating a competitive online basketball environment that allowed our quickly growing community to compete against each other outside of the authentic NBA experience. This experience has evolved over the years into the neighborhood and now what we have proudly introduced as The City, which is many times larger and more immersive community-based experience, only possible on next-gen consoles. It is Visual Concepts' most ambitious execution of a virtual basketball community.\n Borderlands 3 has been fully optimized for next-gen consoles, so Mayhem will be bigger and bolder than ever before. All players who own the game on current gen will be able to download the next-gen upgrade within the same console family for free. This free next-gen upgrade will add a number of exclusive features, including 4K resolution at 60 frames per second in single player and online co-op plus support for 3 and 4 player split-screen co-op. \n In addition, Rockstar Games has announced that they will bring their iconic Grand Theft Auto V to the next generation of consoles in the second half of calendar 2021 during fiscal year 2022. The new generation versions of the game will feature a range of technical improvements, visual upgrades and performance enhancements to take full advantage of the latest hardware, making the game more beautiful and more responsive than ever. For the community of Grand Theft Auto Online, the journey for this ever-evolving world will continue on the next-generation consoles with more new updates, including additional content exclusive to the new consoles and PC. There will also be new stand-alone version of Grand Theft Auto Online coming in the second half of calendar 2021, which will be available for free exclusively on PlayStation 5 during the first 3 months. Rockstar Games will share more details on the new versions of Grand Theft Auto V in the months ahead.\n Driving long-term consumer engagement with our titles after their initial launch remains a key strategic priority for our organization. There are a myriad of ways that our creative teams strive to do this. However, we are always focused on designing games with the goal of giving players experiences that far exceed their expectations and importantly, are worthy of their time and money. To that end, we recently released an array of add-on content for some of our key titles.\n Last month, 2K and HB Studios released 2 updates for our popular golf simulation, PGA TOUR 2K21. The 3 whole matchmaking update allows players to play a quick multiplayer around with friends. Two weeks ago, the team launched the Halloween update, featuring fun holiday theme cosmetic items to customize players and courses. Players can expect additional content to be released for PGA TOUR 2K21 throughout the year. \n In addition, the Private Division, in partnership with the European Space Agency, released their shared Horizon update for Kerbal Space Program for PS4 and Xbox One. The update celebrates the agency's contributions to space exploration and is free for all players of the critically acclaimed physics-based space simulation game. Private Division's new development studio, Intercept Games, remains hard at work on Kerbal Space Program 2, which is now planned for release during fiscal 2023.\n Tomorrow, 2K will release the first update for their new wrestling title WWE 2K Battlegrounds. The update features new superstars and legends that will be made available throughout the month, adding to the game's outrageous in and out of the ring action. 2K will make additional superstores available in December and will share more details in the coming weeks. More than a year after the initial launch of Borderlands 3, engagement with the title remains incredibly strong. Next week, due to the immense popularity and success of the title's add-on content strategy in Season Pass, 2K and Gearbox Software will launch a second season pass for the game. The Season Pass 2, which will be available for all previously released and all next-gen versions of the game, will include 2 brand-new content add-ons. The designers cut add-on will add all new ways to play Borderlands 3 by introducing a new skill tree for each ball hunter, a new stand-alone mode called Arms Race and more, while the Director's Cut add-on includes additional missions, end-game content and behind the scenes extras. Designers cut will be available for purchase starting on November 10, while Director's Cut is planned for release in spring of next year.\n Rockstar Games has announced that both Grand Theft Auto Online and Red Dead Online will receive major updates later this year, featuring an extension to existing frontier pursuits for Red Dead Online as well as Grand Theft Auto Online's biggest update ever, which will feature a new take on heists in a new location. Praxis Games will continue to deliver new content for Sid Meier's Civilization VI as part of their new Frontier pass for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PC and mobile, featuring new civilizations and leaders that will be made available on a bimonthly basis through the end of March 2021. Later this year, the new Frontier Pass will come to mobile platforms, and each pass will be available for individual purchase.\n And during the first half of calendar 2021, Private Division will release The Outer Worlds Murder on Eridanos, the second narrative expansion for their successful RPG from Obsidian Entertainment. The expansion will be available individually or at a discount as part of The Outer Worlds Expansion Pass, which also includes the previously released Peril on Gorgon.\n Turning to eSports. The NBA 2K League concluded its third season on August 28 with Wizards District Gaming winning the 2020 NBA 2K League Championships. All 2020 season games aired live on the NBA 2K League's Twitch channel in addition to select games airing live on ESPN2, ESPN digital platforms, Sportsnet in Canada and the NBA 2K League's YouTube channel, and on delay on eGG Network in Southeast Asia and local in India. Dash Radio's nothing but net channel also provided live game coverage. The NBA 2K League has begun the trial process for its fourth season set to take place in 2021.\n The new format will include more than 35 program tournaments hosted by league teams as part of the NBA 2K League Draft Prospect Series, featuring a first of its kind NBA 2K League combine. The league will enable 2K fans and players to engage with the league and showcase their excitement throughout the off-season by awarding draft eligibility on a rolling basis to members of the 2K community who excel in the tournaments as part of the draft prospect series. \n In addition, we continued to develop and showcase female 2K players. The league is involved with several elite all-women 2K teams who are participating in Pro-Am 2K tournaments throughout the year. We are very excited about the continued success and growth of the NBA 2K League, which has the long-term potential to enhance engagement and to be a driver of profits for our company.\n Looking ahead, we have the strongest pipe -- development pipeline in Take-Two's history as well as significant potential to drive increased engagement and recurrent consumer spending. In addition, we are investing in a number of emerging opportunities that have the potential to enhance our growth rate. Whether transitioning our audiences seamlessly onto new platforms, capitalizing on new business models and distribution channels or increasing our presence in emerging markets, Take-Two is exceedingly well positioned to generate value to consumers as well as growth and margin expansion for our company.\n I'll now turn the call over to Lainie. \nLainie Goldstein: Thanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our second quarter results and then review our financial outlook for the third quarter and fiscal year 2021. Please note that additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release.\n As Strauss mentioned, we delivered second quarter operating results that significantly exceeded our expectations. Net bookings grew to $958 million. This result exceeded our outlook of $775 million to $825 million, driven primarily by the outperformance of NBA 2K, PGA TOUR 2K21 and the Mafia Definitive Editions and Mafia: Trilogy. Digitally delivered net bookings grew 14% as compared to our flat outlook and accounted for 83% of the total. This result exceeded our outlook, primarily due to the outperformance of our current consumer spending. During the second quarter, 59% of sales of current generation console games were delivered digitally, up from 51% last year.\n Recurrent consumer spending grew 43% as compared to our outlook of 10% growth and accounted for 64% of total net bookings. This growth was driven primarily by NBA 2K, Social Point's mobile games, Red Dead Online and Red Dead Redemption 2 and Sid Meier's Civilization VI. \n GAAP net revenue was $841 million and cost of goods sold was $433 million. Operating expenses decreased by 7% to $293 million, due primarily to lower marketing expense. And GAAP net income grew to $99 million or $0.86 per share as compared to $72 million or $0.63 per share in the second quarter last year.\n Now to our guidance, starting with the fiscal third quarter. We project net bookings to range from $675 million to $725 million compared to $888 million in the third quarter last year, which benefited from the launch of Red Dead Redemption 2 on PC and The Outer Worlds. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K21, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Social Point's mobile games, Borderlands 3, Sid Meier's Civilization VI and PGA TOUR 2K21. We expect digitally delivered net bookings to be down approximately 15% due to lower digitally delivered sales of Red Dead Redemption 2 on PC and The Outer Worlds, which launched last year.\n Digitally delivered net bookings are projected to account for 82% of the total compared to 78% last year. Our forecast assumes that 71% of our current generation console in sales will be delivered digitally, up from 44% last year. We project recurrent consumer spending to grow by approximately 5%. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $760 million to $810 million and cost of goods sold to range from $291 million to $317 million.\n Operating expenses are expected to range from $325 million to $335 million. At the midpoint, this represents a 4% increase over last year, driven primarily by the addition of Playdots, higher research and development and IT expenses, partially offset by lower marketing and stock compensation expenses. And GAAP net income is expected to range from $128 million to $140 million or $1.10 to $1.21 per share.\n For management reporting purposes, we expect our tax rate to be 15% throughout fiscal 2021. We are increasing our full year outlook, which now includes record net bookings. This will be the third consecutive year that net bookings have grown. Our net bookings outlook range is now $3.15 billion to $3.25 billion, up from $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion. This is being driven by our second quarter outperformance, along with an updated forecast for the balance of the year, which has improved primarily due to higher recurrent consumer spending from NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online, Red Dead Online and the addition of Playdots as well as strong performance from Red Dead Redemption 2, PGA TOUR 2K21 and the Mafia Definitive Edition and Mafia: Trilogy. We expect growth over the prior year from NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online, Red Dead Online and Social Point's mobile games to be offset by lower results from Borderlands 3, Grand Theft Auto V and Red Dead Redemption 2. \n The largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Social Point's mobile games, Borderlands 3, Sid Meier's Civilization VI and PGA TOUR 2K21. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 55% 2K, 35% Rockstar Games and 10% Private Division, Social Point and Playdots. \n And we forecast our geographic net bookings split to be about 60% United States and 40% international. We now project digitally delivered net bookings to increase by approximately 15% as compared to our prior outlook of 3% growth. This growth is being driven by recurrent consumer spending and digitally delivered sales. As a percentage of our business, digital is projected to represent 87% of net bookings, up from 82% last year. \n Our forecast assumes that 70% of current generation console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 55% last year. We now expect recurrent consumer spending to grow by approximately 30% as compared to our prior outlook of 15% growth and to represent approximately 63% of net bookings as compared to 51% last year. This growth is being driven primarily by NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online, the addition of Playdots, Social Point's mobile games and Red Dead Online. We are increasing our non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow outlook to more than $650 million, up from our prior outlook of more than $500 million. We plan to deploy approximately $75 million for capital expenditures. \n We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $3.05 billion to $3.15 billion and cost of goods sold to range from $1.44 billion to $1.49 billion. Total operating expenses are expected to range from $1.21 billion to $1.23 billion. At the midpoint, this represents an 8% increase over the prior year driven by the addition of Playdots, higher headcount, research and development expense and charitable contributions, partially offset by lower marketing and stock compensation expenses. And we expect GAAP net income to range from $372 million to $403 million or $3.22 to $3.49 per share.\n In closing, fiscal 2021 is poised to be another year with record net bookings, despite a late release date. With our industry-leading creative assets, sound financial foundation and unwavering commitment to operational excellence, our company is superbly positioned to navigate these uncertain times, capitalize on positive industry trends and to deliver strong results for our shareholders over the long term. \n Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Strauss. \nStrauss Zelnick: Did you all hear that? Sorry, I apologize. Thanks, Lainie and Karl.\n On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to again thank our colleagues for their hard work, commitment to excellence and for delivering another exceptional quarter. To our shareholders, I would like to express our appreciation for your continued support, and we'll now take your questions and apologies for my failure with the mute button. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mario Lu with Barclays. \nX. Lu: Great. I have one on NBA and then one high level. So the one on NBA, The City does on next-gen was pretty amazing, and you're also bringing back affiliations, which is exciting. I believe this year is all the first time NBA 2K will have 2 different NBA seasons within 3 months of its release. So with that being said, anything you could provide in terms of the lift unit sales from both The City and the second NBA season and their impact on its fiscal 3Q guide would be helpful. \n And then secondly, Strauss, just curious if you have updated thoughts on the overall subscription model within video games. I think I agree with you that subscription may not translate well in this industry since users only play a few titles a year. But we've seen recently companies like Microsoft push hard with its game pass subscription. And then with the overall gaming audience expanding due to shelter-in-place and more casual titles like Fall Guys and Among Us being more popular. So just curious if your stance has -- on subscription has changed at all? \nKarl Slatoff: It's Karl. I'll take the first question on NBA. Obviously, yes, this is really the first time that we've got this kind of overlap in the season -- not only just our own, not only just the basketball seasons itself, but in our own game. Obviously, with what Strauss has said before, it's had a really positive impact with us because the net bookings for our series grew 28%, and recurrent consumer spending grew, I think, it was 76%. So these are really incredible results, and it's really exciting, but it's a bit of uncharted territory. And I can tell you that we couldn't be more thrilled about it. Because with the new platform coming out and with the NBA 2K21 being built from the ground up and also all of the new features that are coming up, well, I don't have specific lift numbers for you that are associated with The City itself. Obviously, that was a huge commitment made by the team at Visual Concepts and the 2K, and we're really, really excited about it. And anytime you do come out with something that could be a game changer for any game, but specifically for our game, we tend to see really excellent results. And we've already seen great results, and I think it's going to be even better when we launch our next-gen platform, and we're very excited about it. \nStrauss Zelnick: And Mario, regarding your question on subscriptions, no, I don't think our views have changed much. We're open-minded. We're highly skeptical that subscriptions will be the only way or the primary way that interactive entertainment is distributed, and that's because of the way people consume it and the price point for owning a title, which is very reasonable and very, very low, actually on a per hour basis. So I think it's unlikely that subscription sort of supplant frontline video game sales as the primary business model. Subscriptions can play a role in delivering catalog. We've supported numerous subscription offerings with catalog titles. I imagine we'll continue to do so. And in any case, at the end of the day, the consumer will decide, and we will be where the consumer is. \nOperator: Our next question is from Eric Handler with MKM Partners. \nEric Handler: Wondered if you can give us any updates about your thoughts on pricing. You've announced NBA 2K is going to have a $10 price increase console versus console system or next-gen versus current-gen. How are you thinking with that? And then I'll have a follow-up question. \nStrauss Zelnick: Yes. Thanks, Eric. Pricing is determined on a title-by-title basis. We already explained that the reason for the price that we set for NBA 2K21 for next-gen reflected the fact that there hasn't been a frontline price increase since 2005, and yet production costs have gone up 200% or 300% on the one hand, also because we believe we deliver vastly more value to the consumer than the price we charge, that's our goal at all times. As I said, on a per hour basis, interactive entertainment is an incredible bargain, and the U.S. has the lowest frontline pricing of anywhere on earth. So we think it makes sense, and we believe consumers are fine with it as a result. \nEric Handler: Okay. And then as a follow-up, Playdots, looks like it's potentially a very nice tuck-in acquisition. As you look at the M&A landscape, is there much out there for additional acquisitions? It seems like there's more mobile-type deals to be had rather than console-specific type companies, but I wonder if you could just give us some color on the M&A landscape. \nStrauss Zelnick: Look, we have seen an acceleration in M&A activity. Obviously, Microsoft is acquiring Bethesda, for example, which is a significant, I believe, $7-some-odd billion transaction, and so I think you're going to continue to see increased M&A activity just because of the heat around the category and the amount of capital that's being deployed by big companies to pursue it. From our point of view, we have almost $2.4 billion in cash. We have no debt, and we are anxious to build our business and aggressively doing so. And we use our capital to support organic growth, our primary story at Take-Two. We also will use our cash to acquire companies when they're strategically consonant and when those deals are accretive, and we return capital to the shareholders on a regular basis through buybacks. And that'll continue to be our approach. \nOperator: Our next question is from Drew Crum with Stifel. \nAndrew Crum: For Strauss or Karl, can you comment on cross-platform play and how you think about this across your portfolio? And specifically, if the next-gen version of GTA V will feature cross-play? And then I have a follow-up. \nHenry Diamond: Joe, it's Karl. We do think about cross-play a lot. And I think for a lot of games that are out in the market that do support cross-play makes a lot of sense. It's certainly something that's very intriguing to us. It's something that we're capable of doing. And obviously, it's not just our decision alone, there's platforms involved as well. We haven't made any specific announcements about cross-play. We are enabling certain cross-generational opportunities within our games. But in terms of cross-play, it's very interesting. I think it's from a player liquidity perspective, it can be a very compelling thing. But it also has some -- for some games, it also has certain limitations. If you're cross-playing between mobile and console games, it's not always the best experience for everybody. So there are considerations that you have to make when making those types of decisions. But obviously, we do consider it, and it's a great opportunity for our industry, in general, going into this next generation. \nAndrew Crum: Got it. Okay. And Lainie, if I heard you correctly, you indicated the RCS would be up 5% in the December quarter. Is that correct? \nLainie Goldstein: Yes, that's correct. For the third quarter. \nAndrew Crum: Can you talk about the assumed deceleration and how that aligns with the timing of the big updates for Rockstar Online? \nLainie Goldstein: So for GTA we have -- for Q3, we have it coming down in the third quarter versus last year. And when we look at GTA, we always sort of look at it being out for 7 years, and we think about the quarters going forward. And since it's something that has been out for so long, we tend to forecast it as coming down each quarter, and it always beats our expectations. So when we go out into the future, that seems to be have -- we guide for that title. \nAndrew Crum: Okay. Okay. \nLainie Goldstein: And the growth in the quarter is coming from the NBA title. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. \nMichael Ng: Strauss, I was wondering if you could provide your view on using free-to-play experiences to enhance the reach of your franchises. For instance, in the spirit of Call of Duty War Zone and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, would it ever make sense to make a free-to-play component available for GTA or NBA 2K? \nStrauss Zelnick: Well, look, we're pretty open-minded. And at the same time, we deliver the highest quality experiences in the business, and we charge much less for them than we believe they are worth to consumers, and then we deliver typically an ongoing component that is free. And that's already a great deal of value. Any monetization, of course, is totally optional. And unlike many sort of casual titles, the monetization is not necessary to enjoy the experience. It's an additional benefit, but there are no toll booths in any of our online games that are attached to our core games. We have, on occasion, promoted our games very cheaply or in a couple of instances, free, which effectively means you have access to the online component free as a promotion, and I wouldn't rule out the possibility of doing that. And of course, Rockstar has announced that GTA Online will be a stand-alone experience for next-gen coming in second half of 2021, and that it will be free for PS5 users for about 3 months.\n So as you can see, we're open-minded about our business model, and I wouldn't rule out the possibility that at some point, certain experiences can become free as a matter of the entry point. I like what I consider sort of tethered free-to-play, where 100% of the people acknowledge the value of the title and pay to play it. And on an ongoing basis, you have what is effectively a free-to-play experience attached that can go on for many years. Grand Theft Auto Online, of course, has been successful for 7 years and is expected to set a new record in this fiscal year, amazingly enough. I think that you're also implying another question, which is some of our competitors have taken legacy IP and created stand-alone mobile free-to-play titles related to that IP and branded that IP. And we have not done that yet, and we have not announced any plans to do it. And in the world in which we would do it, of course, would be when our labels are excited by the opportunity creatively and when we think we can deliver something to consumers that's absolutely stellar. \nOperator: Our next question is from Gerrick Johnson with BMO Capital Markets. \nGerrick Johnson: On NBA 2K, I have a 2-part question. So you decided to not offer free upgrades on the current to next-gen, but you did release Mamba Forever dual access for $100. So what did you see people do? Do you see people mix up immediately to Mamba Forever or maybe delay the purchase of 21 until next-gen comes out, so maybe we see a second wave? \nHenry Diamond: I mean I don't have any specifics to share -- this is Karl, by the way. I don't have any specific -- it's a great question. I don't have specifics to share with you about what activity we've seen. And by the way, it's kind of hard to know because we're still pretty early in it, and we've sold already 5 million units, and we've had lots of nice action around all of our SKUs, but we don't know what people would otherwise be doing. So it's sort of hard for us to know whether people are waiting or whether they're going for the Mamba now or they're just buying the current gen and they'll buy the next-gen later or just buy current gen. It all remains to be -- it's a little bit of uncharted territory, and it remains to be seen, but what we were very gracious for and proud of is the fact that the activity and the engagement around what we've seen so far has been incredible. So no matter how much it breaks down by SKU, I think we're looking at a really good release for NBA 2K21. \nGerrick Johnson: Okay. And by the way, there's $100,000 worth of virtual currency in Mamba Forever. So how much of that contributed to the 76% recurrent consumer spending growth in NBA? \nLainie Goldstein: We don't share that level of detail. \nOperator: Our next question is from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. \nMatthew Cost: It's Matt on for Brian. So kind of following up on The City content in NBA 2K. Are you seeing any new types of behavior, particularly in the last few months inside of the games, whether it's people socializing more rather than just playing games or kind of like new use cases that you're noticing players eke out and is The City's kind of an opportunity to expand on that and sort of like keep users stickier by adding new sorts of in-game activities? \n And then just secondly, I was just wondering if you could provide an update on the progress with some of the newer studios like 31st Union and Cloud Chamber. Is everything in place to sort of hit the pipeline you guys shared earlier this year? \nKarl Slatoff: Matt, it's Karl. In terms of The City, I think the real quick answer to the question is, really since The Park came back out in '14, we've seen more social activities in NBA, generally speaking. And as the environment has got more sophisticated and there is more things to do, that social activity has been increasing all along. And you see big jumps in that as well. When you come out -- when we move from The Park to the neighborhood, we saw a market difference in how people play in the game. You create events. People create their own events within the communities themselves. And the more that you give -- more that you content you give within these communities and within these spaces, within these worlds, it encourages people to spend more time there. And that's a really great thing from an engagement perspective because, number one, I think it does actually, people love it and driving engagement also drives economics for us, and that's one of our objectives. So building out The City was a huge endeavor that VC took on. We think it's going to be really well received. We think people are spending a lot of time in The City, and it really will take that whole concept of open world social gaming to another level in the context of NBA. So we're very excited. \nStrauss Zelnick: Yes, in terms of how things are going at our studios, particularly in our new studios, the answer is very, very well. We have an extraordinary pipeline. We've doubled our prior pipeline of releases over the next 5 years. You mentioned 2 of our studios, I'd really talk about all of our studios, and there are many now. And everything is looking great and is on target. We do not expect to see any slippage. And while I think working from home is really tough, and I admire our colleagues for doing such a great job doing it. It isn't the same as being in the office and yet we have not seen any slowdown in our expected cadence of releases. \nOperator: Our next question is from Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein. \nTodd Juenger: One sort of high-level one and then one housekeeping. The higher-level one, just following on, you've been asked so far about subscription and free-to-play and really every permutation of business model and platform. I'm going to ask sort of the mobile question version of that, if you don't mind, especially given you've seen some other AAA publishers be very aggressive, and you could argue successful in taking what used to be console IP, finding a big home for it, relatively big home for it in mobile. When you start to think about the role of mobile across your IP portfolio and studios, I wonder if you have any big ideas there, I think that fits for any of your big IP? And if so, do you have the sort of resources you need in-house to make that sort of development effort? \n And then the super quick one is, if you don't mind, so I know typically you guys aim to release a AAA frontline title generally every year outside of U.K. NBA 2K, you didn't have one this year. I wonder when you look at next year, do the remastered versions of GTA and RDR, does that fit your definition of a AAA console release or not? \nStrauss Zelnick: Yes, thanks. In terms of the portfolio of owned intellectual property, which we're very proud, we have 11 franchises that have sold over 5 million units with an individual release and over 60 that have sold over 2 million units, and they're some of the most extraordinary franchises in the entertainment business, never mind, the interactive entertainment business. I think I alluded to this earlier, we wouldn't rule out the possibility of making a stand-alone mobile title based on that intellectual property. It would be driven by the label's creative desire to do so in a belief that we can do an extraordinary job at it. We have a lot of talent in the mobile space now at numerous labels, Playdots, Social Point, 2K and others. And I don't doubt that we could put together the resources for the properties that make sense. So stay tuned on that topic. It is not lost on us that the biggest hits in the mobile business are native to the mobile business. They are not based on licensed IP, they're not based on console IP. The biggest hits are native to the business.\n And in terms of our ongoing lease schedule, we haven't said very much at all about fiscal '22. We have said that GTA Online and GTA V are coming for next-gen in the second half of calendar '21. We said the Kerbal Space Program 2 is coming in fiscal '23, but we will be talking about our release schedule for '22 in due time. And our goal remains the same, but it's too early to comment on what the release schedule will look like. \nKarl Slatoff: And to answer your question specifically, Todd, about the platform extensions and whether we consider them the part of our core gaming experience, we do. So we did say before the 93 titles, 63 that we mentioned that are in our pipeline, which is more than double what it was 5 years ago, by the way. 63 of those are core gaming experiences, and that includes 15 platform extensions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Alex Giaimo with Jefferies. \nAlexander Giaimo: Strauss, I think the messaging recently has been -- has still been for growth from the company as we think about next year, as we think about fiscal '22. Does that change at all as you continue to beat and raise expectations this year and the comp gets any more challenging or is the expectation still for growth next year? \nLainie Goldstein: So for fiscal year '22, given that we now expect net bookings of over $3 billion this fiscal year, it's too early to predict whether our business will grow next year. Our results this year have benefited from sheltering-at-home, and it remains to be seen whether that will continue to last into next year. So it's just a little bit too early to call at this point. \nOperator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Strauss Zelnick for closing comments. \nStrauss Zelnick: Thank you very much. On behalf of everyone at Take-Two, I'd like to wish you all a very happy and healthy holiday season. These are extraordinary times, and I wish you all the best through them. And once again, I'd like to thank all of our colleagues for their incredible work and for these extraordinary results. Have a great evening. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Karl Slatoff",
            "content": "Thanks, Strauss. I'd like to begin by thanking our teams for continuing their stellar work in achieving strong results that are lining up to deliver a record year for net bookings. Our culture of collaboration, coupled with the company's commitment to creating the best entertainment experiences, is driving our ongoing success and the ability to engage with audiences more deeply than ever before.\n I'll now discuss our recent and upcoming releases. As Strauss mentioned, we are very excited about next week's introduction of 2 new leading-edge gaming platforms. Through these new robust platforms, our development teams have an even greater ability to captivate and engage audiences with our renowned franchises and new intellectual properties. We are thrilled to deliver at launch 2 of 2K's most successful and popular franchises, NBA 2K and Borderlands for both platforms. \n NBA 2K21 was built from the ground up for next-generation consoles and will once again redefine the standard for sports simulations. In addition to unparalleled graphics and loading speeds, NBA 2K21 will introduce several initiatives to bridge current and new console generations of the game, including MyTeam cross-progression and the shared VC wallet within the same console families. \n Furthermore, NBA legend Kobe Bryant's lifetime achievement of basketball excellence is celebrated with the NBA 2K21 Mamba Forever Edition, which will provide players with seamless access to both current and next-generation versions of the game.\n Just yesterday, 2K released the trailer for The City, featuring a completely overhauled park experience, exclusive to NBA 2K21 on next-gen consoles. Originally introduced in NBA 2K14 for Xbox One and PS4, The Park helped push 2K forward by creating a competitive online basketball environment that allowed our quickly growing community to compete against each other outside of the authentic NBA experience. This experience has evolved over the years into the neighborhood and now what we have proudly introduced as The City, which is many times larger and more immersive community-based experience, only possible on next-gen consoles. It is Visual Concepts' most ambitious execution of a virtual basketball community.\n Borderlands 3 has been fully optimized for next-gen consoles, so Mayhem will be bigger and bolder than ever before. All players who own the game on current gen will be able to download the next-gen upgrade within the same console family for free. This free next-gen upgrade will add a number of exclusive features, including 4K resolution at 60 frames per second in single player and online co-op plus support for 3 and 4 player split-screen co-op. \n In addition, Rockstar Games has announced that they will bring their iconic Grand Theft Auto V to the next generation of consoles in the second half of calendar 2021 during fiscal year 2022. The new generation versions of the game will feature a range of technical improvements, visual upgrades and performance enhancements to take full advantage of the latest hardware, making the game more beautiful and more responsive than ever. For the community of Grand Theft Auto Online, the journey for this ever-evolving world will continue on the next-generation consoles with more new updates, including additional content exclusive to the new consoles and PC. There will also be new stand-alone version of Grand Theft Auto Online coming in the second half of calendar 2021, which will be available for free exclusively on PlayStation 5 during the first 3 months. Rockstar Games will share more details on the new versions of Grand Theft Auto V in the months ahead.\n Driving long-term consumer engagement with our titles after their initial launch remains a key strategic priority for our organization. There are a myriad of ways that our creative teams strive to do this. However, we are always focused on designing games with the goal of giving players experiences that far exceed their expectations and importantly, are worthy of their time and money. To that end, we recently released an array of add-on content for some of our key titles.\n Last month, 2K and HB Studios released 2 updates for our popular golf simulation, PGA TOUR 2K21. The 3 whole matchmaking update allows players to play a quick multiplayer around with friends. Two weeks ago, the team launched the Halloween update, featuring fun holiday theme cosmetic items to customize players and courses. Players can expect additional content to be released for PGA TOUR 2K21 throughout the year. \n In addition, the Private Division, in partnership with the European Space Agency, released their shared Horizon update for Kerbal Space Program for PS4 and Xbox One. The update celebrates the agency's contributions to space exploration and is free for all players of the critically acclaimed physics-based space simulation game. Private Division's new development studio, Intercept Games, remains hard at work on Kerbal Space Program 2, which is now planned for release during fiscal 2023.\n Tomorrow, 2K will release the first update for their new wrestling title WWE 2K Battlegrounds. The update features new superstars and legends that will be made available throughout the month, adding to the game's outrageous in and out of the ring action. 2K will make additional superstores available in December and will share more details in the coming weeks. More than a year after the initial launch of Borderlands 3, engagement with the title remains incredibly strong. Next week, due to the immense popularity and success of the title's add-on content strategy in Season Pass, 2K and Gearbox Software will launch a second season pass for the game. The Season Pass 2, which will be available for all previously released and all next-gen versions of the game, will include 2 brand-new content add-ons. The designers cut add-on will add all new ways to play Borderlands 3 by introducing a new skill tree for each ball hunter, a new stand-alone mode called Arms Race and more, while the Director's Cut add-on includes additional missions, end-game content and behind the scenes extras. Designers cut will be available for purchase starting on November 10, while Director's Cut is planned for release in spring of next year.\n Rockstar Games has announced that both Grand Theft Auto Online and Red Dead Online will receive major updates later this year, featuring an extension to existing frontier pursuits for Red Dead Online as well as Grand Theft Auto Online's biggest update ever, which will feature a new take on heists in a new location. Praxis Games will continue to deliver new content for Sid Meier's Civilization VI as part of their new Frontier pass for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PC and mobile, featuring new civilizations and leaders that will be made available on a bimonthly basis through the end of March 2021. Later this year, the new Frontier Pass will come to mobile platforms, and each pass will be available for individual purchase.\n And during the first half of calendar 2021, Private Division will release The Outer Worlds Murder on Eridanos, the second narrative expansion for their successful RPG from Obsidian Entertainment. The expansion will be available individually or at a discount as part of The Outer Worlds Expansion Pass, which also includes the previously released Peril on Gorgon.\n Turning to eSports. The NBA 2K League concluded its third season on August 28 with Wizards District Gaming winning the 2020 NBA 2K League Championships. All 2020 season games aired live on the NBA 2K League's Twitch channel in addition to select games airing live on ESPN2, ESPN digital platforms, Sportsnet in Canada and the NBA 2K League's YouTube channel, and on delay on eGG Network in Southeast Asia and local in India. Dash Radio's nothing but net channel also provided live game coverage. The NBA 2K League has begun the trial process for its fourth season set to take place in 2021.\n The new format will include more than 35 program tournaments hosted by league teams as part of the NBA 2K League Draft Prospect Series, featuring a first of its kind NBA 2K League combine. The league will enable 2K fans and players to engage with the league and showcase their excitement throughout the off-season by awarding draft eligibility on a rolling basis to members of the 2K community who excel in the tournaments as part of the draft prospect series. \n In addition, we continued to develop and showcase female 2K players. The league is involved with several elite all-women 2K teams who are participating in Pro-Am 2K tournaments throughout the year. We are very excited about the continued success and growth of the NBA 2K League, which has the long-term potential to enhance engagement and to be a driver of profits for our company.\n Looking ahead, we have the strongest pipe -- development pipeline in Take-Two's history as well as significant potential to drive increased engagement and recurrent consumer spending. In addition, we are investing in a number of emerging opportunities that have the potential to enhance our growth rate. Whether transitioning our audiences seamlessly onto new platforms, capitalizing on new business models and distribution channels or increasing our presence in emerging markets, Take-Two is exceedingly well positioned to generate value to consumers as well as growth and margin expansion for our company.\n I'll now turn the call over to Lainie. It's Karl. I'll take the first question on NBA. Obviously, yes, this is really the first time that we've got this kind of overlap in the season -- not only just our own, not only just the basketball seasons itself, but in our own game. Obviously, with what Strauss has said before, it's had a really positive impact with us because the net bookings for our series grew 28%, and recurrent consumer spending grew, I think, it was 76%. So these are really incredible results, and it's really exciting, but it's a bit of uncharted territory. And I can tell you that we couldn't be more thrilled about it. Because with the new platform coming out and with the NBA 2K21 being built from the ground up and also all of the new features that are coming up, well, I don't have specific lift numbers for you that are associated with The City itself. Obviously, that was a huge commitment made by the team at Visual Concepts and the 2K, and we're really, really excited about it. And anytime you do come out with something that could be a game changer for any game, but specifically for our game, we tend to see really excellent results. And we've already seen great results, and I think it's going to be even better when we launch our next-gen platform, and we're very excited about it. Matt, it's Karl. In terms of The City, I think the real quick answer to the question is, really since The Park came back out in '14, we've seen more social activities in NBA, generally speaking. And as the environment has got more sophisticated and there is more things to do, that social activity has been increasing all along. And you see big jumps in that as well. When you come out -- when we move from The Park to the neighborhood, we saw a market difference in how people play in the game. You create events. People create their own events within the communities themselves. And the more that you give -- more that you content you give within these communities and within these spaces, within these worlds, it encourages people to spend more time there. And that's a really great thing from an engagement perspective because, number one, I think it does actually, people love it and driving engagement also drives economics for us, and that's one of our objectives. So building out The City was a huge endeavor that VC took on. We think it's going to be really well received. We think people are spending a lot of time in The City, and it really will take that whole concept of open world social gaming to another level in the context of NBA. So we're very excited. And to answer your question specifically, Todd, about the platform extensions and whether we consider them the part of our core gaming experience, we do. So we did say before the 93 titles, 63 that we mentioned that are in our pipeline, which is more than double what it was 5 years ago, by the way. 63 of those are core gaming experiences, and that includes 15 platform extensions."

            "content": "Thanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our second quarter results and then review our financial outlook for the third quarter and fiscal year 2021. Please note that additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release.\n As Strauss mentioned, we delivered second quarter operating results that significantly exceeded our expectations. Net bookings grew to $958 million. This result exceeded our outlook of $775 million to $825 million, driven primarily by the outperformance of NBA 2K, PGA TOUR 2K21 and the Mafia Definitive Editions and Mafia: Trilogy. Digitally delivered net bookings grew 14% as compared to our flat outlook and accounted for 83% of the total. This result exceeded our outlook, primarily due to the outperformance of our current consumer spending. During the second quarter, 59% of sales of current generation console games were delivered digitally, up from 51% last year.\n Recurrent consumer spending grew 43% as compared to our outlook of 10% growth and accounted for 64% of total net bookings. This growth was driven primarily by NBA 2K, Social Point's mobile games, Red Dead Online and Red Dead Redemption 2 and Sid Meier's Civilization VI. \n GAAP net revenue was $841 million and cost of goods sold was $433 million. Operating expenses decreased by 7% to $293 million, due primarily to lower marketing expense. And GAAP net income grew to $99 million or $0.86 per share as compared to $72 million or $0.63 per share in the second quarter last year.\n Now to our guidance, starting with the fiscal third quarter. We project net bookings to range from $675 million to $725 million compared to $888 million in the third quarter last year, which benefited from the launch of Red Dead Redemption 2 on PC and The Outer Worlds. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K21, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Social Point's mobile games, Borderlands 3, Sid Meier's Civilization VI and PGA TOUR 2K21. We expect digitally delivered net bookings to be down approximately 15% due to lower digitally delivered sales of Red Dead Redemption 2 on PC and The Outer Worlds, which launched last year.\n Digitally delivered net bookings are projected to account for 82% of the total compared to 78% last year. Our forecast assumes that 71% of our current generation console in sales will be delivered digitally, up from 44% last year. We project recurrent consumer spending to grow by approximately 5%. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $760 million to $810 million and cost of goods sold to range from $291 million to $317 million.\n Operating expenses are expected to range from $325 million to $335 million. At the midpoint, this represents a 4% increase over last year, driven primarily by the addition of Playdots, higher research and development and IT expenses, partially offset by lower marketing and stock compensation expenses. And GAAP net income is expected to range from $128 million to $140 million or $1.10 to $1.21 per share.\n For management reporting purposes, we expect our tax rate to be 15% throughout fiscal 2021. We are increasing our full year outlook, which now includes record net bookings. This will be the third consecutive year that net bookings have grown. Our net bookings outlook range is now $3.15 billion to $3.25 billion, up from $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion. This is being driven by our second quarter outperformance, along with an updated forecast for the balance of the year, which has improved primarily due to higher recurrent consumer spending from NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online, Red Dead Online and the addition of Playdots as well as strong performance from Red Dead Redemption 2, PGA TOUR 2K21 and the Mafia Definitive Edition and Mafia: Trilogy. We expect growth over the prior year from NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online, Red Dead Online and Social Point's mobile games to be offset by lower results from Borderlands 3, Grand Theft Auto V and Red Dead Redemption 2. \n The largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Social Point's mobile games, Borderlands 3, Sid Meier's Civilization VI and PGA TOUR 2K21. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 55% 2K, 35% Rockstar Games and 10% Private Division, Social Point and Playdots. \n And we forecast our geographic net bookings split to be about 60% United States and 40% international. We now project digitally delivered net bookings to increase by approximately 15% as compared to our prior outlook of 3% growth. This growth is being driven by recurrent consumer spending and digitally delivered sales. As a percentage of our business, digital is projected to represent 87% of net bookings, up from 82% last year. \n Our forecast assumes that 70% of current generation console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 55% last year. We now expect recurrent consumer spending to grow by approximately 30% as compared to our prior outlook of 15% growth and to represent approximately 63% of net bookings as compared to 51% last year. This growth is being driven primarily by NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online, the addition of Playdots, Social Point's mobile games and Red Dead Online. We are increasing our non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow outlook to more than $650 million, up from our prior outlook of more than $500 million. We plan to deploy approximately $75 million for capital expenditures. \n We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $3.05 billion to $3.15 billion and cost of goods sold to range from $1.44 billion to $1.49 billion. Total operating expenses are expected to range from $1.21 billion to $1.23 billion. At the midpoint, this represents an 8% increase over the prior year driven by the addition of Playdots, higher headcount, research and development expense and charitable contributions, partially offset by lower marketing and stock compensation expenses. And we expect GAAP net income to range from $372 million to $403 million or $3.22 to $3.49 per share.\n In closing, fiscal 2021 is poised to be another year with record net bookings, despite a late release date. With our industry-leading creative assets, sound financial foundation and unwavering commitment to operational excellence, our company is superbly positioned to navigate these uncertain times, capitalize on positive industry trends and to deliver strong results for our shareholders over the long term. \n Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Strauss. Yes, that's correct. For the third quarter. So for GTA we have -- for Q3, we have it coming down in the third quarter versus last year. And when we look at GTA, we always sort of look at it being out for 7 years, and we think about the quarters going forward. And since it's something that has been out for so long, we tend to forecast it as coming down each quarter, and it always beats our expectations. So when we go out into the future, that seems to be have -- we guide for that title. And the growth in the quarter is coming from the NBA title. We don't share that level of detail. So for fiscal year '22, given that we now expect net bookings of over $3 billion this fiscal year, it's too early to predict whether our business will grow next year. Our results this year have benefited from sheltering-at-home, and it remains to be seen whether that will continue to last into next year. So it's just a little bit too early to call at this point."

            "name": "Strauss Zelnick",
            "content": "Thanks, Hank. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. I'd like to begin by acknowledging those who have been affected by the global pandemic. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to express our deepest sympathies and shared hope that in time, this crisis shall pass. We remain immensely grateful to everyone who serves on the front lines caring for those in need and helping the world navigate these challenging times.\n I'm pleased to report that our positive momentum continued in the second quarter with operating results that significantly exceeded our expectations. Our stellar results were highlighted by the outperformance of NBA 2K, PGA Tour 2K21 and the Mafia Definitive Editions and Mafia: Trilogy. \n Our ability to deliver the highest quality entertainment experiences to our audiences during these challenging times is a reflection of the professionalism and the passion of our entire organization. I'm immensely proud of our teams throughout the world that embody our core tenets of creativity, innovation and efficiency. \n On September 4, 2K and Visual Concepts launched NBA 2K21, the latest installment in our industry-leading basketball simulation series for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PC and Stadia. The title is off to a remarkable start, and net bookings from the title have outperformed our expectations. To date, NBA 2K21 has sold in over 5 million units.\n As compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2020, net bookings for the NBA 2K series grew 28%, and recurrent consumer spending significantly exceeded our expectations, growing an incredible 76%. Consumer engagement with NBA 2K continues to increase with daily active users, MyCAREER users and MyTeam users growing significantly. Moreover, NBA 2K21 users have been more deeply engaged with the game, with average games played per user up 21% as compared to NBA 2K20 in the same period. \n Next week, NBA 2K21 will launch for next-gen platforms, which Karl will discuss shortly. I'd like to congratulate 2K and Visual Concepts for delivering another outstanding entry in this beloved franchise.\n Seven years after its initial release, Grand Theft Auto V continues to grow its audience. The title has now sold in over 135 million units and remains one of the most successful and iconic experiences in all of entertainment. In addition, recurrent consumer spending on Grand Theft Auto Online outperformed our second quarter forecast and was entitled the best second quarter ever in terms of both active players and new players. \n During the month of August, Rockstar Games released the Los Santos Summer Special for Grand Theft Auto Online, featuring a ray of new vehicles, co-op missions, business battles, racetrack, the open-wheel race creator and more. We continue to expect Grand Theft Auto Online to establish a new net bookings record in fiscal 2021.\n Red Dead Redemption 2 also outperformed, and to date, has sold in over 34 million units worldwide. Net bookings from Red Dead Redemption 2 grew an outstanding 124%, including 106% growth in full game sales. Engagement with and recurrent consumer spending on Red Dead Online continues to increase, with net bookings from the title surpassing expectations, growing 96%.\n Furthermore, the title grew 28% in audience, and growth in new players was 47%. During the second quarter, Rockstar Games added new content to Red Dead Online, including the natural list update, a new specialist role, including the ability to hunt, track and study legendary animals as well as new poaching missions and free roam events, 2 new weapons, the advanced camera and more, including the latest addition of Outlaw Pass, The Outlaw Pass #3.\n Throughout the coming year, Rockstar Games will continue to support both Red Dead Online and Grand Theft Auto Online with more content updates to keep new and returning players excited and engaged.\n In late summer, 2K enhanced further our sports simulation offerings with the release of PGA TOUR 2K21 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PC and Stadia. Developed by HB Studios, PGA TOUR 2K21 was universally lauded by consumers and critics, including game and former Golf Digest in U.S. day to day for being an incredibly fun, realistic and engaging entry into the category. The title has exceeded our expectations and to date has sold in over 1 million units. \n According to the MTD Group, PGA TOUR 2K21 was the fastest-selling golf game by units over the past 10 years. And in addition, according to Metacritic, the title is the highest-rated golf simulation of the current console generation. I'd like to congratulate the teams AT 2K and HB Studios who are continuing to support the game with additional post-launch content.\n During the second quarter, 2K also released WWE 2 Battlegrounds, a completely new WWE game featuring arcade-style brawling action for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PC and Stadia. We're very pleased to expand our WWE offerings with a title that provides both casual gamers and die-hard wrestling fans with an over-the-top, pick-up-and-play experience. The title has exceeded our expectations and is being supported with post-launch content. \n In addition, during the period, 2K released Mafia Definitive Edition for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC. The title, which has exceeded our sales expectations and received significant critical acclaim, was comprehensively remade from the ground up. The release of Mafia Definitive Edition completes the full Mafia: Trilogy, a collection featuring definitive editions of all 3 Mafia titles. The definitive additions of Mafia, Mafia 2 and Mafia 3 are available individually or as part of the trilogy. To date, these titles collectively sold in over 2 million units.\n Turning to Private Division. During the second quarter, the label released Peril on Gorgon, a narrative expansion for their award-winning RPG, The Outer Worlds, from Obsidian Entertainment. Peril on Gorgon is the first of 2 expansions that can be purchased individually or bundled at a discount in The Outer World's expansion pass. The Outer World's continues to outperform our expectations and has now sold in over 3 million units.\n Our second quarter results were also enhanced by a variety of other offerings, led by Borderlands 3, Social Point's mobile games and Sid Meier's Civilization VI.\n During the second quarter, recurrent consumer spending exceeded our expectations, growing 43% and accounted for 64% of net bookings. In addition to virtual currency for NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Red Dead Online, recurrent consumer spending was enhanced by the following offerings: in the free-to-play category, Social Point's live games, including Dragon City, Monster Legends, World Chef, Tasty Town and Word Life outperformed during the second quarter, matching the net bookings record achieved in the previous quarter. Live games delivered new fresh content, events and experiences to boost engagement and enhance the customer experience, and net bookings grew 55%. The studio continues to invest in its broad and innovative pipeline of more than 10 new games planned for launch in the coming years.\n WWE SuperCard also outperformed during the second quarter, growing 24%. The title has now been downloaded more than 22 million times and remains 2K's highest-grossing mobile title. Later this month, 2K will deliver season 7 of our popular free-to-play sports entertainment mobile game. \n And NBA 2K Online in China grew 13% and remains a significant contributor to our results. The title is the #1 PC online sports game in China with more than 50 million registered users. Add-on content grew 254% and outperformed expectations, led by offerings for the Borderlands Series and Sid Meier's Civilization VI.\n As a result of our better-than-expected second quarter performance and improved outlook for the back half of the year, we're increasing our outlook for fiscal 2021, which we expect to deliver a new record for net bookings of over $3 billion.\n In September, as part of our ongoing strategy to expand selectively our portfolio of owned intellectual property and to diversify and strengthen further our mobile offerings, we acquired Playdots, a long-standing leader in the mobile puzzle genre. Founded in 2013 and based in New York City, Playdots builds mobile games with unique and thoughtful designs. The studios created 3 hits, Dots, Two-Dots and Dots & Co., which have collectively been downloaded over 100 million times. They're best known for Two-Dots, which has been downloaded over 80 million times since its launch 6 years ago, and that continues to engage deeply audiences throughout the world. \n Playdot's near-term strategy for growth includes live ops technology and the addition of numerous features to its core games, such as scavenger hunts and social leader boards, which are driving meaningful long-term consumer engagement. \n In addition, Playdots will remain focused on existing IP and will continue to create new properties as they've done since their inception. We're very pleased to welcome Nir Efrat and the entire team at Playdots to the Take-Two family and are excited by the potential of their development pipeline and positive long-term contributions to our business.\n It bears noting that next week, we'll enter in an exciting new era in the history of our industry. The eagerly anticipated launches of 2 new gaming platforms from Microsoft and Sony marked the latest technological advances that promise to provide our world-class development teams with better platforms on which to captivate and engage our audiences. We're both prepared and thrilled to take this next step, and Karl will have more to share about our offerings for this next generation.\n As we've seen over the past several months, consumers' appetite for and participation in interactive entertainment has never been stronger. We believe that this trend, coupled with the fervor for new gaming platforms, bodes well for the upcoming holiday season, and that interactive entertainment will be among the most popular gift-giving items. \n Looking ahead, Take-Two has the strongest development pipeline in its history, including sequels from our biggest franchises as well as exciting new IP. We continue to make great strides to increase the scale of our enterprise, both organically and through selective inorganic accretive opportunities.\n In closing, our company remains superbly positioned creatively, operationally and financially to capitalize on the many positive trends in our industry and to deliver growth and returns for our shareholders over the long term. \n I'll now turn the call over to Karl. Did you all hear that? Sorry, I apologize. Thanks, Lainie and Karl.\n On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to again thank our colleagues for their hard work, commitment to excellence and for delivering another exceptional quarter. To our shareholders, I would like to express our appreciation for your continued support, and we'll now take your questions and apologies for my failure with the mute button. And Mario, regarding your question on subscriptions, no, I don't think our views have changed much. We're open-minded. We're highly skeptical that subscriptions will be the only way or the primary way that interactive entertainment is distributed, and that's because of the way people consume it and the price point for owning a title, which is very reasonable and very, very low, actually on a per hour basis. So I think it's unlikely that subscription sort of supplant frontline video game sales as the primary business model. Subscriptions can play a role in delivering catalog. We've supported numerous subscription offerings with catalog titles. I imagine we'll continue to do so. And in any case, at the end of the day, the consumer will decide, and we will be where the consumer is. Yes. Thanks, Eric. Pricing is determined on a title-by-title basis. We already explained that the reason for the price that we set for NBA 2K21 for next-gen reflected the fact that there hasn't been a frontline price increase since 2005, and yet production costs have gone up 200% or 300% on the one hand, also because we believe we deliver vastly more value to the consumer than the price we charge, that's our goal at all times. As I said, on a per hour basis, interactive entertainment is an incredible bargain, and the U.S. has the lowest frontline pricing of anywhere on earth. So we think it makes sense, and we believe consumers are fine with it as a result. Look, we have seen an acceleration in M&A activity. Obviously, Microsoft is acquiring Bethesda, for example, which is a significant, I believe, $7-some-odd billion transaction, and so I think you're going to continue to see increased M&A activity just because of the heat around the category and the amount of capital that's being deployed by big companies to pursue it. From our point of view, we have almost $2.4 billion in cash. We have no debt, and we are anxious to build our business and aggressively doing so. And we use our capital to support organic growth, our primary story at Take-Two. We also will use our cash to acquire companies when they're strategically consonant and when those deals are accretive, and we return capital to the shareholders on a regular basis through buybacks. And that'll continue to be our approach. Well, look, we're pretty open-minded. And at the same time, we deliver the highest quality experiences in the business, and we charge much less for them than we believe they are worth to consumers, and then we deliver typically an ongoing component that is free. And that's already a great deal of value. Any monetization, of course, is totally optional. And unlike many sort of casual titles, the monetization is not necessary to enjoy the experience. It's an additional benefit, but there are no toll booths in any of our online games that are attached to our core games. We have, on occasion, promoted our games very cheaply or in a couple of instances, free, which effectively means you have access to the online component free as a promotion, and I wouldn't rule out the possibility of doing that. And of course, Rockstar has announced that GTA Online will be a stand-alone experience for next-gen coming in second half of 2021, and that it will be free for PS5 users for about 3 months.\n So as you can see, we're open-minded about our business model, and I wouldn't rule out the possibility that at some point, certain experiences can become free as a matter of the entry point. I like what I consider sort of tethered free-to-play, where 100% of the people acknowledge the value of the title and pay to play it. And on an ongoing basis, you have what is effectively a free-to-play experience attached that can go on for many years. Grand Theft Auto Online, of course, has been successful for 7 years and is expected to set a new record in this fiscal year, amazingly enough. I think that you're also implying another question, which is some of our competitors have taken legacy IP and created stand-alone mobile free-to-play titles related to that IP and branded that IP. And we have not done that yet, and we have not announced any plans to do it. And in the world in which we would do it, of course, would be when our labels are excited by the opportunity creatively and when we think we can deliver something to consumers that's absolutely stellar. Yes, in terms of how things are going at our studios, particularly in our new studios, the answer is very, very well. We have an extraordinary pipeline. We've doubled our prior pipeline of releases over the next 5 years. You mentioned 2 of our studios, I'd really talk about all of our studios, and there are many now. And everything is looking great and is on target. We do not expect to see any slippage. And while I think working from home is really tough, and I admire our colleagues for doing such a great job doing it. It isn't the same as being in the office and yet we have not seen any slowdown in our expected cadence of releases. Yes, thanks. In terms of the portfolio of owned intellectual property, which we're very proud, we have 11 franchises that have sold over 5 million units with an individual release and over 60 that have sold over 2 million units, and they're some of the most extraordinary franchises in the entertainment business, never mind, the interactive entertainment business. I think I alluded to this earlier, we wouldn't rule out the possibility of making a stand-alone mobile title based on that intellectual property. It would be driven by the label's creative desire to do so in a belief that we can do an extraordinary job at it. We have a lot of talent in the mobile space now at numerous labels, Playdots, Social Point, 2K and others. And I don't doubt that we could put together the resources for the properties that make sense. So stay tuned on that topic. It is not lost on us that the biggest hits in the mobile business are native to the mobile business. They are not based on licensed IP, they're not based on console IP. The biggest hits are native to the business.\n And in terms of our ongoing lease schedule, we haven't said very much at all about fiscal '22. We have said that GTA Online and GTA V are coming for next-gen in the second half of calendar '21. We said the Kerbal Space Program 2 is coming in fiscal '23, but we will be talking about our release schedule for '22 in due time. And our goal remains the same, but it's too early to comment on what the release schedule will look like. Thank you very much. On behalf of everyone at Take-Two, I'd like to wish you all a very happy and healthy holiday season. These are extraordinary times, and I wish you all the best through them. And once again, I'd like to thank all of our colleagues for their incredible work and for these extraordinary results. Have a great evening."

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Hank Diamond. Thank you. You may begin. \nHenry Diamond: Good afternoon. Welcome, and thank you for joining Take-Two's conference call to discuss its results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 ended June 30, 2020. Today's call will be led by Strauss Zelnick, Take-Two's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Karl Slatoff, our President; and Lainie Goldstein, our Chief Financial Officer.

In addition, we have posted to our website a slide deck that visually presents our results and financial outlook. Our press release and filings with the SEC may be obtained from our website at www.take2games.com. And now I'll turn the call over to Strauss. \nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks, Hank. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. I'd like to start by expressing, on behalf of our entire management team, our deepest sympathies for those who have been and continued to be affected by this pandemic. We're immensely grateful to everyone who serves on the front lines caring for people in need and helping the world navigate this crisis. \n Turning to our business. Fiscal 2021 is off to a terrific start with first quarter operating results that significantly exceeded our expectations, including fiscal first quarter records for GAAP net revenue and net bookings. Our outstanding results were driven by the outperformance of NBA 2K20, Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online and Social Point's mobile games. I remain incredibly proud of our entire organization, which exemplifies our core tenets of creativity, innovation and efficiency, and continues to deliver industry-leading entertainment experiences to our audiences during these challenging times. \n In the first quarter, NBA 2K20 significantly outperformed expectations and recently achieved a franchise milestone of $1 billion in net bookings since launch. Consumer engagement with NBA 2K continues to increase with daily active users growing 82%, MyCAREER users growing 78% and MyTeam users up a remarkable 108% as compared to the first quarter of last year. \n Recurrent consumer spending in NBA 2K grew 126% to a new record and remained the largest contributor to that part of our business. To date, NBA 2K20 has sold an over 14 million units, up over 18% compared with NBA 2K19 in the same time frame. We expect that lifetime units, recurrent consumer spending and net bookings for NBA 2K20 will be the highest ever for a 2K sports title. \n Nearly 7 years after its initial release, sales of Grand Theft Auto V continue to exceed expectations. The title has now sold in nearly 135 million units and remains the standard bearer of the current console generation. In addition, recurrent consumer spending on Grand Theft Auto Online outperformed our forecast, growing 155% to a new record. \n In April, Rockstar Games released Gerald's Last Play, a series of 6 new contact missions for Grand Theft Auto Online. The first quarter was the second best period ever for new player acquisitions since the title's launch in 2013. The unprecedented player volume trend started with the superlative performance of The Diamond Casino & Resort update in July 2019 and drove record average multiplayer MAUs through August 2019, persisted with sequential records in average multiplayer MAUs from December 2019 through May 2020. We now expect Grand Theft Auto Online to establish a new net bookings record in fiscal 2021. \n In addition, the partnership with Epic Games Store for Grand Theft Auto V was offered free for a week in mid-May, was a contributing factor to the strong performance of Grand Theft Auto Online and did not come at the expense of paid sales of the title. In fact, Grand Theft Auto V sold through more units in the period than any first quarter since the title's launch in 2013. And in the 6 weeks following the Epic Store promotion, Grand Theft Auto V sold more units than in the same period in any previous year. \n Red Dead Redemption 2 also outperformed, and to date has sold in more than 32 million units worldwide. The title sold through twice as many units compared to last year. Engagement with and recurrent consumer spending on Red Dead Online continues to increase. The title acquired nearly twice as many users year-over-year, and average multiplayer MAUs grew 50%. Net bookings from Red Dead Online surpassed expectations, growing 118%, excluding digital content bundled with the Red Dead Redemption 2 Premium Editions. During the first quarter, Rockstar Games added new content to Red Dead Online including 6 new maps to Showdown Mode. Through the coming year, Rockstar Games will continue to support both Red Dead Online and Grand Theft Auto Online with more content updates to keep new and returning players excited and engaged. \n Borderlands 3 continues to expand its audience and to date has sold in over 10.5 million units worldwide, up 69% over Borderlands 2 in the same period. During the first quarter, 2K and Gearbox launched Bounty of Blood. The third of 4 announced paid campaigns that are included in the Borderlands 3 Super Deluxe Edition and the Season Pass, or are available for purchase separately upon release. The Season Pass attach rate for Borderlands 3 continues to be the highest in 2K's history, and there's more content coming. \n In the period, MAUs grew as sales continued at a steady pace with the consistent release of free and paid content. We attribute this ongoing success in part to 2K's and Gearbox Software's continued efforts to support Borderlands 3 as a live service game, which should continue to benefit the title and series over the long term. \n Private Division's critical and commercial success, The Outer Worlds, outperformed expectations in the first quarter and has now sold in 2.8 million units. On June 5, the title was released for Nintendo Switch. In addition, Private Division launched Disintegration, a new sci-fi first person shooter experience that blends real-time tactical elements for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC. \n During the first quarter, 2K released Mafia II Definitive Edition and Mafia III Definitive Edition as part of the Mafia Trilogy, which combines all 3 previously released Mafia titles into a single package for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC, curated by 2K's Hangar 13 studio. Mafia I Definitive Edition will become available on September 25 as Karl will discuss shortly. \n 2K also bolstered our offerings for Nintendo Switch with some of our most beloved and successful franchises, including Bioshock: The Collection, The Borderlands Legendary Collection and the XCOM 2 Collection. In addition, 2K and Firaxis Games released XCOM: Chimera Squad, an all-new stand-alone title in the award-winning, turn-based XCOM series for PC. Our first quarter results were also enhanced by a variety of other offerings, led by Social Point's Sid Meier's Civilization VI and the WWE series. \n During the first quarter, recurrent consumer spending exceeded expectations, growing 127% to a new record and accounted for 65% of net bookings. In addition to virtual currency for NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Red Dead Online, recurrent consumer spending was enhanced by the following offerings. \n In the free-to-play category, Social Point outperformed expectations, growing 54% to a fiscal first quarter record, driven primarily by the exceptional performance of its 2 biggest games, Dragon City and Monster Legends. The studio continues to invest in its broad and innovative pipeline of more than 10 new games planned for launch in the coming years. WWE SuperCard also outperformed during the first quarter, growing 54%. And the title has now been downloaded more than 21 million times and remains 2K's highest grossing mobile title. And NBA 2K Online in China remains a significant contributor to our results. The title is the #1 PC online sports game in China with nearly 50 million registered users. \n Add-on content grew 135% and outperformed expectations, led by offerings for the Borderlands franchise, Sid Meier's Civilization VI and XCOM 2. As a result of our outperformance in the first quarter, along with a higher forecast for the balance of the year, we're raising our outlook for fiscal 2021, which is well underway to be another great year for Take-Two. \n Looking ahead, our company has the strongest development pipeline in its history, including sequels from our biggest franchises as well as exciting new IP. We've made great strides to increase the scale of our enterprise, and our current pipeline is more than double what it was 5 years ago in terms of number of games, including 54% internally developed titles and 46% externally developed titles. \n In closing, we continue to prepare for our industry's forthcoming transition to a new console cycle, which will provide our world-class development teams with a better platform on which to captivate and engage our audiences. Our company remains superbly positioned, creatively, operationally and financially to capitalize on the many positive trends in our industry and to deliver returns for our shareholders over the long term. I'll now turn the call over to Karl. \nKarl Slatoff: Thanks, Strauss. I'd like to begin by thanking our teams for delivering an excellent start to the year. The work being accomplished across our company is a shining example of what can be achieved through our culture of collaboration, which is more important than ever during these challenging times. \n I'll now discuss our recent and upcoming releases. On July 1, Private Division, in partnership with the European Space Agency, launched a new update for Kerbal Space Program for PC entitled Shared Horizons. The update, which will also be available later this year on consoles, celebrates ESA's outstanding contribution to space exploration and is free for all players of the critically-acclaimed, physics-based space simulation game. \n In addition, Private Division's new development studio, Intercept Games, remains hard at work on Kerbal Space Program 2, which is expected to launch in the fall of 2021. \n On July 23, Firaxis Games released Ethiopia Pack as part of the bimonthly release of 6 downloadable content packs for the all-new Sid Meier's Civilization VI New Frontier Pass for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and PC.

In the coming weeks, 2K and Gearbox will have more to share on their upcoming content releases to support and further expand the audience for Borderlands 3. \n Rockstar also announced an upcoming summer update to Grand Theft Auto Online, and both Grand Theft Auto Online and Red Dead Online will receive major updates later this fiscal year, featuring an extension to existing Frontier Pursuits for Red Dead Online as well as Grand Theft Auto Online's biggest update ever, featuring a new take on heists in a new location. \n Throughout fiscal 2021, we will continue to support our titles with innovative post-launch content that drives engagement and recurrent consumer spending. In addition, Social Point and 2K will continue to broaden our offerings for mobile devices. \n Looking ahead to fiscal year 2022, Rockstar Games also announced that they will bring their beloved and iconic Grand Theft Auto V to the next-generation of consoles in the second half of calendar 2021. The new generation versions of the game will feature a range of technical improvements, visual upgrades and performance enhancements to take full advantage of the latest hardware, making the game more beautiful and more responsive than ever. For the community of Grand Theft Auto Online, the journey through this ever-evolving world will continue on the next-generation consoles with more new updates, including additional content exclusive to the new consoles and PC. There will also be a new stand-alone version of Grand Theft Auto Online coming in the second half of calendar 2021, which will be available for free exclusively for PlayStation 5 players during the first 3 months. Rockstar Games will share more details on the new versions of Grand Theft Auto V in the months ahead. \n Last week, Private Division announced the signing of 3 new publishing arrangements -- agreements with top independent developers Moon Studios, League of Geeks and Roll7. These partnerships will expand the label's portfolio of titles that includes Kerbal Space Program franchise, The Outer Worlds, Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey and Disintegration. \n Moon Studios, founded in 2010 by Thomas Mahler and Gennadiy Korol, is a BAFTA award-winning studio, best known for developing the critically acclaimed Ori and The Blind Forest and Ori and The Will of The Wisps. Moon Studios is working on creating a compelling new action RPG. \n League of Geeks, founded in 2011 by Trent Kuster, Blake Mizzi and Ty Carey, are renowned for developing the PC game Armello, which combines deep tactical card play, rich tabletop strategy and RPG elements. Located in Melbourne, League of Geeks is looking to expand upon its initial success with an ambitious new intellectual property. \n Roll7 is a BAFTA multi-award winning independent studio founded in London in 2008 by Simon Bennett, John Ribbins and Tom Hegarty. Roll7 created the OlliOlli series, Not A Hero and Laser League. They are working with Private Division on their next job forward in their mission to create awesome flow state games. The first of these titles is expected to launch in fiscal 2022. \n Also last week, 2K announced a partnership with OneTeam Partners and the National Football League Players Association that will allow the label to include the names, numbers, images and likenesses for over 2,000 current NFL players in multiple nonsimulation football games that are currently in development and set a launch starting in calendar year 2021 during fiscal 2022. We are thrilled to be back in the business with NFL, which is one of the most successful sport brands in the world. We are confident that our forthcoming NFL offerings will be extremely fun, highly engaging and deeply social experiences. \n Turning to eSports. We are very excited about the continued progress and growth of the NBA 2K League, which is currently in its third season. These playoffs will run between August 19 and 22, prior to the finals on August 29. The league has been steadily building its portfolio of high-profile partnerships and sponsorships, including Anheuser-Busch, AT&T, Champion Athleticwear, GameStop, HyperX, Jostens, Panera Bread, Raynor Gaming, SAP, Scuf Gaming, Snickers, Stance and Tissot. The NBA 2K League airs live on the League's Twitch channel in addition to select matches airing live on ESPN2, ESPN's digital platforms and the NBA 2K League YouTube channel as well as on delay on eGG Network in Southeast Asia. \n Furthermore, in June, as part of multiyear agreement, livestreams of League games has begun airing on Dash Radio's Nothin' But Net channel on the digital network that has more than 12 million subscribers. We are very excited about the continued success and growth of the NBA 2K League, which has the long-term potential to enhance engagement and to be a driver of profits for our company. \n As Strauss mentioned, we have the strongest development pipeline in Take-Two's history as well as significant potential to increase engagement and recurrent consumer spending. In addition, we are investing on a number of emerging opportunities that has the potential to enhance our growth rate. We remain focused on delivering the highest quality entertainment that captivates and engages audience throughout the world. Whether expanding our offerings on to new platforms, capitalizing on new business models and distribution channels or increasing our presence in emerging markets, Take-Two is exceedingly well positioned to generate value to consumers as well as growth for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Lainie. \nLainie Goldstein: Thanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our first quarter results and then review our financial outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year 2021. Please note that additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release. As Strauss mentioned, fiscal 2021 is off to a great start, the first quarter operating results significantly beating our expectations. \n Net bookings grew 136% to $996 million, which was a fiscal first quarter record. This result exceeded our outlook of $800 million to $850 million, driven by the exceptional performance throughout our portfolio, led by NBA 2K20, Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online and Social Point's mobile games, partially offset by the underperformance of Disintegration. \n Digitally-delivered net bookings grew 139% as compared to our outlook of 100% growth and accounted for 92% of the total. This result exceeded our outlook primarily due to the outperformance of recurrent consumer spending. \n During the first quarter, 77% of sales of current generation console games were delivered digitally, up from 75% last year. Recurrent consumer spending grew 127% as compared to our outlook of 75% growth and accounted for 65% of total net bookings. This growth was driven primarily by NBA 2K20, Grand Theft Auto Online and Social Point's mobile games. \n GAAP net revenue grew 54% to $831 million, which was a fiscal first quarter record, and cost of goods sold increased to $477 million. Operating expenses increased by 10% to $272 million, due primarily to our COVID-19 charitable initiative, headcount expansion and higher incentive compensation as a result of the company's performance. And GAAP net income grew to $89 million or $0.77 per share as compared to $46 million or $0.41 per share in the first quarter last year. \n Now to our guidance, starting with the fiscal second quarter. We project net bookings to range from $775 million to $825 million compared to $951 million in the second quarter last year, which benefited from the launch of Borderlands 3. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Borderlands 3, Social Point's mobile games, Sid Meier's Civilization VI, and The Outer World. We expect digitally-delivered net bookings to be flat, driven by growth in recurrent consumer spending, offset by lower digitally delivered sales of Borderlands 3, which launched last year. \n Our forecast assumes that 63% for current generation console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 51% last year. We project recurrent consumer spending to grow by approximately 10%. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $750 million to $800 million and cost of goods sold to range from $355 million to $381 million. \n Operating expenses are expected to range from $285 million to $295 million. At the midpoint, this represents an 8% decrease over last year, driven primarily by lower marketing expense. And GAAP net income is expected to range from $98 million to $110 million or $0.85 to $0.95 per share. For management reporting purposes, we expect our tax rate to be 16% throughout fiscal 2021. \n Turning to our outlook for the full fiscal year. We are increasing our net bookings outlook range to $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion from $2.55 billion to $2.65 billion, driven by our outperformance in the first quarter along with an updated forecast for the balance of the year. We are continuing to see elevated engagement and sales from people sheltering at home, which we have included in the second quarter, but have not yet factored into the back half of the year. \n We expect growth in NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Social Point's mobile games to be offset by lower results on Borderlands 3, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Grand Theft Auto V. Read Dead Online, excluding digital content bundled with the premium edition is projected to be approximately flat versus fiscal 2020. The largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Borderlands 3, Social Point's mobile games, Sid Meier's Civilization VI and The Outer World. \n We expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 55% 2K, 35% Rockstar Games and 10% Private Division and Social Point. And we forecast our geographic net booking split to be about 60% United States and 40% international. We now project digitally-delivered net bookings to increase by approximately 3% as compared to our prior outlook of an 8% decline. This growth is being driven by our recurrent consumer spending and digitally-delivered sales. As a percentage of our business, digital is projected to represent 87%, up from 82% last year. \n Our forecast assumes that 68% of current generation console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 55% last year. We now expect recurrent consumer spending to grow by 15% as compared to our prior outlook of flat versus fiscal 2020 and to represent 61% of net bookings as compared to 51% last year. This growth is being driven by NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Social Point. We are increasing our non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow outlook to more than $500 million, up from our prior outlook of more than $350 million. We plan to deploy approximately $75 million for capital expenditures. \n We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion and cost of goods sold to range from $1.28 billion to $1.32 billion. Total operating expenses are expected to range from $1.15 billion to $1.17 billion. At the midpoint, this represents a 3% increase over the prior year, driven by higher headcount, R&D expense and shareable contributions, partially offset by lower marketing and stock compensation expenses. And we expect GAAP net income to range from $350 million to $380 million or $3.05 to $3.30 per share. \n In closing, fiscal 2021 is off to a strong start and is poised to be another terrific year for our organization. We remain well positioned both to navigate the uncertainties of these times and to capitalize on the positive trends within our industry. Over the long term, our industry-leading creative assets, firm commitment to operational excellence and strong financial foundation position our company to deliver significant growth and margin expansion for our shareholders. Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Strauss. \nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd again like to thank our colleagues for their hard work, commitment to excellence and for delivering an exceptional start to the year. To our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued support. We'll now take your questions. Operator? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mario Lu with Barclays. \nX. Lu: So the first question is on the $70 price point announced for NBA 2K21. Any color behind making that decision? And was that decision broad-based? Or title-specific since NBA 2K21 will span 2 NBA seasons this time instead of 1? So in other words, is the higher price point embedded in guidance for all AAA new-gen titles going forward or just NBA 2K? And I have a follow-up. \nStrauss Zelnick: Yes. We're definitely announcing pricing on a title by title basis. I would just observe, there hasn't been a frontline price increase for a very long time, although costs have increased significantly. But most importantly, we believe we're delivering the highest quality titles in the business. And consumers are staying more engaged than ever. Games have extraordinary playability and replayability. And they offer many, many hours of entertainment. We think it's a great value. It does rely on our continuing to deliver amazing experiences, and that's our strategy and our goal. \nX. Lu: Got it. And then the second question is on GTA Online. Anything you can share in terms of the normalized growth rate for GTA Online this quarter, so excluding the Epic Store? Or similarly, can you share what percentage of the bookings came from new versus existing players in fiscal 1Q? \nStrauss Zelnick: No. We don't give that kind of granular detail. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. \nMichael Ng: I was just wondering if you could expand on the GTA V Enhanced Edition for next holiday. It feels a little inappropriate to call it a typical remaster. And I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about whether or not there's an opportunity for a GTA, call it, a replacement cycle, if you will? \nStrauss Zelnick: Well, it's a great question, and I appreciate the sentiment with which it's asked because we've now sold in over 135 million units. And of course, GTA V was created for the last console generation, is the standard bearer in this generation, and now we've announced that it will be available for the next generation of consoles, which is just amazing. \n Historically, Rockstar always delivers a great new experience with new content and new opportunities to excite, engage and surprise players. And that's true of everything that Rockstar Games releases. Any more details, I think, will properly come from the label in due time, but we couldn't be more excited that the title will be available for the next generation of consoles. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Fitzgerald with Wells Fargo. \nBrian Fitzgerald: At Xbox 2020 a couple of weeks ago, 2 weeks ago, we saw The Outer Worlds, Grounded [ evolved ]. They look great, these are all Private Division titles. So our question was around this. Strauss, when you mentioned I think you said The Outer Worlds in the Switch was 2.8 million units already. How do you see Private Division aggregating up volumes over time? Lainie, I think you said, near term, it's going to hit 10%, that's Private Division and Social Point. So how should we think about that metering out? Can it be, longer down the road, can it be a bigger percentage? \n And then the second part to that question was these titles seem to appeal maybe especially to the expanding demographic of gamers that are being pulled in the ecosystem. Can you give us any color or dynamics in terms of how types of players that are engaging with private label versus some of your other studios? \nStrauss Zelnick: Well, thanks for your question. Just to clarify, Outer World is sold in 2.8 million units and it's across all platforms, and so far as recently made available for Switch. So -- and we're very excited about it. Outer Worlds also has more content coming, and that's a very exciting opportunity. \n We think the opportunity for Private Division to be a greater percentage of our overall net bookings is strong. And to state the obvious, it will all depend on the quality of the releases but they continue to sign up and announce great publishing arrangements with first-class independent developers. And so far, their track record is pretty extraordinary, which is amazing. \n In terms of the demographic to which they appeal, I think that's title by title. I don't think there's anything in particular in their strategy that would either limit or expand the scope of their potential audience, except that their titles are created by developers who live outside of the big company system. And does that give them an opportunity to be perhaps more innovative and take more risk? Possibly. Although we pride ourselves on being the most innovative company across everything we do. So it's a really good start. We're incredibly proud of what the team has achieved so far, Private Division, and very optimistic about the future. \nOperator: Our next question is from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird. \nColin Sebastian: Congrats on the quarter. I have a couple of questions as well. First off, with the start of the NBA season in Orlando, curious if you've seen any change positively or negatively with respect to NBA 2K? And broadly where markets have reopened, if you've seen any interesting changes or observations with respect to usage trends. And then a bigger picture question on digital distribution. Strauss, I know you guys support platforms where your users are, where they want to access games. There are an increasing number of platforms, which seems to add some complexity to the industry. And I'm curious if you have any updated thoughts on a direct-to-consumer offering if you think that makes some more sense now or maybe less sense? But just curious on your thoughts on distribution. \nKarl Slatoff: So for NBA 2K, obviously, this has been an incredible year for us, and we've had a really, really nice run, obviously, much better than our expectations. We were originally projecting that it wasn't going to be a record year, and now it's going to be a record year across the board. \n We obviously have some tailwind with that behind the shelter-at-home. But generally speaking, the game has been improving since the day came out, and it's really generated a huge amount of interest across the board. \n In terms of has that interest changed with the new seasons, et cetera? There's really nothing to report there at this point. It is -- it's certainly, we're excited that basketball is back at it. It's always a good thing when people are engaged with the NBA. It's an incredible brand and having players in the court is obviously a good thing for us. But there's nothing really that we have to report about the results itself specifically related to that. \nStrauss Zelnick: And with regard to distribution, yes, I think you captured it well. We said we want to be where the consumer is. We need to find that intersection of what's great for the consumer and what makes sense for us as a producer and distributor. And there are a lot of opportunities. We tend to be very supportive of new launches. We were supportive early of Google Stadia. We certainly support what Microsoft and Sony and Nintendo do when they bring out new platforms, and I think that will continue. \n In terms of direct-to-consumer opportunities, naturally, we have the ability to go direct-to-consumer. Rockstar goes direct-to-consumer through their Launcher, 2K goes direct-to-consumer. We have the ability for consumers to buy goods directly from our company, and I expect that to continue. It's still a relatively small portion of our business. And I think our expectation over time is that our goal is not to drive consumers to any particular destination, including one of our own. Our goal is to be where the consumer is. \nOperator: Next question is from Eric Handler with MKM Partners. \nEric Handler: Wondered if you could talk a little bit about how you're balancing concerns in the back half of the year about how the economy is going to fare versus what you're seeing in engagement in July? Are you seeing much of a falloff versus the months in the first quarter? How is that shaping up? \nKarl Slatoff: So we -- in our Q2 guidance, we have included the fact that we're seeing some benefits continue on our business, some of the similar tailwinds that we've had since starting in the first quarter, actually the end of the fourth quarter as well. So we do see some of that in our Q2 guidance. \n In terms of the back half of the year, we really haven't factored anything in related to that or even -- or to take into account any sort of recessionary possibilities. \nEric Handler: All right. So you feel good about the consumer right now, but basically, you don't have a crystal ball for the back half of the year. So too challenging to predict at this point. \nStrauss Zelnick: That's right. \nOperator: Our next question is from Drew Crum with Stifel. \nAndrew Crum: Karl, I think you and I have talked about this in the past, but I want to revisit the software development cost balance and reconcile the total against your commentary around the game pipeline. It's considerably lower versus recent years. And with more than 90 games in development, does that suggest these are smaller titles, or you're just not as far along? And hence, the pipeline is very back-end loaded? \nKarl Slatoff: Can you just clarify what you mean what's considerably lower? \nAndrew Crum: Well, if you look at... \nKarl Slatoff: Balance sheet? \nAndrew Crum: Yes. Correct. Yes. Current plus non-sort of... \nKarl Slatoff: [Capitalized as well.] Yes I think, well, look, as we said, our pipeline is twice the size as it was -- more than double the size as it was 5 years ago, and we're really excited about what that is. Some of these titles are early on in development. Some of those titles are much further along in development. Some of these titles are very, very big titles and some of these titles are very, very, very small titles. So there is a big mix there. \n And in terms of -- so you can't really say, well, there's just more titles or they're less expensive. Because there is such a play between those 2 elements. But you identified those 2 elements that, well, those 2 things will certainly play into how large that capitalized balance sheet moves going forward. It's relative to the scale and where we are in development. \nOperator: Our next question is from Matthew Thornton with SunTrust. \nMatthew Thornton: Maybe for Strauss, can I just get your thoughts 3 months later since the last call, given the COVID environment, just be interested to hear your thoughts on the lasting impact of all these, whether it's Take-Two kind of operation-specific, whether it's consumer and kind of what you think you can kind of hold on to once things kind of normalize. I'd just be very interested to hear your latest thinking about the lasting impact of this environment longer term? \n And then just secondly, quickly, you talked about, obviously, GTA moving to next-gen consoles. Curious if there's any other nonrecurring franchises that could also see a similar upgrade path? \nStrauss Zelnick: Yes. In terms of the lasting impact of this period of time, it's so hard to predict because most humans tend to believe that whatever is going on right now is what will always continue. And of course, that's not the case. Everything, in fact, generally changes. So we've seen certain companies announced that, from their point of view, everyone should just always work from home. And I know there are people I know who believe they'll never go to the movies again or they'll never fly in an airplane again or stay in a hotel again or eat inside a restaurant again. And I don't see the world that way. So from our point of view, this tragedy will pass and the world will go back to looking an awful lot like it did before. However, it does feel like this has been a period of time where previously existing trends have been accelerated. \n And I do think that we appreciate the possibility of remote work as needed, where we understand in a disaster scenario, how we can continue to be productive. I think, frankly, it's created a great benefit in our morale as an organization. As any tragedy does, I think tragedy will either pull people together or push them apart. I think we have a strong enough culture that it pulled people even more together. It's just my point of view, but I think it's borne out in the level of productivity and the quality of our games and the quality of our operations and hopeful that, that continues. \n In terms of the consumer, I do think that this has intensified a shift from old analog entertainment to new interactive entertainment. And I do think that people have come back to video games and tried video games when they hadn't tried them previously. And I think you're going to see a long-lasting increase in demand. \n Again, that's not reflected in our numbers because we don't build our guidance based on my opinion about things, luckily. But I do believe that's the case. And I think you're seeing a systemic shift in favor of interactive entertainment. And there are only a handful of companies on earth who aim to do what we do, never mind, are able to do what we do. So it puts us in a very good position indeed. \n In terms of your question about other older titles being brought to next-gen consoles. We always leave those announcements to our labels, but I'm sure there'll be more in the future. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. \nUnknown Analyst: It's Matt on for Brian. Two, if I could. So on GTA on the next gen, can you walk us through the decision to split it into -- in the back half of next year, split it into a separate online mode and then like the upgraded version of GTA V? Obviously, you had tremendous success kind of just packaging those 2 together when you went from the last generation to the current generation. So what was the opportunity that you saw on next gen to maybe separate those 2 games? \n And then just separately, thinking about pipeline now that we're kind of 3 months into the work-from-home environment. Are you seeing more of an impact on games maybe that are a little farther out in the development cycle? Or do you feel that the pipeline is more or less kind of on track that you expect it to be, you would have expected it to be 3 months ago? \nStrauss Zelnick: Yes. I mean the decision regarding GTA for next gen is a marketing decision and a production decision by Rockstar Games. And I'm sure they'll have more to say about that in the coming months, but I'll leave it to them as I prefer to do. \n In terms of the pipeline, we've been very fortunate. As I just said, our workforce has been exceedingly productive. And I think we only have announced 1 delay since this whole tragedy started, that was a delay of Kerbal Space Program 2 to fiscal '22. But apart from that, everything is looking really good and is on track and on target, no issues whatsoever. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Hickey with The Benchmark Company. \nMichael Hickey: Congrats on another solid quarter. Just 2 questions for me. I guess the -- curious, the response you've gotten from your player community on The Naturalist experience, latest upgrade or update for Red Dead Online. And also curious about future cadence of content. I think it was December last year when we got the Moonshiner update. So it seemed like it was sort of an extended period of time before we get an update. I'm just curious if that was maybe because of the work-from-home? Or is there something else going on that sort of led to that sort of lengthy time in between updates? \n And then Strauss, I know you talked on pricing. Just want to -- just curious on how you think about the economy, the $70 price point. Obviously, a lot of people without jobs, how do you think about how it could impact recurrent spend within the game? And if you've done any sort of survey work or what gives you, I guess, the confidence that demand won't slip at that price point. \nStrauss Zelnick: Yes. The productivity has been strong across the board and across all of our labels. And as you know, Rockstar Games decides on the cadence of updates, and it's driven by great ideas and the ability to deliver those great ideas into superb experiences. And all of our labels wait to distribute new content until it's nearly business perfect as it can possibly be. There is more content coming for both Red Dead Online and Grand Theft Auto Online this fiscal year. So stay tuned, I think it's going to be awesome. \n In terms of the price point, this is a very modest price increase. The pricing has been going down on a real dollar basis for the better part of 15 years. And we're applying this price point in the case where we think the quality not only supports it, but demands it. Production costs have gone up greatly. But most importantly, the consumer experience is more robust than ever before. And I'm utterly convinced that NBA 2K21 will be nothing short of extraordinary, so I don't expect that there will be any concerns. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. \nEric Sheridan: Two, if I can, following up on some of the themes earlier in the call. Based on what you've seen from player behavior through COVID-19, what might some of the key learnings you've gained around lead marketing to older content and sort of reinvigorating players' desire to sort of go back and revisit content and games from a prior generation to continue to sort of drive out lifetime value in that content? And secondly, what have you learned about marketing efficiency as a result of the current environment? And how that might -- how might that carry forward into the next console cycle as well? \nStrauss Zelnick: Yes. I don't think this period of time has led to look at our catalog any differently than before. We're bringing out the Mafia Trilogy. We always bring out legacy content usually in an enhanced format for new consoles on a regular basis or even in the absence of new distribution opportunities. And I'm sure that will continue, of course, driven by the demand for our properties. And if I'm not mistaken, we still have the highest sales per SKU of catalog of any of our competitors based on the quality of what we have historically done. We aimed to keep doing that. \n In terms of marketing efficiency, I haven't really seen a change. At any given time, we're trying to be more and more efficient with our marketing. Undoubtedly, in the mobile business, there's going to be a meaningful change in marketing based on changes that have been announced by Apple and other changes that are driven by privacy legislation and privacy concerns. But I don't know that, that will enhance efficiency. In fact, it may go in the other direction. So it's always a challenge to create the best marketing. And I wouldn't say it's becoming more or less efficient than before. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein. \nTodd Juenger: I also have two, if you don't mind, for whoever wants to [ feel ] them. The first, at the risk of being shut down again and just waiting for more from Rockstar, I'd love to explore the topic of the relationship with PlayStation around GTA Online. And just, at a higher level, without the specifics, what sorts of factors go into the decision to make such a partnership with a company like Sony? And in particular, what sorts of things would we expect you would get in return from them in order to offer them, the things you've done, including the exclusivity. That's question #1. \n The second one is, it wasn't too long ago, every night, we turned on the TV, we saw NBA celebrities playing against each other on NBA 2K on television. I'm just -- I'm really curious as what's it about, what that did in terms of licensing revenues or engagement in the quarter. Although that's interesting, I'm more interested in whether that's opened your mind or any of your development team's mind into how to keep things like that going well into the future? And what that can do in terms of bringing together celebrity and culture and your games in a social and engaging way and sort of driving that whole experience to a whole new level? \nStrauss Zelnick: Yes. I mean without going into too much detail on confidential arrangements. Typically, we have great relationships with all of our platform partners. And we will sometimes announce a particular situation. In many instances, it's driven by marketing support and other benefits that both parties obtain from such an arrangement. And Karl will take the question on basketball. \nKarl Slatoff: Yes. In the case of the NBA, the player tournament that we did, obviously, that was an exciting event. And that was an unplanned event, as you could probably tell. It's something that would probably not have happened, but if it were not for the COVID situation. So in a lot of ways, there are some interesting things that come out of these situations when you're dealt with them. This particular one, I wouldn't really think about it as a specific money making opportunity in the moment. But like any marketing or anything that engages an audience or even creates new audience, it has the benefit of creating interest and engagement with the game. So we really look at that kind of thing, like we would as any other marketing opportunity. Is there a big huge learning from it, something we can keep going? Perhaps. I mean, it was definitely something different than what we've done before, although we have done player-based things in the past, and we've done tournaments in the past, this was just kind of marrying them together. So that's not to say we can do it every day or that this is something that is going to set some kind of precedent for us. But it certainly is interesting. It was a lot of fun to do. And it undoubtedly increased interest and engagement with the game. And as our financial results ultimately reflect all of these things happening for us at once. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Creutz with Cowen and Company. \nDouglas Creutz: A little bit along the lines of the last question. In the last couple of years, you've really extended the life span of NBA 2K very deep into the annual cycle, far beyond where it used to be sort of falling off. Do you think NBA 2K League has been an important part of that? If so, is there anything you can point to, specifically, where the league has really helped engage with the overall game? Or do you think the 2 are incidental to each other? \nStrauss Zelnick: Very hard to point to it. But I think the NBA 2K League is not only an interesting opportunity as a stand-alone, but also forms part of building the brand and building overall engagement. I think you're 100% right. It used to be a 3-month experience, then it became a 6-month experience. Now it's very close toward a year-long experience, and that's very much our goal. And that's really a reflection of NBA 2K morphing from being the highest quality sim in the market to one of the highest quality interactive entertainment experiences of any kind. And it's both a sim and a lifestyle in a world you can inhabit that's constantly evolving and changing. So that's very much the goal of visual concepts, and you're seeing that goal being realized, and I believe you'll see it be more and more realized. Does the league form a part of that? Unquestionably. We also expect it to be very successful on a stand-alone basis. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Giaimo with Jefferies. \nAlexander Giaimo: Karl, a follow-up to a previous question, but the upcoming game pipeline for 93 new titles that you mentioned last quarter that will launch by, I think it was fiscal '25. Should we expect a similar cadence as we've seen in the past of maybe 1 nonsports AAA title per year? And I think it's 11 franchises in your portfolio now that have sold in at least 5 million units. Is it also fair to assume that the content plate will include sequels to most of those bigger franchises? \nKarl Slatoff: The -- certainly, the development pipeline certainly does include sequels to the bigger franchises. And in some cases, could include sequels from new franchises to the extent they actually work. So that -- there's no doubt that, that's the case. \n I'm sorry, what was the first part of the question? \nAlexander Giaimo: If in the past, I think the goal has been 1 nonsports AAA title per year. Is that the cadence we should still think about? \nStrauss Zelnick: Yes. I mean, look, it's again, I think, look, 1, 2, whatever it may be, that is obviously our goal, to come up with more than 1 -- more than what we have now and to be more consistent with the number of AAA releases that come out every year in addition to our annualized title. So whether that number is 1 to 3, that certainly would be the goal. \nOperator: Our next question is from Ryan Gee with Bank of America. \nRyan Gee: So the 100% plus growth in MyTeam players, certainly consistent with demand we're seeing for expression personalization in games right now. Does this speak to the opportunity for a nonsim game from the NFL? And why 2021 is the right time and place to deliver that game? And then on a related matter, the doubling of the NBA players, I think it was last quarter. Can you speak to how much you've seen in growth in the players brand-new to the franchise? So that as you look forward, even if you lost some of these kind of French casual guys, you'll still be net ahead. \nStrauss Zelnick: Yes. I would just observe, as I did previously that the game already offers numerous opportunities that are in addition to the sim, the core sim game. And we'll leave to Visual Concepts, how that will be expressed going forward. But right now, we think NBA 2K offers something for everyone. You want the best sim game, it's there. You want an opportunity to experience great music, it's there. Great characters, it's there. Play outside of the sim game, it's there or just experience the world. That's a possibility, too. So I'm sure there'll be much more to talk about, and we'll let Visual Concepts and 2K talk about it. \n In terms of data around players, we don't tend to go into that much detail. But with 14 million units sold, 18% greater than last year, wonderful engagement and enormous growth in recurrent consumer spending, I think you can safely assume that the audience is expanding. \nKarl Slatoff: And also, to answer your question about football, look, we obviously think that there's a significant opportunity for nonsimulation gameplay with the NFL, the football business. Otherwise, we wouldn't have done that partnership, and won't be so excited about it. \n The fact the success of MyTeam isn't necessarily a barometer for that. There are so many different kinds of nonsimulation play and whether the MyTeam phenomenon is relevant or not, remains to be seen. But in respect of that, the nonsim market is very exciting for us, and that's why we're going forward with NFL with that. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we've reached the end of the question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Strauss Zelnick for closing comments. \nStrauss Zelnick: Thank you so much for joining us today. On behalf of everyone at Take-Two, we appreciate your interest. We appreciate your support, and we'd like to wish you all a happy, healthy and most of all safe summer. Thank you for joining us. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Thanks, Strauss. I'd like to begin by thanking our teams for delivering an excellent start to the year. The work being accomplished across our company is a shining example of what can be achieved through our culture of collaboration, which is more important than ever during these challenging times. \n I'll now discuss our recent and upcoming releases.

In addition, Social Point and 2K will continue to broaden our offerings for mobile devices. \n Looking ahead to fiscal year 2022, Rockstar Games also announced that they will bring their beloved and iconic Grand Theft Auto V to the next-generation of consoles in the second half of calendar 2021. The new generation versions of the game will feature a range of technical improvements, visual upgrades and performance enhancements to take full advantage of the latest hardware, making the game more beautiful and more responsive than ever. For the community of Grand Theft Auto Online, the journey through this ever-evolving world will continue on the next-generation consoles with more new updates, including additional content exclusive to the new consoles and PC. There will also be a new stand-alone version of Grand Theft Auto Online coming in the second half of calendar 2021, which will be available for free exclusively for PlayStation 5 players during the first 3 months. Rockstar Games will share more details on the new versions of Grand Theft Auto V in the months ahead. \n Last week, Private Division announced the signing of 3 new publishing arrangements -- agreements with top independent developers Moon Studios, League of Geeks and Roll7. These partnerships will expand the label's portfolio of titles that includes Kerbal Space Program franchise, The Outer Worlds, Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey and Disintegration. \n Moon Studios, founded in 2010 by Thomas Mahler and Gennadiy Korol, is a BAFTA award-winning studio, best known for developing the critically acclaimed Ori and The Blind Forest and Ori and The Will of The Wisps. Moon Studios is working on creating a compelling new action RPG. \n League of Geeks, founded in 2011 by Trent Kuster, Blake Mizzi and Ty Carey, are renowned for developing the PC game Armello, which combines deep tactical card play, rich tabletop strategy and RPG elements. Located in Melbourne, League of Geeks is looking to expand upon its initial success with an ambitious new intellectual property. \n Roll7 is a BAFTA multi-award winning independent studio founded in London in 2008 by Simon Bennett, John Ribbins and Tom Hegarty. Roll7 created the OlliOlli series, Not A Hero and Laser League. They are working with Private Division on their next job forward in their mission to create awesome flow state games. The first of these titles is expected to launch in fiscal 2022. \n Also last week, 2K announced a partnership with OneTeam Partners and the National Football League Players Association that will allow the label to include the names, numbers, images and likenesses for over 2,000 current NFL players in multiple nonsimulation football games that are currently in development and set a launch starting in calendar year 2021 during fiscal 2022. We are thrilled to be back in the business with NFL, which is one of the most successful sport brands in the world. We are confident that our forthcoming NFL offerings will be extremely fun, highly engaging and deeply social experiences. \n Turning to eSports. We are very excited about the continued progress and growth of the NBA 2K League, which is currently in its third season. These playoffs will run between August 19 and 22, prior to the finals on August 29. The league has been steadily building its portfolio of high-profile partnerships and sponsorships, including Anheuser-Busch, AT&T, Champion Athleticwear, GameStop, HyperX, Jostens, Panera Bread, Raynor Gaming, SAP, Scuf Gaming, Snickers, Stance and Tissot. The NBA 2K League airs live on the League's Twitch channel in addition to select matches airing live on ESPN2, ESPN's digital platforms and the NBA 2K League YouTube channel as well as on delay on eGG Network in Southeast Asia. \n Furthermore, in June, as part of multiyear agreement, livestreams of League games has begun airing on Dash Radio's Nothin' But Net channel on the digital network that has more than 12 million subscribers. We are very excited about the continued success and growth of the NBA 2K League, which has the long-term potential to enhance engagement and to be a driver of profits for our company. \n As Strauss mentioned, we have the strongest development pipeline in Take-Two's history as well as significant potential to increase engagement and recurrent consumer spending. In addition, we are investing on a number of emerging opportunities that has the potential to enhance our growth rate. We remain focused on delivering the highest quality entertainment that captivates and engages audience throughout the world. Whether expanding our offerings on to new platforms, capitalizing on new business models and distribution channels or increasing our presence in emerging markets, Take-Two is exceedingly well positioned to generate value to consumers as well as growth for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Lainie. So for NBA 2K, obviously, this has been an incredible year for us, and we've had a really, really nice run, obviously, much better than our expectations. We were originally projecting that it wasn't going to be a record year, and now it's going to be a record year across the board. \n We obviously have some tailwind with that behind the shelter-at-home. But generally speaking, the game has been improving since the day came out, and it's really generated a huge amount of interest across the board. \n In terms of has that interest changed with the new seasons, et cetera? There's really nothing to report there at this point. It is -- it's certainly, we're excited that basketball is back at it. It's always a good thing when people are engaged with the NBA. It's an incredible brand and having players in the court is obviously a good thing for us. But there's nothing really that we have to report about the results itself specifically related to that. So we -- in our Q2 guidance, we have included the fact that we're seeing some benefits continue on our business, some of the similar tailwinds that we've had since starting in the first quarter, actually the end of the fourth quarter as well. So we do see some of that in our Q2 guidance. \n In terms of the back half of the year, we really haven't factored anything in related to that or even -- or to take into account any sort of recessionary possibilities. Can you just clarify what you mean what's considerably lower? Balance sheet? [Capitalized as well.] Yes I think, well, look, as we said, our pipeline is twice the size as it was -- more than double the size as it was 5 years ago, and we're really excited about what that is. Some of these titles are early on in development. Some of those titles are much further along in development. Some of these titles are very, very big titles and some of these titles are very, very, very small titles. So there is a big mix there. \n And in terms of -- so you can't really say, well, there's just more titles or they're less expensive. Because there is such a play between those 2 elements. But you identified those 2 elements that, well, those 2 things will certainly play into how large that capitalized balance sheet moves going forward. It's relative to the scale and where we are in development. Yes. In the case of the NBA, the player tournament that we did, obviously, that was an exciting event. And that was an unplanned event, as you could probably tell. It's something that would probably not have happened, but if it were not for the COVID situation. So in a lot of ways, there are some interesting things that come out of these situations when you're dealt with them. This particular one, I wouldn't really think about it as a specific money making opportunity in the moment. But like any marketing or anything that engages an audience or even creates new audience, it has the benefit of creating interest and engagement with the game. So we really look at that kind of thing, like we would as any other marketing opportunity. Is there a big huge learning from it, something we can keep going? Perhaps. I mean, it was definitely something different than what we've done before, although we have done player-based things in the past, and we've done tournaments in the past, this was just kind of marrying them together. So that's not to say we can do it every day or that this is something that is going to set some kind of precedent for us. But it certainly is interesting. It was a lot of fun to do. And it undoubtedly increased interest and engagement with the game. And as our financial results ultimately reflect all of these things happening for us at once. The -- certainly, the development pipeline certainly does include sequels to the bigger franchises. And in some cases, could include sequels from new franchises to the extent they actually work. So that -- there's no doubt that, that's the case. \n I'm sorry, what was the first part of the question? And also, to answer your question about football, look, we obviously think that there's a significant opportunity for nonsimulation gameplay with the NFL, the football business. Otherwise, we wouldn't have done that partnership, and won't be so excited about it. \n The fact the success of MyTeam isn't necessarily a barometer for that. There are so many different kinds of nonsimulation play and whether the MyTeam phenomenon is relevant or not, remains to be seen. But in respect of that, the nonsim market is very exciting for us, and that's why we're going forward with NFL with that."

            "name": "Lainie Goldstein",
            "content": "Thanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our first quarter results and then review our financial outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year 2021. Please note that additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release. As Strauss mentioned, fiscal 2021 is off to a great start, the first quarter operating results significantly beating our expectations. \n Net bookings grew 136% to $996 million, which was a fiscal first quarter record. This result exceeded our outlook of $800 million to $850 million, driven by the exceptional performance throughout our portfolio, led by NBA 2K20, Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online and Social Point's mobile games, partially offset by the underperformance of Disintegration. \n Digitally-delivered net bookings grew 139% as compared to our outlook of 100% growth and accounted for 92% of the total. This result exceeded our outlook primarily due to the outperformance of recurrent consumer spending. \n During the first quarter, 77% of sales of current generation console games were delivered digitally, up from 75% last year. Recurrent consumer spending grew 127% as compared to our outlook of 75% growth and accounted for 65% of total net bookings. This growth was driven primarily by NBA 2K20, Grand Theft Auto Online and Social Point's mobile games. \n GAAP net revenue grew 54% to $831 million, which was a fiscal first quarter record, and cost of goods sold increased to $477 million. Operating expenses increased by 10% to $272 million, due primarily to our COVID-19 charitable initiative, headcount expansion and higher incentive compensation as a result of the company's performance. And GAAP net income grew to $89 million or $0.77 per share as compared to $46 million or $0.41 per share in the first quarter last year. \n Now to our guidance, starting with the fiscal second quarter. We project net bookings to range from $775 million to $825 million compared to $951 million in the second quarter last year, which benefited from the launch of Borderlands 3. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Borderlands 3, Social Point's mobile games, Sid Meier's Civilization VI, and The Outer World. We expect digitally-delivered net bookings to be flat, driven by growth in recurrent consumer spending, offset by lower digitally delivered sales of Borderlands 3, which launched last year. \n Our forecast assumes that 63% for current generation console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 51% last year. We project recurrent consumer spending to grow by approximately 10%. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $750 million to $800 million and cost of goods sold to range from $355 million to $381 million. \n Operating expenses are expected to range from $285 million to $295 million. At the midpoint, this represents an 8% decrease over last year, driven primarily by lower marketing expense. And GAAP net income is expected to range from $98 million to $110 million or $0.85 to $0.95 per share. For management reporting purposes, we expect our tax rate to be 16% throughout fiscal 2021. \n Turning to our outlook for the full fiscal year. We are increasing our net bookings outlook range to $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion from $2.55 billion to $2.65 billion, driven by our outperformance in the first quarter along with an updated forecast for the balance of the year. We are continuing to see elevated engagement and sales from people sheltering at home, which we have included in the second quarter, but have not yet factored into the back half of the year. \n We expect growth in NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Social Point's mobile games to be offset by lower results on Borderlands 3, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Grand Theft Auto V. Read Dead Online, excluding digital content bundled with the premium edition is projected to be approximately flat versus fiscal 2020. The largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Borderlands 3, Social Point's mobile games, Sid Meier's Civilization VI and The Outer World. \n We expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 55% 2K, 35% Rockstar Games and 10% Private Division and Social Point. And we forecast our geographic net booking split to be about 60% United States and 40% international. We now project digitally-delivered net bookings to increase by approximately 3% as compared to our prior outlook of an 8% decline. This growth is being driven by our recurrent consumer spending and digitally-delivered sales. As a percentage of our business, digital is projected to represent 87%, up from 82% last year. \n Our forecast assumes that 68% of current generation console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 55% last year. We now expect recurrent consumer spending to grow by 15% as compared to our prior outlook of flat versus fiscal 2020 and to represent 61% of net bookings as compared to 51% last year. This growth is being driven by NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Social Point. We are increasing our non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow outlook to more than $500 million, up from our prior outlook of more than $350 million. We plan to deploy approximately $75 million for capital expenditures. \n We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion and cost of goods sold to range from $1.28 billion to $1.32 billion. Total operating expenses are expected to range from $1.15 billion to $1.17 billion. At the midpoint, this represents a 3% increase over the prior year, driven by higher headcount, R&D expense and shareable contributions, partially offset by lower marketing and stock compensation expenses. And we expect GAAP net income to range from $350 million to $380 million or $3.05 to $3.30 per share. \n In closing, fiscal 2021 is off to a strong start and is poised to be another terrific year for our organization. We remain well positioned both to navigate the uncertainties of these times and to capitalize on the positive trends within our industry. Over the long term, our industry-leading creative assets, firm commitment to operational excellence and strong financial foundation position our company to deliver significant growth and margin expansion for our shareholders. Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Strauss."

            "name": "Strauss Zelnick",
            "content": "Thanks, Hank. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. I'd like to start by expressing, on behalf of our entire management team, our deepest sympathies for those who have been and continued to be affected by this pandemic. We're immensely grateful to everyone who serves on the front lines caring for people in need and helping the world navigate this crisis. \n Turning to our business. Fiscal 2021 is off to a terrific start with first quarter operating results that significantly exceeded our expectations, including fiscal first quarter records for GAAP net revenue and net bookings. Our outstanding results were driven by the outperformance of NBA 2K20, Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online and Social Point's mobile games. I remain incredibly proud of our entire organization, which exemplifies our core tenets of creativity, innovation and efficiency, and continues to deliver industry-leading entertainment experiences to our audiences during these challenging times. \n In the first quarter, NBA 2K20 significantly outperformed expectations and recently achieved a franchise milestone of $1 billion in net bookings since launch. Consumer engagement with NBA 2K continues to increase with daily active users growing 82%, MyCAREER users growing 78% and MyTeam users up a remarkable 108% as compared to the first quarter of last year. \n Recurrent consumer spending in NBA 2K grew 126% to a new record and remained the largest contributor to that part of our business. To date, NBA 2K20 has sold an over 14 million units, up over 18% compared with NBA 2K19 in the same time frame. We expect that lifetime units, recurrent consumer spending and net bookings for NBA 2K20 will be the highest ever for a 2K sports title. \n Nearly 7 years after its initial release, sales of Grand Theft Auto V continue to exceed expectations. The title has now sold in nearly 135 million units and remains the standard bearer of the current console generation. In addition, recurrent consumer spending on Grand Theft Auto Online outperformed our forecast, growing 155% to a new record. \n In April, Rockstar Games released Gerald's Last Play, a series of 6 new contact missions for Grand Theft Auto Online. The first quarter was the second best period ever for new player acquisitions since the title's launch in 2013. The unprecedented player volume trend started with the superlative performance of The Diamond Casino & Resort update in July 2019 and drove record average multiplayer MAUs through August 2019, persisted with sequential records in average multiplayer MAUs from December 2019 through May 2020. We now expect Grand Theft Auto Online to establish a new net bookings record in fiscal 2021. \n In addition, the partnership with Epic Games Store for Grand Theft Auto V was offered free for a week in mid-May, was a contributing factor to the strong performance of Grand Theft Auto Online and did not come at the expense of paid sales of the title. In fact, Grand Theft Auto V sold through more units in the period than any first quarter since the title's launch in 2013. And in the 6 weeks following the Epic Store promotion, Grand Theft Auto V sold more units than in the same period in any previous year. \n Red Dead Redemption 2 also outperformed, and to date has sold in more than 32 million units worldwide. The title sold through twice as many units compared to last year. Engagement with and recurrent consumer spending on Red Dead Online continues to increase. The title acquired nearly twice as many users year-over-year, and average multiplayer MAUs grew 50%. Net bookings from Red Dead Online surpassed expectations, growing 118%, excluding digital content bundled with the Red Dead Redemption 2 Premium Editions. During the first quarter, Rockstar Games added new content to Red Dead Online including 6 new maps to Showdown Mode. Through the coming year, Rockstar Games will continue to support both Red Dead Online and Grand Theft Auto Online with more content updates to keep new and returning players excited and engaged. \n Borderlands 3 continues to expand its audience and to date has sold in over 10.5 million units worldwide, up 69% over Borderlands 2 in the same period. During the first quarter, 2K and Gearbox launched Bounty of Blood. The third of 4 announced paid campaigns that are included in the Borderlands 3 Super Deluxe Edition and the Season Pass, or are available for purchase separately upon release. The Season Pass attach rate for Borderlands 3 continues to be the highest in 2K's history, and there's more content coming. \n In the period, MAUs grew as sales continued at a steady pace with the consistent release of free and paid content. We attribute this ongoing success in part to 2K's and Gearbox Software's continued efforts to support Borderlands 3 as a live service game, which should continue to benefit the title and series over the long term. \n Private Division's critical and commercial success, The Outer Worlds, outperformed expectations in the first quarter and has now sold in 2.8 million units. On June 5, the title was released for Nintendo Switch. In addition, Private Division launched Disintegration, a new sci-fi first person shooter experience that blends real-time tactical elements for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC. \n During the first quarter, 2K released Mafia II Definitive Edition and Mafia III Definitive Edition as part of the Mafia Trilogy, which combines all 3 previously released Mafia titles into a single package for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC, curated by 2K's Hangar 13 studio. Mafia I Definitive Edition will become available on September 25 as Karl will discuss shortly. \n 2K also bolstered our offerings for Nintendo Switch with some of our most beloved and successful franchises, including Bioshock: The Collection, The Borderlands Legendary Collection and the XCOM 2 Collection. In addition, 2K and Firaxis Games released XCOM: Chimera Squad, an all-new stand-alone title in the award-winning, turn-based XCOM series for PC. Our first quarter results were also enhanced by a variety of other offerings, led by Social Point's Sid Meier's Civilization VI and the WWE series. \n During the first quarter, recurrent consumer spending exceeded expectations, growing 127% to a new record and accounted for 65% of net bookings. In addition to virtual currency for NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Red Dead Online, recurrent consumer spending was enhanced by the following offerings. \n In the free-to-play category, Social Point outperformed expectations, growing 54% to a fiscal first quarter record, driven primarily by the exceptional performance of its 2 biggest games, Dragon City and Monster Legends. The studio continues to invest in its broad and innovative pipeline of more than 10 new games planned for launch in the coming years. WWE SuperCard also outperformed during the first quarter, growing 54%. And the title has now been downloaded more than 21 million times and remains 2K's highest grossing mobile title. And NBA 2K Online in China remains a significant contributor to our results. The title is the #1 PC online sports game in China with nearly 50 million registered users. \n Add-on content grew 135% and outperformed expectations, led by offerings for the Borderlands franchise, Sid Meier's Civilization VI and XCOM 2. As a result of our outperformance in the first quarter, along with a higher forecast for the balance of the year, we're raising our outlook for fiscal 2021, which is well underway to be another great year for Take-Two. \n Looking ahead, our company has the strongest development pipeline in its history, including sequels from our biggest franchises as well as exciting new IP. We've made great strides to increase the scale of our enterprise, and our current pipeline is more than double what it was 5 years ago in terms of number of games, including 54% internally developed titles and 46% externally developed titles. \n In closing, we continue to prepare for our industry's forthcoming transition to a new console cycle, which will provide our world-class development teams with a better platform on which to captivate and engage our audiences. Our company remains superbly positioned, creatively, operationally and financially to capitalize on the many positive trends in our industry and to deliver returns for our shareholders over the long term. I'll now turn the call over to Karl. Thanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd again like to thank our colleagues for their hard work, commitment to excellence and for delivering an exceptional start to the year. To our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued support. We'll now take your questions. Operator? Yes. We're definitely announcing pricing on a title by title basis. I would just observe, there hasn't been a frontline price increase for a very long time, although costs have increased significantly. But most importantly, we believe we're delivering the highest quality titles in the business. And consumers are staying more engaged than ever. Games have extraordinary playability and replayability. And they offer many, many hours of entertainment. We think it's a great value. It does rely on our continuing to deliver amazing experiences, and that's our strategy and our goal. No. We don't give that kind of granular detail. Well, it's a great question, and I appreciate the sentiment with which it's asked because we've now sold in over 135 million units. And of course, GTA V was created for the last console generation, is the standard bearer in this generation, and now we've announced that it will be available for the next generation of consoles, which is just amazing. \n Historically, Rockstar always delivers a great new experience with new content and new opportunities to excite, engage and surprise players. And that's true of everything that Rockstar Games releases. Any more details, I think, will properly come from the label in due time, but we couldn't be more excited that the title will be available for the next generation of consoles. Well, thanks for your question. Just to clarify, Outer World is sold in 2.8 million units and it's across all platforms, and so far as recently made available for Switch. So -- and we're very excited about it. Outer Worlds also has more content coming, and that's a very exciting opportunity. \n We think the opportunity for Private Division to be a greater percentage of our overall net bookings is strong. And to state the obvious, it will all depend on the quality of the releases but they continue to sign up and announce great publishing arrangements with first-class independent developers. And so far, their track record is pretty extraordinary, which is amazing. \n In terms of the demographic to which they appeal, I think that's title by title. I don't think there's anything in particular in their strategy that would either limit or expand the scope of their potential audience, except that their titles are created by developers who live outside of the big company system. And does that give them an opportunity to be perhaps more innovative and take more risk? Possibly. Although we pride ourselves on being the most innovative company across everything we do. So it's a really good start. We're incredibly proud of what the team has achieved so far, Private Division, and very optimistic about the future. And with regard to distribution, yes, I think you captured it well. We said we want to be where the consumer is. We need to find that intersection of what's great for the consumer and what makes sense for us as a producer and distributor. And there are a lot of opportunities. We tend to be very supportive of new launches. We were supportive early of Google Stadia. We certainly support what Microsoft and Sony and Nintendo do when they bring out new platforms, and I think that will continue. \n In terms of direct-to-consumer opportunities, naturally, we have the ability to go direct-to-consumer. Rockstar goes direct-to-consumer through their Launcher, 2K goes direct-to-consumer. We have the ability for consumers to buy goods directly from our company, and I expect that to continue. It's still a relatively small portion of our business. And I think our expectation over time is that our goal is not to drive consumers to any particular destination, including one of our own. Our goal is to be where the consumer is. That's right. Yes. In terms of the lasting impact of this period of time, it's so hard to predict because most humans tend to believe that whatever is going on right now is what will always continue. And of course, that's not the case. Everything, in fact, generally changes. So we've seen certain companies announced that, from their point of view, everyone should just always work from home. And I know there are people I know who believe they'll never go to the movies again or they'll never fly in an airplane again or stay in a hotel again or eat inside a restaurant again. And I don't see the world that way. So from our point of view, this tragedy will pass and the world will go back to looking an awful lot like it did before. However, it does feel like this has been a period of time where previously existing trends have been accelerated. \n And I do think that we appreciate the possibility of remote work as needed, where we understand in a disaster scenario, how we can continue to be productive. I think, frankly, it's created a great benefit in our morale as an organization. As any tragedy does, I think tragedy will either pull people together or push them apart. I think we have a strong enough culture that it pulled people even more together. It's just my point of view, but I think it's borne out in the level of productivity and the quality of our games and the quality of our operations and hopeful that, that continues. \n In terms of the consumer, I do think that this has intensified a shift from old analog entertainment to new interactive entertainment. And I do think that people have come back to video games and tried video games when they hadn't tried them previously. And I think you're going to see a long-lasting increase in demand. \n Again, that's not reflected in our numbers because we don't build our guidance based on my opinion about things, luckily. But I do believe that's the case. And I think you're seeing a systemic shift in favor of interactive entertainment. And there are only a handful of companies on earth who aim to do what we do, never mind, are able to do what we do. So it puts us in a very good position indeed. \n In terms of your question about other older titles being brought to next-gen consoles. We always leave those announcements to our labels, but I'm sure there'll be more in the future. Yes. I mean the decision regarding GTA for next gen is a marketing decision and a production decision by Rockstar Games. And I'm sure they'll have more to say about that in the coming months, but I'll leave it to them as I prefer to do. \n In terms of the pipeline, we've been very fortunate. As I just said, our workforce has been exceedingly productive. And I think we only have announced 1 delay since this whole tragedy started, that was a delay of Kerbal Space Program 2 to fiscal '22. But apart from that, everything is looking really good and is on track and on target, no issues whatsoever. Yes. The productivity has been strong across the board and across all of our labels. And as you know, Rockstar Games decides on the cadence of updates, and it's driven by great ideas and the ability to deliver those great ideas into superb experiences. And all of our labels wait to distribute new content until it's nearly business perfect as it can possibly be. There is more content coming for both Red Dead Online and Grand Theft Auto Online this fiscal year. So stay tuned, I think it's going to be awesome. \n In terms of the price point, this is a very modest price increase. The pricing has been going down on a real dollar basis for the better part of 15 years. And we're applying this price point in the case where we think the quality not only supports it, but demands it. Production costs have gone up greatly. But most importantly, the consumer experience is more robust than ever before. And I'm utterly convinced that NBA 2K21 will be nothing short of extraordinary, so I don't expect that there will be any concerns. Yes. I don't think this period of time has led to look at our catalog any differently than before. We're bringing out the Mafia Trilogy. We always bring out legacy content usually in an enhanced format for new consoles on a regular basis or even in the absence of new distribution opportunities. And I'm sure that will continue, of course, driven by the demand for our properties. And if I'm not mistaken, we still have the highest sales per SKU of catalog of any of our competitors based on the quality of what we have historically done. We aimed to keep doing that. \n In terms of marketing efficiency, I haven't really seen a change. At any given time, we're trying to be more and more efficient with our marketing. Undoubtedly, in the mobile business, there's going to be a meaningful change in marketing based on changes that have been announced by Apple and other changes that are driven by privacy legislation and privacy concerns. But I don't know that, that will enhance efficiency. In fact, it may go in the other direction. So it's always a challenge to create the best marketing. And I wouldn't say it's becoming more or less efficient than before. Yes. I mean without going into too much detail on confidential arrangements. Typically, we have great relationships with all of our platform partners. And we will sometimes announce a particular situation. In many instances, it's driven by marketing support and other benefits that both parties obtain from such an arrangement. And Karl will take the question on basketball. Very hard to point to it. But I think the NBA 2K League is not only an interesting opportunity as a stand-alone, but also forms part of building the brand and building overall engagement. I think you're 100% right. It used to be a 3-month experience, then it became a 6-month experience. Now it's very close toward a year-long experience, and that's very much our goal. And that's really a reflection of NBA 2K morphing from being the highest quality sim in the market to one of the highest quality interactive entertainment experiences of any kind. And it's both a sim and a lifestyle in a world you can inhabit that's constantly evolving and changing. So that's very much the goal of visual concepts, and you're seeing that goal being realized, and I believe you'll see it be more and more realized. Does the league form a part of that? Unquestionably. We also expect it to be very successful on a stand-alone basis. Yes. I mean, look, it's again, I think, look, 1, 2, whatever it may be, that is obviously our goal, to come up with more than 1 -- more than what we have now and to be more consistent with the number of AAA releases that come out every year in addition to our annualized title. So whether that number is 1 to 3, that certainly would be the goal. Yes. I would just observe, as I did previously that the game already offers numerous opportunities that are in addition to the sim, the core sim game. And we'll leave to Visual Concepts, how that will be expressed going forward. But right now, we think NBA 2K offers something for everyone. You want the best sim game, it's there. You want an opportunity to experience great music, it's there. Great characters, it's there. Play outside of the sim game, it's there or just experience the world. That's a possibility, too. So I'm sure there'll be much more to talk about, and we'll let Visual Concepts and 2K talk about it. \n In terms of data around players, we don't tend to go into that much detail. But with 14 million units sold, 18% greater than last year, wonderful engagement and enormous growth in recurrent consumer spending, I think you can safely assume that the audience is expanding. Thank you so much for joining us today. On behalf of everyone at Take-Two, we appreciate your interest. We appreciate your support, and we'd like to wish you all a happy, healthy and most of all safe summer. Thank you for joining us."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. \n I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Nicole Shevins, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. You may begin. \nNicole Shevins: Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss our results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022 ended March 31, 2022. Today's call will be led by Strauss Zelnick, Take-Two's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Karl Slatoff, our President; and Lainie Goldstein, our Chief Financial Officer. We will be available to answer your questions during the Q&A session following our prepared remarks.  \n Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that statements made during this call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs of our management as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to us. We have no obligation to update these forward-looking statements.  \n Actual operating results may vary significantly from these forward-looking statements based on a variety of factors. These important factors are described in our filings with the SEC, including the company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q, including the risks summarized in the section entitled Risk Factors.  \n I'd also like to note that unless otherwise stated, all numbers we will be discussing today are GAAP and all comparisons are year-over-year. Additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release, including the items that our management uses internally to adjust our GAAP financial results in order to evaluate our operating performance.  \n Our press release also contains a reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure. In addition, we have posted to our website a slide deck that visually presents our results and financial outlook. Our press release and filings with the SEC may be obtained from our website at take2games.com. \n And now I'll turn the call over to Strauss. \nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks, Nicole. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today.  \n Our strong fourth quarter results concluded another highly successful year for our company. We delivered net bookings of $3.4 billion, which reflect our creative team's unwavering commitment to quality and the ability to deliver captivating and engaging entertainment experiences that transcend geographies and generations. \n On behalf of our management team, I'd like to thank all of our colleagues around the world for helping us to achieve these results, especially as we continue to navigate through the new normal following the pandemic.\n During the year, we positioned our organization strategically for long-term growth. To that end, we bolstered our creative teams by adding nearly 1,000 new developers, including through the acquisition of several talented studios which will help us expand our capabilities and support our growing pipeline of offerings. We broadened our portfolio further with the introduction of new intellectual properties and business models to drive player engagement. \n We agreed upon our pending combination with Zynga, which will grow our audience significantly and increase exponentially our net bookings for mobile, the fastest-growing segment in interactive entertainment, while also providing us with substantial cost synergies and revenue opportunities. As we build our scale, we believe that we can grow our margins meaningfully.  \n Lastly, we advanced our ESG efforts, and I'm pleased that we recently published our first dedicated report, which includes information on our initiatives to date as well as our road map for the future.  \n During the quarter, our newly released WWE 2K22 and Tiny Tina's Wonderlands outperformed our expectations, as did Red Dead Redemption 2. NBA 2K22 continued to grow its audience, with the title selling in over 10 million units to date and exceeding sell-in from the prior year. \n During the fourth quarter, engagement remained very strong with average active days of playing up 6% on average games per user, up 13% year-over-year. In addition, NBA 2K22 Arcade Edition continues to hold the #1 position on Apple Arcade's top game chart. And for the full year, downloads of NBA 2K Mobile increased nearly 25% as compared with fiscal 2021. We see a significant opportunity to add unique and innovative experiences throughout the game and focus on expanding our player base.  \n On March 11, 2K and Visual Concepts returned triumphantly to the Squared Circle with the eagerly anticipated release of WWE 2K22, which achieved the highest Metacritic scores on both Xbox and PlayStation platforms in franchise history. Setting new benchmarks for quality, the title offers more features and enhancements than any prior release in the series, including a redesigned gameplay engine, new controls, foundational improvements, upgraded visuals and an array of options requested by our passionate player base.  \n Notably, WWE 2K22 sell-in for its first 4 weeks exceeded the levels achieved for both WWE 2K19 and WWE 2K20, even with the revised release window that was not during the holiday season. Consumer engagement with the title has been outstanding with over 140 million in-game matches played to date and over 5.6 million hours of WWE 2K22 content viewed on Twitch.\n I'd like to thank 2K and the WWE team of Visual Concepts for their commitment to reestablishing this incredible franchise. We greatly appreciate WWE's immense support in launching this year's game and look forward to continuing and building upon our successful partnership in the years to come.  \n On March 25, 2K and Gearbox Software released Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, an all-new fantasy-fueled offering that has taken our partnership with Gearbox to new creative heights and is viewed as the best new franchise launch from 2K in several years. The title has resonated with core fans and new audiences alike with nearly 30% of players having never before played a Borderland's title. \n To date, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands has exceeded our expectations and is being supported with cross-play functionality, an array of post-launch content and a season pass. I'd like to congratulate 2K and Gearbox on delivering another stellar game, and we look forward to the possibilities for this new franchise in the years to come.  \n During the fourth quarter, Rockstar Games expanded the reach of their iconic entertainment experience, Grand Theft Auto V, with the release of new versions of the game upgraded specifically for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S. This marked the third console generation for which the game has been made available since its initial launch in 2013. And to date, the title has sold in more than 165 million units.  \n Also for the first time ever, Grand Theft Auto Online was made available as a stand-alone title for the latest generation consoles. Featuring an array of graphical and technical enhancements, a new career builder, new vehicles and more, these versions were well received by the game's vast community of players. \n In the period, Grand Theft Auto Online maintained its massive audience size from the prior year, while growing 8% and 74% as compared to the fourth quarters of fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. In addition, Rockstar Games launched GTA+, an all-new membership program that's exclusive to Grand Theft Auto Online players on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S consoles whereby participants can receive a range of valuable player-friendly benefits, including a monthly deposit of GTA dollars and other bonuses designed to help players experience everything Grand Theft Auto Online has to offer, including access to major content packs like last holiday's, The Contract. Initial conversion has been above our expectations, which we believe bodes well for this to be an ongoing engagement driver over time.  \n Red Dead Redemption 2 continued to expand its audience and to date has sold in more than 44 million units worldwide. Results for the series were notably above our expectations for the period, which is further proof of the ongoing popularity of Rockstar's blockbuster entertainment experiences.\n Turning to Private Division. The label's recently acquired studio, Roll7, successfully launched OlliOlli World in February, which received significant critical praise for its unique art style and impressive gameplay mechanics. We'll support the title with its first expansion, Void Riders, in the first half of this fiscal year.  \n Championing the best independent talent in our industry, Private Division recently signed 4 new publishing agreements with leading independent developers, Die Gute Fabrik, Evening Star, Piccolo Studio and Yellow Brick Games. We look forward to working with these talented teams.  \n During the fourth quarter, recurrent consumer spending declined 6% over last year and accounted for 60% of net bookings. Over the past few months, the consumer has seen a wide array of long-awaited high-quality new releases in the market, including several of our own exciting titles that have not deployed significant live service offerings. We believe that this dynamic has impacted our overall recurrent consumer spending.  \n NBA 2K and Grand Theft Auto Online were the largest contributors to our current consumer spending during the fourth quarter, and many of our free-to-play offerings were notable drivers as well. Top Eleven continued to perform very well following our acquisition and was our #1 mobile title during the fourth quarter. Two Dots delivered notable year-over-year growth and posted its best ever net bookings performance driven by new in-game events and successful marketing activations. Dragon City and Monster Legends delivered a solid finish to the year, supported by enhanced live operations.  \n WWE SuperCard has now been downloaded more than 26 million times and remains 2K's highest grossing mobile game. And NBA 2K Online in China outperformed our expectations. The title remains the #1 online PC sports game in the region with nearly 57 million registered users.  \n We're incredibly excited about our future path of growth, including our pending combination with Zynga. We believe that this will be a transformative moment for Take-Two as we continue to build upon our core tenants to become the most innovative, the most creative and the most efficient entertainment company in the world. Combined, we'll create a powerhouse of industry-leading titles that span key platforms and genres across interactive entertainment, developed by some of the most creative and forward-thinking talent within the industry.  \n Later this week, our respective shareholders who will vote on the transaction, which, assuming such approvals are obtained, we anticipate will close on May 23, 2022. On a stand-alone basis, for fiscal 2023, we expect to achieve a new record of $3.75 billion to $3.85 billion in net bookings as we plan to deliver many new exciting releases during the year. \n Looking ahead and excluding the impact of our combination with Zynga, we expect fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025 to set even higher records of net bookings for our company alongside a significant ramp-up in profitability.  Lainie will provide additional details on our outlook shortly, while Karl will share an update on our exciting diverse multiyear pipeline, including approximately 69 titles that we plan to release through fiscal 2025.\n In closing, we're highly optimistic about our future. As we continue to expand our enterprise and execute on our growth strategies, we believe that Take-Two remains incredibly well positioned to increase its scale and prominence within the industry, expand margins and deliver long-term value for our shareholders.  \n I'll now turn the call over to Karl. \nKarl Slatoff: Thanks, Strauss. I'd like to begin by thanking our teams around the world for delivering another outstanding year for our company. Strong results were driven by our colleagues' passion, creativity and commitment to deliver value for all of our stakeholders. \n I'll now discuss our recent first quarter releases. On April 21, 2K and Gearbox Software released Coiled Captors, the first of 4 exciting downloadable content packs in the Tiny Tina's Wonderlands season pass. Featuring a new environment, boss encounter and legendary loots, the offering represents an innovative post-launch experience from this exciting new franchise.\n On April 26, 2K and Visual Concepts launched the Banzai Pack, featuring 5 playable superstars plus MyFACTION EVO cards for each. This is the first of 5 downloadable plan content offerings for WWE 2K22, all of which will be available individually and as part of the game's season pass throughout the year.\n Looking ahead, fiscal 2023 will be another exciting year for Take-Two as we deliver captivating new entertainment experiences for our players while also growing our business through our pending combination with Zynga.\n I'll now provide details on Take-Two's fiscal 2023 pipeline on a stand-alone basis, which includes 18 planned releases. We expect to deliver 6 immersive core offerings, all of which will be available for purchase. These include The Quarry, an all-new or narrative game from 2K and Supermassive Games where every choice, big or small, shapes her story and determines who lives to tell the tale. \n Featuring an iconic ensemble cast of Hollywood stars, including David Arquette, Ariel Winter, Justice Smith, Brenda Song, Lance Henriksen, Lin Shaye and more. The Quarry will launch on June 10 for PlayStation and Xbox consoles and Windows PC via Steam.  \n Marvel's Midnight Suns is planned for release during the second half of calendar 2022 and is one of this year's most anticipated games. The title is being developed by Firaxis Games, the acclaimed studio that brought audience such iconic franchises as Sid Meier's Civilization and XCOM and features the Marvel Universe's most revered heroes and entirely new gameplay experience. 2K will have more to share in the coming months.  \n Kerbal Space Program 2, which is coming from Private Division and Intercept Games, is now expected to launch on PC in early calendar 2023, and on console later in calendar 2023. Anticipation for the title is high, with more than 12 million views of the announcement trailer. The dedicated Kerbal community can look forward to more information about the game and its new features from the title's ongoing gameplay reveal video series.  \n Turning to our annual sports offerings. Fans can expect all new releases from our popular sports series, including NBA 2K23, WWE 2K23 and PGA TOUR 2K23, which will debut legendary Gulf icon Tiger Woods as the game's Executive Director. 2K will have more to share about these titles shortly.  \n Continuing with our fiscal 2023 pipeline, we plan to release 8 mobile titles, including 4 from new franchises and 4 from existing franchises and 3 mid-core RK titles for purchase, which include one new sports title from 2K, a new franchise from Private Division and a new tales from the Borderlands game, which will feature new characters and stories set in the Borderlands universe. And lastly, we'll have one new iteration of a previous released title available for purchase.  \n Our labels will continue to provide new content and experiences that drive engagement and recurrent consumer spending across many of their hit franchises including NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online, Red Dead Redemption Online, WWE 2K, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, OlliOlli World and more. \n Excluding our pending combination with Zynga, we expect to deliver 51 titles throughout fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025, which we believe will pave the way for us to achieve a strong acceleration in net bookings and growth and profitability. This includes 18 immersive core releases, 7 of which are sports simulation games. 16 of these will be available for purchase while 2 will be free-to-play. 10 independent titles, which will all be avail for purchase; 12 free-to-play mobile games; 4 mid-core games for purchase, 2 of which will be sports-oriented; and 7 new iterations of previously released titles, which will all be available for purchase.  \n Bears noting that these titles are a snapshot of our current development pipeline. It is likely that some of these titles will not be developed through completion that launch timing may change and that we will also be adding new titles to our slate. In addition to our full game releases, we will continue to offer post loss content for many of our releases, ranging from virtual currency sales to DLC packs and Season Passes.  \n Turning to eSports. The NBA 2K League kicked off its fifth season on March 23 and included new sponsors such as Google and Coinbase. This year, the league has partnered with the City of Indianapolis to bring all tournaments as well as playoffs and finals to its new home at The Pavilion at Pan Am. \n The League's overall price pool has increased to $2.5 million this season, the largest since its inception. We remain very excited about the continued success and growth of the NBA 2K League, which has a long-term potential to enhance engagement and to be a driver of profits for our company.  \n In closing, as we execute on our organic growth initiatives and unlock new opportunities presented by our pending transaction with Zynga, we believe that we can broaden our portfolio and capitalize further on new platforms, business models, emerging markets and distribution channels. As we deliver on these growth opportunities, we believe that Take-Two is exceedingly well positioned to deliver long-term value for our shareholders.   \n I'll now turn the call over to Lainie. \nLainie Goldstein: Thanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal 2022 results and then review our financial outlook for the full year and first quarter of fiscal 2023. Please note that our initial outlook does not include Zynga in our projected results or the interest expense on the notes that Take-Two issued in April to fund the cash portion of our pending acquisition of Zynga. Additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release. \n I'm extremely pleased with the accomplishments that Take-Two delivered during the fourth quarter and fiscal year. We posted strong financial results, took exciting steps to position the company for long-term growth and announced our transformational pending combination with Zynga, which brings massive potential to our portfolio and financial profile. I'd like to thank our teams for their passion commitment and for continuing to help Take-Two deliver its strategic vision. \n Starting with our fourth quarter. Total net bookings grew 8% to $846 million. Our newly released WWE 2K22 and Tiny Tina's Wonderlands outperformed our expectations, as did Red Dead Redemption 2. During the period, digitally-delivered net bookings grew 4% and accounted for 91% of the total. This exceeded our outlook of a slight increase due to the outperformance of digitally-delivered full game sales. 75% of console game sales were delivered digitally, up slightly from last year. \n As Strauss mentioned, over the last few months, there's been a wide array of long-awaited, high-quality new releases in the market, including several of our own exciting titles that have not deployed significant live service offering. Accordingly, our recurrent consumer spending declined 6% and accounted for 60% of total net bookings. \n GAAP net revenue grew 11% to $930 million, while cost of goods sold increased 43% to $399 million, driven by amortization of software development costs for our fourth quarter release. Operating expenses increased by 32% to $403 million, driven by the addition of Nordeus, including its earn-out as well as higher marketing and transaction costs. And GAAP net income was $111 million or $0.95 per share compared to $290 million or $1.88 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.\n Turning to our fiscal 2022 results. Total net bookings were $3.41 billion as compared to $3.55 billion in the prior year. As we expected, throughout the year, our engagement trends are notably higher than they were pre-pandemic. However, as the world began settling into a new normal, there was a moderation of the trends that benefited our industry during the height of the pandemic. \n As a result, digitally-delivered net bookings declined 2%, slightly outperforming our guidance of a 3% decline and accounted for 91% of the total. 68% of our console game sales were delivered digitally, up from 64% last year, and recurrent consumer spending declined 6%. Non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow was $425 million as compared to our outlook of over $400 million. \n During fiscal 2022, we spent $159 million in capital expenditures. At fiscal year-end, our cash and short-term investments balance was approximately $2.6 billion. GAAP net revenue grew 4% to $3.5 billion, while cost of goods sold was flat at $1.5 billion. Operating expenses increased 24% to $1.5 billion driven primarily by the additions of Playdots and Nordeus, including the revaluation of its earn-out, higher personnel, stock compensation, marketing and IT expenses and higher transaction costs. And GAAP net income was $418 million or $3.58 per share as compared to $589 million or $5.09 per share in the prior year. \n Today, we provided our initial fiscal 2023 outlook for Take-Two on a stand-alone basis. We project net bookings to range from $3.75 billion to $3.85 billion, which is a new record level for the company and implies strong growth of 11% at the midpoint. We have an exciting pipeline of releases that we expect to bring to market during the year, including 6 immersive core titles, which is twice as many as we delivered in fiscal 2022. \n The largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, Marvel's Midnight Sun and PGA TOUR 2K23. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 60% 2K, 30% Rockstar Games and 10% Private Division and T2 mobile games. And we forecast our geographic net booking split to be about 60% United States and 40% international. \n We expect recurrent consumer sending to be flat compared to fiscal 2022 and represents 58% of net bookings, which is down from 64% last year due to a greater number of new releases. We project digitally-delivered net bookings to grow 10% and represent 91% of net bookings, which is in line with last year. Our forecast assumes that 71% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 68% last year. \n We expect to generate more than $350 million in non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow, and we plan to deploy approximately $120 million for capital expenditures. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $3.67 billion to $3.77 billion and cost of goods sold to range from $1.66 billion to $1.7 billion. \n Our total operating expenses are expected to range from $1.74 billion to $1.76 billion. At the midpoint, this represents a 17% increase over the prior year. As Karl mentioned, we have approximately 69 titles that we plan to deliver over the next 3 years, and we will be investing behind our pipeline in key areas such as marketing, personnel and IT. And we expect GAAP net income to range from $223 million to $252 million or $1.90 to $2.15 per share. For management reporting purposes, we expect our tax rate to be 16% throughout fiscal 2023. \n Now moving on to our guidance for the fiscal first quarter. We project net bookings to range from $700 million to $750 million as compared to $711 million in the first quarter last year. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K22, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, The Quarry and WWE 2K22. We expect digitally-delivered net bookings to increase 2%. \n Our forecast assumes that 78% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 73% in the same period last year. We project recurrent consumer spending to decline by 10% as we believe that the momentum behind our own exciting titles that have not deployed significant live service offerings will continue into the first quarter. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $810 million to $860 million and cost of goods sold to range from $307 million to $333 million. \n Operating expenses are expected to range from $387 million to $397 million. At the midpoint, this represents a 25% increase over last year, driven primarily by higher personnel and marketing expenses as well as transaction costs. And GAAP net income is expected to range from $93 million to $105 million or $0.80 to $0.90 per share. \n In closing, we have great confidence in our ability to drive accelerated growth into fiscal 2023 and beyond. And we believe that our pending combination with Zynga will take our business to an even greater level of scale and profitability. As we execute on our strategic initiatives, we believe that we can deliver sustainable, profitable growth for our shareholders. \n Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Strauss. \nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for delivering another outstanding year. And to our shareholders, I'd like to express our appreciation for your continued support. \n We'll now take your questions. Operator? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Uerkwitz with Jefferies. \nAndrew Uerkwitz: Just 2 quick ones. The first one, on RCS, you look like you're guiding that flat, it was down in fiscal '22. Is that more a product of quantity? Or is there something you're seeing in the underlying engagement stats that give you comfort that lapping some tough COVID comps here in the first half are doable? \nLainie Goldstein: Yes. So the first year is definitely due to the comp against the year with COVID from last year. So we had a really strong Q1. And so comping against that quarter was very difficult. And then this quarter, we were seeing a lot of people playing the full game that we put out as well as some of our competitors. So that also affected RCS in the quarter. \nAndrew Uerkwitz: Got it. And then in the guide then, just trying to understand why the guide was flat and for the -- it just seems like it's still fairly tough. So is it comfort coming back of more CS for '23 or something else? \nLainie Goldstein: So in Q1, we're expecting to be down by about 10%, and that's the ongoing of what we're seeing in Q4, which is the players playing the full games of our games and some of our competitors. So that's continuing. We've seen that in Q1, and we expect to see that. For the full year, we expect to see it flat for the full year. So some of our new games that are coming out don't have any recurrent consumer spending associated with that. We expect NBA to be up for the year. And then GT Online and Red Dead Online, we expect to be down for the year. \nAndrew Uerkwitz: Got it. And then Strauss, you did a wonderful podcast earlier in the month, I think, with LionTree. In it, you discussed M&A and the importance of listening to offers. Just out of curiosity, with the changing valuations we've seen across the landscape and the market that we're in, what are your broader thoughts on M&A activity here at the current levels and volatility in the market? \nStrauss Zelnick: Well, no one likes to see their stock price experience a drawdown, but we ultimately will always trade on our fundamentals, and that's how we look at the company. So we have a really strong company. We continue to perform and outperform expectations as we have in this quarter and this fiscal -- this past fiscal year. We've just issued initial guidance, which is a very positive look at our company and at the market. So we remain in a very optimistic place and I think similarly situated companies probably feel the same way. \n When the overall market re-rates, there's nothing that we can do about it nor something that we would wish to do about it. We don't need to access the capital markets at this price level. We're under-leveraged under, no matter how you look at it. We have a small amount of investment grade debt coming with the closing of the Zynga transaction. And then we have a really powerful company that we expect to continue to fire on all cylinders. So momentary changes in the market are kind of irrelevant to us. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners. \nEric Handler: Two questions. Strauss, maybe you could start off. Do you think there's any type of shift going on in preferences among gamers to -- for more story mode type of play versus, let's call it, the live services type of play and people are just sort of craving that story mode a bit more lately? \nKarl Slatoff: It's Karl. Actually, I think that we never, as an industry, went away from the attractiveness of the story mill content. We've always said that we believe in that kind of content. We've always delivered on that as a company. It's the ultimate entertainment experience. And I think what you're seeing is you're just seeing some other games in the market capitalize on that.\n I think there are a number of them out there right now, so maybe it looks that way. But when you look at it over time, story-driven content has always been a significant amount -- a significant portion of the activity and also the economy behind the industry, and we expect that to be the case going forward. \nEric Handler: Great. And just as a second question, comparing your guidance to what was in the S-4 from a few months back, I'm curious if there was -- when you look at the sort of puts and takes it looks like the bookings guide is a little lower than your internal budget. The EPS guide is a little better than internal budgets. Anything you could talk about maybe what's changed on the margin since then? \nLainie Goldstein: The projections that we gave on the S-4 were not exactly our guidance because these numbers reflected our internal estimates as of a point in time, which was back in December 2021. So there's always some fluidity in our release slate, our marketing plans, the overall operating expense needs and those can change our projections over time. \n Also like our net bookings guidance was affected by the Russia-Ukraine situation. So those numbers are not included in our projections, in our guidance right now. So that really affected it. So there's always shifts in our impact on our software development costs and marketing expenses, which also affected the bottom line. So those are some of the differences between guidance and the S-4. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Thornton with Truist Securities. \nMatthew Thornton: Hit on a little bit, but Lainie, I'm wondering if you can maybe quantify some of the discrete items that have kind of been going on in the last 3 months. And what I'm getting at there is Russia, as you alluded to as well as currency. How can we think about that headwind maybe versus where we were 3 months ago? \n And then maybe more broadly, I don't know if this is for Strauss or Karl, any latest thoughts on just where you think we are in the \"reopening\"? Are we at a normal run rate? And similarly, just player behavior, obviously, there's a lot going on again on the macro front. I'm kind of curious your thoughts on what you're seeing in the player behavior more broadly? Any color there would be very helpful. \nLainie Goldstein: So for the first one, Russia and Ukraine is not a big material number for us, but it is something that did change between the S-4 and our guidance. Probably a bigger difference in the top line with more of some of the fluidity in our release schedule. In terms of the currency, it wasn't a huge change for us between those few months. We have a pretty big natural hedge. So there really isn't a big change between then and now for us.\n When we set our guidance, we set it based on the spot rate at the time. So any major changes from the time that we set our forecast, that could be a difference going forward. But as of right now, it's based on that spot rate. \nKarl Slatoff: And in terms of the post-COVID outlook, it does feel like we basically are at -- in a normalized situation right now. And actually, things have quite worked out basically as we thought they would. We expected that our audiences would stay with us and they have. And we also expected that we would see some level of pullback in terms of engagement amongst that audience, which we've seen some of that. \n And I think you can see that reflected across the entire industry. But at this point, I would characterize it as we sort of normalized, we've stabilized, and I think we're back on the growth trajectory that we were all anticipating a year ago when we expect -- that we felt [ that occurred ] this way. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Mario Lu with Barclays. \nX. Lu: Great. I have 2 on GTA. So for GTA V products, you mentioned that conversion rate came in above your expectations. So is there a possibility of that subscription kind of being offered to the current gen players as well in the future? And then secondly, you mentioned that I believe the full year guide for GTA recurring consumer spending is going to be down this year. So how should we think about the cadence of update this year for GTA Online and going forward in terms of current gen versus next gen? \nStrauss Zelnick: Yes, we haven't given have any news about broadening the subscription offering. We're thrilled about how it's been rolled out so far. We're thrilled with the conversion rate. And it's clear that consumers really like the opportunity to engage with GTA Online and they value the -- what we're offering through a subscription. And with regard to ongoing content updates, Rockstar has said there's more content coming, and we're excited about that. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Baird. \nColin Sebastian: All right. Maybe just a follow-up on the normalization of usage and engagement monetization trends. I guess we're looking at mounting concerns about a recession, maybe even stagflation. I think historically, the industry has performed pretty well in economic slowdowns, downturns. But curious, Strauss, I guess, how you're thinking about the macro environment? Are there scenarios where we could see an impact to the growth in investment strategy on the horizon? \n And related to that, on the mobile side, I mean there are concerns that the softening we saw in the March quarter might continue through the year. So curious if that impacts at all your plans for Zynga integration and the synergies. \nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks for your question. Look, people would like to claim that entertainment is countercyclical or immune to cyclicality, that is not the case. The entertainment business will be affected by an overall economic slowdown. However, we can be seen as resistant to such a slowdown. So for example, if you go back to '08 and '09, the market actually grew in 2008 by 20%. It did decline in '09, but the 12% drop was less pronounced than many other business segments. And after September 11, the U.S. gaming market actually grew by 42% in '01 and 11% in '02. \n So in the event of the consumer recession and I'm not going to opine on that because I'm not sure my opinion is very valuable. In such an event, I think we will be resistant but not immune, but we can withstand any such slowdown without a problem. And look, if you put out great entertainment, people will come out for it, and they'll come out in good times and in bad, sometimes they'll come out more in bad times. \n By the way, I don't think there's any evidence that we're going to have stagflation. Stagflation referred to a time when there was both high unemployment and high inflation. And by high inflation, mortgage rates were over 16%. We're not in that ballpark. \n We're not close to that ballpark, and we have very low unemployment rates in this country right now. So stagflation doesn't seem to me to be a meaningful risk. Some kind of moderate recession, I think, I suppose, is conceptually a risk, but it wouldn't have an impact on this business that we can perceive at the time. \n In terms of mobile games, T2 Mobile Games did just fine. They're performing incredibly well and continue to perform well in the fourth quarter. So if that's any guide about how we're going to do, we feel just great about the pending combination with Zynga, and we think there's wonderful opportunities there. \n And we think that some of the challenges, for example, the post-IDFA world actually create opportunities for a company that has the kind of consumer database that we collectively have with Zynga and the data analytics that we have to help us navigate that database. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Omar Dessouky with Bank of America. \nOmar Dessouky: There's been some debate in the market as to the size of the total addressable market for Grand Theft Auto VI, which was discussed in a blog post by Rockstar because it will launch into the Gen 9 console cycle, whereas the Grand Theft Auto V launched slightly before PlayStation 4 and Xbox One were launched. \n So will such a graphically intensive game be as performance on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 or even the Nintendo Switch as it will be on Xbox X and PlayStation 5? And does streaming technology have the potential to make older generation console and mobile devices capable of a satisfactory performance for such a state-of-the-art game? \nStrauss Zelnick: Well, in reverse order, there are no -- really aren't very many streaming platforms that are up and running right now. Stadia is still up and running. It's -- they don't have that many titles and they have relatively small audience. We've been very supportive of Stadia, but it's a tiny portion of our business, to be clear. And of course, there's Xbox, but these are not meaningful markets right now. .\n I'm not sure I understood the question. If you're asking like, will the launch of the next update in the Grand Theft Auto series, which has been discussed by Rockstar in a blog post as you pointed out, have a salutary effect on the launch of upcoming platforms. Was that your question? When you're talking about... \nOmar Dessouky: No, no, it's really the question of whether the installed base -- we should think about the installed base as the Xbox One -- sorry, Xbox One/PlayStation 4 plus Xbox X/PlayStation 5 or only Xbox X/PlayStation 5 in which case the TAM would be smaller. \nStrauss Zelnick: So Rockstar hasn't talked about any details at all about the next generation of Grand Theft Auto. So there'll be more information to come. But I have no doubt that when that moment comes, and there is another iteration that we'll be releasing to a very robust market. \nOmar Dessouky: Okay. Could I just ask you also a quick follow-up? In terms of your capitalized development expenses, do those typically accelerate as you head closer towards the launch of a big game like Grand Theft Auto VI? Or are they relatively flat over time? \nLainie Goldstein: It depends on what games are being worked on and what the -- how big the teams are that are working on the game. So over time, the balance on the balance sheet will go up and down based on what titles are releasing and how the games are being developed. But it doesn't go in line with any one specific game. There's a lot of games being worked on. And as Karl mentioned, there is a large amount of titles that are in the pipeline, and most of those are capitalized other than our mobile titles. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Benjamin Soff with Deutsche Bank. \nBenjamin Soff: So just now that the FIFA license is officially kind of up for grabs. I wanted to gauge your interest in building out a soccer franchise, either simulation or non-simulation? And if you've looked into it or thought about it, how do you see the different opportunities and challenges there? \nStrauss Zelnick: Well, we noticed, and we tend to be thoughtful about our business at all times. We're excited about building out our sports business, and we don't have much else to say at the moment. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Fitzgerald with Wells Fargo. \nBrian Fitzgerald: Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep, it was featured in the PS5, PlayStation Plus and it included a preorder from Wonderland. So just wondering if that Dragon's Keep engagement correspondent with preordering eventually drove conversions, if that was a unique dynamic, if you -- if that was helpful to how the -- that particular marketing program works. \n And then Strauss, you highlighted cross-play functionality with Tiny Tina's. Is there anything notable to call out with respect to what you're seeing in the cross form -- platform plate there, either versus other prior games or other cohorts of players because you've mentioned a nice influx of those who had not previously played Borderlands games. \nKarl Slatoff: I'll take the second part of the question first in terms of the cross-play. The cross-play component of Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is terrific. And we're really excited about that. We think cross-play generally is great for the consumer to have people being able to play against each other, with each other, across console and PC. That's an ideal situation. \n And we do think that, that ability has helped with Tiny Tina's. I don't have any specific data to share of how many of the new people was because of cross-play, that part I don't have to share. But I can tell you, obviously, it's a good component and is very well executed by Gearbox. And I just -- could I ask you just for -- I didn't really quite understand the first part of the question about Assault on Dragons. What was the specific question there? \nBrian Fitzgerald: So there was -- if I recall correctly, there was a -- it was highlighted -- Assault on Dragon was highlighted in PS5 and the PlayStation Plus, and it included a Wonderlands' preorder screen. So I'm just wondering if that engagement with Dragon Keep kind of built momentum and drove conversions in terms of people preordering or even engaging with that and then eventually buying Wonderland. \nKarl Slatoff: Yes. I would -- again, I don't have numbers -- specific numbers to share with you, but that was a significant marketing beat for us. Any time that we can reengage a consumer base into a franchise, particularly to launch a new franchise, it's going to have a very positive effect. And obviously, we were blessed to have Tiny Tina's because that's one of the most beloved characters in the Borderlands series. So to have access to that, they put out some content prior to the release of Wonderlands. Obviously, it had a positive impact on us and drove momentum prior. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Cost with Morgan Stanley. \nMatthew Cost: I guess just on the hiring front, you mentioned in the prepared remarks that you added 1,000 developers to the developer base this year. What are you seeing in the way of competition for those developers and wage inflation? And if you are seeing any amount of wage inflation, is that impacting your outlook for hiring for the rest of the year?\n And then on the M&A front, obviously, you're still in the process of closing the Zynga deal, but it does seem like we're in a moment after many years of running the business with very little leverage and cash on the balance sheet, like there are opportunities out there to go after assets at depressed valuation. So I guess, are you on the hunt post Zynga or more focused on kind of the integration effort in the near term? \nKarl Slatoff: Sure. In terms of the wage inflation, I think like many other companies, we are feeling the impact of wage inflation and particularly since the labor market is pretty tight right now. That being said, we really do believe that we're very well positioned to attract and retain talent. We offer highly competitive compensation packages, benefit packages, many of which include profit sharing and equity. So when the company succeeds, our employees succeed, and that is very well appreciated. \n And there's also the element of our culture where people come here because they like to work here. And they can -- and particularly on the creative side, where they have the freedom to pursue their passions in a way that also enables them to enrich themselves at the same time. So yes, I would say everybody in the entire market is feeling some impact of the tight labor market. But I think, generally speaking, we're pretty well positioned because we consider that a competitive strength of ours. \nStrauss Zelnick: And on the M&A side, our story has mostly been an organic growth story for a very long period of time. We've selectively acquired companies that have great intellectual property and great teams. And then, of course, we acquired Social Point, Playdots and Nordeus in order to enter the mobile business and most excitingly, we expect to close our combination with Zynga next week.\n But over the 15-year history that this management team has been here at Take-Two, the bulk of our growth, the bulk of our success has been organically driven. And I think that will continue going forward. \n And we have a great opportunity because combined with Zynga, we have the best collection of owned intellectual property for PC and console and mobile in the business. And I think the most talented creative people, the most talented executives. Of course, I'm speaking from our perspective, but I believe that, and I think we have to deliver on that promise, and we will do so organically.\n I don't know what opportunities exist given what I hope will be a short-term re-rating of interactive entertainment stocks. Ultimately, all securities will trade up on their fundamentals. And the fundamentals in this business are quite strong, and I think will continue to be strong. That said, we have the ability in a highly disciplined way to do more inorganic growth transactions. And if they make sense to us, we will pursue them. But it's probably not the first order of business. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Thornton with Truist Securities. \nMatthew Thornton: A couple of quick follow-ups. Just coming back to the capital allocation question there, Strauss. I think a couple of quarters back, it might have been the fiscal third quarter, you actually bought back some stock for the first time in several years. I know you guys have typically done that pretty opportunistically.\n So my first question here is, given the pullback in the shares after you kind of closed the Zynga deal, would buybacks or opportunistic buybacks be something you'd entertain? Or are you trying to perhaps bring leverage down faster? Just kind of any thoughts there? \n And then just secondly and relatedly, post close of Zynga, would you wait until the following quarter to issue pro forma guidance? Is that something you might entertain intra-quarter? Just any way for us to think about that would be helpful. \nStrauss Zelnick: Yes. We've said that we believe in returning capital to the shareholders when it makes sense, economically, and we've done buybacks on an opportunistic basis. Generally speaking, when we perceive there to be a deep value opportunity in the marketplace, we perceived such deep value at $158 a share sitting here today, we were wrong about that. But it's still this management team's view that, that represents deep value of this company for what that's worth. \n We are heading into a transaction we have put leverage on the company for the first time ever. And so I think again, buybacks won't be our first order of business, but we do retain the flexibility to pursue buybacks if we decide to do so. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike -- I'm sorry were you still... \nStrauss Zelnick: Sorry. We still have Lainie to answer the second part of the question. \nOperator: oh, my apologies. \nLainie Goldstein: No problem. So for the guidance at Zynga, we plan to provide consolidated guidance when we report our Q1 results in early August. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Hickey with The Benchmark Company. \nMichael Hickey: Strauss, Karl, Lainie, Nicole, nice quarters, guys. Congratulations. Two questions. The first, I'm not sure how much you can speak to this, but sort of, Lainie, maybe your philosophy on guidance as it relates to mobile, do you think there's much of a delta there in terms of what Zynga has provided to the Street historically? \n And then more, I guess, the higher view, when you look at the mobile market through the first quarter here, how are you reflecting on growth of mobile? And is it meeting your expectations? And I have a follow-up. \nLainie Goldstein: In terms of our guidance process in terms of mobile, we haven't closed the transaction yet. So we'll start to work with Zynga closely and get a chance to get under the numbers with them and make sure we have a consistent approach towards how we plan all of our business. So that's the plan right now. \nMichael Hickey: And then Strauss, did you have a view just on mobile market growth, if it's still tracking where you thought it would be or first quarter end has changed your view at all? \nStrauss Zelnick: Yes, we don't track growth to [ a fixed ] quarter-to-quarter. But long term, we believe that there's a wonderful opportunity in interactive entertainment generally and that mobile will continue to be a rapidly growing segment of the marketplace. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Creutz with Cowen and Company. \nDouglas Creutz: One of the Zynga's key executives recently left to go to [ be CEO of another company ]. Just wondered if you could give any update on your plans for how the mobile business is going to be run assuming that transaction closes. \nStrauss Zelnick: It's a little early to have that conversation because the transaction has not closed yet. Zynga has been operating successfully as an independent company for approximately 15 years, and they have highly experienced key personnel across all areas of their business under Frank Gibeau's leadership. Zynga has a deep bench of talent, including many executives who aren't exactly public-facing in their roles, but they are running the business on a day-to-day basis. \n So we're highly confident that there are plenty of talented executives at the -- what will become the Zynga division of Take-Two, assuming everything goes according to plan. And we're very excited about the future together and we'll have much more to say about that company after the deal closes. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Martin Yang with Oppenheimer. \nMartin Yang: This is more of a longer-term question for Strauss. Can you maybe share with us how would you characterize the impact of great individual creators? Is there any impact on the commercial outcome of the games? And has that really changed since you started working in the industry? \nStrauss Zelnick: Well, I think we have -- we've put more focus on creative talent here, Take-Two than perhaps any other company in the Interactive Entertainment business and our success has reflected that choice. It's an easy thing to say, it's a hard thing to do. We truly encourage the most creative people in the industry to come to our company and work on what they're passionate about. And we make decisions that are in service of that approach, that strategy and our goal to make great art as well as to make great hits.\n The work is done by teams, all the work here is done by teams, but the leadership is crucial. And we have great creative leadership across the board, and we're really, really proud of that great creative leadership and grateful to them for the results that they continue to deliver here. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Marok with Raymond James. \nAndrew Marok: You mentioned that you saw some success in the stand-alone GTA Online version. I guess who are the players that are getting into GTA online at this point? How do they differ from the legacy GTA online players to the extent that you can provide quantitative guide around that as well? And then secondly, is there any update that you guys have to share maybe on your NFL partnership? \nStrauss Zelnick: Yes. I think on the GTA players, I think what's most interesting is that the market continues to grow, that we've sold in 165 million units of the title even though it was launched in 2013, the title has dominated now 3 console generations. And when we created a stand-alone version of Grand Theft Auto Online, lots of people showed up to play it. \n So clearly, the market is huge and continues to grow. And I think Rockstar has done a great job in continuing to make the market accessible for people over a long period of time. But no, we don't have anything specifically to say about the particular people who've shown up even though we have a lot of good data. \n And we don't have anything right now to say about the NFL partnership, although we're excited about it and looking forward to releases that will come in the future. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Clay Griffin with MoffettNathanson. \nClayton Griffin: Just a point of clarification there. I know it was late in the quarter, but the stand-alone price for GTA Online, is that -- I'm assuming that's getting booked at RCS or maybe there's some nuance there just to confirm that.\n And then just I'm curious if you could maybe put some thoughts around just the strategy around that. I think Strauss, you've called the combination of the full gain online of tethered and free-to-play just how successful that's been in the past, obviously. But any thoughts around -- should we assume that, that is kind of the MO, I guess, for future titles of this size or ilk? \nStrauss Zelnick: Sorry, I apologize. If you can, what was your question about pricing? \nLainie Goldstein: Stand-alone. \nClayton Griffin: Just curious if the stand-alone pricing for GTA Online, is that getting booked as recurring consumer spending? Or is that being booked as a full game, I guess, is the first question and the second question... \nLainie Goldstein: So the stand-alone game itself is a full game. But if you're playing it online and buying virtual currency, that's RCS. \nStrauss Zelnick: And your second question? I'm sorry, I missed the second one as well. \nClayton Griffin: Sure. No, just general thoughts on considering the relative success of tying GTA Online to GTA V, if we should expect that that's the kind of modus operandi for games of this stature, for your biggest IP going forward. \nStrauss Zelnick: We have said that we expect to offer opportunities to engage with our titles on an ongoing basis after release. We aim to provide such opportunities and to monetize them when it makes sense. But there are all different ways to do that. That could be downloadable add-on content or that could be an online multiplayer game. It really depends on the title and as the labels get ready to market and release titles, that will generally be made clear. So it varies title by title. There's not going to be just one singular approach going forward. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Drew Crum with Stifel. \nAndrew Crum: So I know there's some commentary in the preamble about ramping up profitability in fiscal '24 and '25. Is that solely a function of scale? Or do you also anticipate slowing down the investment spend? And where will we see fluctuation in investment spending going forward? \nLainie Goldstein: It's a combination of scale and also the investments other than direct marketing, we would expect those to slow down. The direct marketing will be in line with what titles come out. But the other expenses like headcount and IT expenses and rent, we would expect that to slow down. \nStrauss Zelnick: We want to thank you all for your questions today, for your attention, for joining us and for your support. We really appreciate it. Thanks, all. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Karl Slatoff",
            "content": "Thanks, Strauss. I'd like to begin by thanking our teams around the world for delivering another outstanding year for our company. Strong results were driven by our colleagues' passion, creativity and commitment to deliver value for all of our stakeholders. \n I'll now discuss our recent first quarter releases. On April 21, 2K and Gearbox Software released Coiled Captors, the first of 4 exciting downloadable content packs in the Tiny Tina's Wonderlands season pass. Featuring a new environment, boss encounter and legendary loots, the offering represents an innovative post-launch experience from this exciting new franchise.\n On April 26, 2K and Visual Concepts launched the Banzai Pack, featuring 5 playable superstars plus MyFACTION EVO cards for each. This is the first of 5 downloadable plan content offerings for WWE 2K22, all of which will be available individually and as part of the game's season pass throughout the year.\n Looking ahead, fiscal 2023 will be another exciting year for Take-Two as we deliver captivating new entertainment experiences for our players while also growing our business through our pending combination with Zynga.\n I'll now provide details on Take-Two's fiscal 2023 pipeline on a stand-alone basis, which includes 18 planned releases. We expect to deliver 6 immersive core offerings, all of which will be available for purchase. These include The Quarry, an all-new or narrative game from 2K and Supermassive Games where every choice, big or small, shapes her story and determines who lives to tell the tale. \n Featuring an iconic ensemble cast of Hollywood stars, including David Arquette, Ariel Winter, Justice Smith, Brenda Song, Lance Henriksen, Lin Shaye and more. The Quarry will launch on June 10 for PlayStation and Xbox consoles and Windows PC via Steam.  \n Marvel's Midnight Suns is planned for release during the second half of calendar 2022 and is one of this year's most anticipated games. The title is being developed by Firaxis Games, the acclaimed studio that brought audience such iconic franchises as Sid Meier's Civilization and XCOM and features the Marvel Universe's most revered heroes and entirely new gameplay experience. 2K will have more to share in the coming months.  \n Kerbal Space Program 2, which is coming from Private Division and Intercept Games, is now expected to launch on PC in early calendar 2023, and on console later in calendar 2023. Anticipation for the title is high, with more than 12 million views of the announcement trailer. The dedicated Kerbal community can look forward to more information about the game and its new features from the title's ongoing gameplay reveal video series.  \n Turning to our annual sports offerings. Fans can expect all new releases from our popular sports series, including NBA 2K23, WWE 2K23 and PGA TOUR 2K23, which will debut legendary Gulf icon Tiger Woods as the game's Executive Director. 2K will have more to share about these titles shortly.  \n Continuing with our fiscal 2023 pipeline, we plan to release 8 mobile titles, including 4 from new franchises and 4 from existing franchises and 3 mid-core RK titles for purchase, which include one new sports title from 2K, a new franchise from Private Division and a new tales from the Borderlands game, which will feature new characters and stories set in the Borderlands universe. And lastly, we'll have one new iteration of a previous released title available for purchase.  \n Our labels will continue to provide new content and experiences that drive engagement and recurrent consumer spending across many of their hit franchises including NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online, Red Dead Redemption Online, WWE 2K, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, OlliOlli World and more. \n Excluding our pending combination with Zynga, we expect to deliver 51 titles throughout fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025, which we believe will pave the way for us to achieve a strong acceleration in net bookings and growth and profitability. This includes 18 immersive core releases, 7 of which are sports simulation games. 16 of these will be available for purchase while 2 will be free-to-play. 10 independent titles, which will all be avail for purchase; 12 free-to-play mobile games; 4 mid-core games for purchase, 2 of which will be sports-oriented; and 7 new iterations of previously released titles, which will all be available for purchase.  \n Bears noting that these titles are a snapshot of our current development pipeline. It is likely that some of these titles will not be developed through completion that launch timing may change and that we will also be adding new titles to our slate. In addition to our full game releases, we will continue to offer post loss content for many of our releases, ranging from virtual currency sales to DLC packs and Season Passes.  \n Turning to eSports. The NBA 2K League kicked off its fifth season on March 23 and included new sponsors such as Google and Coinbase. This year, the league has partnered with the City of Indianapolis to bring all tournaments as well as playoffs and finals to its new home at The Pavilion at Pan Am. \n The League's overall price pool has increased to $2.5 million this season, the largest since its inception. We remain very excited about the continued success and growth of the NBA 2K League, which has a long-term potential to enhance engagement and to be a driver of profits for our company.  \n In closing, as we execute on our organic growth initiatives and unlock new opportunities presented by our pending transaction with Zynga, we believe that we can broaden our portfolio and capitalize further on new platforms, business models, emerging markets and distribution channels. As we deliver on these growth opportunities, we believe that Take-Two is exceedingly well positioned to deliver long-term value for our shareholders.   \n I'll now turn the call over to Lainie. It's Karl. Actually, I think that we never, as an industry, went away from the attractiveness of the story mill content. We've always said that we believe in that kind of content. We've always delivered on that as a company. It's the ultimate entertainment experience. And I think what you're seeing is you're just seeing some other games in the market capitalize on that.\n I think there are a number of them out there right now, so maybe it looks that way. But when you look at it over time, story-driven content has always been a significant amount -- a significant portion of the activity and also the economy behind the industry, and we expect that to be the case going forward. And in terms of the post-COVID outlook, it does feel like we basically are at -- in a normalized situation right now. And actually, things have quite worked out basically as we thought they would. We expected that our audiences would stay with us and they have. And we also expected that we would see some level of pullback in terms of engagement amongst that audience, which we've seen some of that. \n And I think you can see that reflected across the entire industry. But at this point, I would characterize it as we sort of normalized, we've stabilized, and I think we're back on the growth trajectory that we were all anticipating a year ago when we expect -- that we felt [ that occurred ] this way. I'll take the second part of the question first in terms of the cross-play. The cross-play component of Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is terrific. And we're really excited about that. We think cross-play generally is great for the consumer to have people being able to play against each other, with each other, across console and PC. That's an ideal situation. \n And we do think that, that ability has helped with Tiny Tina's. I don't have any specific data to share of how many of the new people was because of cross-play, that part I don't have to share. But I can tell you, obviously, it's a good component and is very well executed by Gearbox. And I just -- could I ask you just for -- I didn't really quite understand the first part of the question about Assault on Dragons. What was the specific question there? Yes. I would -- again, I don't have numbers -- specific numbers to share with you, but that was a significant marketing beat for us. Any time that we can reengage a consumer base into a franchise, particularly to launch a new franchise, it's going to have a very positive effect. And obviously, we were blessed to have Tiny Tina's because that's one of the most beloved characters in the Borderlands series. So to have access to that, they put out some content prior to the release of Wonderlands. Obviously, it had a positive impact on us and drove momentum prior. Sure. In terms of the wage inflation, I think like many other companies, we are feeling the impact of wage inflation and particularly since the labor market is pretty tight right now. That being said, we really do believe that we're very well positioned to attract and retain talent. We offer highly competitive compensation packages, benefit packages, many of which include profit sharing and equity. So when the company succeeds, our employees succeed, and that is very well appreciated. \n And there's also the element of our culture where people come here because they like to work here. And they can -- and particularly on the creative side, where they have the freedom to pursue their passions in a way that also enables them to enrich themselves at the same time. So yes, I would say everybody in the entire market is feeling some impact of the tight labor market. But I think, generally speaking, we're pretty well positioned because we consider that a competitive strength of ours."

            "name": "Lainie Goldstein",
            "content": "Thanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal 2022 results and then review our financial outlook for the full year and first quarter of fiscal 2023. Please note that our initial outlook does not include Zynga in our projected results or the interest expense on the notes that Take-Two issued in April to fund the cash portion of our pending acquisition of Zynga. Additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release. \n I'm extremely pleased with the accomplishments that Take-Two delivered during the fourth quarter and fiscal year. We posted strong financial results, took exciting steps to position the company for long-term growth and announced our transformational pending combination with Zynga, which brings massive potential to our portfolio and financial profile. I'd like to thank our teams for their passion commitment and for continuing to help Take-Two deliver its strategic vision. \n Starting with our fourth quarter. Total net bookings grew 8% to $846 million. Our newly released WWE 2K22 and Tiny Tina's Wonderlands outperformed our expectations, as did Red Dead Redemption 2. During the period, digitally-delivered net bookings grew 4% and accounted for 91% of the total. This exceeded our outlook of a slight increase due to the outperformance of digitally-delivered full game sales. 75% of console game sales were delivered digitally, up slightly from last year. \n As Strauss mentioned, over the last few months, there's been a wide array of long-awaited, high-quality new releases in the market, including several of our own exciting titles that have not deployed significant live service offering. Accordingly, our recurrent consumer spending declined 6% and accounted for 60% of total net bookings. \n GAAP net revenue grew 11% to $930 million, while cost of goods sold increased 43% to $399 million, driven by amortization of software development costs for our fourth quarter release. Operating expenses increased by 32% to $403 million, driven by the addition of Nordeus, including its earn-out as well as higher marketing and transaction costs. And GAAP net income was $111 million or $0.95 per share compared to $290 million or $1.88 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.\n Turning to our fiscal 2022 results. Total net bookings were $3.41 billion as compared to $3.55 billion in the prior year. As we expected, throughout the year, our engagement trends are notably higher than they were pre-pandemic. However, as the world began settling into a new normal, there was a moderation of the trends that benefited our industry during the height of the pandemic. \n As a result, digitally-delivered net bookings declined 2%, slightly outperforming our guidance of a 3% decline and accounted for 91% of the total. 68% of our console game sales were delivered digitally, up from 64% last year, and recurrent consumer spending declined 6%. Non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow was $425 million as compared to our outlook of over $400 million. \n During fiscal 2022, we spent $159 million in capital expenditures. At fiscal year-end, our cash and short-term investments balance was approximately $2.6 billion. GAAP net revenue grew 4% to $3.5 billion, while cost of goods sold was flat at $1.5 billion. Operating expenses increased 24% to $1.5 billion driven primarily by the additions of Playdots and Nordeus, including the revaluation of its earn-out, higher personnel, stock compensation, marketing and IT expenses and higher transaction costs. And GAAP net income was $418 million or $3.58 per share as compared to $589 million or $5.09 per share in the prior year. \n Today, we provided our initial fiscal 2023 outlook for Take-Two on a stand-alone basis. We project net bookings to range from $3.75 billion to $3.85 billion, which is a new record level for the company and implies strong growth of 11% at the midpoint. We have an exciting pipeline of releases that we expect to bring to market during the year, including 6 immersive core titles, which is twice as many as we delivered in fiscal 2022. \n The largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, Marvel's Midnight Sun and PGA TOUR 2K23. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 60% 2K, 30% Rockstar Games and 10% Private Division and T2 mobile games. And we forecast our geographic net booking split to be about 60% United States and 40% international. \n We expect recurrent consumer sending to be flat compared to fiscal 2022 and represents 58% of net bookings, which is down from 64% last year due to a greater number of new releases. We project digitally-delivered net bookings to grow 10% and represent 91% of net bookings, which is in line with last year. Our forecast assumes that 71% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 68% last year. \n We expect to generate more than $350 million in non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow, and we plan to deploy approximately $120 million for capital expenditures. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $3.67 billion to $3.77 billion and cost of goods sold to range from $1.66 billion to $1.7 billion. \n Our total operating expenses are expected to range from $1.74 billion to $1.76 billion. At the midpoint, this represents a 17% increase over the prior year. As Karl mentioned, we have approximately 69 titles that we plan to deliver over the next 3 years, and we will be investing behind our pipeline in key areas such as marketing, personnel and IT. And we expect GAAP net income to range from $223 million to $252 million or $1.90 to $2.15 per share. For management reporting purposes, we expect our tax rate to be 16% throughout fiscal 2023. \n Now moving on to our guidance for the fiscal first quarter. We project net bookings to range from $700 million to $750 million as compared to $711 million in the first quarter last year. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K22, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, The Quarry and WWE 2K22. We expect digitally-delivered net bookings to increase 2%. \n Our forecast assumes that 78% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 73% in the same period last year. We project recurrent consumer spending to decline by 10% as we believe that the momentum behind our own exciting titles that have not deployed significant live service offerings will continue into the first quarter. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $810 million to $860 million and cost of goods sold to range from $307 million to $333 million. \n Operating expenses are expected to range from $387 million to $397 million. At the midpoint, this represents a 25% increase over last year, driven primarily by higher personnel and marketing expenses as well as transaction costs. And GAAP net income is expected to range from $93 million to $105 million or $0.80 to $0.90 per share. \n In closing, we have great confidence in our ability to drive accelerated growth into fiscal 2023 and beyond. And we believe that our pending combination with Zynga will take our business to an even greater level of scale and profitability. As we execute on our strategic initiatives, we believe that we can deliver sustainable, profitable growth for our shareholders. \n Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Strauss. Yes. So the first year is definitely due to the comp against the year with COVID from last year. So we had a really strong Q1. And so comping against that quarter was very difficult. And then this quarter, we were seeing a lot of people playing the full game that we put out as well as some of our competitors. So that also affected RCS in the quarter. So in Q1, we're expecting to be down by about 10%, and that's the ongoing of what we're seeing in Q4, which is the players playing the full games of our games and some of our competitors. So that's continuing. We've seen that in Q1, and we expect to see that. For the full year, we expect to see it flat for the full year. So some of our new games that are coming out don't have any recurrent consumer spending associated with that. We expect NBA to be up for the year. And then GT Online and Red Dead Online, we expect to be down for the year. The projections that we gave on the S-4 were not exactly our guidance because these numbers reflected our internal estimates as of a point in time, which was back in December 2021. So there's always some fluidity in our release slate, our marketing plans, the overall operating expense needs and those can change our projections over time. \n Also like our net bookings guidance was affected by the Russia-Ukraine situation. So those numbers are not included in our projections, in our guidance right now. So that really affected it. So there's always shifts in our impact on our software development costs and marketing expenses, which also affected the bottom line. So those are some of the differences between guidance and the S-4. So for the first one, Russia and Ukraine is not a big material number for us, but it is something that did change between the S-4 and our guidance. Probably a bigger difference in the top line with more of some of the fluidity in our release schedule. In terms of the currency, it wasn't a huge change for us between those few months. We have a pretty big natural hedge. So there really isn't a big change between then and now for us.\n When we set our guidance, we set it based on the spot rate at the time. So any major changes from the time that we set our forecast, that could be a difference going forward. But as of right now, it's based on that spot rate. It depends on what games are being worked on and what the -- how big the teams are that are working on the game. So over time, the balance on the balance sheet will go up and down based on what titles are releasing and how the games are being developed. But it doesn't go in line with any one specific game. There's a lot of games being worked on. And as Karl mentioned, there is a large amount of titles that are in the pipeline, and most of those are capitalized other than our mobile titles. No problem. So for the guidance at Zynga, we plan to provide consolidated guidance when we report our Q1 results in early August. In terms of our guidance process in terms of mobile, we haven't closed the transaction yet. So we'll start to work with Zynga closely and get a chance to get under the numbers with them and make sure we have a consistent approach towards how we plan all of our business. So that's the plan right now. Stand-alone. So the stand-alone game itself is a full game. But if you're playing it online and buying virtual currency, that's RCS. It's a combination of scale and also the investments other than direct marketing, we would expect those to slow down. The direct marketing will be in line with what titles come out. But the other expenses like headcount and IT expenses and rent, we would expect that to slow down."

            "name": "Strauss Zelnick",
            "content": "Thanks, Nicole. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today.  \n Our strong fourth quarter results concluded another highly successful year for our company. We delivered net bookings of $3.4 billion, which reflect our creative team's unwavering commitment to quality and the ability to deliver captivating and engaging entertainment experiences that transcend geographies and generations. \n On behalf of our management team, I'd like to thank all of our colleagues around the world for helping us to achieve these results, especially as we continue to navigate through the new normal following the pandemic.\n During the year, we positioned our organization strategically for long-term growth. To that end, we bolstered our creative teams by adding nearly 1,000 new developers, including through the acquisition of several talented studios which will help us expand our capabilities and support our growing pipeline of offerings. We broadened our portfolio further with the introduction of new intellectual properties and business models to drive player engagement. \n We agreed upon our pending combination with Zynga, which will grow our audience significantly and increase exponentially our net bookings for mobile, the fastest-growing segment in interactive entertainment, while also providing us with substantial cost synergies and revenue opportunities. As we build our scale, we believe that we can grow our margins meaningfully.  \n Lastly, we advanced our ESG efforts, and I'm pleased that we recently published our first dedicated report, which includes information on our initiatives to date as well as our road map for the future.  \n During the quarter, our newly released WWE 2K22 and Tiny Tina's Wonderlands outperformed our expectations, as did Red Dead Redemption 2. NBA 2K22 continued to grow its audience, with the title selling in over 10 million units to date and exceeding sell-in from the prior year. \n During the fourth quarter, engagement remained very strong with average active days of playing up 6% on average games per user, up 13% year-over-year. In addition, NBA 2K22 Arcade Edition continues to hold the #1 position on Apple Arcade's top game chart. And for the full year, downloads of NBA 2K Mobile increased nearly 25% as compared with fiscal 2021. We see a significant opportunity to add unique and innovative experiences throughout the game and focus on expanding our player base.  \n On March 11, 2K and Visual Concepts returned triumphantly to the Squared Circle with the eagerly anticipated release of WWE 2K22, which achieved the highest Metacritic scores on both Xbox and PlayStation platforms in franchise history. Setting new benchmarks for quality, the title offers more features and enhancements than any prior release in the series, including a redesigned gameplay engine, new controls, foundational improvements, upgraded visuals and an array of options requested by our passionate player base.  \n Notably, WWE 2K22 sell-in for its first 4 weeks exceeded the levels achieved for both WWE 2K19 and WWE 2K20, even with the revised release window that was not during the holiday season. Consumer engagement with the title has been outstanding with over 140 million in-game matches played to date and over 5.6 million hours of WWE 2K22 content viewed on Twitch.\n I'd like to thank 2K and the WWE team of Visual Concepts for their commitment to reestablishing this incredible franchise. We greatly appreciate WWE's immense support in launching this year's game and look forward to continuing and building upon our successful partnership in the years to come.  \n On March 25, 2K and Gearbox Software released Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, an all-new fantasy-fueled offering that has taken our partnership with Gearbox to new creative heights and is viewed as the best new franchise launch from 2K in several years. The title has resonated with core fans and new audiences alike with nearly 30% of players having never before played a Borderland's title. \n To date, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands has exceeded our expectations and is being supported with cross-play functionality, an array of post-launch content and a season pass. I'd like to congratulate 2K and Gearbox on delivering another stellar game, and we look forward to the possibilities for this new franchise in the years to come.  \n During the fourth quarter, Rockstar Games expanded the reach of their iconic entertainment experience, Grand Theft Auto V, with the release of new versions of the game upgraded specifically for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S. This marked the third console generation for which the game has been made available since its initial launch in 2013. And to date, the title has sold in more than 165 million units.  \n Also for the first time ever, Grand Theft Auto Online was made available as a stand-alone title for the latest generation consoles. Featuring an array of graphical and technical enhancements, a new career builder, new vehicles and more, these versions were well received by the game's vast community of players. \n In the period, Grand Theft Auto Online maintained its massive audience size from the prior year, while growing 8% and 74% as compared to the fourth quarters of fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. In addition, Rockstar Games launched GTA+, an all-new membership program that's exclusive to Grand Theft Auto Online players on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S consoles whereby participants can receive a range of valuable player-friendly benefits, including a monthly deposit of GTA dollars and other bonuses designed to help players experience everything Grand Theft Auto Online has to offer, including access to major content packs like last holiday's, The Contract. Initial conversion has been above our expectations, which we believe bodes well for this to be an ongoing engagement driver over time.  \n Red Dead Redemption 2 continued to expand its audience and to date has sold in more than 44 million units worldwide. Results for the series were notably above our expectations for the period, which is further proof of the ongoing popularity of Rockstar's blockbuster entertainment experiences.\n Turning to Private Division. The label's recently acquired studio, Roll7, successfully launched OlliOlli World in February, which received significant critical praise for its unique art style and impressive gameplay mechanics. We'll support the title with its first expansion, Void Riders, in the first half of this fiscal year.  \n Championing the best independent talent in our industry, Private Division recently signed 4 new publishing agreements with leading independent developers, Die Gute Fabrik, Evening Star, Piccolo Studio and Yellow Brick Games. We look forward to working with these talented teams.  \n During the fourth quarter, recurrent consumer spending declined 6% over last year and accounted for 60% of net bookings. Over the past few months, the consumer has seen a wide array of long-awaited high-quality new releases in the market, including several of our own exciting titles that have not deployed significant live service offerings. We believe that this dynamic has impacted our overall recurrent consumer spending.  \n NBA 2K and Grand Theft Auto Online were the largest contributors to our current consumer spending during the fourth quarter, and many of our free-to-play offerings were notable drivers as well. Top Eleven continued to perform very well following our acquisition and was our #1 mobile title during the fourth quarter. Two Dots delivered notable year-over-year growth and posted its best ever net bookings performance driven by new in-game events and successful marketing activations. Dragon City and Monster Legends delivered a solid finish to the year, supported by enhanced live operations.  \n WWE SuperCard has now been downloaded more than 26 million times and remains 2K's highest grossing mobile game. And NBA 2K Online in China outperformed our expectations. The title remains the #1 online PC sports game in the region with nearly 57 million registered users.  \n We're incredibly excited about our future path of growth, including our pending combination with Zynga. We believe that this will be a transformative moment for Take-Two as we continue to build upon our core tenants to become the most innovative, the most creative and the most efficient entertainment company in the world. Combined, we'll create a powerhouse of industry-leading titles that span key platforms and genres across interactive entertainment, developed by some of the most creative and forward-thinking talent within the industry.  \n Later this week, our respective shareholders who will vote on the transaction, which, assuming such approvals are obtained, we anticipate will close on May 23, 2022. On a stand-alone basis, for fiscal 2023, we expect to achieve a new record of $3.75 billion to $3.85 billion in net bookings as we plan to deliver many new exciting releases during the year. \n Looking ahead and excluding the impact of our combination with Zynga, we expect fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025 to set even higher records of net bookings for our company alongside a significant ramp-up in profitability.  Lainie will provide additional details on our outlook shortly, while Karl will share an update on our exciting diverse multiyear pipeline, including approximately 69 titles that we plan to release through fiscal 2025.\n In closing, we're highly optimistic about our future. As we continue to expand our enterprise and execute on our growth strategies, we believe that Take-Two remains incredibly well positioned to increase its scale and prominence within the industry, expand margins and deliver long-term value for our shareholders.  \n I'll now turn the call over to Karl. Thanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for delivering another outstanding year. And to our shareholders, I'd like to express our appreciation for your continued support. \n We'll now take your questions. Operator? Well, no one likes to see their stock price experience a drawdown, but we ultimately will always trade on our fundamentals, and that's how we look at the company. So we have a really strong company. We continue to perform and outperform expectations as we have in this quarter and this fiscal -- this past fiscal year. We've just issued initial guidance, which is a very positive look at our company and at the market. So we remain in a very optimistic place and I think similarly situated companies probably feel the same way. \n When the overall market re-rates, there's nothing that we can do about it nor something that we would wish to do about it. We don't need to access the capital markets at this price level. We're under-leveraged under, no matter how you look at it. We have a small amount of investment grade debt coming with the closing of the Zynga transaction. And then we have a really powerful company that we expect to continue to fire on all cylinders. So momentary changes in the market are kind of irrelevant to us. Yes, we haven't given have any news about broadening the subscription offering. We're thrilled about how it's been rolled out so far. We're thrilled with the conversion rate. And it's clear that consumers really like the opportunity to engage with GTA Online and they value the -- what we're offering through a subscription. And with regard to ongoing content updates, Rockstar has said there's more content coming, and we're excited about that. Thanks for your question. Look, people would like to claim that entertainment is countercyclical or immune to cyclicality, that is not the case. The entertainment business will be affected by an overall economic slowdown. However, we can be seen as resistant to such a slowdown. So for example, if you go back to '08 and '09, the market actually grew in 2008 by 20%. It did decline in '09, but the 12% drop was less pronounced than many other business segments. And after September 11, the U.S. gaming market actually grew by 42% in '01 and 11% in '02. \n So in the event of the consumer recession and I'm not going to opine on that because I'm not sure my opinion is very valuable. In such an event, I think we will be resistant but not immune, but we can withstand any such slowdown without a problem. And look, if you put out great entertainment, people will come out for it, and they'll come out in good times and in bad, sometimes they'll come out more in bad times. \n By the way, I don't think there's any evidence that we're going to have stagflation. Stagflation referred to a time when there was both high unemployment and high inflation. And by high inflation, mortgage rates were over 16%. We're not in that ballpark. \n We're not close to that ballpark, and we have very low unemployment rates in this country right now. So stagflation doesn't seem to me to be a meaningful risk. Some kind of moderate recession, I think, I suppose, is conceptually a risk, but it wouldn't have an impact on this business that we can perceive at the time. \n In terms of mobile games, T2 Mobile Games did just fine. They're performing incredibly well and continue to perform well in the fourth quarter. So if that's any guide about how we're going to do, we feel just great about the pending combination with Zynga, and we think there's wonderful opportunities there. \n And we think that some of the challenges, for example, the post-IDFA world actually create opportunities for a company that has the kind of consumer database that we collectively have with Zynga and the data analytics that we have to help us navigate that database. Well, in reverse order, there are no -- really aren't very many streaming platforms that are up and running right now. Stadia is still up and running. It's -- they don't have that many titles and they have relatively small audience. We've been very supportive of Stadia, but it's a tiny portion of our business, to be clear. And of course, there's Xbox, but these are not meaningful markets right now. .\n I'm not sure I understood the question. If you're asking like, will the launch of the next update in the Grand Theft Auto series, which has been discussed by Rockstar in a blog post as you pointed out, have a salutary effect on the launch of upcoming platforms. Was that your question? When you're talking about... So Rockstar hasn't talked about any details at all about the next generation of Grand Theft Auto. So there'll be more information to come. But I have no doubt that when that moment comes, and there is another iteration that we'll be releasing to a very robust market. Well, we noticed, and we tend to be thoughtful about our business at all times. We're excited about building out our sports business, and we don't have much else to say at the moment. And on the M&A side, our story has mostly been an organic growth story for a very long period of time. We've selectively acquired companies that have great intellectual property and great teams. And then, of course, we acquired Social Point, Playdots and Nordeus in order to enter the mobile business and most excitingly, we expect to close our combination with Zynga next week.\n But over the 15-year history that this management team has been here at Take-Two, the bulk of our growth, the bulk of our success has been organically driven. And I think that will continue going forward. \n And we have a great opportunity because combined with Zynga, we have the best collection of owned intellectual property for PC and console and mobile in the business. And I think the most talented creative people, the most talented executives. Of course, I'm speaking from our perspective, but I believe that, and I think we have to deliver on that promise, and we will do so organically.\n I don't know what opportunities exist given what I hope will be a short-term re-rating of interactive entertainment stocks. Ultimately, all securities will trade up on their fundamentals. And the fundamentals in this business are quite strong, and I think will continue to be strong. That said, we have the ability in a highly disciplined way to do more inorganic growth transactions. And if they make sense to us, we will pursue them. But it's probably not the first order of business. Yes. We've said that we believe in returning capital to the shareholders when it makes sense, economically, and we've done buybacks on an opportunistic basis. Generally speaking, when we perceive there to be a deep value opportunity in the marketplace, we perceived such deep value at $158 a share sitting here today, we were wrong about that. But it's still this management team's view that, that represents deep value of this company for what that's worth. \n We are heading into a transaction we have put leverage on the company for the first time ever. And so I think again, buybacks won't be our first order of business, but we do retain the flexibility to pursue buybacks if we decide to do so. Sorry. We still have Lainie to answer the second part of the question. Yes, we don't track growth to [ a fixed ] quarter-to-quarter. But long term, we believe that there's a wonderful opportunity in interactive entertainment generally and that mobile will continue to be a rapidly growing segment of the marketplace. It's a little early to have that conversation because the transaction has not closed yet. Zynga has been operating successfully as an independent company for approximately 15 years, and they have highly experienced key personnel across all areas of their business under Frank Gibeau's leadership. Zynga has a deep bench of talent, including many executives who aren't exactly public-facing in their roles, but they are running the business on a day-to-day basis. \n So we're highly confident that there are plenty of talented executives at the -- what will become the Zynga division of Take-Two, assuming everything goes according to plan. And we're very excited about the future together and we'll have much more to say about that company after the deal closes. Well, I think we have -- we've put more focus on creative talent here, Take-Two than perhaps any other company in the Interactive Entertainment business and our success has reflected that choice. It's an easy thing to say, it's a hard thing to do. We truly encourage the most creative people in the industry to come to our company and work on what they're passionate about. And we make decisions that are in service of that approach, that strategy and our goal to make great art as well as to make great hits.\n The work is done by teams, all the work here is done by teams, but the leadership is crucial. And we have great creative leadership across the board, and we're really, really proud of that great creative leadership and grateful to them for the results that they continue to deliver here. Yes. I think on the GTA players, I think what's most interesting is that the market continues to grow, that we've sold in 165 million units of the title even though it was launched in 2013, the title has dominated now 3 console generations. And when we created a stand-alone version of Grand Theft Auto Online, lots of people showed up to play it. \n So clearly, the market is huge and continues to grow. And I think Rockstar has done a great job in continuing to make the market accessible for people over a long period of time. But no, we don't have anything specifically to say about the particular people who've shown up even though we have a lot of good data. \n And we don't have anything right now to say about the NFL partnership, although we're excited about it and looking forward to releases that will come in the future. Sorry, I apologize. If you can, what was your question about pricing? And your second question? I'm sorry, I missed the second one as well. We have said that we expect to offer opportunities to engage with our titles on an ongoing basis after release. We aim to provide such opportunities and to monetize them when it makes sense. But there are all different ways to do that. That could be downloadable add-on content or that could be an online multiplayer game. It really depends on the title and as the labels get ready to market and release titles, that will generally be made clear. So it varies title by title. There's not going to be just one singular approach going forward. We want to thank you all for your questions today, for your attention, for joining us and for your support. We really appreciate it. Thanks, all."

Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we delivered another strong quarter, highlighted by net bookings of $866 million, which exceeded our expectations and increased 6% over the prior year. Our outstanding holiday season results were driven by our new and existing titles as well as strong, ongoing engagement from our player communities that continue to immerse themselves in their favorite experiences and exciting new content updates.\n We continue to position our company to deliver on its long-term pipeline, build scale and gain market share. During the quarter, we grew our pool of creative talent with the addition of more than 300 developers. This includes our highly complementary acquisitions of elite3d and Roll7. Based in Valencia, Spain, elite3d is one of the world's leading creative studios that is dedicated to innovative 2D and 3D artwork for the interactive entertainment industry. elite3D will form a second office for 2K's 31st Union studio and serve as a new publishing location for 2K's Global Services Division.\n Roll7 is the BAFTA award-winning studio behind OlliOlli World, which is launching tomorrow. Going forward, the team will help support Private Division's mission to bring games to market from the industry's top creative studios as well as to broaden the label's portfolio of owned intellectual property and internal development capabilities.\n Our most significant recent development was our agreement to combine with Zynga, which we expect to close during the first quarter of our fiscal 2023. We're very excited by the prospect of this transformative combination, which will significantly diversify our business; establish us as a leader in mobile, the fastest-growing segment of the interactive entertainment industry; and greatly enhance our positioning as one of the world's top 3 pure-play publishers of interactive entertainment. \n We believe there will be tremendous strategic and financial benefits for our company and we've already identified $100 million of annual cost synergies that we expect to achieve within the first 2 years post-closing and over $500 million of annual revenue opportunities that we can deliver over time. We look forward to welcoming the teams at Zynga into the Take-Two family in the coming months.\n Turning to our third quarter results. Our better-than-expected performance was driven primarily by Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy -- The Definitive Edition, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online and NBA 2K22. NBA 2K22 continued to exceed our expectations. And according to the [ MPT Group ], it was the #1 selling title in the U.S. across all new releases in calendar 2021. In addition, the game achieved a new franchise record for experiencing the largest number of users in the shortest amount of time. This performance helped solidify NBA 2K's legacy as the top basketball simulation experience in our industry with over 8 million units sold-in to date worldwide.\n Players remain deeply engaged, and an average of 1.9 million users are playing the game every day, which is up 10% compared to NBA 2K21 in the same period last year. This helped drive better-than-expected recurrent consumer spending growth of 10% year-over-year even as we face challenging comparisons from the Gen 9 launch of the game last November. In addition, NBA 2K22 experienced an 8% increase in total in-game purchasers and a 30% increase in new-to-franchise spenders. 2K expanded the brand's addressable market further with the launch of NBA 2K22 Arcade Edition for Apple Arcade. The title continues to sit at the top of the Arcade's top game chart and has an average score of 4.7 out of 5 across more than 35,000 ratings.\n We continue to be pleased with the ongoing innovation that Visual Concepts brings to the series annually and look forward to seeing how they'll deliver new experiences to NBA 2K in the future.\n Sales of Grand Theft Auto V continue to be strong, and to date, the title has sold-in more than 160 million units worldwide. Since its launch in 2013, Grand Theft Auto V has remained within the top 5 best-selling titles for each calendar year across the Americas, including the U.S., and over 50 major territories across Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific.\n 2021 marked another excellent year for Grand Theft Auto Online with the title matching 2020's record-setting monthly audience size. Grand Theft Auto Online's engagement was driven by an array of free content updates, including new events around Halloween, new vehicles and clothing options for the race creator, and the contract update featuring Grammy award-winning artist, legendary producer in this year's Super Bowl halftime show headliner, Dr. Dre, which were all released during the third quarter. In particular, the contract broke new ground for Grand Theft Auto Online from a design standpoint with its deep story elements and increased access for solo players while also advancing Rockstar Games' unique ability to innovate through incorporating elements of pop culture and music into their experiences.\n The update also features co-op story missions with Grand Theft Auto V Protagonist Franklin and sidekick Lamar's playable characters; a new social space, Record A Studios, where players were able to hang out with Dr. Dre and special guests; a new radio station hosted by global pop stars Rosalia and Arca, called Motomami Los Santos, named after Rosalia's forthcoming album; updates to 2 existing radio stations from L.A. DJ royalty, DJ Pooh and Big Boy; 6 exclusive new tracks by Dr. Dre, which officially released to streaming services this past Friday; and new purchasable properties, vehicles and more.\n In addition, Rockstar Games celebrated the 20th anniversary with the launch of Grand Theft Auto III with the release of Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy -- The Definitive Addition for current and prior-gen consoles and PC via the Rockstar Games Launcher with the title significantly exceeding our commercial expectations.\n Red Dead Redemption 2 also had an excellent quarter. The title's outperformance was primarily driven by strong holiday sales and to date, it has sold-in nearly 43 million units worldwide. In addition, Red Dead Online outperformed our expectations due to strong sales of Red Dead Redemption 2 and the continued influx of new players alongside a series of updates, including the fourth installment of the Quick Draw Club, All Hallows' Call to Arms, The Halloween Pass 2 and Holiday Call to Arms.\n 2K and Gearbox Software expanded our popular Borderland series further with the release of Borderlands 3 Ultimate Edition. Our teams also rereleased the 2013 fan favorite, Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep: A Wonderlands One-Shot Adventure on a stand-alone basis, which exceeded our expectations and is helping set the stage for next month's eagerly anticipated launch of Tiny Tina's Wonderlands. \n During the third quarter, recurrent consumer spending rose 2% over last year, which was in line with our expectations of a slight increase and accounted for 57% of net bookings. Our ability to captivate and deeply engage audiences with our offerings remains a distinguishing characteristic of our enterprise. NBA 2K and Grand Theft Auto Online were the largest contributors to recurrent consumer spending, and many of our free-to-play offerings were notable drivers as well.\n Nordeus delivered a strong quarter as its newly released Top Eleven 2022 achieved record-high seasonal net bookings, driven by new features, gameplay improvements and enhanced live operations. Two Dots (sic) [ Dots Two ] posted record net bookings results, attributable to additional in-game events, curated seasonal content and successful marketing activations. Dragon City and Monster Legends performance was driven by enhanced live operations, new event types and strong seasonal content. \n 2K launched Season 8 for WWE SuperCard, which has now been downloaded more than 25 million times and remains 2K's highest-grossing mobile game. NBA 2K Online in China outperformed our expectations. The title remains the #1 online PC sports game in the region with over 55 million registered users.\n Turning to our outlook. As a result of our third quarter outperformance, along with our updated forecast for the balance of the year, we are once again raising our guidance for fiscal year 2022 and we now expect to achieve net bookings of $3.37 billion to $3.42 billion. Lainie will provide more details shortly.\n Looking ahead, we remain highly optimistic about the future of the interactive entertainment industry and our multiyear growth trajectory. We have the strongest and most diverse pipeline in our company's history, comprised of new intellectual properties as well as sequels to many of our beloved franchises. We look forward to delivering many of these titles in the coming months and beyond.\n We're also confident that we can emerge as an even stronger player within our industry and deliver long-term value for our shareholders following the anticipated closing of our transaction with Zynga. With greater scale, extensive synergies and a more diversified portfolio of industry-leading titles, we believe that together, our 2 companies will far exceed our individual goals. We'd like to thank all of our stakeholders for their continued support.\n I'll now turn the call over to Karl. \nKarl Slatoff: Thanks, Strauss. I'd like to thank our teams for delivering another outstanding quarter driven by their continued commitment to excellence and dedication to our business.\n I'll start by discussing our announced offerings planned for the remainder of this fiscal year. Tomorrow, Private Division and our recently acquired Roll7 Studio will launch OlliOlli World on Nintendo Switch, Xbox and PlayStation consoles and Steam. This skateboard and action performer has been eagerly awaited by fans and received significant critical praise for its unique art style and tight gameplay mechanics. Reviews for OlliOlli World have been extremely positive with multiple sites recommending or calling the title an essential purchase, with the game currently scoring an 85 on OpenCritic and 84 on Metacritic. We're thrilled to add this popular series to our portfolio and to pursue exciting new projects with the talented team at Roll7.\n In early March, 2K and Visual Concepts will launch WWE 2K22, which we believe will set a new benchmark in quality for the series. The game offers more features and enhancements than any prior WWE 2K release, including a redesigned gameplay engine, new controls, foundational improvements, upgraded visuals and an array of features specifically requested by our passionate player base. WWE 2K22 will hit different, giving players complete control over the game's universe, including a new look and feel, accessible but challenging gameplay and significant replay value.\n Rey Mysterio, one of the most renowned and respected WWE icons of all time, will grace the cover of this year's game in true Lucha Libre fashion. We can't wait for players to step into the ring with WWE 2K22 and experience all the groundbreaking enhancements on which our teams have been tirelessly working.\n On March 15, Rockstar Games will launch Grand Theft Auto V for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S and X, bringing the blockbuster entertainment experience to an unprecedented third-console generation. This new release features new graphics, modes -- features new graphic modes with up to 4K resolution, up to 60 frames per second, texture and draw distance upgrades, HDR options and rate tracing as well as faster loading times, immersive 3D audio, platform-specific features and much more. We are also excited for new players to join the thriving Grand Theft Auto Online community on the latest hardware when the stand-alone offering is released in March, with Grand Theft Auto Online free on PlayStation 5 for the first 3 months.\n PlayStation 4 and Xbox One players eager to continue their journey on the newest generation of hardware will be able to transfer both the Grand Theft Auto V Story Mode progress and their current Grand Theft Auto Online characters and progression to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S with a one-time migration at launch.\n On March 25, 2K and Gearbox Software will launch an exciting delay tree from the Borderlands universe, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, the highly anticipated fantasy-fueled and all new take on the looter shooter genre. During the game awards in December, 2K debuted a story trailer introduced on stage by members of Tiny Tina's Wonderlands' all-star celebrity cast. On the heels of the star-studded event, player segment for Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is at an all-time high. We expect the segment to continue to build as we grant access to media and content creators for extended previews and reviews and reveal new gameplay details in the coming weeks. We are looking forward to wrapping up our fiscal year with this tent-pole release.\n Looking ahead to fiscal year 2023. Rockstar Games will launch Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy -- The Definitive Edition for iOS and Android devices in the first half of calendar 2022. 2K and Firaxis Games remain deeply immersed in the development of Marvel's Midnight Suns, one of our most exciting upcoming releases, which will launch this fall. The team is diligently working to add more story content, cinematics and overall polish to the game. Given the immense global popularity and cross-media presence of the Marvel Universe, coupled with Firaxis Games' proven success in creating deeply immersive games, we believe this title has the potential to appeal to a broad audience that will enjoy experiencing some of comics' most legendary heroes in all new way.\n Private Division and Intercept Games remain hard at work on Kerbal Space Program 2, the next iteration in our beloved space exploration simulation series. We'll have more to share about our fiscal 2023 pipeline in the coming months and during our fourth quarter call in May.\n Turning to eSports. The NBA 2K League is gearing up for its fifth season, which will provide a thrilling tournament-centric structure, including 3-on-3 gameplay, amateur teams versus NBA2K League teams and a significantly higher price pool. On February 26, fans can tune in to the league's Twitch and YouTube channels to watch its draft on live stream. \n In keeping with its ongoing commitment to women in eSports, last month, the League held its third annual Women in Gaming Development Camp and brought together top amateur female NBA 2K players to compete alongside and learn from League players and coaches and to participate in off-court development sessions focused on amplifying the voices in women in gaming.\n In closing, we believe there is a vast potential for our company to continue captivating and engaging audiences around the world by delivering the very best entertainment experiences. The next few months represent an exciting time for Take-Two as we release many of our new titles and prepare for a transformative combination with Zynga, which brings with it a diverse portfolio of titles, impressive data science capabilities, industry-leading publishing and live operations, a massive customer database and their leading advertising platform, Chartboost. Together, we expect to benefit from substantial costs in publishing synergies while also unlocking significant new revenue streams and reaching new audiences around the world. As we capitalize on these and other opportunities, we believe we will deliver long-term value for our shareholders.\n I'll now turn the call over to Lainie. \nLainie Goldstein: Thanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our third quarter results and then review our financial outlook for our fiscal year 2022 and fourth quarter. Please note that additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release.\n As Strauss mentioned, our holiday results were outstanding driven by strong engagement across our key franchises. Net bookings were $866 million, which was above our guidance of $800 million to $850 million and up 6% as compared to last year. Our outperformance was primarily driven by Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy -- The Definitive Addition, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online and NBA 2K22. \n During the period, recurring consumer spending increased 2% compared to our outlook of a slight increase and accounted for 57% of total net bookings. Digitally delivered net bookings increased 12%, which was above our outlook of a 5% increase and accounted for 88% of the total. Our outperformance was primarily due to higher-than-expected digitally delivered full game sales. During the quarter, 63% of console game sales were delivered digitally, up from 56% last year.\n GAAP net revenue increased 5% to $903 million, and cost of goods sold increased 1% to $350 million. Operating expenses increased by 18% to $399 million, primarily driven by higher personnel and stock-based compensation expenses; the addition of Nordeus and the revaluation of its earn-out; partially offset by lower marketing expense. GAAP net income was $145 million or $1.24 per share as compared to $182 million or $1.57 per share in the third quarter last year. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.5 billion of cash and short-term investments.\n Turning to our guidance. I'll begin with our full fiscal year expectations. We are raising our net bookings outlook range to $3.37 billion to $3.42 billion. This is up from our prior outlook of $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion due to our third quarter outperformance, along with our updated forecast for the fourth quarter. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be: NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Borderlands 3 and Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy -- The Definitive Edition. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our label to be roughly 50% 2K, 40% Rockstar Games and 10% Private Division and T2 Mobile Games. We forecast our geographic net booking split to be about 60% United States and 40% international.\n We now expect recurrent consumer spending to decline by 5% compared to our prior outlook of a 6% decline and represents 65% of net bookings, which is in line with last year. We now project digitally delivered net bookings to decrease by approximately 3% compared to our prior outlook of a 4% decline. 90% of our net bookings are expected to be digital, slightly above 89% last year. Our forecast assumes that 69% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 64% last year.\n We expect to generate more than $400 million in non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow, and we plan to deploy approximately $170 million for capital expenditures. We are raising our GAAP net revenue outlook to $3.41 billion to $3.46 billion, and we now expect cost of goods sold to range from $1.52 billion to $1.54 billion.\n Total operating expenses are expected to range from $1.48 billion to $1.49 billion, which at the midpoint represents a 23% increase over the prior year. This increase includes investments in marketing, personnel, IT and research and development that will help us deliver our expansive multiyear pipeline. It also reflects the addition of Nordeus and a full year of Playdots as well as an increase in stock compensation expense. Our operating expense expectations are slightly above our prior guidance, primarily driven by the transaction costs associated with our anticipated combination with Zynga.\n We expect GAAP net income to range from $361 million to $373 million or $3.10 to $3.20 per share. For management reporting purposes, we expect our tax rate to be 16% for the remainder of fiscal 2022.\n Now moving to our guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter. We project net bookings to range from $808 million to $858 million compared to $785 million in the fourth quarter last year. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, which includes Grand Theft Auto V for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy -- The Definitive Edition and WWE 2K22. We project recurrent consumer spending to be down 3% compared to last year and digitally delivered net bookings to increase slightly.\n Our forecast assumes that 77% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 74% last year. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $835 million to $885 million and cost of goods sold to range from $380 million to $406 million. Operating expenses are expected to range from $389 million to $399 million. At the midpoint, this represents a 30% increase over last year, driven primarily by higher marketing expenses to support our fourth quarter release slate, the addition of Nordeus, and transaction costs associated with our anticipated combination with Zynga. GAAP net income is expected to range from $53 million to $65 million or $0.46 to $0.56 per share.\n Looking ahead, we have many exciting projects underway across all of our labels, and we plan to make continued investments next year to prepare for some of our major launches. With our incredible portfolio of creative assets, our significant growth opportunities, including our robust pipeline and our strong balance sheet, we remain highly confident in our long-term growth trajectory and our ability to deliver shareholder value.\n Before I turn the call back over to Strauss, I'd like to reiterate that we are very excited about our anticipated combination with Zynga. We believe that the proposed transaction will not only bring together our highly complementary portfolios but will also significantly increase Take-Two's scale and provide many new growth opportunities. \n As we disclosed in our January 10 announcement, we expect the combined business to deliver a 14% compound annual growth rate for the 3-year period from our fiscal 2021 through 2024, excluding any of the proposed transactions, revenue opportunities or any future acquisitions. \n In terms of next steps, we expect to file our joint S-4, which includes the proxy statement and prospectus, with the SEC in late February or early March, and our stockholder voting will occur in the spring. We continue to expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2023.\n Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Strauss. \nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for delivering another outstanding quarter. And to our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued support.\n We'll now take your questions. Operator? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Mario Lu with Barclays. \nX. Lu: Maybe first on NBA 2K. You guys mentioned that DAUs and bookings were up 10% year-on-year. So just wondering if you could dig a little bit deeper into whether this growth was due to macro-based factors or new modes within the game. Anything that you can point to that suggests that this growth is sustainable long term? \nKarl Slatoff: Mario, it's Karl. I'm not sure that there's any real macro issues that are going on that I would attribute to the game. I'm sure -- obviously, the NBA is having -- is incredibly successful and is having growth. So that always helps. And we're thrilled with that partnership.\n The game's just great. I mean the game is really out of the gate performed fantastically well. I think people are reacting, first and foremost, to the quality of the game and also to the expansive amount of content in the game. And we're just really focused on driving engagement.\n And I think every year, the team at Visual Concepts and 2K continues to add more and more content, more modes and actually enable those modes to work more seamlessly together with innovations such as the city, neighborhood, et cetera. So really for us, it's about the quality of the game and driving engagement through offering more and more and better content. And that's really what we see driving growth.\n And we're not finished. I mean there's -- we're not nowhere near saturation point at this point. There's a lot of greenfield in front of us. And as long as we continue to deliver on the quality of the content, then we expect the growth to continue for the foreseeable future. \nX. Lu: Got it. And then maybe one on GTA. So yes, playing devil's advocate here a little bit. So one of the main drivers of outperformance this quarter, you guys mentioned, was The Trilogy. But I believe there were a number of bugs launched that affected gameplay. So one, has this issue been fixed? And then two, more importantly, has there been any changes made to the QA process to ensure that this does not happen to future launches such as GTA Enhanced next month and the next entry in the series thereafter? \nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks for the question. Yes, we are totally focused on quality here. And we always want to deliver the best possible experience. Very occasionally, we fall short. And I think The Trilogy was an example of that. And the title was launched with some issues. We've addressed many of them. There are more fixes to come. And going forward, we remain highly focused on quality, and we are exceedingly confident in all of our upcoming releases. \nOperator: Our next question is from Matthew Cost with Morgan Stanley. \nMatthew Cost: So I guess on the 14% CAGR guidance, I think it implies something like $9 billion of revenue for the combined entity in fiscal '24. I guess that seems to imply a pretty significant amount of top line growth kind of for the core Take-Two business, excluding Zynga. So I guess what would you call out as kind of the biggest, most important drivers over the next 2 years to get to that higher revenue base? And which are the most important ones to get there?\n And then I just guess, secondarily on Zynga. You've talked about the opportunity to drive revenue synergies by maybe using the tools at Zynga to bring some of your tent-pole IPs on to mobile in a bigger way than they have been in the past. How long do you think that would take? What does it look like? How much investment would it take to get there? \nLainie Goldstein: Matthew, I'll start with the 14% CAGR. And when we're talking about Take-Two's pipeline of titles, we haven't given any detail deeper than that, but we have been talking about the growth of our pipeline over the last couple of years and the 20 titles per year that we've been growing over time. And that's really what's in those numbers. And we talked about more immersive core titles and how we were supporting the pipeline of title, and that's really where that growth is coming from. \nStrauss Zelnick: And with regard to bringing Take-Two's core intellectual property to mobile with Zynga's help, look, we think that's one of many great opportunities. We've already said that we expect to achieve $100 million in cost synergies annually over the next couple of years. Additionally, we've identified at least $500 million of annual run rate revenue synergies, many of which are unrelated to new game launches, many of which are unrelated to bringing Take-Two IP to mobile.\n However, that is an opportunity. And while we haven't identified any heroics within there, we do think it's an interesting opportunity on a selective basis in the coming years. The actual investment is not significant compared to our core investment in console and PC IP. \nOperator: Our next question is from Colin Sebastian with Baird. \nColin Sebastian: I guess, first off, I'm just wondering for -- if you have any industry-level observations on the quarter that just passed. Several high-profile new releases in the industry underperformed expectations. Just wondering if you -- if there was a common denominator that you saw that might explain that or if they were really just title-specific.\n And then secondly, on the mobile business, and I know we're looking past the close of the acquisition, but just curious to learn a little bit more about the road map for converting a bunch of your really strong console and PC franchises to mobile, how quickly you think that can develop? \nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks for your question. Look, this is -- it's really hard to make hits in any entertainment industry. It's really hard to make hit video games. And now and then, we fall short; and now and then, our competitors fall short. We don't believe there's any trend in the industry. We just think that, over time, as entertainment industries mature, consumers' expectations always increase, and they should. So it's always our goal to do better with each iteration of a franchise or with each launch of a new intellectual property.\n And one of the things we're really proud of in our track record is with regard to our franchises, and we have 11 franchises, for example, that have sold over 5 million units with an individual release, each iteration has always sold more than the prior iteration, which is not always true for the industry and lately has really not been true for the industry, but it is true for us. But it will only remain true for us if we continue to focus on quality mightily. And that's job #1 around here.\n In terms of bringing Take-Two's core intellectual properties to mobile, that remains a very interesting opportunity. As I said earlier, we've identified around $500 million of annual run rate revenue synergies to be achieved in the coming years in the combination with Zynga in addition to $100 million of annual run rate cost synergies. And only a small portion of those synergies on the revenue side are attributable to new releases based on core Take-Two IP.\n So we have not identified any heroics. We know it will take some time. The financial investment in the context of our investing in the console and PC titles is not significant because obviously, the creation of a mobile title is not as heavy a lift. Equally, the hit ratios are not as strong in the mobile space. So I think we have a sober view of where we can go in the future. And we're really excited that we think Zynga's extraordinary developers and their extraordinary publishing abilities will enhance our ability to bring core intellectual property to the mobile market. \nOperator: Our next question is from Doug Creutz with Cowen & Co. \nDouglas Creutz: A couple of questions on RCS. First, if you could just confirm what the RCS growth rate would have been on an organic basis without Nordeus. And then secondly, just to remind, I know that Tiny Tina is shipping with a premium addition that includes access to the season pass. How will that impact your RCS bookings in the fiscal fourth quarter? \nLainie Goldstein: RCS, I don't -- we didn't -- we don't break that out with Nordeus. So it's -- for the quarter, we had 2% up versus slight increase, but I don't have it broken out without Nordeus. But in total, for the year, we expect RCS to be slightly down by about 5%, and we originally expected it to be 15%. So RCS has been pretty strong for the year and beating our expectations for the year so far. So we're pretty happy with the performance for RCS for the year.\n And for Tiny Tina's, we're not breaking out the premium addition and how much that will impact RCS. So we're not giving that level of detail either. \nDouglas Creutz: Well, I'm not asking for details, just conceptually, if you sell a premium edition pass that $30 incremental buy-up, presumably, some of that does benefit your RCS revenue in the quarter, correct? \nLainie Goldstein: Some of it will be added into the RCS. \nOperator: Our next question is from Martin Yang with Oppenheimer. \nMartin Yang: I was under the impression that GTA V Enhanced is not available for purchase yet. Can you confirm that? And how do you think about the pricing strategy for the GTA Enhanced relative to GTA V Premium? Do you intend to use pricing to differentiate the different value proposition between the upcoming Enhanced Edition and the current edition? \nKarl Slatoff: So the GTA Enhanced, so the next-gen version of GTA V are not, in fact, available for purchase yet, but they will be. And in terms of pricing, we haven't discussed any pricing models around those new releases. \nMartin Yang: So conceptually, how would you market the Enhanced Edition versus the Premium Edition? So besides the graphic changes and content, is there any reasons you would give the upcoming potential buyers to purchase the Premium Edition also? \nStrauss Zelnick: Yes. It's an enhanced version for Gen 9 consoles, and there will be a lot of upgrades and plenty of reason to purchase it. And Rockstar, obviously, will be talking about that in the marketing materials. \nOperator: Our next question is from Drew Crum with Stifel. \nAndrew Crum: Share with us where the company is in terms of returning to the office or studio and your confidence in your label's ability to hit the title count you presented in the slide deck? Do you see ongoing work-from-home as a risk to that? \n And then separately, I think in past quarters, you guys have said that you expect fiscal '23 to see a re-acceleration in growth. Does that guidance still hold? \nStrauss Zelnick: Yes. So look, return-to-office is sort of location by location question depending on the state of affairs in each location and what the local authorities are saying. And obviously, we comply with all local regulations. The expectation is that we're either back now or we will be back in the coming months. In any case, the company has proven that we can be very effective without regard to where people are working from. We've had great success in the context of remote work. And while I think all of us are anxious to get back to the office as soon as we possibly can, we're also mindful of the science and the circumstances.\n We haven't had a quality lapse. We haven't had a timing lapse. We haven't had a financial lapse, and we don't expect to. \nLainie Goldstein: So in terms of fiscal year '23, so it's a little early for us to start to give detailed guidance for next year, but we plan to share that on our year-end earnings call in May. But what I can tell you that on a stand-alone basis, we do continue to believe that we will achieve sequential net bookings growth in fiscal year 2023, driven by some of the exciting releases that our labels have been working on. And at the same time, we will make continued investments next year in marketing, talent, in IT and space expansion as we prepare for some of the major launches that our teams have underway, which we project will enable us to deliver record levels of operating performance in the next few years. \nOperator: Our next question is from Matthew Thornton with Truist Securities. \nMatthew Thornton: Obviously, it's been -- fiscal 2022 has been interesting year. And Strauss, I was just wondering if we can get maybe your latest thoughts on maybe where we are in terms of reopening. Obviously, we had data privacy changes that had some impact on the mobile sector. Just kind of your thoughts as to maybe where we are there.\n And then just hiring and retention has been challenging. And I don't think that's gaming-specific thing. I think that's broad-brush. But just curious to get your kind of latest take on some of those countervailing forces this year. \nStrauss Zelnick: Well, in terms of reopening, as I just said, certain of our offices are fully open. Others will be opening in the coming months, depending on what happens in the marketplaces. We will listen to local authorities. We will pay attention to the science, and we're mostly sensitive to the health and well-being of our colleagues around the world. However, my belief is that we will largely be back in office within the next couple of months.\n But I think the broader point is that working remotely has not been an issue for the company in terms of quality or performance. So we'd all love to be back in the office. Our team today, who is on this call, we're all together in the office today, and we like it that way.\n In terms of data privacy, we have not had any issues coming out from the change in IDFA. And we have an extraordinary customer database. And in the combination with Zynga, we expect to have more than 1 billion customer records, which gives us some massive opportunity from a marketing point of view despite the change in IDFA. So we feel just fine about being able to market and, at the same time, to maintain customers' privacy, which is an important value of ours.\n With regard to hiring, we brought on 300 new developers in the quarter. We continue to grow and grow rapidly, and that's been a good news story because we think people really like working at this company. And with regard to retention, it's an even better story. I think we have one of the lowest attrition rates in the industry, if not the lowest. I know our attrition rate is about half that of the industry average. We earn the right to say that every single day. We're really proud of our culture. It's of paramount importance to us. \nMatthew Thornton: Strauss, just one point of clarification, I guess, on the reopening point. I was kind of curious, maybe from the player side, just where you think we are in terms of engagement trends. Are we kind of back to a \"norm\"? I'm just kind of curious your latest thoughts there. \nStrauss Zelnick: Yes. I think -- I don't think we're seeing enhanced demand because of the pandemic. I think we're seeing normalized demand at this point. \nOperator: Our next question is from Brian Fitzgerald with Wells Fargo. \nBrian Fitzgerald: We wanted to ask about the platforms a little bit, maybe like Stadia. Google is reportedly diminishing the gaming focus there. And maybe they just never had enough critical mass in terms of subs. Is there just a limit in terms of, hey, market opportunity for that type of device or experience or yet another platform in the market? Maybe gamers are more excited about enhanced versions for the Gen 9 platforms versus cost.\n And then maybe a related topic, how do you view the recent market activity and the notion of exclusive titles or features of release Windows? Is cross-platforming really just diminishing the need -- actually, the ability to have exclusives? \nStrauss Zelnick: On the first point, look, there's always a marketing story du jour in this business, and we're usually very sober about them. And a couple of years ago, the marketing story du jour was how cloud gaming would completely transform the industry and multiply demand by 20x. And what we said on these calls was we'd love to subscribe to that view, but we didn't subscribe to that view, that we thought streaming and cloud distribution was super interesting but probably wouldn't change the market size materially. And that's exactly what we've seen. It's super interesting, and it's not changing the market size materially.\n So there's broad distribution for our products now for those who want them. And I don't think that anything will occur on the platform side that will significantly change the marketplace going forward. The marketplace will change by virtue of putting out hits or not putting out hits. And I think you alluded to that. So as between platform-driven growth or product-driven growth, I'm going with product-driven growth, which means those who are great will do great and those who are good will have problems.\n Hard for me to opine about exclusive titles. I think in the event that a platform company acquires a label and that label's intellectual property, one could imagine those titles becoming exclusive in certain circumstances. I think outside of that, it's less likely, although there may be short-term exclusivity deals still as there always have been. And I do think cross-platform play is the wave of the future, and you're going to see more and more because consumers will demand it. \nOperator: Our next question is from Benjamin Soff with Deutsche Bank. \nBenjamin Soff: I'd like to ask a little bit about RCS. It was sort of in line with your expectations, whereas over the past few quarters, you posted more meaningful outperformance. So the question is, were there any surprises, either positive or negative, that impacted RCS this quarter? And I've got a follow-up after that. \nLainie Goldstein: So for RCS this quarter, NBA 2K22 outperformed as well as Red Dead Online, and GTA Online was in line with our strong expectations. We had some mobile titles that were modestly -- came in below our expectations. So net-net, we were slightly above our expectations. But when we had forecasted for this quarter, we knew that Q2 we had been so much higher. So we put some strong expectations on the page. So that's why we didn't over-exceed as much as we did last quarter. \nBenjamin Soff: Got it. And then just how should we think about the trajectory of margins for the business over time? Specifically, what are the puts and takes that we should be mindful of as you guys bring to market a much larger number of games in the coming years? \nLainie Goldstein: So in terms of our bottom line margins, our expectation is as we build scale for the business is for our bottom line margins to continue to expand. So this year and next year, we have some investments that we're doing in terms of our operating expenses to drive our top line in terms of our organic growth and our pipeline of titles, as we've been talking about. \n And as that continues to build, our expectations are for our bottom line margins to continue to expand. And we've seen that on years where we've had some big hits, and we continue to expect to have those. And we expect to have some record years in the next couple of years. And with that, we would expect to see our bottom line margins expand. \nOperator: Our next question is from Eric Handler with MKM Partners. \nEric Handler: I wanted to talk a little bit about Red Dead Redemption 2. It looks like you sold on a quarter-over-quarter basis, an incremental 4 million units, your best quarter in a little bit of -- quite some time. I'm curious, was there anything special that led to that increase in unit sales? Or was this sort of seasonality around the holidays? \n And secondly, I'm just curious what you're seeing from new cohort spending on Red Dead Online versus sort of existing cohort spending? \nLainie Goldstein: So for Red Dead Redemption 2, we had a lot of holiday promos during the Christmas season, and that really drove a lot of the units as well as we had a series of updates. So a lot of people were playing the game. So that really drove a lot of those units. And in terms of the new cohort spending, we don't have any real details on that. \nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Hickey with The Benchmark Company. \nMichael Hickey: Congrats on the quarter, guys. Just 2. I'm not sure if you have given us the [ engine ] on this, but the GTA Trilogy for mobile, is that free-to-play? Or is that a premium offering?\n And then second question, just looking at sort of Microsoft's acquisition of Activision, maybe Sony's acquisition of -- or excuse me, acquisition of Bungie, thinking about sort of the rise of subscription plans over time, thinking sort of 3 to 5 years, how you think that sort of changes the competitive landscape, maybe in particular for sort of the mid-lane budget gains if they can still be competitive outside of that subscription plan that's obviously going with a lot of content. \nStrauss Zelnick: So we haven't discussed pricing for Trilogy for mobile yet. And on the competitive landscape, hard to know really. I think there are probably puts and calls. I think assuming the Microsoft acquisition of Activision closes, that means there'll be really 2 very powerful leading pure-play interactive entertainment companies, and we'll be one of them. And I think that probably means there are some advantages in terms of attracting talent and being able to invest in really great experiences and to market them powerfully.\n At the same time, a platform enterprise having an even more robust product slate, there will be benefits. And again, perhaps there'll be some detriments. I think we're very focused on that which we can control, and we tend not to spend a lot of time worrying about things that are out of our control. What's within our control is making hits. And as long as we maintain our approach, which is try to be the most creative, the most innovative and the most efficient company in the business, as long as we focus mightily on quality, we'd do well. And if we have a lapse, if we miss a step, if we divert our attention from that strategy, we don't do as well. So we have our work cut out for us, and we're focused on that work. \nOperator: Our next question is from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. \nStephen Ju: So Strauss and Karl, I want to put you on a spot a little bit. It seems like there has been and continues to be a lot of potential for Private Division publishing opportunities for the company, but there doesn't seem to be a ton of studios out there that you may want to look to acquire maybe. So can you square that dynamic with us? Is it just that access to capital is easy and for the most part, these independent studios value their freedom and maybe want to remain that way? \nStrauss Zelnick: Well, the good news is that Private Division's business model doesn't require us to own the studios we're in business with. In fact, to the contrary. Private Division was set up to offer fantastic publishing marketing services and financing to creators who want to stay independent of the larger enterprises. And Michael Worosz and the team have done a great job building a business that does just that.\n At the same time, we are able to own certain intellectual properties like Kerbal Space Program. And we've just announced that we've acquired Roll7, which makes OlliOlli World, which is being launched tomorrow incidentally and has great Metacritic scores on Switch, and we couldn't be more excited about it.\n So I think right now, Private Division is able really to offer opportunities for those who want to stay independent and opportunities for those who want to be part of the Private Division system. We obviously have plenty of capital to deploy when the opportunity presents itself to own intellectual property. And the sky is the limit. It's still early days for Private Division. We're really excited about what will come in the future. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Andrew Marok with Raymond James. \nAndrew Marok: With the performance of the contract so far and its greater emphasis on single player, I guess, how does that inform your road map for future GTA Online content releases? And does it necessarily say anything about the appetite for single-player experiences more broadly? \nStrauss Zelnick: There was a time when a couple of our competitors were taking a position that single player was dead. We never took that position. We know that there's a role for single player. I believe there will be a role going forward. Then there are certain games that are meant to be only multiplayer experiences.\n Rockstar is known for its storytelling. And yes, Rockstar's also known for these fantastic open-world experiences. They clearly do both really well. And the contract shows, as you just said, that consumers are really excited about Rockstar's storytelling ability. And at the same time, we had a great quarter with Grand Theft Auto Online. So there's a lot of excitement there. So the answer is sort of all of the above. \nOperator: Our next question is from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. \nDavid Karnovsky: Just to follow up on a GTA Trilogy question from earlier. I believe work for the game was largely outsourced. And I think you've noted for remaster support sometimes that that's from a resource standpoint. My question is, does the experience with Trilogy lead you to rethink this model at all? Or is this just an isolated case? \nStrauss Zelnick: We've had precious few quality lapses at this company. So any time that we've fallen short from a quality point of view, it has been an isolated case, and we aim to keep it that way. However, we're not changing our business model. \nOperator: Our next question is from Clay Griffin with MoffettNathanson LLC. \nClayton Griffin: Strauss, on the Zynga M&A call, you noted kind of one of the key strategic benefits of the deal that now you can address a market that was previously not available to you, i.e. outside of kind of the console market, the high end kind of AAA gaming. I suppose like, how do you view that taking shape? I mean, obviously, that market has access to mobile games now. It seems like implicit in that assumption is that you feel that there's demand for kind of what we might call the core Take-Two game experience. But just curious if you view kind of the experiences and the gains that you're thinking about when you think about that market opportunity, if there's any kind of delineation between what you do now, obviously, with AAAs and mobile. Is there a white space kind of in between those 2 things where you think that's where the real opportunity is? \nKarl Slatoff: Clay, it's Karl. I think, look, we've been big supporters and big fans of the mobile market for quite some time. I think that's exhibited in our acquisition strategy over the past few years and obviously with our announced acquisition of Zynga. So it's actually -- it's really exciting for us. And it's not just about the casual space or the mid-core space or the core space. We actually think the mobile market has got room for all the above as it relates to that. It's becoming more sophisticated. The technology is getting better. There's more cross-platform opportunities. There are more examples of the market for mid-core and core franchises having success.\n Obviously, Call of Duty is a perfect example of that, Fortnite as well. So we really do think that there's an opportunity for us to play along the entire spectrum of mobile opportunities, which is hyper-casual, which we've never really been involved with that much, to casual to mid-core to even core experiences.\n And look, down the line, I mean one of the benefits of cloud, should that ever come about, which we do hope that it is, is that it does take some of the stress off of the remote device and allows a lot of the intelligence to be done in the cloud. And that enables folks to us to tap into that market all the more easier. In other words, you don't have to buy a console or a high-end PC in order to play sophisticated games. So we really don't think there's any limitation at all in the mobile space for any of our content, whether it be all the way from hyper-casual to our most core assets. \nClayton Griffin: Makes sense. And do you think that, that takes shape primarily by the way in the way of live services games? Or do you feel like that there's obvious opportunity in kind of the Red Dead Redemption type games as well? \nKarl Slatoff: Yes. I don't -- look, obviously, most of the mobile space right now is more in the live services business. So there's clearly an opportunity there. But I wouldn't say that single-player story content doesn't have a role in mobile either. Again, I wouldn't count out either one of those categories. \nOperator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I will now turn the call over to Strauss Zelnick, Chairman and CEO, for closing remarks. \nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks so much for joining today. We are really grateful to all of our colleagues for delivering another stellar quarter and for the great outlook going forward. Thank you to our shareholders for your continued support, and have a great evening. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Karl Slatoff",
            "content": "Thanks, Strauss. I'd like to thank our teams for delivering another outstanding quarter driven by their continued commitment to excellence and dedication to our business.\n I'll start by discussing our announced offerings planned for the remainder of this fiscal year. Tomorrow, Private Division and our recently acquired Roll7 Studio will launch OlliOlli World on Nintendo Switch, Xbox and PlayStation consoles and Steam. This skateboard and action performer has been eagerly awaited by fans and received significant critical praise for its unique art style and tight gameplay mechanics. Reviews for OlliOlli World have been extremely positive with multiple sites recommending or calling the title an essential purchase, with the game currently scoring an 85 on OpenCritic and 84 on Metacritic. We're thrilled to add this popular series to our portfolio and to pursue exciting new projects with the talented team at Roll7.\n In early March, 2K and Visual Concepts will launch WWE 2K22, which we believe will set a new benchmark in quality for the series. The game offers more features and enhancements than any prior WWE 2K release, including a redesigned gameplay engine, new controls, foundational improvements, upgraded visuals and an array of features specifically requested by our passionate player base. WWE 2K22 will hit different, giving players complete control over the game's universe, including a new look and feel, accessible but challenging gameplay and significant replay value.\n Rey Mysterio, one of the most renowned and respected WWE icons of all time, will grace the cover of this year's game in true Lucha Libre fashion. We can't wait for players to step into the ring with WWE 2K22 and experience all the groundbreaking enhancements on which our teams have been tirelessly working.\n On March 15, Rockstar Games will launch Grand Theft Auto V for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S and X, bringing the blockbuster entertainment experience to an unprecedented third-console generation. This new release features new graphics, modes -- features new graphic modes with up to 4K resolution, up to 60 frames per second, texture and draw distance upgrades, HDR options and rate tracing as well as faster loading times, immersive 3D audio, platform-specific features and much more. We are also excited for new players to join the thriving Grand Theft Auto Online community on the latest hardware when the stand-alone offering is released in March, with Grand Theft Auto Online free on PlayStation 5 for the first 3 months.\n PlayStation 4 and Xbox One players eager to continue their journey on the newest generation of hardware will be able to transfer both the Grand Theft Auto V Story Mode progress and their current Grand Theft Auto Online characters and progression to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S with a one-time migration at launch.\n On March 25, 2K and Gearbox Software will launch an exciting delay tree from the Borderlands universe, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, the highly anticipated fantasy-fueled and all new take on the looter shooter genre. During the game awards in December, 2K debuted a story trailer introduced on stage by members of Tiny Tina's Wonderlands' all-star celebrity cast. On the heels of the star-studded event, player segment for Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is at an all-time high. We expect the segment to continue to build as we grant access to media and content creators for extended previews and reviews and reveal new gameplay details in the coming weeks. We are looking forward to wrapping up our fiscal year with this tent-pole release.\n Looking ahead to fiscal year 2023. Rockstar Games will launch Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy -- The Definitive Edition for iOS and Android devices in the first half of calendar 2022. 2K and Firaxis Games remain deeply immersed in the development of Marvel's Midnight Suns, one of our most exciting upcoming releases, which will launch this fall. The team is diligently working to add more story content, cinematics and overall polish to the game. Given the immense global popularity and cross-media presence of the Marvel Universe, coupled with Firaxis Games' proven success in creating deeply immersive games, we believe this title has the potential to appeal to a broad audience that will enjoy experiencing some of comics' most legendary heroes in all new way.\n Private Division and Intercept Games remain hard at work on Kerbal Space Program 2, the next iteration in our beloved space exploration simulation series. We'll have more to share about our fiscal 2023 pipeline in the coming months and during our fourth quarter call in May.\n Turning to eSports. The NBA 2K League is gearing up for its fifth season, which will provide a thrilling tournament-centric structure, including 3-on-3 gameplay, amateur teams versus NBA2K League teams and a significantly higher price pool. On February 26, fans can tune in to the league's Twitch and YouTube channels to watch its draft on live stream. \n In keeping with its ongoing commitment to women in eSports, last month, the League held its third annual Women in Gaming Development Camp and brought together top amateur female NBA 2K players to compete alongside and learn from League players and coaches and to participate in off-court development sessions focused on amplifying the voices in women in gaming.\n In closing, we believe there is a vast potential for our company to continue captivating and engaging audiences around the world by delivering the very best entertainment experiences. The next few months represent an exciting time for Take-Two as we release many of our new titles and prepare for a transformative combination with Zynga, which brings with it a diverse portfolio of titles, impressive data science capabilities, industry-leading publishing and live operations, a massive customer database and their leading advertising platform, Chartboost. Together, we expect to benefit from substantial costs in publishing synergies while also unlocking significant new revenue streams and reaching new audiences around the world. As we capitalize on these and other opportunities, we believe we will deliver long-term value for our shareholders.\n I'll now turn the call over to Lainie. Mario, it's Karl. I'm not sure that there's any real macro issues that are going on that I would attribute to the game. I'm sure -- obviously, the NBA is having -- is incredibly successful and is having growth. So that always helps. And we're thrilled with that partnership.\n The game's just great. I mean the game is really out of the gate performed fantastically well. I think people are reacting, first and foremost, to the quality of the game and also to the expansive amount of content in the game. And we're just really focused on driving engagement.\n And I think every year, the team at Visual Concepts and 2K continues to add more and more content, more modes and actually enable those modes to work more seamlessly together with innovations such as the city, neighborhood, et cetera. So really for us, it's about the quality of the game and driving engagement through offering more and more and better content. And that's really what we see driving growth.\n And we're not finished. I mean there's -- we're not nowhere near saturation point at this point. There's a lot of greenfield in front of us. And as long as we continue to deliver on the quality of the content, then we expect the growth to continue for the foreseeable future. So the GTA Enhanced, so the next-gen version of GTA V are not, in fact, available for purchase yet, but they will be. And in terms of pricing, we haven't discussed any pricing models around those new releases. Clay, it's Karl. I think, look, we've been big supporters and big fans of the mobile market for quite some time. I think that's exhibited in our acquisition strategy over the past few years and obviously with our announced acquisition of Zynga. So it's actually -- it's really exciting for us. And it's not just about the casual space or the mid-core space or the core space. We actually think the mobile market has got room for all the above as it relates to that. It's becoming more sophisticated. The technology is getting better. There's more cross-platform opportunities. There are more examples of the market for mid-core and core franchises having success.\n Obviously, Call of Duty is a perfect example of that, Fortnite as well. So we really do think that there's an opportunity for us to play along the entire spectrum of mobile opportunities, which is hyper-casual, which we've never really been involved with that much, to casual to mid-core to even core experiences.\n And look, down the line, I mean one of the benefits of cloud, should that ever come about, which we do hope that it is, is that it does take some of the stress off of the remote device and allows a lot of the intelligence to be done in the cloud. And that enables folks to us to tap into that market all the more easier. In other words, you don't have to buy a console or a high-end PC in order to play sophisticated games. So we really don't think there's any limitation at all in the mobile space for any of our content, whether it be all the way from hyper-casual to our most core assets. Yes. I don't -- look, obviously, most of the mobile space right now is more in the live services business. So there's clearly an opportunity there. But I wouldn't say that single-player story content doesn't have a role in mobile either. Again, I wouldn't count out either one of those categories."

            "name": "Lainie Goldstein",
            "content": "Thanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our third quarter results and then review our financial outlook for our fiscal year 2022 and fourth quarter. Please note that additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release.\n As Strauss mentioned, our holiday results were outstanding driven by strong engagement across our key franchises. Net bookings were $866 million, which was above our guidance of $800 million to $850 million and up 6% as compared to last year. Our outperformance was primarily driven by Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy -- The Definitive Addition, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online and NBA 2K22. \n During the period, recurring consumer spending increased 2% compared to our outlook of a slight increase and accounted for 57% of total net bookings. Digitally delivered net bookings increased 12%, which was above our outlook of a 5% increase and accounted for 88% of the total. Our outperformance was primarily due to higher-than-expected digitally delivered full game sales. During the quarter, 63% of console game sales were delivered digitally, up from 56% last year.\n GAAP net revenue increased 5% to $903 million, and cost of goods sold increased 1% to $350 million. Operating expenses increased by 18% to $399 million, primarily driven by higher personnel and stock-based compensation expenses; the addition of Nordeus and the revaluation of its earn-out; partially offset by lower marketing expense. GAAP net income was $145 million or $1.24 per share as compared to $182 million or $1.57 per share in the third quarter last year. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.5 billion of cash and short-term investments.\n Turning to our guidance. I'll begin with our full fiscal year expectations. We are raising our net bookings outlook range to $3.37 billion to $3.42 billion. This is up from our prior outlook of $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion due to our third quarter outperformance, along with our updated forecast for the fourth quarter. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be: NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Borderlands 3 and Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy -- The Definitive Edition. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our label to be roughly 50% 2K, 40% Rockstar Games and 10% Private Division and T2 Mobile Games. We forecast our geographic net booking split to be about 60% United States and 40% international.\n We now expect recurrent consumer spending to decline by 5% compared to our prior outlook of a 6% decline and represents 65% of net bookings, which is in line with last year. We now project digitally delivered net bookings to decrease by approximately 3% compared to our prior outlook of a 4% decline. 90% of our net bookings are expected to be digital, slightly above 89% last year. Our forecast assumes that 69% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 64% last year.\n We expect to generate more than $400 million in non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow, and we plan to deploy approximately $170 million for capital expenditures. We are raising our GAAP net revenue outlook to $3.41 billion to $3.46 billion, and we now expect cost of goods sold to range from $1.52 billion to $1.54 billion.\n Total operating expenses are expected to range from $1.48 billion to $1.49 billion, which at the midpoint represents a 23% increase over the prior year. This increase includes investments in marketing, personnel, IT and research and development that will help us deliver our expansive multiyear pipeline. It also reflects the addition of Nordeus and a full year of Playdots as well as an increase in stock compensation expense. Our operating expense expectations are slightly above our prior guidance, primarily driven by the transaction costs associated with our anticipated combination with Zynga.\n We expect GAAP net income to range from $361 million to $373 million or $3.10 to $3.20 per share. For management reporting purposes, we expect our tax rate to be 16% for the remainder of fiscal 2022.\n Now moving to our guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter. We project net bookings to range from $808 million to $858 million compared to $785 million in the fourth quarter last year. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, which includes Grand Theft Auto V for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy -- The Definitive Edition and WWE 2K22. We project recurrent consumer spending to be down 3% compared to last year and digitally delivered net bookings to increase slightly.\n Our forecast assumes that 77% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 74% last year. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $835 million to $885 million and cost of goods sold to range from $380 million to $406 million. Operating expenses are expected to range from $389 million to $399 million. At the midpoint, this represents a 30% increase over last year, driven primarily by higher marketing expenses to support our fourth quarter release slate, the addition of Nordeus, and transaction costs associated with our anticipated combination with Zynga. GAAP net income is expected to range from $53 million to $65 million or $0.46 to $0.56 per share.\n Looking ahead, we have many exciting projects underway across all of our labels, and we plan to make continued investments next year to prepare for some of our major launches. With our incredible portfolio of creative assets, our significant growth opportunities, including our robust pipeline and our strong balance sheet, we remain highly confident in our long-term growth trajectory and our ability to deliver shareholder value.\n Before I turn the call back over to Strauss, I'd like to reiterate that we are very excited about our anticipated combination with Zynga. We believe that the proposed transaction will not only bring together our highly complementary portfolios but will also significantly increase Take-Two's scale and provide many new growth opportunities. \n As we disclosed in our January 10 announcement, we expect the combined business to deliver a 14% compound annual growth rate for the 3-year period from our fiscal 2021 through 2024, excluding any of the proposed transactions, revenue opportunities or any future acquisitions. \n In terms of next steps, we expect to file our joint S-4, which includes the proxy statement and prospectus, with the SEC in late February or early March, and our stockholder voting will occur in the spring. We continue to expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2023.\n Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Strauss. Matthew, I'll start with the 14% CAGR. And when we're talking about Take-Two's pipeline of titles, we haven't given any detail deeper than that, but we have been talking about the growth of our pipeline over the last couple of years and the 20 titles per year that we've been growing over time. And that's really what's in those numbers. And we talked about more immersive core titles and how we were supporting the pipeline of title, and that's really where that growth is coming from. RCS, I don't -- we didn't -- we don't break that out with Nordeus. So it's -- for the quarter, we had 2% up versus slight increase, but I don't have it broken out without Nordeus. But in total, for the year, we expect RCS to be slightly down by about 5%, and we originally expected it to be 15%. So RCS has been pretty strong for the year and beating our expectations for the year so far. So we're pretty happy with the performance for RCS for the year.\n And for Tiny Tina's, we're not breaking out the premium addition and how much that will impact RCS. So we're not giving that level of detail either. Some of it will be added into the RCS. So in terms of fiscal year '23, so it's a little early for us to start to give detailed guidance for next year, but we plan to share that on our year-end earnings call in May. But what I can tell you that on a stand-alone basis, we do continue to believe that we will achieve sequential net bookings growth in fiscal year 2023, driven by some of the exciting releases that our labels have been working on. And at the same time, we will make continued investments next year in marketing, talent, in IT and space expansion as we prepare for some of the major launches that our teams have underway, which we project will enable us to deliver record levels of operating performance in the next few years. So for RCS this quarter, NBA 2K22 outperformed as well as Red Dead Online, and GTA Online was in line with our strong expectations. We had some mobile titles that were modestly -- came in below our expectations. So net-net, we were slightly above our expectations. But when we had forecasted for this quarter, we knew that Q2 we had been so much higher. So we put some strong expectations on the page. So that's why we didn't over-exceed as much as we did last quarter. So in terms of our bottom line margins, our expectation is as we build scale for the business is for our bottom line margins to continue to expand. So this year and next year, we have some investments that we're doing in terms of our operating expenses to drive our top line in terms of our organic growth and our pipeline of titles, as we've been talking about. \n And as that continues to build, our expectations are for our bottom line margins to continue to expand. And we've seen that on years where we've had some big hits, and we continue to expect to have those. And we expect to have some record years in the next couple of years. And with that, we would expect to see our bottom line margins expand. So for Red Dead Redemption 2, we had a lot of holiday promos during the Christmas season, and that really drove a lot of the units as well as we had a series of updates. So a lot of people were playing the game. So that really drove a lot of those units. And in terms of the new cohort spending, we don't have any real details on that."

            "name": "Strauss Zelnick",
            "content": "Thanks, Nicole. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we delivered another strong quarter, highlighted by net bookings of $866 million, which exceeded our expectations and increased 6% over the prior year. Our outstanding holiday season results were driven by our new and existing titles as well as strong, ongoing engagement from our player communities that continue to immerse themselves in their favorite experiences and exciting new content updates.\n We continue to position our company to deliver on its long-term pipeline, build scale and gain market share. During the quarter, we grew our pool of creative talent with the addition of more than 300 developers. This includes our highly complementary acquisitions of elite3d and Roll7. Based in Valencia, Spain, elite3d is one of the world's leading creative studios that is dedicated to innovative 2D and 3D artwork for the interactive entertainment industry. elite3D will form a second office for 2K's 31st Union studio and serve as a new publishing location for 2K's Global Services Division.\n Roll7 is the BAFTA award-winning studio behind OlliOlli World, which is launching tomorrow. Going forward, the team will help support Private Division's mission to bring games to market from the industry's top creative studios as well as to broaden the label's portfolio of owned intellectual property and internal development capabilities.\n Our most significant recent development was our agreement to combine with Zynga, which we expect to close during the first quarter of our fiscal 2023. We're very excited by the prospect of this transformative combination, which will significantly diversify our business; establish us as a leader in mobile, the fastest-growing segment of the interactive entertainment industry; and greatly enhance our positioning as one of the world's top 3 pure-play publishers of interactive entertainment. \n We believe there will be tremendous strategic and financial benefits for our company and we've already identified $100 million of annual cost synergies that we expect to achieve within the first 2 years post-closing and over $500 million of annual revenue opportunities that we can deliver over time. We look forward to welcoming the teams at Zynga into the Take-Two family in the coming months.\n Turning to our third quarter results. Our better-than-expected performance was driven primarily by Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy -- The Definitive Edition, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online and NBA 2K22. NBA 2K22 continued to exceed our expectations. And according to the [ MPT Group ], it was the #1 selling title in the U.S. across all new releases in calendar 2021. In addition, the game achieved a new franchise record for experiencing the largest number of users in the shortest amount of time. This performance helped solidify NBA 2K's legacy as the top basketball simulation experience in our industry with over 8 million units sold-in to date worldwide.\n Players remain deeply engaged, and an average of 1.9 million users are playing the game every day, which is up 10% compared to NBA 2K21 in the same period last year. This helped drive better-than-expected recurrent consumer spending growth of 10% year-over-year even as we face challenging comparisons from the Gen 9 launch of the game last November. In addition, NBA 2K22 experienced an 8% increase in total in-game purchasers and a 30% increase in new-to-franchise spenders. 2K expanded the brand's addressable market further with the launch of NBA 2K22 Arcade Edition for Apple Arcade. The title continues to sit at the top of the Arcade's top game chart and has an average score of 4.7 out of 5 across more than 35,000 ratings.\n We continue to be pleased with the ongoing innovation that Visual Concepts brings to the series annually and look forward to seeing how they'll deliver new experiences to NBA 2K in the future.\n Sales of Grand Theft Auto V continue to be strong, and to date, the title has sold-in more than 160 million units worldwide. Since its launch in 2013, Grand Theft Auto V has remained within the top 5 best-selling titles for each calendar year across the Americas, including the U.S., and over 50 major territories across Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific.\n 2021 marked another excellent year for Grand Theft Auto Online with the title matching 2020's record-setting monthly audience size. Grand Theft Auto Online's engagement was driven by an array of free content updates, including new events around Halloween, new vehicles and clothing options for the race creator, and the contract update featuring Grammy award-winning artist, legendary producer in this year's Super Bowl halftime show headliner, Dr. Dre, which were all released during the third quarter. In particular, the contract broke new ground for Grand Theft Auto Online from a design standpoint with its deep story elements and increased access for solo players while also advancing Rockstar Games' unique ability to innovate through incorporating elements of pop culture and music into their experiences.\n The update also features co-op story missions with Grand Theft Auto V Protagonist Franklin and sidekick Lamar's playable characters; a new social space, Record A Studios, where players were able to hang out with Dr. Dre and special guests; a new radio station hosted by global pop stars Rosalia and Arca, called Motomami Los Santos, named after Rosalia's forthcoming album; updates to 2 existing radio stations from L.A. DJ royalty, DJ Pooh and Big Boy; 6 exclusive new tracks by Dr. Dre, which officially released to streaming services this past Friday; and new purchasable properties, vehicles and more.\n In addition, Rockstar Games celebrated the 20th anniversary with the launch of Grand Theft Auto III with the release of Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy -- The Definitive Addition for current and prior-gen consoles and PC via the Rockstar Games Launcher with the title significantly exceeding our commercial expectations.\n Red Dead Redemption 2 also had an excellent quarter. The title's outperformance was primarily driven by strong holiday sales and to date, it has sold-in nearly 43 million units worldwide. In addition, Red Dead Online outperformed our expectations due to strong sales of Red Dead Redemption 2 and the continued influx of new players alongside a series of updates, including the fourth installment of the Quick Draw Club, All Hallows' Call to Arms, The Halloween Pass 2 and Holiday Call to Arms.\n 2K and Gearbox Software expanded our popular Borderland series further with the release of Borderlands 3 Ultimate Edition. Our teams also rereleased the 2013 fan favorite, Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep: A Wonderlands One-Shot Adventure on a stand-alone basis, which exceeded our expectations and is helping set the stage for next month's eagerly anticipated launch of Tiny Tina's Wonderlands. \n During the third quarter, recurrent consumer spending rose 2% over last year, which was in line with our expectations of a slight increase and accounted for 57% of net bookings. Our ability to captivate and deeply engage audiences with our offerings remains a distinguishing characteristic of our enterprise. NBA 2K and Grand Theft Auto Online were the largest contributors to recurrent consumer spending, and many of our free-to-play offerings were notable drivers as well.\n Nordeus delivered a strong quarter as its newly released Top Eleven 2022 achieved record-high seasonal net bookings, driven by new features, gameplay improvements and enhanced live operations. Two Dots (sic) [ Dots Two ] posted record net bookings results, attributable to additional in-game events, curated seasonal content and successful marketing activations. Dragon City and Monster Legends performance was driven by enhanced live operations, new event types and strong seasonal content. \n 2K launched Season 8 for WWE SuperCard, which has now been downloaded more than 25 million times and remains 2K's highest-grossing mobile game. NBA 2K Online in China outperformed our expectations. The title remains the #1 online PC sports game in the region with over 55 million registered users.\n Turning to our outlook. As a result of our third quarter outperformance, along with our updated forecast for the balance of the year, we are once again raising our guidance for fiscal year 2022 and we now expect to achieve net bookings of $3.37 billion to $3.42 billion. Lainie will provide more details shortly.\n Looking ahead, we remain highly optimistic about the future of the interactive entertainment industry and our multiyear growth trajectory. We have the strongest and most diverse pipeline in our company's history, comprised of new intellectual properties as well as sequels to many of our beloved franchises. We look forward to delivering many of these titles in the coming months and beyond.\n We're also confident that we can emerge as an even stronger player within our industry and deliver long-term value for our shareholders following the anticipated closing of our transaction with Zynga. With greater scale, extensive synergies and a more diversified portfolio of industry-leading titles, we believe that together, our 2 companies will far exceed our individual goals. We'd like to thank all of our stakeholders for their continued support.\n I'll now turn the call over to Karl. Thanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for delivering another outstanding quarter. And to our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued support.\n We'll now take your questions. Operator? Thanks for the question. Yes, we are totally focused on quality here. And we always want to deliver the best possible experience. Very occasionally, we fall short. And I think The Trilogy was an example of that. And the title was launched with some issues. We've addressed many of them. There are more fixes to come. And going forward, we remain highly focused on quality, and we are exceedingly confident in all of our upcoming releases. And with regard to bringing Take-Two's core intellectual property to mobile with Zynga's help, look, we think that's one of many great opportunities. We've already said that we expect to achieve $100 million in cost synergies annually over the next couple of years. Additionally, we've identified at least $500 million of annual run rate revenue synergies, many of which are unrelated to new game launches, many of which are unrelated to bringing Take-Two IP to mobile.\n However, that is an opportunity. And while we haven't identified any heroics within there, we do think it's an interesting opportunity on a selective basis in the coming years. The actual investment is not significant compared to our core investment in console and PC IP. Thanks for your question. Look, this is -- it's really hard to make hits in any entertainment industry. It's really hard to make hit video games. And now and then, we fall short; and now and then, our competitors fall short. We don't believe there's any trend in the industry. We just think that, over time, as entertainment industries mature, consumers' expectations always increase, and they should. So it's always our goal to do better with each iteration of a franchise or with each launch of a new intellectual property.\n And one of the things we're really proud of in our track record is with regard to our franchises, and we have 11 franchises, for example, that have sold over 5 million units with an individual release, each iteration has always sold more than the prior iteration, which is not always true for the industry and lately has really not been true for the industry, but it is true for us. But it will only remain true for us if we continue to focus on quality mightily. And that's job #1 around here.\n In terms of bringing Take-Two's core intellectual properties to mobile, that remains a very interesting opportunity. As I said earlier, we've identified around $500 million of annual run rate revenue synergies to be achieved in the coming years in the combination with Zynga in addition to $100 million of annual run rate cost synergies. And only a small portion of those synergies on the revenue side are attributable to new releases based on core Take-Two IP.\n So we have not identified any heroics. We know it will take some time. The financial investment in the context of our investing in the console and PC titles is not significant because obviously, the creation of a mobile title is not as heavy a lift. Equally, the hit ratios are not as strong in the mobile space. So I think we have a sober view of where we can go in the future. And we're really excited that we think Zynga's extraordinary developers and their extraordinary publishing abilities will enhance our ability to bring core intellectual property to the mobile market. Yes. It's an enhanced version for Gen 9 consoles, and there will be a lot of upgrades and plenty of reason to purchase it. And Rockstar, obviously, will be talking about that in the marketing materials. Yes. So look, return-to-office is sort of location by location question depending on the state of affairs in each location and what the local authorities are saying. And obviously, we comply with all local regulations. The expectation is that we're either back now or we will be back in the coming months. In any case, the company has proven that we can be very effective without regard to where people are working from. We've had great success in the context of remote work. And while I think all of us are anxious to get back to the office as soon as we possibly can, we're also mindful of the science and the circumstances.\n We haven't had a quality lapse. We haven't had a timing lapse. We haven't had a financial lapse, and we don't expect to. Well, in terms of reopening, as I just said, certain of our offices are fully open. Others will be opening in the coming months, depending on what happens in the marketplaces. We will listen to local authorities. We will pay attention to the science, and we're mostly sensitive to the health and well-being of our colleagues around the world. However, my belief is that we will largely be back in office within the next couple of months.\n But I think the broader point is that working remotely has not been an issue for the company in terms of quality or performance. So we'd all love to be back in the office. Our team today, who is on this call, we're all together in the office today, and we like it that way.\n In terms of data privacy, we have not had any issues coming out from the change in IDFA. And we have an extraordinary customer database. And in the combination with Zynga, we expect to have more than 1 billion customer records, which gives us some massive opportunity from a marketing point of view despite the change in IDFA. So we feel just fine about being able to market and, at the same time, to maintain customers' privacy, which is an important value of ours.\n With regard to hiring, we brought on 300 new developers in the quarter. We continue to grow and grow rapidly, and that's been a good news story because we think people really like working at this company. And with regard to retention, it's an even better story. I think we have one of the lowest attrition rates in the industry, if not the lowest. I know our attrition rate is about half that of the industry average. We earn the right to say that every single day. We're really proud of our culture. It's of paramount importance to us. Yes. I think -- I don't think we're seeing enhanced demand because of the pandemic. I think we're seeing normalized demand at this point. On the first point, look, there's always a marketing story du jour in this business, and we're usually very sober about them. And a couple of years ago, the marketing story du jour was how cloud gaming would completely transform the industry and multiply demand by 20x. And what we said on these calls was we'd love to subscribe to that view, but we didn't subscribe to that view, that we thought streaming and cloud distribution was super interesting but probably wouldn't change the market size materially. And that's exactly what we've seen. It's super interesting, and it's not changing the market size materially.\n So there's broad distribution for our products now for those who want them. And I don't think that anything will occur on the platform side that will significantly change the marketplace going forward. The marketplace will change by virtue of putting out hits or not putting out hits. And I think you alluded to that. So as between platform-driven growth or product-driven growth, I'm going with product-driven growth, which means those who are great will do great and those who are good will have problems.\n Hard for me to opine about exclusive titles. I think in the event that a platform company acquires a label and that label's intellectual property, one could imagine those titles becoming exclusive in certain circumstances. I think outside of that, it's less likely, although there may be short-term exclusivity deals still as there always have been. And I do think cross-platform play is the wave of the future, and you're going to see more and more because consumers will demand it. So we haven't discussed pricing for Trilogy for mobile yet. And on the competitive landscape, hard to know really. I think there are probably puts and calls. I think assuming the Microsoft acquisition of Activision closes, that means there'll be really 2 very powerful leading pure-play interactive entertainment companies, and we'll be one of them. And I think that probably means there are some advantages in terms of attracting talent and being able to invest in really great experiences and to market them powerfully.\n At the same time, a platform enterprise having an even more robust product slate, there will be benefits. And again, perhaps there'll be some detriments. I think we're very focused on that which we can control, and we tend not to spend a lot of time worrying about things that are out of our control. What's within our control is making hits. And as long as we maintain our approach, which is try to be the most creative, the most innovative and the most efficient company in the business, as long as we focus mightily on quality, we'd do well. And if we have a lapse, if we miss a step, if we divert our attention from that strategy, we don't do as well. So we have our work cut out for us, and we're focused on that work. Well, the good news is that Private Division's business model doesn't require us to own the studios we're in business with. In fact, to the contrary. Private Division was set up to offer fantastic publishing marketing services and financing to creators who want to stay independent of the larger enterprises. And Michael Worosz and the team have done a great job building a business that does just that.\n At the same time, we are able to own certain intellectual properties like Kerbal Space Program. And we've just announced that we've acquired Roll7, which makes OlliOlli World, which is being launched tomorrow incidentally and has great Metacritic scores on Switch, and we couldn't be more excited about it.\n So I think right now, Private Division is able really to offer opportunities for those who want to stay independent and opportunities for those who want to be part of the Private Division system. We obviously have plenty of capital to deploy when the opportunity presents itself to own intellectual property. And the sky is the limit. It's still early days for Private Division. We're really excited about what will come in the future. There was a time when a couple of our competitors were taking a position that single player was dead. We never took that position. We know that there's a role for single player. I believe there will be a role going forward. Then there are certain games that are meant to be only multiplayer experiences.\n Rockstar is known for its storytelling. And yes, Rockstar's also known for these fantastic open-world experiences. They clearly do both really well. And the contract shows, as you just said, that consumers are really excited about Rockstar's storytelling ability. And at the same time, we had a great quarter with Grand Theft Auto Online. So there's a lot of excitement there. So the answer is sort of all of the above. We've had precious few quality lapses at this company. So any time that we've fallen short from a quality point of view, it has been an isolated case, and we aim to keep it that way. However, we're not changing our business model. Thanks so much for joining today. We are really grateful to all of our colleagues for delivering another stellar quarter and for the great outlook going forward. Thank you to our shareholders for your continued support, and have a great evening."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\n It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Nicole Shevins. Thank you. Nicole, you may begin. \nNicole Shevins: Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss our results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2022 ended September 30, 2021.\n Today's call will be led by Strauss Zelnick, Take-Two's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Karl Slatoff, our President; and Lainie Goldstein, our Chief Financial Officer. We will be available to answer your questions during the Q&A session following our prepared remarks.\n Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that statements made during this call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws.

Our press release and filings with the SEC may be obtained from our website at take2games.com.\n And now I'll turn the call over to Strauss. \nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks, Nicole. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today.\n I'm pleased to report that we delivered another outstanding quarter, highlighted by net bookings of $985 million, which greatly exceeded our expectations and increased 3% over last year. We experienced consistently strong engagement trends across our key franchises, underscoring the durability of our offerings and the deep relationships that we've established with new, existing and returning players. We believe that we can maintain these favorable engagement patterns as we continue to deliver the highest quality entertainment experiences that are driven by our team's passion and commitment to creativity and innovation.\n We've been taking key actions to execute on our long-term strategic vision. We continue to enhance and diversify our pipeline across an array of platforms, business models and genres. To support this, we're investing in our infrastructure and making key hires, ranging from senior talent at our labels, to the addition of more than 350 new developers during the second quarter. We're pleased with the progress of T2 Mobile Games, which is helping us leverage our team's expertise across our enterprise. Additionally, Nordeus has already reached key integration milestones. We continue to build upon our ESG efforts, and we hope to share more in the coming months.\n Given our strong confidence in our company, we opportunistically repurchased 1.26 million shares of our stock during the second quarter for approximately $200 million with an average share price of $158.67. This marks the first time in over 2 years that we repurchased our stock, underscoring the deep value that we observed in our share price. In November, our Board of Directors authorized an additional 7.4 million shares that the company is permitted to repurchase, resulting in 10 million shares remaining available for repurchase as of the date of the additional authorization.\n Turning to our second quarter results. Our better-than-expected performance was driven primarily by Borderlands 3, NBA 2K and Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online.\n On September 10, 2K and Visual Concepts successfully launched NBA 2K22, with more players hitting the digital hard court in its first month than any prior release of the game. The title enjoyed outstanding initial success with over 5 million units sold-in to date. Players are deeply engaged and we're experiencing growth in daily active users and daily games played per user compared to NBA 2K21 in the same period.\n For the quarter, the NBA 2K series delivered exceptional results that were significantly above our expectations. NBA 2K22 experienced growth in recurrent consumer spending as well as a 4% increase in total in-game purchasers and a 58% increase in new user spending. I'd like to congratulate the teams at 2K and Visual Concepts for once again delivering such a stellar basketball experience. We see a meaningful opportunity to grow the franchise further over the next few years as we provide engaging and frequent content updates throughout the game.\n Sales of Grand Theft Auto V continue to exceed our expectations. And to date, the title has sold-in more than 155 million units worldwide.\n During the period, Rockstar Games launched another major update for Grand Theft Auto Online's evolving world. The Los Santos Tuners update brought a renewed focus to the underground street racing scene and introduced a host of innovative and highly requested features, including the LS Car Meet, a shared social space where players can get together to modify, test and race their cars, get tattoos and more. Los Santos Tuners also added 17 highly customizable vehicles, a purchasable auto workshop, new robbery contracts and street races and the ability to add music in a new way through collectible media sticks.\n Recurrent consumer spending increased 33% and active player audience increased 11%, representing the strongest second quarter on record for both metrics. The success of Los Santos Tuners demonstrates Rockstar's ability both to anticipate the needs of its players and to respond to player feedback with an ongoing stream of high quality and engaging content.\n During the quarter, Red Dead Redemption 2 also significantly outperformed our expectations and to date has sold-in more than 39 million units worldwide.\n Momentum continued in Red Dead Online with the introduction of the Blood Money update in July, which introduced a series of new criminal-themed opportunities; complex new missions, including the game's first train robbery; and The Quick Draw Club, a series of 4 distinct, rapid-fire passes featuring criminal-themed unlockable rewards, bonuses and more. As a result of the Blood Money update as well as the influx of new players attributable to the stand-alone version of Red Dead Online, we experienced a 26% increase in active players and a 29% increase in new online player acquisition. Recurrent consumer spending for the series was also notably above expectations.\n In August, Private Division expanded their portfolio with the physical release of Hades for PlayStation and Xbox platforms. The title continues to earn positive praise from the gaming community and is currently Metacritic's highest rated game for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. In September, the label released Murder on Eridanos, the final expansion for The Outer Worlds for the Nintendo Switch. We're pleased that The Outer Worlds continues to grow its audience. And to date, the title has sold-in over 4 million units. Also in September, Private Division launched Kerbal Space Program Enhanced Edition for Gen 9 consoles, taking advantage of the latest performance and the visual enhancements to provide players an exciting new way to experience this beloved space flight simulation game.\n During the quarter, recurrent consumer spending rose 7%, which was significantly ahead of our expectations of an 11% decline and accounted for 69% of net bookings. As I mentioned earlier, our consumer engagement trends were consistently strong even as people resume more normal socialization patterns and as schools and workplaces began to reopen. We're very optimistic about our continued ability to keep players engaged and to capitalize further on our massive audience size.\n For the period, NBA 2K and Grand Theft Auto Online were the largest contributors to recurrent consumer spending. Many of our free-to-play offerings were also notable drivers. Top Eleven exceeded our expectations driven by strong seasonal live ops and features, optimized marketing activities and enhanced user quality. Dragon City and Monster Legends performed well, thanks to strong live ops, new updates and feature releases and increased marketing investments. Two Dots achieved its highest ever net bookings since our acquisition, which we attribute to new in-game events such as scavenger hunts and curated seasonal content. WWE SuperCard has now been downloaded more than 24 million times and remains 2K's highest grossing mobile game.\n NBA 2K Online in China outperformed our expectations and remains the #1 online PC sports game in the region with nearly 55 million registered users. We continue to monitor the regulatory environment. It bears noting that China represents 3% of our net bookings in fiscal '21. While we remain optimistic about China and we'll pursue further opportunity there, we believe that our exposure to the region will remain limited in the context of our growing overall net bookings.\n Turning to our guidance. As a result of our second quarter outperformance, along with our updated forecast for the balance of the year, we're raising our outlook for fiscal year 2022, and we now expect to achieve net bookings of $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion. Lainie will provide more details shortly.\n With the strongest multiyear pipeline in our company's history, we continue to believe that we'll achieve sequential growth in net bookings in fiscal '23 and establish new records of operating results over the next few years.\n Our focus on bringing new intellectual properties to market will help us diversify our portfolio further and build lasting franchises that we believe will enhance our financial profile for years to come. At the same time, our teams are hard at work developing sequels to many of our beloved franchises that we know our consumers will be eager to play.\n As we execute on our strategic vision and maintain our commitment to an outstanding and collaborative culture, we believe that we will significantly grow our operations and drive long-term shareholder value.\n I'll now turn the call over to Karl. \nKarl Slatoff: Thanks, Strauss.\n I'd like to thank our teams for all their contributions as well as their continued passion and dedication to our business. Our unique and collaborative culture continues to be a key driver of our success.\n I'll now discuss our recent releases. On October 1, 2K and Hangar 13 launched the Mafia III: Definitive Edition for Stadia. Previously released on other platforms, the Definitive Edition offers many additional features and post-launch content that has since been incorporated into the game. We're pleased to continue our support for Stadia and expand the Mafia franchise to new audiences.\n On October 11, Nordeus released Top Eleven 2022 on iOS and Android, the latest installment of the world's most successful soccer management game. Top Eleven 2022 delivers a significant update to the gameplay and soccer management experience, pitting aspiring soccer managers against one another in league, cup and friendly matches. Top Eleven 2022 also provides a significant new layer of depth to player development via the Playstyles feature, which helps to enhance the soccer fantasy that Top Eleven has been providing to fans for more than a decade.\n On October 14, 2K and HB Studios launched the PGA TOUR 2K21 Baller Edition, which includes the base game, all previously released DLC courses and game modes, an assortment of adidas apparel and gear and the Golden Touch Pack that features a gold putter and driver. In addition, PGA TOUR 2K21 offers new multiplayer courses each month designed by a group of international content creators. We're thrilled that the community continues to grow with the title selling-in over 2.5 million units to date.\n On October 19, 2K launched NBA 2K22 Arcade Edition for Apple Arcade, building on the success of its predecessor, which continues to be listed as one of the platform's top games with an average of 4.6 out of 5 stars across more than 85,000 ratings. NBA 2K22 Arcade Edition expands the franchise's addressable market with new modes and features, including The Association, MyCOURT and more.\n Rockstar Games continue to provide an array of free content for their vast and growing online communities. To celebrate Halloween, Grand Theft Auto Online added a series of random events to shock and surprise players, including driverless phantom killer cars, superhuman slashers, UFOs and more, including bonuses on Alien Survival modes and a new Arcade game. Players will also be able to experience an all-new adventure in the Grand Theft Auto Online later this year as they help some well-known contacts and familiar faces with many more surprises yet to be revealed.\n I'll now discuss details on our upcoming announced offerings for this year. Rockstar Games will digitally launch Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy \u2014 The Definitive Edition this November 11 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X and S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and the Rockstar Games Launcher for PC. The Definitive Edition will feature across-the-board upgrades for all 3 games, including graphical improvements and modern controls, while still maintaining the classic and distinct aesthetic of the original games. Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy \u2014 The Definitive Edition will launch physically for consoles on December 7 and will release for iOS and Android devices in the first half of calendar 2022. As part of the celebration of the recent 20th anniversary, Grand Theft Auto III fans can also collect an array of special commemorative gear in Grand Theft Auto Online throughout a series of upcoming events this fall.\n On November 12, 2K and Gearbox Software will release limited quantities of Borderlands 3 Ultimate Edition physically for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. Avid Vault Hunters and newcomers alike are sure to enjoy this quintessential Borderlands 3 experience, featuring the award-winning base game, plus all 6 content add-ons and the full collection of bonus cosmetic packs. The Ultimate Edition is optimized to take full advantage of the Gen 9 hardware's processing power, enabling gameplay at up to 60 frames per second in 4K resolution during single player and online co-op.\n OlliOlli World, the skateboarding action-platformer developed by Roll7, launches this winter in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 on PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X and S, PC and Nintendo Switch.\n On March 25, 2K and Gearbox Software will launch an exciting new entry from the Borderlands universe, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands. In September, the team unveiled the game's brand-new mechanics and all-star celebrity cast, including Will Arnett, Ashly Burch, Andy Samberg and Wanda Sykes. Fans' reactions to the first look at the gameplay was extremely positive, reflecting the growing excitement for this fantasy-fueled take on the popular looter-shooter genre.\n In addition, 2K and Visual Concepts remain hard at work on WWE 2K22, which will be released in March. Our partners at WWE have done amazing things with their brand, resulting in a passionate and deeply engaged community. And they're providing tremendous support to maximize our campaign through all their platforms, including social media, digital, programming, talent, in-arena and more. Visual Concepts is gearing up for a major reveal of the game's key features in January, which we look forward to sharing with fans, followed by the biggest WWE 2K launch to date.\n Rockstar Games is thrilled to launch the expanded and enhanced versions of Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online \u2013 Standalone for Gen 9 consoles in March. Players will enjoy a range of technical and graphical improvements across the entire experience, including performance enhancements for select vehicles in Grand Theft Auto Online and much more. Rockstar Games will have more details to share about these eagerly anticipated launches in the coming months.\n As we noted in our earnings release, Marvel's Midnight Suns from Firaxis Games is now expected to be released in the second half of calendar 2022 during our fiscal year 2023. While we don't take delays lightly, we know that our proven success has been rooted firmly in our player-first approach and unwavering commitment to delivering the highest quality entertainment experiences. We believe it is far better to provide the extra time needed for a product, especially a new IP, to reach its full potential and drive long-term success as a permanent franchise in our industry-leading portfolio. As gaming platforms continue to evolve, technological advancements allow us to design experiences that are more immersive and engaging than ever before. While this has enabled us to significantly grow our franchises over time, game development has become more complex, especially with many of our colleagues still working remotely.\n We continue to evaluate and optimize our game creation processes to enhance the ways that our teams collaborate, share best practices and leverage technology and expertise.\n Turning to eSports. The NBA 2K League concluded its fourth season, attracting more than 18 million unique viewers and over 2 million hours of games watched on Twitch. During the playoffs and finals, nearly 4 million unique viewers tuned in as Wizards District Gaming won their second consecutive championship. In addition, the League hosted their inaugural All-Star Game held at Brooklyn Steel in New York. As part of the League's continued global expansion, Mexico's DUX Gaming will launch a team this spring, marking the 24th team and the first to participate from Latin America. We are thrilled to see the League continue to grow both its audience and global presence.\n In closing, we have a strong foundation for success that has helped us curate a portfolio of highly engaging franchises that transcend console and player generations. As we continue to harness and enhance our competitive advantages, our incredible creative talent, best-in-class marketing and technology and strong balance sheet, we will introduce new entertainment experiences that we believe have vast commercial potential and the ability to drive long-term engagement and recurrent consumer spending. We also expect to continue to attract the very best creators who share in our vision to set new benchmarks and captivate audiences throughout the world.\n I'll now turn the call over to Lainie. \nLainie Goldstein: Thanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone.\n Today, I'll discuss our second quarter results and then review our financial outlook for fiscal year 2022 and the third quarter. Please note that additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release.\n As Strauss mentioned, our business fundamentals remain exceptionally strong across our key franchises. Net bookings were $985 million, which was significantly above our guidance of $815 million to $865 million and up 3% as compared to last year. Our outperformance was primarily driven by Borderlands 3, NBA 2K and Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online. During the period, overall engagement was outstanding, with recurrent consumer spending increasing 7% compared to our outlook of an 11% decline and accounting for 69% of total net bookings. Our outperformance was primarily driven by NBA 2K. Digitally delivered net bookings increased 9% compared to our outlook of a 5% decline and accounted for 89% of the total. This result was better than our outlook, primarily due to the outperformance of recurrent consumer spending. During the quarter, 65% of console game sales were delivered digitally, up from 57% last year.\n GAAP net revenue increased 2% to $858 million, while cost of goods sold increased 6% to $457 million. Cost of goods sold included a $53 million impairment charge related to our decision not to proceed with further development of an unannounced title in our pipeline.\n Operating expenses increased by 30% to $381 million. The variance is driven by higher personnel, marketing and IT expenses; the addition of Playdots and Nordeus and the revaluation of the Nordeus earnout.\n And GAAP net income was $10 million or $0.09 per share as compared to $99 million or $0.86 per share in the second quarter last year.\n We ended the quarter with approximately $2.3 billion of cash and short-term investments. We repurchased 1.26 million shares of our stock during the quarter for approximately $200 million with an average share price of $158.67.\n Turning to our guidance. I'll begin with our full fiscal year expectations. We are raising our net bookings outlook range to $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion. This is up from our prior outlook of $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion due to our second quarter outperformance, along with our updated forecast for the balance of the year, which includes the move of Marvel's Midnight Suns into fiscal 2023.\n The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online and Borderlands 3. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 50% 2K, 40% Rockstar Games and 10% Private Division and T2 Mobile Games. We forecast our geographic net booking split to be about 60% United States and 40% international.\n We now expect recurrent consumer spending to decline by 6% compared to our prior outlook of a 9% decline versus fiscal 2021. As a percentage of net bookings, recurrent consumer spending is expected to represent 66% of total net bookings, slightly above 65% last year.\n We now project digitally delivered net bookings to decrease by approximately 4% compared to our prior outlook of a 6% decline. As a percentage of our business, digital is projected to represent 90%, slightly above 89% last year. Our forecast assumes that 73% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 64% last year.\n We expect to generate more than $400 million in non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow, and we plan to deploy approximately $170 million for capital expenditures.\n We're raising our GAAP net revenue outlook to $3.35 billion to $3.45 billion, while we now expect cost of goods sold to range from $1.51 billion to $1.55 billion.\n Total operating expenses are expected to range from $1.47 billion to $1.49 billion, representing at the midpoint a 22% increase over the prior year. This increase reflects costs relating to marketing, personnel, stock compensation, IT and research and development to bring our expansive multiyear pipeline to market as well as incremental expenses due to the addition of Nordeus and a full year of Playdots. Our operating expense expectations have improved compared to our prior guidance driven by lower marketing expenses due to the movement in our release schedule.\n And we expect GAAP net income to range from $320 million to $350 million or $2.75 to $3 per share. For management reporting purposes, we expect our tax rate to be 16% throughout fiscal 2022.\n And now moving to our guidance for the fiscal third quarter. We project net bookings to range from $800 million to $850 million compared to $814 million in the third quarter last year. The largest contributors in our bookings are reflected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online and Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy \u2014 The Definitive Edition. We project recurrent consumer spending to be up slightly compared to last year and digitally delivered net bookings to increase by approximately 5%. Our forecast assumes that 61% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 56% last year.\n We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $840 million to $890 million and cost of goods sold to range from $344 million to $370 million. Operating expenses are expected to range from $378 million to $388 million. At the midpoint, this represents a 13% increase over last year, driven primarily by higher personnel, research and development and IT expenses as well as the inclusion of Nordeus. And GAAP net income is expected to range from $99 million to $111 million or $0.85 to $0.95 per share.\n In closing, our second quarter results demonstrate the health of our business and our continued ability to engage our players with exciting and innovative new content. As we continue to capitalize on organic and inorganic growth opportunities, we believe that we will greatly expand our scale and deliver long-term growth for our shareholders.\n Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Strauss. \nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for delivering another strong quarter. And to our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued support.\n We'll now take your questions. Operator? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Mario Lu with Barclays. \nX. Lu: I have one on NBA 2K and then another high-level question. So the first one on NBA 2K, I believe you guys mentioned a 58% increase in new user spending. So just curious if you could provide any additional color or specific features that was introduced in this game this year that attributed to this large increase. \nKarl Slatoff: It's Karl, Mario. I wouldn't necessarily want to attribute any specific features to the increase. I don't want to tag it, but there have been certainly a lot of additions to the game that we believe have increased engagement. Specifically, just generally speaking, the game is fantastic. I mean, the reviews have been great. User feedback has been great. Engagement has been really, really strong.\n One thing to note is that we did add the seasons feature to MyPLAYER this year, which obviously creates a lot more content drops and a lot more for folks to do. Every time you increase content and deliver content, that obviously leads to increased engagement and tends to lead to increased monetization. So it's really a combination of the game just being better. We had a lot of wind in our backs, too, from an increased player base, generally speaking. And it's just been, it's the great execution and people are really enjoying the incremental content. \nX. Lu: Got it. And then Facebook or Meta recently announced a partnership with Rockstar for GTA: San Andreas on the Quest. Just curious what the background of this partnership was. And do you now think either VR or building a metaverse could be growth drivers for Take-Two as a company going forward? \nStrauss Zelnick: We're really excited about all of our partnerships. So we have numerous partnerships. We've always said that we want to be where the consumer is. And when VR first emerged as a potential technology, while I expressed some skepticism about it becoming a very broad-based consumer application, I also thought it was really exciting technically and said that we would participate. Rockstar has already brought L.A. Noire to VR. NBA 2K has come to VR. I'm sure we'll have more VR titles in the future as well.\n So we're always excited when our creative teams can flex their collective muscles and do different things and remains to be seen just how big that can be. We never make projections like that, but we're very excited about the opportunity. \nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. \nMichael Ng: I just have 2. First, with the upcoming launch of GTA: Trilogy on mobile, can you talk a little bit about your ambitions to create immersive core games on mobile and whether this foreshadows more mobile content in the future that may have historically been reserved for PC and console? And then second, just a housekeeping question on the improvement in guidance. What's driving the back half improvement? Despite the push out of Marvel Midnight Suns, are there any improved expectations by franchise you'd call out? \nKarl Slatoff: Mike, it's Karl. Just to answer your first question about mobile. We are obviously very excited about The Trilogy coming to mobile devices. It's actually not the first time we've had our franchises doing this. We've done this since the very beginning of our mobile days, both on the Rockstar and the 2K side. And we have a long history of bringing our franchises to the mobile space. We've done that in various different ways. Obviously, we've brought older games onto mobile platforms. We've done companion apps, and we've brought modified games or different iterations of franchises like WWE SuperCard or NBA SuperCard.\n So we are no stranger to bringing our core franchises to the mobile space. We definitely think that there's an opportunity for us to do more. Nothing to announce on the call. But look, obviously, we've invested significantly in this space, both through acquisition and also organically, and we don't expect that to stop anytime soon. \nLainie Goldstein: In terms of the back half of the year and the forecast, we are seeing a lot of improvement in the forecast. We have a lot of ups and downs, mostly up, and we're netting up. The titles are looking great. Engagement is great. So we don't have any specific things to call out. But overall, the titles are doing great. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Cost with Morgan Stanley. \nMatthew Cost: I have 2. So can you just talk about your expectations over the next, call it, year or 2? Obviously, you've brought on a lot of heads. You have a lot of content in development. There's a decent amount of it hitting between now and the end of the fiscal year and then obviously more to come in the years following. What do you guys expect at a high level in terms of like the margin impact? I would imagine there would be something along the lines of an increase in marketing as you bring games to market but then sort of benefits from scale as those heads actually produce content that is out and engaging people and monetizing actively.\n Then just the second question is on China. Obviously, you quantified that at about 3% of your business and mentioned how you expect the exposure to remain limited. Should we interpret that to mean that you don't intend to launch games in China in the future or under certain circumstances and sort of what's driving your strategy there going forward? \nLainie Goldstein: So in terms of the margins in the next couple of years, as you know, this year is a big year of investment for us in terms of our headcount and our space and IT expenses and our marketing expenses. So we have been talking about that a lot, and we've seen that this year. And next year, we'll see some annualization of a lot of those costs as we go into next year. But as we continue to build scale with our pipeline of titles over the next few years, we expect those margins to continue to grow for us. So that's our plan for the near and the future over the next couple of years. \nStrauss Zelnick: And in terms of China, I was making the point about the percent of our net bookings that come from China. And it's quite small, roughly 3% at the moment. We expect our net bookings to grow. We expect sequential growth. We're really excited about our future. And at the same time, we're very focused on the region and particularly on the country in the context of what we're able to do and being compliant with regulations. So we remain highly optimistic about China. We absolutely would be very happy to launch additional and new titles there. We expect to do so. In fact, we remain optimistic. I'm simply making the point that it is a small part of our business. \nOperator: Our next question is from Martin Yang with Oppenheimer. \nMartin Yang: I have one. Just curious about your philosophy on remastered games. How do you pick and choose from your pretty substantial library what games to bring back on? And as a follow-up, how does remastering games compete with resources for development of new games? \nKarl Slatoff: Sure. This is Karl, Martin. I'll answer the question. I'll answer the second one. They're actually related because the truth is remastering games, unless you really go truly out to third parties, which we've done in the past, but even in that case, you are actually competing with other resources. And therefore, that goes into your decision-making on which ones you bring to market, and it purely is an economic decision. An economic decision based on what we believe the fan base to be. How much is it going to cost for the game to be remastered? Are we going to make other changes to the game to enhance the experience? Because typically just pure remasters without -- just ports don't really perform as well as something that's truly remastered or truly enhanced. So all of those factors go into those decisions. But in the end, it is an economic decision. And it is a resource allocation decision, and that's just math that we do. \nOperator: Our next question is from Drew Crum with Stifel. \nAndrew Crum: Maybe a follow-up to an earlier question. Some of your peers have suggested challenges around recruiting talent, but it sounds like you've had a different experience. If I heard correctly, you added 350 developers during the quarter. What do you attribute that to? Are labor markets improving? Is reopening helping? And if the macro picture is getting better, is your plan to accelerate new hires? And then I have a follow-up. \nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks for your question. Look, we're so grateful that we continue to attract the industry's top talent. In fact, we've hired over 1,500 developers over the last 2 years, and we've more than doubled our internal developer count in the last 5 years. And I don't want to overstate the case and so much always has to be done on a daily basis regarding culture. But I do think that, that's a reflection of who we are. And I think ultimately, everyone knows who you are, people inside and people outside.\n And we're really proud of the culture that we've built. A culture that starts with creativity, innovation and efficiency, but very importantly, includes accepting everyone as they are, as they show up, as long as they are equally focused on a very high ambition for excellence and hard work, a willingness to be honest and open and transparent and collaborative, and the agreement that we have with one another that we'll treat everyone with decency and kindness. And I think at this point, we're known for that. And we're imperfect and there's much more that we can do at any given time. We are highly focused on this culture and it has served us very well. \nAndrew Crum: And my follow-up concerns the headlines related to FIFA. Just curious around your interest in furthering your exposure to soccer beyond Top Eleven. \nStrauss Zelnick: We are so thrilled to have Nordeus in the Take-Two family. And they're just crushing it, which is great. Top Eleven is a great title, a beloved title. And I just couldn't be happier to be in the soccer manager business through Top Eleven with the Nordeus team. That's a big step forward for us. We haven't been in that sport before. And I think I'll leave it at that today. \nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Strauss Zelnick for any closing comments. \nStrauss Zelnick: Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us. That was an incredibly short call for us. So you all must have better things to do for the rest of the day. We wish you very well. We're obviously really pleased with the results. And what that leads me to say is, how grateful everyone here is to our teams who deliver these results, who work hard every day to make the phenomenal entertainment that drives the success of the company on an ongoing basis. It's incredibly hard. We don't take it for granted. We never take success for granted. And so thank you to all of our colleagues who are listening today and the ones who aren't listening because they're hard at work. Thank you also to our shareholders for your ongoing support. \nOperator: This concludes today's call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Thanks, Strauss.\n I'd like to thank our teams for all their contributions as well as their continued passion and dedication to our business. Our unique and collaborative culture continues to be a key driver of our success.\n I'll now discuss our recent releases. On October 1, 2K and Hangar 13 launched the Mafia III: Definitive Edition for Stadia. Previously released on other platforms, the Definitive Edition offers many additional features and post-launch content that has since been incorporated into the game. We're pleased to continue our support for Stadia and expand the Mafia franchise to new audiences.\n On October 11, Nordeus released Top Eleven 2022 on iOS and Android, the latest installment of the world's most successful soccer management game. Top Eleven 2022 delivers a significant update to the gameplay and soccer management experience, pitting aspiring soccer managers against one another in league, cup and friendly matches. Top Eleven 2022 also provides a significant new layer of depth to player development via the Playstyles feature, which helps to enhance the soccer fantasy that Top Eleven has been providing to fans for more than a decade.\n On October 14, 2K and HB Studios launched the PGA TOUR 2K21 Baller Edition, which includes the base game, all previously released DLC courses and game modes, an assortment of adidas apparel and gear and the Golden Touch Pack that features a gold putter and driver. In addition, PGA TOUR 2K21 offers new multiplayer courses each month designed by a group of international content creators. We're thrilled that the community continues to grow with the title selling-in over 2.5 million units to date.\n On October 19, 2K launched NBA 2K22 Arcade Edition for Apple Arcade, building on the success of its predecessor, which continues to be listed as one of the platform's top games with an average of 4.6 out of 5 stars across more than 85,000 ratings. NBA 2K22 Arcade Edition expands the franchise's addressable market with new modes and features, including The Association, MyCOURT and more.\n Rockstar Games continue to provide an array of free content for their vast and growing online communities. To celebrate Halloween, Grand Theft Auto Online added a series of random events to shock and surprise players, including driverless phantom killer cars, superhuman slashers, UFOs and more, including bonuses on Alien Survival modes and a new Arcade game. Players will also be able to experience an all-new adventure in the Grand Theft Auto Online later this year as they help some well-known contacts and familiar faces with many more surprises yet to be revealed.\n I'll now discuss details on our upcoming announced offerings for this year. Rockstar Games will digitally launch Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy \u2014 The Definitive Edition this November 11 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X and S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and the Rockstar Games Launcher for PC. The Definitive Edition will feature across-the-board upgrades for all 3 games, including graphical improvements and modern controls, while still maintaining the classic and distinct aesthetic of the original games. Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy \u2014 The Definitive Edition will launch physically for consoles on December 7 and will release for iOS and Android devices in the first half of calendar 2022. As part of the celebration of the recent 20th anniversary, Grand Theft Auto III fans can also collect an array of special commemorative gear in Grand Theft Auto Online throughout a series of upcoming events this fall.\n On November 12, 2K and Gearbox Software will release limited quantities of Borderlands 3 Ultimate Edition physically for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. Avid Vault Hunters and newcomers alike are sure to enjoy this quintessential Borderlands 3 experience, featuring the award-winning base game, plus all 6 content add-ons and the full collection of bonus cosmetic packs. The Ultimate Edition is optimized to take full advantage of the Gen 9 hardware's processing power, enabling gameplay at up to 60 frames per second in 4K resolution during single player and online co-op.\n OlliOlli World, the skateboarding action-platformer developed by Roll7, launches this winter in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 on PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X and S, PC and Nintendo Switch.\n On March 25, 2K and Gearbox Software will launch an exciting new entry from the Borderlands universe, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands. In September, the team unveiled the game's brand-new mechanics and all-star celebrity cast, including Will Arnett, Ashly Burch, Andy Samberg and Wanda Sykes. Fans' reactions to the first look at the gameplay was extremely positive, reflecting the growing excitement for this fantasy-fueled take on the popular looter-shooter genre.\n In addition, 2K and Visual Concepts remain hard at work on WWE 2K22, which will be released in March. Our partners at WWE have done amazing things with their brand, resulting in a passionate and deeply engaged community. And they're providing tremendous support to maximize our campaign through all their platforms, including social media, digital, programming, talent, in-arena and more. Visual Concepts is gearing up for a major reveal of the game's key features in January, which we look forward to sharing with fans, followed by the biggest WWE 2K launch to date.\n Rockstar Games is thrilled to launch the expanded and enhanced versions of Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online \u2013 Standalone for Gen 9 consoles in March. Players will enjoy a range of technical and graphical improvements across the entire experience, including performance enhancements for select vehicles in Grand Theft Auto Online and much more. Rockstar Games will have more details to share about these eagerly anticipated launches in the coming months.\n As we noted in our earnings release, Marvel's Midnight Suns from Firaxis Games is now expected to be released in the second half of calendar 2022 during our fiscal year 2023. While we don't take delays lightly, we know that our proven success has been rooted firmly in our player-first approach and unwavering commitment to delivering the highest quality entertainment experiences. We believe it is far better to provide the extra time needed for a product, especially a new IP, to reach its full potential and drive long-term success as a permanent franchise in our industry-leading portfolio. As gaming platforms continue to evolve, technological advancements allow us to design experiences that are more immersive and engaging than ever before. While this has enabled us to significantly grow our franchises over time, game development has become more complex, especially with many of our colleagues still working remotely.\n We continue to evaluate and optimize our game creation processes to enhance the ways that our teams collaborate, share best practices and leverage technology and expertise.\n Turning to eSports. The NBA 2K League concluded its fourth season, attracting more than 18 million unique viewers and over 2 million hours of games watched on Twitch. During the playoffs and finals, nearly 4 million unique viewers tuned in as Wizards District Gaming won their second consecutive championship. In addition, the League hosted their inaugural All-Star Game held at Brooklyn Steel in New York. As part of the League's continued global expansion, Mexico's DUX Gaming will launch a team this spring, marking the 24th team and the first to participate from Latin America. We are thrilled to see the League continue to grow both its audience and global presence.\n In closing, we have a strong foundation for success that has helped us curate a portfolio of highly engaging franchises that transcend console and player generations. As we continue to harness and enhance our competitive advantages, our incredible creative talent, best-in-class marketing and technology and strong balance sheet, we will introduce new entertainment experiences that we believe have vast commercial potential and the ability to drive long-term engagement and recurrent consumer spending. We also expect to continue to attract the very best creators who share in our vision to set new benchmarks and captivate audiences throughout the world.\n I'll now turn the call over to Lainie. It's Karl, Mario. I wouldn't necessarily want to attribute any specific features to the increase. I don't want to tag it, but there have been certainly a lot of additions to the game that we believe have increased engagement. Specifically, just generally speaking, the game is fantastic. I mean, the reviews have been great. User feedback has been great. Engagement has been really, really strong.\n One thing to note is that we did add the seasons feature to MyPLAYER this year, which obviously creates a lot more content drops and a lot more for folks to do. Every time you increase content and deliver content, that obviously leads to increased engagement and tends to lead to increased monetization. So it's really a combination of the game just being better. We had a lot of wind in our backs, too, from an increased player base, generally speaking. And it's just been, it's the great execution and people are really enjoying the incremental content. Mike, it's Karl. Just to answer your first question about mobile. We are obviously very excited about The Trilogy coming to mobile devices. It's actually not the first time we've had our franchises doing this. We've done this since the very beginning of our mobile days, both on the Rockstar and the 2K side. And we have a long history of bringing our franchises to the mobile space. We've done that in various different ways. Obviously, we've brought older games onto mobile platforms. We've done companion apps, and we've brought modified games or different iterations of franchises like WWE SuperCard or NBA SuperCard.\n So we are no stranger to bringing our core franchises to the mobile space. We definitely think that there's an opportunity for us to do more. Nothing to announce on the call. But look, obviously, we've invested significantly in this space, both through acquisition and also organically, and we don't expect that to stop anytime soon. Sure. This is Karl, Martin. I'll answer the question. I'll answer the second one. They're actually related because the truth is remastering games, unless you really go truly out to third parties, which we've done in the past, but even in that case, you are actually competing with other resources. And therefore, that goes into your decision-making on which ones you bring to market, and it purely is an economic decision. An economic decision based on what we believe the fan base to be.

Because typically just pure remasters without -- just ports don't really perform as well as something that's truly remastered or truly enhanced. So all of those factors go into those decisions. But in the end, it is an economic decision. And it is a resource allocation decision, and that's just math that we do."

            "name": "Lainie Goldstein",
            "content": "Thanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone.\n Today, I'll discuss our second quarter results and then review our financial outlook for fiscal year 2022 and the third quarter. Please note that additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release.\n As Strauss mentioned, our business fundamentals remain exceptionally strong across our key franchises. Net bookings were $985 million, which was significantly above our guidance of $815 million to $865 million and up 3% as compared to last year. Our outperformance was primarily driven by Borderlands 3, NBA 2K and Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online. During the period, overall engagement was outstanding, with recurrent consumer spending increasing 7% compared to our outlook of an 11% decline and accounting for 69% of total net bookings. Our outperformance was primarily driven by NBA 2K. Digitally delivered net bookings increased 9% compared to our outlook of a 5% decline and accounted for 89% of the total. This result was better than our outlook, primarily due to the outperformance of recurrent consumer spending. During the quarter, 65% of console game sales were delivered digitally, up from 57% last year.\n GAAP net revenue increased 2% to $858 million, while cost of goods sold increased 6% to $457 million. Cost of goods sold included a $53 million impairment charge related to our decision not to proceed with further development of an unannounced title in our pipeline.\n Operating expenses increased by 30% to $381 million. The variance is driven by higher personnel, marketing and IT expenses; the addition of Playdots and Nordeus and the revaluation of the Nordeus earnout.\n And GAAP net income was $10 million or $0.09 per share as compared to $99 million or $0.86 per share in the second quarter last year.\n We ended the quarter with approximately $2.3 billion of cash and short-term investments. We repurchased 1.26 million shares of our stock during the quarter for approximately $200 million with an average share price of $158.67.\n Turning to our guidance. I'll begin with our full fiscal year expectations. We are raising our net bookings outlook range to $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion. This is up from our prior outlook of $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion due to our second quarter outperformance, along with our updated forecast for the balance of the year, which includes the move of Marvel's Midnight Suns into fiscal 2023.\n The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online and Borderlands 3. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 50% 2K, 40% Rockstar Games and 10% Private Division and T2 Mobile Games. We forecast our geographic net booking split to be about 60% United States and 40% international.\n We now expect recurrent consumer spending to decline by 6% compared to our prior outlook of a 9% decline versus fiscal 2021. As a percentage of net bookings, recurrent consumer spending is expected to represent 66% of total net bookings, slightly above 65% last year.\n We now project digitally delivered net bookings to decrease by approximately 4% compared to our prior outlook of a 6% decline. As a percentage of our business, digital is projected to represent 90%, slightly above 89% last year. Our forecast assumes that 73% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 64% last year.\n We expect to generate more than $400 million in non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow, and we plan to deploy approximately $170 million for capital expenditures.\n We're raising our GAAP net revenue outlook to $3.35 billion to $3.45 billion, while we now expect cost of goods sold to range from $1.51 billion to $1.55 billion.\n Total operating expenses are expected to range from $1.47 billion to $1.49 billion, representing at the midpoint a 22% increase over the prior year. This increase reflects costs relating to marketing, personnel, stock compensation, IT and research and development to bring our expansive multiyear pipeline to market as well as incremental expenses due to the addition of Nordeus and a full year of Playdots. Our operating expense expectations have improved compared to our prior guidance driven by lower marketing expenses due to the movement in our release schedule.\n And we expect GAAP net income to range from $320 million to $350 million or $2.75 to $3 per share. For management reporting purposes, we expect our tax rate to be 16% throughout fiscal 2022.\n And now moving to our guidance for the fiscal third quarter. We project net bookings to range from $800 million to $850 million compared to $814 million in the third quarter last year. The largest contributors in our bookings are reflected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online and Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy \u2014 The Definitive Edition. We project recurrent consumer spending to be up slightly compared to last year and digitally delivered net bookings to increase by approximately 5%. Our forecast assumes that 61% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 56% last year.\n We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $840 million to $890 million and cost of goods sold to range from $344 million to $370 million. Operating expenses are expected to range from $378 million to $388 million. At the midpoint, this represents a 13% increase over last year, driven primarily by higher personnel, research and development and IT expenses as well as the inclusion of Nordeus. And GAAP net income is expected to range from $99 million to $111 million or $0.85 to $0.95 per share.\n In closing, our second quarter results demonstrate the health of our business and our continued ability to engage our players with exciting and innovative new content. As we continue to capitalize on organic and inorganic growth opportunities, we believe that we will greatly expand our scale and deliver long-term growth for our shareholders.\n Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Strauss. In terms of the back half of the year and the forecast, we are seeing a lot of improvement in the forecast. We have a lot of ups and downs, mostly up, and we're netting up. The titles are looking great. Engagement is great. So we don't have any specific things to call out. But overall, the titles are doing great. So in terms of the margins in the next couple of years, as you know, this year is a big year of investment for us in terms of our headcount and our space and IT expenses and our marketing expenses. So we have been talking about that a lot, and we've seen that this year. And next year, we'll see some annualization of a lot of those costs as we go into next year. But as we continue to build scale with our pipeline of titles over the next few years, we expect those margins to continue to grow for us. So that's our plan for the near and the future over the next couple of years."

            "name": "Strauss Zelnick",
            "content": "Thanks, Nicole. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today.\n I'm pleased to report that we delivered another outstanding quarter, highlighted by net bookings of $985 million, which greatly exceeded our expectations and increased 3% over last year. We experienced consistently strong engagement trends across our key franchises, underscoring the durability of our offerings and the deep relationships that we've established with new, existing and returning players. We believe that we can maintain these favorable engagement patterns as we continue to deliver the highest quality entertainment experiences that are driven by our team's passion and commitment to creativity and innovation.\n We've been taking key actions to execute on our long-term strategic vision. We continue to enhance and diversify our pipeline across an array of platforms, business models and genres. To support this, we're investing in our infrastructure and making key hires, ranging from senior talent at our labels, to the addition of more than 350 new developers during the second quarter. We're pleased with the progress of T2 Mobile Games, which is helping us leverage our team's expertise across our enterprise. Additionally, Nordeus has already reached key integration milestones. We continue to build upon our ESG efforts, and we hope to share more in the coming months.\n Given our strong confidence in our company, we opportunistically repurchased 1.26 million shares of our stock during the second quarter for approximately $200 million with an average share price of $158.67. This marks the first time in over 2 years that we repurchased our stock, underscoring the deep value that we observed in our share price. In November, our Board of Directors authorized an additional 7.4 million shares that the company is permitted to repurchase, resulting in 10 million shares remaining available for repurchase as of the date of the additional authorization.\n Turning to our second quarter results. Our better-than-expected performance was driven primarily by Borderlands 3, NBA 2K and Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online.\n On September 10, 2K and Visual Concepts successfully launched NBA 2K22, with more players hitting the digital hard court in its first month than any prior release of the game. The title enjoyed outstanding initial success with over 5 million units sold-in to date. Players are deeply engaged and we're experiencing growth in daily active users and daily games played per user compared to NBA 2K21 in the same period.\n For the quarter, the NBA 2K series delivered exceptional results that were significantly above our expectations. NBA 2K22 experienced growth in recurrent consumer spending as well as a 4% increase in total in-game purchasers and a 58% increase in new user spending. I'd like to congratulate the teams at 2K and Visual Concepts for once again delivering such a stellar basketball experience. We see a meaningful opportunity to grow the franchise further over the next few years as we provide engaging and frequent content updates throughout the game.\n Sales of Grand Theft Auto V continue to exceed our expectations. And to date, the title has sold-in more than 155 million units worldwide.\n During the period, Rockstar Games launched another major update for Grand Theft Auto Online's evolving world. The Los Santos Tuners update brought a renewed focus to the underground street racing scene and introduced a host of innovative and highly requested features, including the LS Car Meet, a shared social space where players can get together to modify, test and race their cars, get tattoos and more. Los Santos Tuners also added 17 highly customizable vehicles, a purchasable auto workshop, new robbery contracts and street races and the ability to add music in a new way through collectible media sticks.\n Recurrent consumer spending increased 33% and active player audience increased 11%, representing the strongest second quarter on record for both metrics. The success of Los Santos Tuners demonstrates Rockstar's ability both to anticipate the needs of its players and to respond to player feedback with an ongoing stream of high quality and engaging content.\n During the quarter, Red Dead Redemption 2 also significantly outperformed our expectations and to date has sold-in more than 39 million units worldwide.\n Momentum continued in Red Dead Online with the introduction of the Blood Money update in July, which introduced a series of new criminal-themed opportunities; complex new missions, including the game's first train robbery; and The Quick Draw Club, a series of 4 distinct, rapid-fire passes featuring criminal-themed unlockable rewards, bonuses and more. As a result of the Blood Money update as well as the influx of new players attributable to the stand-alone version of Red Dead Online, we experienced a 26% increase in active players and a 29% increase in new online player acquisition. Recurrent consumer spending for the series was also notably above expectations.\n In August, Private Division expanded their portfolio with the physical release of Hades for PlayStation and Xbox platforms. The title continues to earn positive praise from the gaming community and is currently Metacritic's highest rated game for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. In September, the label released Murder on Eridanos, the final expansion for The Outer Worlds for the Nintendo Switch. We're pleased that The Outer Worlds continues to grow its audience. And to date, the title has sold-in over 4 million units. Also in September, Private Division launched Kerbal Space Program Enhanced Edition for Gen 9 consoles, taking advantage of the latest performance and the visual enhancements to provide players an exciting new way to experience this beloved space flight simulation game.\n During the quarter, recurrent consumer spending rose 7%, which was significantly ahead of our expectations of an 11% decline and accounted for 69% of net bookings. As I mentioned earlier, our consumer engagement trends were consistently strong even as people resume more normal socialization patterns and as schools and workplaces began to reopen. We're very optimistic about our continued ability to keep players engaged and to capitalize further on our massive audience size.\n For the period, NBA 2K and Grand Theft Auto Online were the largest contributors to recurrent consumer spending. Many of our free-to-play offerings were also notable drivers. Top Eleven exceeded our expectations driven by strong seasonal live ops and features, optimized marketing activities and enhanced user quality. Dragon City and Monster Legends performed well, thanks to strong live ops, new updates and feature releases and increased marketing investments. Two Dots achieved its highest ever net bookings since our acquisition, which we attribute to new in-game events such as scavenger hunts and curated seasonal content. WWE SuperCard has now been downloaded more than 24 million times and remains 2K's highest grossing mobile game.\n NBA 2K Online in China outperformed our expectations and remains the #1 online PC sports game in the region with nearly 55 million registered users. We continue to monitor the regulatory environment. It bears noting that China represents 3% of our net bookings in fiscal '21. While we remain optimistic about China and we'll pursue further opportunity there, we believe that our exposure to the region will remain limited in the context of our growing overall net bookings.\n Turning to our guidance. As a result of our second quarter outperformance, along with our updated forecast for the balance of the year, we're raising our outlook for fiscal year 2022, and we now expect to achieve net bookings of $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion. Lainie will provide more details shortly.\n With the strongest multiyear pipeline in our company's history, we continue to believe that we'll achieve sequential growth in net bookings in fiscal '23 and establish new records of operating results over the next few years.\n Our focus on bringing new intellectual properties to market will help us diversify our portfolio further and build lasting franchises that we believe will enhance our financial profile for years to come. At the same time, our teams are hard at work developing sequels to many of our beloved franchises that we know our consumers will be eager to play.\n As we execute on our strategic vision and maintain our commitment to an outstanding and collaborative culture, we believe that we will significantly grow our operations and drive long-term shareholder value.\n I'll now turn the call over to Karl. Thanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for delivering another strong quarter. And to our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued support.\n We'll now take your questions. Operator? We're really excited about all of our partnerships. So we have numerous partnerships. We've always said that we want to be where the consumer is. And when VR first emerged as a potential technology, while I expressed some skepticism about it becoming a very broad-based consumer application, I also thought it was really exciting technically and said that we would participate. Rockstar has already brought L.A. Noire to VR. NBA 2K has come to VR. I'm sure we'll have more VR titles in the future as well.\n So we're always excited when our creative teams can flex their collective muscles and do different things and remains to be seen just how big that can be. We never make projections like that, but we're very excited about the opportunity. And in terms of China, I was making the point about the percent of our net bookings that come from China. And it's quite small, roughly 3% at the moment. We expect our net bookings to grow. We expect sequential growth. We're really excited about our future. And at the same time, we're very focused on the region and particularly on the country in the context of what we're able to do and being compliant with regulations. So we remain highly optimistic about China. We absolutely would be very happy to launch additional and new titles there. We expect to do so. In fact, we remain optimistic. I'm simply making the point that it is a small part of our business. Thanks for your question. Look, we're so grateful that we continue to attract the industry's top talent. In fact, we've hired over 1,500 developers over the last 2 years, and we've more than doubled our internal developer count in the last 5 years. And I don't want to overstate the case and so much always has to be done on a daily basis regarding culture. But I do think that, that's a reflection of who we are. And I think ultimately, everyone knows who you are, people inside and people outside.\n And we're really proud of the culture that we've built. A culture that starts with creativity, innovation and efficiency, but very importantly, includes accepting everyone as they are, as they show up, as long as they are equally focused on a very high ambition for excellence and hard work, a willingness to be honest and open and transparent and collaborative, and the agreement that we have with one another that we'll treat everyone with decency and kindness. And I think at this point, we're known for that. And we're imperfect and there's much more that we can do at any given time. We are highly focused on this culture and it has served us very well. We are so thrilled to have Nordeus in the Take-Two family. And they're just crushing it, which is great. Top Eleven is a great title, a beloved title. And I just couldn't be happier to be in the soccer manager business through Top Eleven with the Nordeus team. That's a big step forward for us. We haven't been in that sport before. And I think I'll leave it at that today. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us. That was an incredibly short call for us. So you all must have better things to do for the rest of the day. We wish you very well. We're obviously really pleased with the results. And what that leads me to say is, how grateful everyone here is to our teams who deliver these results, who work hard every day to make the phenomenal entertainment that drives the success of the company on an ongoing basis. It's incredibly hard. We don't take it for granted. We never take success for granted. And so thank you to all of our colleagues who are listening today and the ones who aren't listening because they're hard at work. Thank you also to our shareholders for your ongoing support."

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Nicole Shevins, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Please go ahead. \nNicole Shevins: Good afternoon.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. \n I'm pleased to report that fiscal year 2022 is off to a great start, highlighted by first quarter net bookings of $711 million, which exceeded our expectations. As the world has moved toward a safer, new normal, we experienced strong engagement trends across most of our core franchises. \n During the period, we took multiple steps to enhance our organization over the long term. We invested further in talent and core infrastructure, which are important areas to support our expansive multiyear pipeline. Mobile remains a key growth opportunity, and we believe that our acquisition of Nordeus will enhance meaningfully our talents and expertise in this area. With a larger mobile footprint, we've integrated Socialpoint, Playdots and Nordeus into T2 Mobile Games. This structure will enable us to realize cost synergies, leverage expertise and share best practices across our mobile teams. I'm also proud that we deepened our focus on corporate responsibility, and we've recently made several key hires to lead our efforts regarding diversity, equity and inclusion. \n Turning to our first quarter results. Our better-than-expected performance was primarily driven by Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, and Borderlands 3. For nearly 8 years, Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online have redefined the creative and cultural influence of interactive entertainment, setting new standards for multiple generations of consumers and gaming platforms. Sales of Grand Theft Auto V were significantly above our expectations once again, and the title has now sold in more than 150 million units. \n Rockstar Games continued to keep its massive player base engaged with new content updates for Grand Theft Auto Online, including 8 new stunt races, 7 new arenas for Deadline mode and regular in-game bonuses and incentives. This helped drive the title to its second highest first quarter on record for player audience in its third consecutive quarter of player growth. In comparison to the first quarter of fiscal 2020, Grand Theft Auto Online achieved a 72% increase in its audience size, a 77% increase in new players and significant growth in recurring consumer spending. \n In addition, Rockstar Games continued to captivate and engage audiences with Red Dead Redemption 2, which exceeded our expectations and has now sold in more than 38 million units. Red Dead Online also enjoyed a strong quarter, thanks to new content offerings, including 8 new horse races and a creative array of bonuses and incentives. The game experienced strong performance as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2020, including 18% growth in its audience size, 26% growth in new players and outstanding growth in recurrent consumer spending. This performance was driven by both strong ongoing game sales and the continued influx of new players from the stand-alone version of Red Dead Online. \n Turning to our sports offerings. NBA 2K21 has sold in over 11 million units and remains the #1 sports title in the U.S. NBA 2K's community continues to be highly engaged with more than 2.7 million users playing daily. As compared to last year, the game experienced 13% growth in first-time spenders and nearly 30% growth in returning players. We see a significant opportunity to grow the franchise further over the next few years as we provide unique and innovative experiences throughout the game. \n PGA TOUR 2K21 continues to exceed our expectations and expand its audience. In June, 2K and HB Studios launched a community-driven program that allows the top golf course designers from around the world to create and submit ideas for inclusion in the game's online playlist. This program is enhancing the game's vast replayability while also driving player engagement and growing its global community. \n Borderlands 3 had a strong quarter. During the period, 2K and Gearbox Software released the Director's Cut add-on, providing new missions, characters, daily and weekly challenges and unique rewards. The game was also supported with an array of new free content offerings that gave players more ways to perfect and expand their arsenals. \n 2K and Firaxis Games launched Sid Meier's Civilization VI Anthology on Windows PC, providing the ultimate package for players that have yet to experience the award-winning, critically-acclaimed strategy title. The Anthology includes the base game, all previously released DLC, the Rise and Fall and Gathering Storm expansions as well as the popular New Frontier Pass. Civilization VI has sold in more than 11 million units, outperforming its predecessor at the same point in its life cycle. Later this year, 2K and Firaxis Games will celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Civilization franchise, and I'd like to congratulate our teams on this incredible milestone. \n Kerbal Space Program, which has sold in over 5 million units, celebrated its 10-year anniversary in June. To mark the milestone, Private Division released a short documentary video detailing the achievements of the title as well as its impact on the aerospace industry. \n One of our key strategic priorities is to provide new and innovative ways for audiences to stay engaged with our titles and the communities built around them after their initial launch. During the first quarter, recurrent consumer spending declined 25%, which was better than our expectations of a 30% decline and accounted for 69% of net bookings. \n Overall, all evidence suggests that media consumption patterns are beginning to stabilize to a new normal. And while down from the highs of the previous year, recurrent consumer spending in our products has leveled off and remained significantly higher than the first quarter of fiscal 2020. \n The largest contributors to recurrent consumer spending in the period were NBA 2K and Grand Theft Auto Online. We also experienced strong performance across many of our free-to-play offerings. \n Monster Legends and Dragon City exceeded our expectations with sequential top line growth compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. This performance was driven by strong live ops, successful feature releases and significant marketing investments. \n Two Dots celebrated its seventh anniversary in June. The title performed well with positive momentum continuing from the second half of fiscal 2021. \n WWE SuperCard has now been downloaded over 24 million times and remains 2K's highest-grossing mobile title. The franchise has had strong performance with the last 12 months marking its sixth consecutive year of growth. \n Following our acquisition of Nordeus, we're encouraged by the performance of and the potential for Top Eleven, including its use of seasonal live ops and new features. \n NBA 2K Online in China outperformed our expectations. The title remains the #1 online PC sports game in the region with nearly 54 million registered users. \n Turning to our outlook. We're reiterating our prior guidance of $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion in net bookings for fiscal 2022. As we continue to develop our pipeline, there has been movement in some of our planned releases, including 2 of our immersive core titles shifting to later in fiscal 2022 than our prior guidance had contemplated. Our approach has always been to allow our labels to determine when projects are ready to bring to market to ensure the best quality and overall experience for players. \n As Karl will discuss in greater detail, we're excited about our pipeline and the impact of our new releases will have on our business and financial profile in the years to come. We believe that we'll achieve sequential growth in fiscal 2023 and establish new record levels of operating results over the next few years. \n Looking ahead, we remain highly optimistic about the future of the interactive entertainment sector and our competitive positioning. As we leverage our many advantages, our leading talent, focus on creativity, incredible portfolio of owned IP and strong balance sheet, we believe that Take-Two is well positioned to drive long-term growth and shareholder value. \n I'll now turn the call over to Karl. \nKarl Slatoff: Thanks, Strauss. I'd like to thank our team for a strong start to the year and their continued dedication to our business. \n We continue to believe that fiscal year 2022 will be a year of investments, as marked by our recent acquisitions of Nordeus and Dynamixyz. We are thrilled to have both teams join our family, and we will continue to evaluate organic and inorganic opportunities to enhance our organization. \n I'll now discuss our recent releases. Rockstar Games continued to provide an array of free content for their vast and growing online communities. In June, Rockstar released 7 new arenas for the fan-favorite Deadline mode for Grand Theft Auto Online. This was followed by the Los Santos Tuners update, the game's major summer launch in July, which delivered an action-packed street racing-themed update into Grand Theft Auto Online. The update introduced elements of the tuner car culture to the game world, including the LS Car Meet, a new, heavily requested shared social space for players to get together to modify their personal vehicles, watch others modify their Tuner vehicles in real time, race and test various vehicles on an underground test track and much more. \n In addition, the Los Santos Tuners update features 6 epic new robbery contracts, 6 new race types, 10 new highly customizable vehicles, collectible USB sticks offering a new way to hear music from Moodymann and Seth Troxler and a host of quality-of-life updates, including a new customizable radio station wheel. \n The launch of the Los Santos Tuners set new records for Grand Theft Auto Online, including the largest number of players and the highest level of net bookings for both day 1 and during the opening week for any update in Grand Theft Auto Online's history. \n Looking ahead, the upcoming launch of the expanded and enhanced versions of Grand Theft Auto Online for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S systems this November will allow for higher top speeds for select vehicles across these more powerful systems. \n In July, Rockstar Games released the Bloody Money (sic) [ Blood Money ] update for Red Dead Online. The update introduced a series of criminal-themed opportunities; complex new missions, including the game's first train robbery; and The Quick Draw Club, a series of 4 distinct, rapid-fire passes featuring criminal-themed unlockable rewards, bonuses and more. Blood Money's success, along with the additional influx of new players thanks to the launch of the stand-alone version of Red Dead Online, led to the highest number of players on day 1 for any update in Red Dead Online history. \n Fiscal 2022 is an exciting year for Take-Two as we embark on our multiyear strategy to deliver a slate of releases more robust than any other time in our company's history. While there has been some movement in our pipeline, including 2 of our immersive core titles shifting to later this fiscal year, we remain highly optimistic about our plans, including the introduction of several new franchises. \n I'll now discuss details on our upcoming announced offerings for this year. On August 13, Private Division will launch Hades on physical disc for PlayStation and Xbox consoles. Developed by Supergiant Games, Hades is a rouge-like dungeon crawler in which players seek freedom by battling their way through the treacherous Underworld of Greek myth. The physical retail edition will come with additional items for collectors, including a compendium booklet featuring the art of the game and a code to download its soundtrack. We are excited to launch Hades, which previously won over 50 Game of the Year awards and earned impressive aggregate scores of 93 and 94 on Metacritic and OpenCritic, respectively. \n In addition, during the second quarter, Private Division will launch Murder on Eridanos, the second add-on content offering for The Outer Worlds for the Nintendo Switch. \n On September 10, 2K and Visual Concepts will once again set the standard for basketball simulations as they have done for the past 20 years with the launch of NBA 2K22 for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch and PC. Featuring best-in-class visual presentation and player AI, historic teams and a wide variety of hoops experiences, NBA 2K22 will place the entire basketball universe in the player's hands. \n Global phenomenon and 2-time NBA All-Star, Luka Doncic, will grace the cover of the Standard Edition and Cross-Gen Digital Bundle, while NBA legends Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Dirk Nowitzki and Kevin Durant will be featured on the premium NBA 75th Anniversary Edition. \n In North America, players can purchase a special version of the Standard Edition featuring 6-time WNBA All-Star and WNBA Champion, Candace Parker, on the cover, available exclusively through GameStop and EB Games. Parker's appearance is a milestone for the NBA 2K series, marking the first female cover athlete in the history of the franchise. \n In Japan, players can also purchase a special version of the Standard Edition that will feature Washington Wizards Rui Hachimura, a rising star who was the first Japanese player to not only be drafted in the first round in 2019, but also to reach the NBA Playoffs. \n The NBA 75th Anniversary Edition and Cross-Gen Digital Bundle will feature cover artwork painted by renowned Atlanta-based artist, Charly Palmer, whose Civil Rights series appeared on the cover of TIME Magazine in July 2020. \n This fall, Private Division will introduce Kerbal Space Program Enhanced Edition for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S. The title will benefit from multiple hardware advancements, which will provide upgraded resolution, increased frame rate, advanced shaders, better textures and additional performance improvements. Players who already own Kerbal Space Program Enhanced Edition for Gen 8 consoles will be eligible for a free upgrade to the new version of the game upon its release. \n On November 11, Rockstar Games will launch the expanded and enhanced version of Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online - Standalone for Gen 9 consoles. Rockstar Games will have more details to share about these eagerly anticipated launches in the coming months. \n This winter, Private Division will release Roll 7's OlliOlli World digitally for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Nintendo Switch and PC. The title has received outstanding initial feedback from early media impressions, including praise for its bold new direction, unique art style, standout soundtrack and improve game play mechanics. \n During the fourth quarter, 2K and Gearbox Software will launch an exciting new franchise. Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is an epic adventure full of whimsy, wonder and high-powered weaponry set in an unpredictable fantasy world where magic, broadswords and bullets collide. It is an entirely new game and a full stand-alone experience with a rich, story-driven co-op campaign for up to 4 players as well as repeatable end-game content. In addition, later this month, 2K will unveil details of another exciting new franchise planned for launch during this fiscal year. \n During fiscal 2020 -- '22, WWE 2K22 will mark the rebirth of our popular wrestling series. We are very excited about the team's fresh approach to the franchise, including an array of enhancements and new features. 2K and Visual Concepts have shared a series of behind the scenes videos of their work on WWE 2K22, including entrance and move animations as well as motion capture and facial scanning with much more to come.  \n Turning to mobile. We are pleased to expand our offerings, especially given the strong momentum in this market segment. Players can look forward to new releases this year, which our teams will have more to share about in the coming months. In addition, our labels continue to invest in technology and new games that they plan to deliver during the next few years.  \n Turning to eSports. The NBA 2K League kicked off its fourth season on May 19 that will include on September 4 -- that will conclude on September 4, with the league finals delivered by Door Dash. This season, games have been airing live on the League's Twitch and YouTube channels and are also available on eGG Network in Southeast Asia, ESRevolution, Loco in India, Sport1 in Europe and Dash Radio. The League continues to grow its audience with more than 2 million followers on its social media platforms and nearly 470 million video views.  \n We are excited about the League's recent announcement that its 2021 playoffs will take place at the Mavs Gaming Hub in Dallas, marking the first time that in-person games will be offered since the 2019 NBA 2K League Finals in New York City. Looking ahead, we believe that the NBA 2K League has the long-term potential to enhance engagement and to be a driver of profits for our company. \n In closing, we are optimistic about the multiyear growth trajectory ahead of us. We are positioning our business for growth and enhancing our enterprise by investing in talent and infrastructure. With our robust pipeline of titles and content updates, we are confident that we can establish new record levels of operating performance over the next several years. \n I'll now turn the call over to Lainie. \nLainie Goldstein: Thanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our first quarter results and then review our financial outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year 2022. Please note that additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release. \n As Strauss mentioned, fiscal 2022 is off to a strong start with our first quarter operating results exceeding our expectations. Net bookings were $711 million, which was above our guidance of $625 million to $675 million and marked our second highest Q1 on record. Our outperformance was primarily driven by Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online and Borderlands 3. \n During the period, overall engagement exceeded our expectations. Recurrent consumer spending declined 25% as compared to our outlook of a 30% decline and accounted for 69% of total net bookings. Our outperformance was primarily driven by Grand Theft Auto Online as well as the addition of Nordeus. \n Digitally delivered net bookings declined 26% as compared to our outlook of a 30% decline and accounted for 96% of the total. This result was better than our outlook primarily due to the outperformance of recurrent consumer spending. During the quarter, 73% of console game sales were delivered digitally, up from 71% last year. \n GAAP net revenue declined 2% to $813 million, while cost of goods sold decreased 31% to $330 million. Operating expenses increased by 15% to $313 million, primarily driven by higher personnel and stock compensation expenses as well as the addition of Playdots and Nordeus. And GAAP net income was $152 million or $1.30 per share as compared to $89 million or $0.77 per share in the first quarter last year. We ended the quarter with over $2.5 billion of cash and short-term investments. \n Turning to our guidance, I'll begin with our full fiscal year expectation. As Strauss mentioned, we are reiterating our net bookings outlook range of $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion. While our first quarter results outperformed our expectations and our acquisition of Nordeus will benefit the year, this is being offset by some changes to our release schedule, including moving 2 of our immersive core titles to later in fiscal 2022 than our prior guidance had contemplated. We continue to be very excited about our pipeline and the next phase of growth that it presents for our company. \n The largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online as well as some of our new releases that are yet to be announced. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 55% 2K, 35% Rockstar Games and 10% Private Division and T2 Mobile Games. \n We forecast a geographic net bookings split to be about 60% United States and 40% international. As a result of our outperformance in Q1 as well as the addition of Nordeus, we now expect recurrent consumer spending to decline by 9% compared to our prior outlook of a 15% decline versus fiscal 2021. As a percentage of net bookings, recurrent consumer spending is expected to be relatively flat versus last year and represent 65% of total net bookings. \n We now project digitally delivered net bookings to decrease by approximately 6% as compared to our prior outlook of an 8% decline. As a percentage of our business, digital is projected to represent 90%, slightly above 89% last year. Our forecast assumes that 74% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 64% last year. \n We expect to generate more than $400 million in non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow, and we plan to deploy approximately $170 million for capital expenditures. The increase over our prior guidance relates to the acquisition of 2 office buildings in the U.K. to support our business in the region. We continue to expect GAAP net revenue to range from $3.14 billion to $3.24 billion while we now expect cost of goods sold to range from $1.4 billion to $1.44 billion. \n Total operating expenses are expected to range from $1.48 billion to $1.5 billion, representing at the midpoint a 23% increase over the prior year. This increase reflects significant investments in marketing, personnel, stock compensation and IT expenses to bring our expansive multiyear pipeline to market as well as incremental expenses due to the addition of Nordeus and a full year of Playdots. \n And we expect GAAP net income to range from $229 million to $259 million or $1.95 to $2.20 per share. For management reporting purposes, we expect our tax rate to be 16% throughout fiscal 2022. \n Now moving to our guidance for the fiscal second quarter. We project net bookings to range from $815 million to $865 million compared to $958 million in the second quarter last year. Our guidance reflects the continued challenging comparisons from last year due to COVID-19. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Dragon City, Top Eleven and Two Dots. We project recurrent consumer spending to decline by approximately 11% and digitally delivered net bookings to decline by approximately 5%. Our forecast assumes that 64% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 57% last year. \n We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $740 million to $790 million and cost of goods sold to range from $323 million to $349 million. Operating expenses are expected to range from $368 million to $378 million. At the midpoint, this represents a 27% increase over last year, driven primarily by higher marketing, personnel, IT and research and development costs as well as the inclusion of Playdots and Nordeus. And GAAP net income is expected to range from $41 million to $53 million or $0.35 to $0.45 per share. \n In closing, our first quarter results demonstrate the health of our business and the incredible execution from our talented colleagues across the world. As we capitalize on our industry's strong talent, combined with our unique business drivers, we believe that our company will deliver significant long-term growth and margin expansion for our shareholders. \n Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Strauss. \nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for delivering a strong start to the year. And to our shareholders, I'd like to express our appreciation for your continued support. We'll now be happy to take your questions. Operator? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mario Lu with Barclays. \nX. Lu: So being the first of the major game publishers to report earnings this quarter, I wanted to hear your thoughts regarding the recent developments within the industry on gender and equality. If you could share Take-Two's stance on this issue and if there's anything you can share in terms of impacts or change [ does ] expected to be within the company would be greatly appreciated. \nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks for the question. Look, our most important asset here is our people because they create everything that we're able to bring to consumers. We're an asset-light business. We are a business of intellectual property. And our strategy, our stated strategy has always been to be the most creative, the most innovative and the most efficient company in the business. \n Diversity is key to our success. We need to have a diverse perspective and diverse voices in order to create that quality. So it starts at the top. Our Board of Directors is diverse with respect to gender, race and skill set. Our management team is exceedingly diverse from a gender perspective. And our voices as a result are diverse. \n But we're not stopping there. We're also reaching into the community to create a broader, more diverse pool from which we can recruit and our competitors can recruit going forward. So we work together in company-sponsored service projects and the communities in which we operate. We encourage individual volunteerism and giving through philanthropic and matching donation programs. We support organizations that are focused on enhancing diversity. We increased the Canada pool through scholarships to design students, contributions to organizations providing STEM opportunities to children in underserved communities. And delivering interview training and career counseling to young adults. And this crosses genders. But in many instances, we're also focused on young females as well. \n So we're trying to do the right thing from the top of the company at the Board level to the management team, to even creating a pool from which we can recruit a long time into the future. And even so, I'm sure there's much more that we can do. \nX. Lu: Great. That's -- glad to hear it. And just 1 question for Lainie on the COVID impact and on recurrent consumer spending in the quarter. Recurrent consumer spending declined 25% versus your guidance, down 30%, which is a smaller beat than usual. So given that fiscal 1Q was the first full quarter of comping sheltering in place last year, can you give us a little bit more color in terms of how user engagement trended throughout the quarter? Did things get better or worse? And any additional color would be helpful. \nLainie Goldstein: So Mario, it's definitely in line with what our expectations were. It's a little bit better. We saw better performance in GTA Online than we expected. We also have the addition of Nordeus, which also helped our recurrent consumer spending in the quarter. So we definitely are seeing the engagement in line with what we had expected. So there really isn't any change than what we had guided to from the beginning of the year. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. \nMichael Ng: Great. I also just have 2. First, could you talk a little bit about how the success of GTA V and GTA Online informs your interest -- or sorry, the interest levels for GTA enhanced edition and how that could perform? \n And then second, just as a housekeeping item, I was just wondering if you're willing to provide the actual growth numbers for GTA Online and Red Dead Online in the quarter. And also, your assumptions, at least directionally, for those businesses in the September quarter guidance for RCS. \nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks, Mike. In terms of our expectations about any upcoming release, apart from what we've given guidance, I don't tend to give any more color than that. Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online have been out now for some 8 years, and the performance has consistently been vastly better than our expectations. I have no doubt that the enhanced edition will delight consumers. I have no doubt that it will be absolutely extraordinary. How it will perform? Hard to say. This is now the third generation in which the title has existed. I'm an optimist, and I find that you never want to bet against Rockstar Games. So I'm looking forward to the release. And Lainie will take the second question. \nLainie Goldstein: So for GTA Online in Q2, our expectations are for it to be up in the quarter due to the update that is just released. We didn't have an update last year. It's a difficult comp because of COVID, but since we had this update, we expect it to be up versus last year. And for Red Dead Online, since it's a difficult comp, we expect it to be slightly up, but -- due to the update, but not as up as GTA Online versus last year. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Thornton with Truist Securities. \nMatthew Thornton: Maybe 2 quick ones. First, just on the delays, you called out the 2 immersive core titles. It sounded like maybe there might be some other stuff as well. I'm just curious if there's any slippage, without getting into specifics, around some of the other new mobile titles or extensions kind of planned for the year. Any color there. \n And then just secondly, I think you just talked a little bit about kind of engagement trends given the pandemic normalization. It sounds like things are trending kind of as you thought 3 months ago. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but I think that's the interpretation there. The other change in the quarter was obviously around the Apple ATT change, IDFA changes and the impact on the mobile side of the business. So I'm just curious on the mobile side of the business if you saw any impact there or I guess how that tracked relative to your expectation when we all sat here 3 months ago. Any color there would be great. \nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks, Matthew. We don't have any other expectations of delays. So we've got -- we've mentioned what we have as we always do. In terms of how things are trending post pandemic, if you call this post pandemic, and I hope we can, it remains to be seen, the trend is almost exactly what we anticipated and what we've talked about now for over a year, which is we expected postpandemic demand to be higher than prepandemic demand and lower than the demand during the pandemic, which stands to reason because people have, in many ways, returned to normal in most of the world. That remains to be seen. As to what will come in the future, I'm hopeful that, that will continue. \n But clearly, there's been a systemic shift in favor of interactive entertainment. It's now the #1 entertainment vertical. It's something like $180 billion market. It's a diverse market in terms of gender. It's a diverse market in terms of age. So we couldn't be more optimistic about the market than we are. \n And in terms of IDFA, it's still early days. It remains to be seen. We have not seen any negative impact on our business. And I think that's really because we're big enough that we have lots of access to data. We have a consolidated consumer database across all of our labels, which is very robust. And if you have enough of your own data and you have solid data analytics teams, which we have both at the corporate level and at the label level, then a great deal of the information can be found in other ways. And you can do appropriate marketing that protects consumers' privacy without the resources that we had before from Apple. So we're in a good place so far with regard to that change, but it is still early. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Uerkwitz with Jefferies. \nAndrew Uerkwitz: I just have 2 quick ones. First one, I think, is for Lainie. Could you -- on the increased marketing spend, is the delay affect the way you're going to go to market with these titles? And then secondly, has the return on marketing spend changed over the last several years? Has it gotten better, gotten worse? Any color there to kind of -- on how marketing has affected game sales would be useful. \nLainie Goldstein: So the increase on the marketing hasn't really changed. There's a little bit of timing change from Q1 into the rest of the year. And there's a little bit of shift out of the year into next year, but that's being offset by some additional costs due to the acquisition of Nordeus into the year. So there is a little bit of an increase of the overall operating expense in the year versus previous guidance. So it's a reduction of a little bit of marketing, offset by the Nordeus expense. \n And in terms of the return on marketing spend, I wouldn't say there's better or worse. I would say that we're a little bit more targeted on how we're spending our marketing. So I'd say we were getting a better return because we're able to really see how we're spending the marketing in a better way with better analytics over the last few years. But the spend continues to be a strong spend in order to do the best marketing for our titles, especially also with the mobile titles as well. \nAndrew Uerkwitz: Got it. And then, Strauss, I just want to go back to the first question a bit. I mean have some of the issues popped up? And have other competitors made you guys kind of rethink how you -- some of your policies, procedures? And then kind of along those lines, I believe employee turnover is already -- excuse me, you guys have a history of low turnover because people enjoy working at Take-Two. Is that still the case? Is turnover is still pretty low? \nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks for the question. Look, let's just pause at the -- inclusion, diversity and common decency is of paramount importance to everyone here and specifically highly important to me and has been for the 14 years that we've been around. This is nothing new for us. The culture of the company is well-known and well-known internally and reasonably well-known externally. All that said, we can always do better. And I think we're known to be people who always want to be doing better and never want to rest on our laurels. \n We don't think that fostering an appropriate environment is a single set of actions or reflects  1 day in a new cycle. We think it's a constant process of introspection and improvement. There are always ways that we and the industry can do better. We'll listen to our colleagues, and we'll work on this area over time. \n But I want to be very specific because you asked the question about what we do around here and what we've always done. The first is, and I'll say it in as black and white a way as I can, we will not tolerate harassment or discrimination or bad behavior of any kind. We never have. We set those expectations when people come on board here through our code of conduct and our anti-harassment and antidiscrimination policies, all of which our colleagues are required to review and sign when they're hired. All of our colleagues take anti-harassment training at hire and biannually after that. And we make it clear through the training and through our policy that if anyone does experience any inappropriate contact, there are multiple avenues to report that, and they'll never be retaliated against for doing so. Those options include the management chain, anyone in HR, an anonymous complaint by phone or online through our third-party hotline and website reporting tools. \n Take-Two has a director of diversity and inclusion, and that [indiscernible] includes developing, executing and leading a global DE&I strategy, and that supports our business objectives. We also have multiple employee resource groups inside the company, and we have more growing all the time, which gives us all a thrill. So that's what we're up to very specifically. Again, is there more that we could do? I'm certain there is. Do we feel like we're in a pretty good place? We're grateful that we do feel that way right now. \n In terms of retention, our turnover rate is roughly half of the industries. That's been true for about the past 18 months. There have been times when it's been about 70% of industry levels. It's been trending down at a time when I think, in general, turnover is trending up. So we feel good about that. And that's another measure of how we're doing, so we focus on it. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Martin Yang with Oppenheimer & Co. \nMartin Yang: My first one is about how you account for the shifts in business models and player taste for games that have a much longer development cycle than a typical annual release is. And how much input does your central organization have in those directional changes on the market? \nStrauss Zelnick: I'm not sure I entirely follow your question. The development cycles for our core immersive releases are still significant. It takes some time to make what we hope will be the best titles in the business. And development cycles are not getting shorter for core immersive releases, and I wouldn't necessarily expect them to. \n I think what's changed is that in between big releases, we continue to engage consumers with add-on content and with opportunities to engage in online versions of the game in certain instances and multiplayer opportunities as well. So that's what created recurrent consumer spending. But much more importantly, recurrent consumer spending reflects consumer activity and engagement. But that doesn't really change development cycles. So did I miss your question in some way? \nMartin Yang: No, I think you answered it. I have a follow-up for Lainie. In terms of the marketing plan for the year, particularly around expanded and enhanced version for GTA, do you treat that game release as a brand-new game around the marketing and campaigns around it? Or do you -- how do you see this enhanced version marketing leading to the release? \nLainie Goldstein: It wouldn't be marketed as a brand-new game. There certainly is marketing around the game, but it wouldn't be as if it's a brand-new release of a GTA property. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. \nMatthew Cost: It's Matt on for Brian. I have 2. So Strauss, you made a comment about seeing signs of stabilization in media consumption patterns. Obviously, it's under -- I understood your comments about how you expected to come to a lower rate post pandemic than you saw during the pandemic. But I guess what are the things that you're seeing right now that are giving you confidence that you're seeing stabilization as opposed to sort of being midway through sort of the normalization process with a floor at some lower level? \n And then the second question is just on the reorganization of the mobile studios. Are there any new capabilities or new goals for that organization now that you're centralizing all the studios under 1 umbrella? Is there anything that's new that's possible on the mobile side of the business because of that? \nKarl Slatoff: Matt, so in terms of the stabilization of media consumption patterns, really, what we're seeing is we can just see it in the numbers. Obviously, we don't have the same kind of wind in our backs as we did during the pandemic itself. But now that the pandemic is hopefully over, certainly, people are getting back to normal. We're experiencing what we expected, but we're also seeing instances like, for example, when the new movies came out for GTA Online, we're seeing record engagement. So that in itself shows you that the sort of the moderation that we've seen is really coming to an end because people are engaging when the content is released, and they're engaging in a very significant way. So that gives us a lot of confidence that we may be past the, I guess, you call them headwinds of losing the tailwinds of the pandemic, and we moved on to where the titles are behaving as we would expect in a more normalized environment. So we can see it in the numbers themselves. \n In terms of centralizing the studios and mobile under 1 umbrella, we do expect that there will be synergies across the organizations. Each of these studios has got something to bring in terms of expertise, whether it's data analytics, whether it's different ways to create content. There are a lot of things that they can learn from each other, and bringing them together under 1 management umbrella really gives us the ability -- not to mention also consumer data, really gives us the ability to pursue best practices across the entire organization. So yes, we do expect there to be synergies based on this reorganization. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your question comes from the line of Gerrick Johnson with BMO Capital Markets. \nGerrick Johnson: First, I'm just wondering why these titles were delayed. \nStrauss Zelnick: We needed more time to polish them and make sure that they're the best titles they possibly can be. \nGerrick Johnson: Okay. So no COVID-related delay then? \nStrauss Zelnick: No, our team has been incredibly productive throughout the pandemic. And even though we have a lot of work going on at home, productivity is high. \nGerrick Johnson: Okay. Great. And is Nordeus accretive? \nLainie Goldstein: Yes. Nordeus is an accretive acquisition for us. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Clay Griffin with MoffettNathanson. \nClay Griffin: Strauss, I noted Sony's Jim Ryan specifically calling out Chinese demand for PlayStation 5. You've been bullish on the long-term opportunity in China in the sense that it opens up to Western content. At the same time, there's obviously been a lot of concern on a regulatory shift in China in the space. I'd love to just get your current thoughts on the Chinese market and how you think Take-Two is positioned to participate in that market over time. \nStrauss Zelnick: It's a great market for us. We have the #1 PC online sports title in China with 54 million registered users. NBA 2K Online continues to grow in China. We also have console titles for China, and we have titles that are being approved. We have great relationships in China with Tencent and others. And so we think there's plenty of upside going forward. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald with Wells Fargo. \nBrian Fitzgerald: From Socialpoint to Playdots to Nordeus, you guys have always been really highly disciplined in terms of M&A activity. We wanted to ask what you're seeing in terms of valuations on the mobile side of things. Or are platform changes like Apple is doing with AT&T, is that making it increasingly harder, Strauss, to your point for small publishers and studios to compete? Is that making it more frothy in terms of the -- just the general environment for acquisitions? \nStrauss Zelnick: We haven't seen any change in the market yet, and valuations remain frothy, I think, because of the growth of the sector and enthusiasm around the sector. However, our discipline has really paid off in the past 14 years. Knock wood, we haven't made a failed acquisition. Our acquisitions are accretive, usually right away. Sometimes it could take a little bit of time. But we're happy that we've done every deal that we've done. We did miss out on a few that we wish we had done, but frankly, not all that many. \n I think you raised a good point, which is over time, will it be harder for smaller companies to compete in the space? And I think that will be true. The answer will be yes with regard to both mobile and console. The resources required are significant. The risk profile is significant. And the history of the entertainment business is that over time, those that are very creative become very successful. Those that are very successful become bigger. Those that are bigger have the opportunity to acquire smaller enterprises. And as long as the focus remains on creativity, innovation and efficiency and as long as the culture that has made the company successful in the first place is maintained, there's an opportunity for continued success even with scale. And that's certainly how we see ourselves and how we envision our future. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel. \nAndrew Crum: Okay. So just going back to GTA Online, can you talk about your expectations for the fiscal year? Lainie, I know you said you're expecting growth in fiscal 2Q. You have the stand-alone version coming in November. So with that in place, can GTA Online grow this year? \n And then separately, I know you guys don't like to guide on specific titles, but on Hades, it looks like you had a limited release previously but managed to ship 1 million plus copies, very high metascore. Can you talk about maybe at a high level what your expectations are for that game and prospects for commercial success? \nLainie Goldstein: Drew, for GTA Online, our expectations for the full year is for it to moderate. So for the full year, we expect moderation of the trends that benefited us from the industry last year due to COVID and the sheltering at home. So Q1 was down versus last year. [ We've now ] beat our expectations. And Q2 is going to be up because of the update, which is doing really well. So we do expect Q3 and Q4 right now to be down. But GTA Online always surprises us. So it's still early in the year, so we'll see what happens. But right now, we do have our expectations as it being moderating for the year. \nKarl Slatoff: And in terms of Hades, look, I mean in a lot of ways, this is one of the ideal projects for Private Division. I mean we founded the Division based on our effort to hook up with some of the best independent developers in the world. And I would certainly categorize Supergiant as one of those. Hades obviously has had its significant critical and commercial success to date with the digital release. And we're really excited to be part of it on the physical side. \n And we think there's a significant market for that title that has just started. They have sold a good number of copies, but there's a lot of upside for us. So we're thrilled to be in business with Supergiant. We think there's a great amount of upside for us, and we're looking forward to the release. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Benjamin Soff with Deutsche Bank. \nBenjamin Soff: Just one, if I could. I was just wondering how you guys think about the subscription model in gaming and where and if you see an opportunity there for you guys. \nStrauss Zelnick: Yes. Our views remain unchanged. We think that a subscription model can make sense for deep catalog titles, but it doesn't really make sense for frontline titles. And for any business model that makes sense in the entertainment business, it has to work for the creators of the entertainment as well as the consumers of the entertainment. And I think catalog can make sense for the publishers. It can make sense for consumers who are avid, who really want access to a lot of product. \n But if you're getting into frontline product, then the economics are much more difficult to make sense of. And remember, consumers who are involved with interactive entertainment have different consumption patterns than those involved with linear entertainment. Linear entertainment consumers consume something like 150 hours of programming a month. That's probably well over 100 different titles. In the case of interactive entertainment, consumers are consuming something like 45 hours a month, and that may be 1, 2, 3, 4 titles, but it's certainly not 100 titles. \n So from a consumer point of view, it's not clear that a subscription model really makes sense for the bulk of consumers. That remains to be seen. We're open-minded. We have made catalog titles available for subscription services. Very occasionally, we've made frontline titles available as well. But we do see this more as a catalog offering than a frontline offering. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners. \nEric Handler: Two questions. First, with regards to the untethering of Red Dead Redemption Online, now that you've had this for a little while, I'm just curious, what are you finding with the game in terms of widening the funnel? Is it bringing new people in that's helping to sell more units of Red Dead Redemption 2? Anything -- any color you can give us would be great. \nStrauss Zelnick: It's been good news. We've added players. It's been good for the main game. It's been good for Red Dead Online. I think the timing was excellent. Again, I think you can do almost anything from a marketing point of view if you're mindful of creating appropriate marketing windows. \nEric Handler: Great. And then just as a follow-up. I'm curious with COVID ebbs and flows, are your developers still completely working at home? Are you -- have you brought them back in-house at all? Or where do you stand there? \nStrauss Zelnick: It's a mix. People are back at work in China, for example, and other parts of the globe. We have some people back at work at offices in the U.S. as well. We are very mindful of what's going on. Our colleague's safety and health comes first. And thankfully, everyone's highly productive wherever they are. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Hickey with The Benchmark Company. \nMichael Hickey: Congrats on the quarter, guys. Two from me. First one, it looks like subsequent quarter end, you started using some DMCA takedown requests to remove [indiscernible]. Just sort of curious the catalyst for doing that and sort of the feedback from the player community. \n The second question is on the collegiate opportunity. It seems like you sort of have a new frontier here for college sports and athletes. And sort of, I guess, your thoughts there and any consideration in your pipeline. \nStrauss Zelnick: In terms of takedowns, we're pretty flexible, frankly. That said, if the economy is threatened or if there's bad behavior, and we know how to define that, then we would issue a takedown notice. I'm sorry, what was your second question, Mike? \nMichael Hickey: Second question is just on the collegiate opportunity, Strauss, for sports and athletes or games. \nStrauss Zelnick: And the opportunity with regard to what, just so I understand your question. \nMichael Hickey: NBA. Obviously, college basketball would be pretty sweet, I think, too. Just sort of, I guess, expansion opportunities for your game portfolio or working with athletes maybe for marketing or [ game from last year ]? \nStrauss Zelnick: I'm not sure how to answer it. And so I'm going to be judicious and probably not going to answer it. I will note that we were in business many years ago with the NCAA, and we know longer are. And we're always looking for opportunities to grow our business and our sports business. \nOperator: Your next question is a follow-up from Matthew Thornton with Truist Securities. \n Your next follow-up comes from Gerrick Johnson with BMO Capital Markets. \nGerrick Johnson: You were in a special time here with next-gen consoles rolling out, and you have -- GTA and NBA both have new titles coming out that will take advantage of those consoles. Are you finding more deferral of those titles in general, waiting for those next versions and the rollout of those consoles? \nStrauss Zelnick: It's awfully hard to measure something like that, but demand for NBA 2K has been very strong this year. We've had a great year. We've sold in over 11 million units. And certainly, ongoing demand for Grand Theft Auto V has been huge. We've sold in over 150 million units. So I'm not sure we've seen -- I'm not sure we could measure it in any case. I don't know -- we have to do tailored research and it still wouldn't tell us anything that we could do differently. But I remain of the view that the enhanced edition of Grand Theft Auto V will be highly appealing to consumers with next-gen platforms or now current-gen platforms. But that remains to be seen. \nOperator: Your next question is a follow-up from Matthew Thornton with Truist Securities. \nMatthew Thornton: Just 2 quick follow-ups. I guess staying on new consoles for a second. I'm just curious how you're thinking about supply as we head into the holiday season. And obviously, we've got the next-gen Grand Theft Auto releasing. I'm just kind of curious of the latest thoughts around console supply and demand. \n And then just secondly, you guys have talked a lot about the pipeline numbers of releases for fiscal '23 and fiscal '24. You've talked about expecting sequential growth in fiscal '23. And you've talked about getting to new record operating results in the outyears as well. I'm just curious if that last comment pertain to that window, that fiscal '23 to fiscal '24 window, or if I'm reading too much into that. \nStrauss Zelnick: We know that demand for consoles remains high. That's not in doubt. We're hopeful that supply will be enhanced by year-end, and it will be in a good place. But most importantly, the demand is there. And in terms of the pipeline, yes, we said we expected sequential growth in fiscal '23, and we expect to set new operating records in the coming years. And we still have both of those expectations. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the call back to Strauss Zelnick for closing remarks. \nStrauss Zelnick: Thank you so much for joining us today. I want to, as always, emphatically thank all of our colleagues all around the world who delivered these great results. And it has been a challenging time to deliver the results. And our team shows up and does their best work every day, and work continues to pay off. We're so grateful. We're also grateful to our shareholders who have been so supportive over these years. And I want to wish you all a happy, healthy and safe remainder of the summer. Thanks for joining us. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you all for your participation.",

            "name": "Karl Slatoff",
            "content": "Thanks, Strauss. I'd like to thank our team for a strong start to the year and their continued dedication to our business. \n We continue to believe that fiscal year 2022 will be a year of investments, as marked by our recent acquisitions of Nordeus and Dynamixyz. We are thrilled to have both teams join our family, and we will continue to evaluate organic and inorganic opportunities to enhance our organization. \n I'll now discuss our recent releases. Rockstar Games continued to provide an array of free content for their vast and growing online communities. In June, Rockstar released 7 new arenas for the fan-favorite Deadline mode for Grand Theft Auto Online. This was followed by the Los Santos Tuners update, the game's major summer launch in July, which delivered an action-packed street racing-themed update into Grand Theft Auto Online. The update introduced elements of the tuner car culture to the game world, including the LS Car Meet, a new, heavily requested shared social space for players to get together to modify their personal vehicles, watch others modify their Tuner vehicles in real time, race and test various vehicles on an underground test track and much more. \n In addition, the Los Santos Tuners update features 6 epic new robbery contracts, 6 new race types, 10 new highly customizable vehicles, collectible USB sticks offering a new way to hear music from Moodymann and Seth Troxler and a host of quality-of-life updates, including a new customizable radio station wheel. \n The launch of the Los Santos Tuners set new records for Grand Theft Auto Online, including the largest number of players and the highest level of net bookings for both day 1 and during the opening week for any update in Grand Theft Auto Online's history. \n Looking ahead, the upcoming launch of the expanded and enhanced versions of Grand Theft Auto Online for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S systems this November will allow for higher top speeds for select vehicles across these more powerful systems. \n In July, Rockstar Games released the Bloody Money (sic) [ Blood Money ] update for Red Dead Online. The update introduced a series of criminal-themed opportunities; complex new missions, including the game's first train robbery; and The Quick Draw Club, a series of 4 distinct, rapid-fire passes featuring criminal-themed unlockable rewards, bonuses and more. Blood Money's success, along with the additional influx of new players thanks to the launch of the stand-alone version of Red Dead Online, led to the highest number of players on day 1 for any update in Red Dead Online history. \n Fiscal 2022 is an exciting year for Take-Two as we embark on our multiyear strategy to deliver a slate of releases more robust than any other time in our company's history. While there has been some movement in our pipeline, including 2 of our immersive core titles shifting to later this fiscal year, we remain highly optimistic about our plans, including the introduction of several new franchises. \n I'll now discuss details on our upcoming announced offerings for this year. On August 13, Private Division will launch Hades on physical disc for PlayStation and Xbox consoles. Developed by Supergiant Games, Hades is a rouge-like dungeon crawler in which players seek freedom by battling their way through the treacherous Underworld of Greek myth. The physical retail edition will come with additional items for collectors, including a compendium booklet featuring the art of the game and a code to download its soundtrack. We are excited to launch Hades, which previously won over 50 Game of the Year awards and earned impressive aggregate scores of 93 and 94 on Metacritic and OpenCritic, respectively. \n In addition, during the second quarter, Private Division will launch Murder on Eridanos, the second add-on content offering for The Outer Worlds for the Nintendo Switch. \n On September 10, 2K and Visual Concepts will once again set the standard for basketball simulations as they have done for the past 20 years with the launch of NBA 2K22 for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch and PC. Featuring best-in-class visual presentation and player AI, historic teams and a wide variety of hoops experiences, NBA 2K22 will place the entire basketball universe in the player's hands. \n Global phenomenon and 2-time NBA All-Star, Luka Doncic, will grace the cover of the Standard Edition and Cross-Gen Digital Bundle, while NBA legends Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Dirk Nowitzki and Kevin Durant will be featured on the premium NBA 75th Anniversary Edition. \n In North America, players can purchase a special version of the Standard Edition featuring 6-time WNBA All-Star and WNBA Champion, Candace Parker, on the cover, available exclusively through GameStop and EB Games. Parker's appearance is a milestone for the NBA 2K series, marking the first female cover athlete in the history of the franchise. \n In Japan, players can also purchase a special version of the Standard Edition that will feature Washington Wizards Rui Hachimura, a rising star who was the first Japanese player to not only be drafted in the first round in 2019, but also to reach the NBA Playoffs. \n The NBA 75th Anniversary Edition and Cross-Gen Digital Bundle will feature cover artwork painted by renowned Atlanta-based artist, Charly Palmer, whose Civil Rights series appeared on the cover of TIME Magazine in July 2020. \n This fall, Private Division will introduce Kerbal Space Program Enhanced Edition for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S. The title will benefit from multiple hardware advancements, which will provide upgraded resolution, increased frame rate, advanced shaders, better textures and additional performance improvements. Players who already own Kerbal Space Program Enhanced Edition for Gen 8 consoles will be eligible for a free upgrade to the new version of the game upon its release. \n On November 11, Rockstar Games will launch the expanded and enhanced version of Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online - Standalone for Gen 9 consoles. Rockstar Games will have more details to share about these eagerly anticipated launches in the coming months. \n This winter, Private Division will release Roll 7's OlliOlli World digitally for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Nintendo Switch and PC. The title has received outstanding initial feedback from early media impressions, including praise for its bold new direction, unique art style, standout soundtrack and improve game play mechanics. \n During the fourth quarter, 2K and Gearbox Software will launch an exciting new franchise. Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is an epic adventure full of whimsy, wonder and high-powered weaponry set in an unpredictable fantasy world where magic, broadswords and bullets collide. It is an entirely new game and a full stand-alone experience with a rich, story-driven co-op campaign for up to 4 players as well as repeatable end-game content. In addition, later this month, 2K will unveil details of another exciting new franchise planned for launch during this fiscal year. \n During fiscal 2020 -- '22, WWE 2K22 will mark the rebirth of our popular wrestling series. We are very excited about the team's fresh approach to the franchise, including an array of enhancements and new features. 2K and Visual Concepts have shared a series of behind the scenes videos of their work on WWE 2K22, including entrance and move animations as well as motion capture and facial scanning with much more to come.  \n Turning to mobile. We are pleased to expand our offerings, especially given the strong momentum in this market segment. Players can look forward to new releases this year, which our teams will have more to share about in the coming months. In addition, our labels continue to invest in technology and new games that they plan to deliver during the next few years.  \n Turning to eSports. The NBA 2K League kicked off its fourth season on May 19 that will include on September 4 -- that will conclude on September 4, with the league finals delivered by Door Dash. This season, games have been airing live on the League's Twitch and YouTube channels and are also available on eGG Network in Southeast Asia, ESRevolution, Loco in India, Sport1 in Europe and Dash Radio. The League continues to grow its audience with more than 2 million followers on its social media platforms and nearly 470 million video views.  \n We are excited about the League's recent announcement that its 2021 playoffs will take place at the Mavs Gaming Hub in Dallas, marking the first time that in-person games will be offered since the 2019 NBA 2K League Finals in New York City. Looking ahead, we believe that the NBA 2K League has the long-term potential to enhance engagement and to be a driver of profits for our company. \n In closing, we are optimistic about the multiyear growth trajectory ahead of us. We are positioning our business for growth and enhancing our enterprise by investing in talent and infrastructure. With our robust pipeline of titles and content updates, we are confident that we can establish new record levels of operating performance over the next several years. \n I'll now turn the call over to Lainie. Matt, so in terms of the stabilization of media consumption patterns, really, what we're seeing is we can just see it in the numbers. Obviously, we don't have the same kind of wind in our backs as we did during the pandemic itself. But now that the pandemic is hopefully over, certainly, people are getting back to normal. We're experiencing what we expected, but we're also seeing instances like, for example, when the new movies came out for GTA Online, we're seeing record engagement. So that in itself shows you that the sort of the moderation that we've seen is really coming to an end because people are engaging when the content is released, and they're engaging in a very significant way. So that gives us a lot of confidence that we may be past the, I guess, you call them headwinds of losing the tailwinds of the pandemic, and we moved on to where the titles are behaving as we would expect in a more normalized environment. So we can see it in the numbers themselves. \n In terms of centralizing the studios and mobile under 1 umbrella, we do expect that there will be synergies across the organizations. Each of these studios has got something to bring in terms of expertise, whether it's data analytics, whether it's different ways to create content. There are a lot of things that they can learn from each other, and bringing them together under 1 management umbrella really gives us the ability -- not to mention also consumer data, really gives us the ability to pursue best practices across the entire organization. So yes, we do expect there to be synergies based on this reorganization. And in terms of Hades, look, I mean in a lot of ways, this is one of the ideal projects for Private Division. I mean we founded the Division based on our effort to hook up with some of the best independent developers in the world. And I would certainly categorize Supergiant as one of those. Hades obviously has had its significant critical and commercial success to date with the digital release. And we're really excited to be part of it on the physical side. \n And we think there's a significant market for that title that has just started. They have sold a good number of copies, but there's a lot of upside for us. So we're thrilled to be in business with Supergiant. We think there's a great amount of upside for us, and we're looking forward to the release."

            "name": "Lainie Goldstein",
            "content": "Thanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our first quarter results and then review our financial outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year 2022. Please note that additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release. \n As Strauss mentioned, fiscal 2022 is off to a strong start with our first quarter operating results exceeding our expectations. Net bookings were $711 million, which was above our guidance of $625 million to $675 million and marked our second highest Q1 on record. Our outperformance was primarily driven by Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online and Borderlands 3. \n During the period, overall engagement exceeded our expectations. Recurrent consumer spending declined 25% as compared to our outlook of a 30% decline and accounted for 69% of total net bookings. Our outperformance was primarily driven by Grand Theft Auto Online as well as the addition of Nordeus. \n Digitally delivered net bookings declined 26% as compared to our outlook of a 30% decline and accounted for 96% of the total. This result was better than our outlook primarily due to the outperformance of recurrent consumer spending. During the quarter, 73% of console game sales were delivered digitally, up from 71% last year. \n GAAP net revenue declined 2% to $813 million, while cost of goods sold decreased 31% to $330 million. Operating expenses increased by 15% to $313 million, primarily driven by higher personnel and stock compensation expenses as well as the addition of Playdots and Nordeus. And GAAP net income was $152 million or $1.30 per share as compared to $89 million or $0.77 per share in the first quarter last year. We ended the quarter with over $2.5 billion of cash and short-term investments. \n Turning to our guidance, I'll begin with our full fiscal year expectation. As Strauss mentioned, we are reiterating our net bookings outlook range of $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion. While our first quarter results outperformed our expectations and our acquisition of Nordeus will benefit the year, this is being offset by some changes to our release schedule, including moving 2 of our immersive core titles to later in fiscal 2022 than our prior guidance had contemplated. We continue to be very excited about our pipeline and the next phase of growth that it presents for our company. \n The largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online as well as some of our new releases that are yet to be announced. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 55% 2K, 35% Rockstar Games and 10% Private Division and T2 Mobile Games. \n We forecast a geographic net bookings split to be about 60% United States and 40% international. As a result of our outperformance in Q1 as well as the addition of Nordeus, we now expect recurrent consumer spending to decline by 9% compared to our prior outlook of a 15% decline versus fiscal 2021. As a percentage of net bookings, recurrent consumer spending is expected to be relatively flat versus last year and represent 65% of total net bookings. \n We now project digitally delivered net bookings to decrease by approximately 6% as compared to our prior outlook of an 8% decline. As a percentage of our business, digital is projected to represent 90%, slightly above 89% last year. Our forecast assumes that 74% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 64% last year. \n We expect to generate more than $400 million in non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow, and we plan to deploy approximately $170 million for capital expenditures. The increase over our prior guidance relates to the acquisition of 2 office buildings in the U.K. to support our business in the region. We continue to expect GAAP net revenue to range from $3.14 billion to $3.24 billion while we now expect cost of goods sold to range from $1.4 billion to $1.44 billion. \n Total operating expenses are expected to range from $1.48 billion to $1.5 billion, representing at the midpoint a 23% increase over the prior year. This increase reflects significant investments in marketing, personnel, stock compensation and IT expenses to bring our expansive multiyear pipeline to market as well as incremental expenses due to the addition of Nordeus and a full year of Playdots. \n And we expect GAAP net income to range from $229 million to $259 million or $1.95 to $2.20 per share. For management reporting purposes, we expect our tax rate to be 16% throughout fiscal 2022. \n Now moving to our guidance for the fiscal second quarter. We project net bookings to range from $815 million to $865 million compared to $958 million in the second quarter last year. Our guidance reflects the continued challenging comparisons from last year due to COVID-19. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Dragon City, Top Eleven and Two Dots. We project recurrent consumer spending to decline by approximately 11% and digitally delivered net bookings to decline by approximately 5%. Our forecast assumes that 64% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 57% last year. \n We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $740 million to $790 million and cost of goods sold to range from $323 million to $349 million. Operating expenses are expected to range from $368 million to $378 million. At the midpoint, this represents a 27% increase over last year, driven primarily by higher marketing, personnel, IT and research and development costs as well as the inclusion of Playdots and Nordeus. And GAAP net income is expected to range from $41 million to $53 million or $0.35 to $0.45 per share. \n In closing, our first quarter results demonstrate the health of our business and the incredible execution from our talented colleagues across the world. As we capitalize on our industry's strong talent, combined with our unique business drivers, we believe that our company will deliver significant long-term growth and margin expansion for our shareholders. \n Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Strauss. So Mario, it's definitely in line with what our expectations were. It's a little bit better. We saw better performance in GTA Online than we expected. We also have the addition of Nordeus, which also helped our recurrent consumer spending in the quarter. So we definitely are seeing the engagement in line with what we had expected. So there really isn't any change than what we had guided to from the beginning of the year. So for GTA Online in Q2, our expectations are for it to be up in the quarter due to the update that is just released. We didn't have an update last year. It's a difficult comp because of COVID, but since we had this update, we expect it to be up versus last year. And for Red Dead Online, since it's a difficult comp, we expect it to be slightly up, but -- due to the update, but not as up as GTA Online versus last year. So the increase on the marketing hasn't really changed. There's a little bit of timing change from Q1 into the rest of the year. And there's a little bit of shift out of the year into next year, but that's being offset by some additional costs due to the acquisition of Nordeus into the year. So there is a little bit of an increase of the overall operating expense in the year versus previous guidance. So it's a reduction of a little bit of marketing, offset by the Nordeus expense. \n And in terms of the return on marketing spend, I wouldn't say there's better or worse. I would say that we're a little bit more targeted on how we're spending our marketing. So I'd say we were getting a better return because we're able to really see how we're spending the marketing in a better way with better analytics over the last few years. But the spend continues to be a strong spend in order to do the best marketing for our titles, especially also with the mobile titles as well. It wouldn't be marketed as a brand-new game. There certainly is marketing around the game, but it wouldn't be as if it's a brand-new release of a GTA property. Yes. Nordeus is an accretive acquisition for us. Drew, for GTA Online, our expectations for the full year is for it to moderate. So for the full year, we expect moderation of the trends that benefited us from the industry last year due to COVID and the sheltering at home. So Q1 was down versus last year. [ We've now ] beat our expectations. And Q2 is going to be up because of the update, which is doing really well. So we do expect Q3 and Q4 right now to be down. But GTA Online always surprises us. So it's still early in the year, so we'll see what happens. But right now, we do have our expectations as it being moderating for the year."

            "name": "Strauss Zelnick",
            "content": "Thanks, Nicole. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. \n I'm pleased to report that fiscal year 2022 is off to a great start, highlighted by first quarter net bookings of $711 million, which exceeded our expectations. As the world has moved toward a safer, new normal, we experienced strong engagement trends across most of our core franchises. \n During the period, we took multiple steps to enhance our organization over the long term. We invested further in talent and core infrastructure, which are important areas to support our expansive multiyear pipeline. Mobile remains a key growth opportunity, and we believe that our acquisition of Nordeus will enhance meaningfully our talents and expertise in this area. With a larger mobile footprint, we've integrated Socialpoint, Playdots and Nordeus into T2 Mobile Games. This structure will enable us to realize cost synergies, leverage expertise and share best practices across our mobile teams. I'm also proud that we deepened our focus on corporate responsibility, and we've recently made several key hires to lead our efforts regarding diversity, equity and inclusion. \n Turning to our first quarter results. Our better-than-expected performance was primarily driven by Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, and Borderlands 3. For nearly 8 years, Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online have redefined the creative and cultural influence of interactive entertainment, setting new standards for multiple generations of consumers and gaming platforms. Sales of Grand Theft Auto V were significantly above our expectations once again, and the title has now sold in more than 150 million units. \n Rockstar Games continued to keep its massive player base engaged with new content updates for Grand Theft Auto Online, including 8 new stunt races, 7 new arenas for Deadline mode and regular in-game bonuses and incentives. This helped drive the title to its second highest first quarter on record for player audience in its third consecutive quarter of player growth. In comparison to the first quarter of fiscal 2020, Grand Theft Auto Online achieved a 72% increase in its audience size, a 77% increase in new players and significant growth in recurring consumer spending. \n In addition, Rockstar Games continued to captivate and engage audiences with Red Dead Redemption 2, which exceeded our expectations and has now sold in more than 38 million units. Red Dead Online also enjoyed a strong quarter, thanks to new content offerings, including 8 new horse races and a creative array of bonuses and incentives. The game experienced strong performance as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2020, including 18% growth in its audience size, 26% growth in new players and outstanding growth in recurrent consumer spending. This performance was driven by both strong ongoing game sales and the continued influx of new players from the stand-alone version of Red Dead Online. \n Turning to our sports offerings. NBA 2K21 has sold in over 11 million units and remains the #1 sports title in the U.S. NBA 2K's community continues to be highly engaged with more than 2.7 million users playing daily. As compared to last year, the game experienced 13% growth in first-time spenders and nearly 30% growth in returning players. We see a significant opportunity to grow the franchise further over the next few years as we provide unique and innovative experiences throughout the game. \n PGA TOUR 2K21 continues to exceed our expectations and expand its audience. In June, 2K and HB Studios launched a community-driven program that allows the top golf course designers from around the world to create and submit ideas for inclusion in the game's online playlist. This program is enhancing the game's vast replayability while also driving player engagement and growing its global community. \n Borderlands 3 had a strong quarter. During the period, 2K and Gearbox Software released the Director's Cut add-on, providing new missions, characters, daily and weekly challenges and unique rewards. The game was also supported with an array of new free content offerings that gave players more ways to perfect and expand their arsenals. \n 2K and Firaxis Games launched Sid Meier's Civilization VI Anthology on Windows PC, providing the ultimate package for players that have yet to experience the award-winning, critically-acclaimed strategy title. The Anthology includes the base game, all previously released DLC, the Rise and Fall and Gathering Storm expansions as well as the popular New Frontier Pass. Civilization VI has sold in more than 11 million units, outperforming its predecessor at the same point in its life cycle. Later this year, 2K and Firaxis Games will celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Civilization franchise, and I'd like to congratulate our teams on this incredible milestone. \n Kerbal Space Program, which has sold in over 5 million units, celebrated its 10-year anniversary in June. To mark the milestone, Private Division released a short documentary video detailing the achievements of the title as well as its impact on the aerospace industry. \n One of our key strategic priorities is to provide new and innovative ways for audiences to stay engaged with our titles and the communities built around them after their initial launch. During the first quarter, recurrent consumer spending declined 25%, which was better than our expectations of a 30% decline and accounted for 69% of net bookings. \n Overall, all evidence suggests that media consumption patterns are beginning to stabilize to a new normal. And while down from the highs of the previous year, recurrent consumer spending in our products has leveled off and remained significantly higher than the first quarter of fiscal 2020. \n The largest contributors to recurrent consumer spending in the period were NBA 2K and Grand Theft Auto Online. We also experienced strong performance across many of our free-to-play offerings. \n Monster Legends and Dragon City exceeded our expectations with sequential top line growth compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. This performance was driven by strong live ops, successful feature releases and significant marketing investments. \n Two Dots celebrated its seventh anniversary in June. The title performed well with positive momentum continuing from the second half of fiscal 2021. \n WWE SuperCard has now been downloaded over 24 million times and remains 2K's highest-grossing mobile title. The franchise has had strong performance with the last 12 months marking its sixth consecutive year of growth. \n Following our acquisition of Nordeus, we're encouraged by the performance of and the potential for Top Eleven, including its use of seasonal live ops and new features. \n NBA 2K Online in China outperformed our expectations. The title remains the #1 online PC sports game in the region with nearly 54 million registered users. \n Turning to our outlook. We're reiterating our prior guidance of $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion in net bookings for fiscal 2022. As we continue to develop our pipeline, there has been movement in some of our planned releases, including 2 of our immersive core titles shifting to later in fiscal 2022 than our prior guidance had contemplated. Our approach has always been to allow our labels to determine when projects are ready to bring to market to ensure the best quality and overall experience for players. \n As Karl will discuss in greater detail, we're excited about our pipeline and the impact of our new releases will have on our business and financial profile in the years to come. We believe that we'll achieve sequential growth in fiscal 2023 and establish new record levels of operating results over the next few years. \n Looking ahead, we remain highly optimistic about the future of the interactive entertainment sector and our competitive positioning. As we leverage our many advantages, our leading talent, focus on creativity, incredible portfolio of owned IP and strong balance sheet, we believe that Take-Two is well positioned to drive long-term growth and shareholder value. \n I'll now turn the call over to Karl. Thanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for delivering a strong start to the year. And to our shareholders, I'd like to express our appreciation for your continued support. We'll now be happy to take your questions. Operator? Thanks for the question. Look, our most important asset here is our people because they create everything that we're able to bring to consumers. We're an asset-light business. We are a business of intellectual property. And our strategy, our stated strategy has always been to be the most creative, the most innovative and the most efficient company in the business. \n Diversity is key to our success. We need to have a diverse perspective and diverse voices in order to create that quality. So it starts at the top. Our Board of Directors is diverse with respect to gender, race and skill set. Our management team is exceedingly diverse from a gender perspective. And our voices as a result are diverse. \n But we're not stopping there. We're also reaching into the community to create a broader, more diverse pool from which we can recruit and our competitors can recruit going forward. So we work together in company-sponsored service projects and the communities in which we operate. We encourage individual volunteerism and giving through philanthropic and matching donation programs. We support organizations that are focused on enhancing diversity. We increased the Canada pool through scholarships to design students, contributions to organizations providing STEM opportunities to children in underserved communities. And delivering interview training and career counseling to young adults. And this crosses genders. But in many instances, we're also focused on young females as well. \n So we're trying to do the right thing from the top of the company at the Board level to the management team, to even creating a pool from which we can recruit a long time into the future. And even so, I'm sure there's much more that we can do. Thanks, Mike. In terms of our expectations about any upcoming release, apart from what we've given guidance, I don't tend to give any more color than that. Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online have been out now for some 8 years, and the performance has consistently been vastly better than our expectations. I have no doubt that the enhanced edition will delight consumers. I have no doubt that it will be absolutely extraordinary. How it will perform? Hard to say. This is now the third generation in which the title has existed. I'm an optimist, and I find that you never want to bet against Rockstar Games. So I'm looking forward to the release. And Lainie will take the second question. Thanks, Matthew. We don't have any other expectations of delays. So we've got -- we've mentioned what we have as we always do. In terms of how things are trending post pandemic, if you call this post pandemic, and I hope we can, it remains to be seen, the trend is almost exactly what we anticipated and what we've talked about now for over a year, which is we expected postpandemic demand to be higher than prepandemic demand and lower than the demand during the pandemic, which stands to reason because people have, in many ways, returned to normal in most of the world. That remains to be seen. As to what will come in the future, I'm hopeful that, that will continue. \n But clearly, there's been a systemic shift in favor of interactive entertainment. It's now the #1 entertainment vertical. It's something like $180 billion market. It's a diverse market in terms of gender. It's a diverse market in terms of age. So we couldn't be more optimistic about the market than we are. \n And in terms of IDFA, it's still early days. It remains to be seen. We have not seen any negative impact on our business. And I think that's really because we're big enough that we have lots of access to data. We have a consolidated consumer database across all of our labels, which is very robust. And if you have enough of your own data and you have solid data analytics teams, which we have both at the corporate level and at the label level, then a great deal of the information can be found in other ways. And you can do appropriate marketing that protects consumers' privacy without the resources that we had before from Apple. So we're in a good place so far with regard to that change, but it is still early. Thanks for the question. Look, let's just pause at the -- inclusion, diversity and common decency is of paramount importance to everyone here and specifically highly important to me and has been for the 14 years that we've been around. This is nothing new for us. The culture of the company is well-known and well-known internally and reasonably well-known externally. All that said, we can always do better. And I think we're known to be people who always want to be doing better and never want to rest on our laurels. \n We don't think that fostering an appropriate environment is a single set of actions or reflects  1 day in a new cycle. We think it's a constant process of introspection and improvement. There are always ways that we and the industry can do better. We'll listen to our colleagues, and we'll work on this area over time. \n But I want to be very specific because you asked the question about what we do around here and what we've always done. The first is, and I'll say it in as black and white a way as I can, we will not tolerate harassment or discrimination or bad behavior of any kind. We never have. We set those expectations when people come on board here through our code of conduct and our anti-harassment and antidiscrimination policies, all of which our colleagues are required to review and sign when they're hired. All of our colleagues take anti-harassment training at hire and biannually after that. And we make it clear through the training and through our policy that if anyone does experience any inappropriate contact, there are multiple avenues to report that, and they'll never be retaliated against for doing so. Those options include the management chain, anyone in HR, an anonymous complaint by phone or online through our third-party hotline and website reporting tools. \n Take-Two has a director of diversity and inclusion, and that [indiscernible] includes developing, executing and leading a global DE&I strategy, and that supports our business objectives. We also have multiple employee resource groups inside the company, and we have more growing all the time, which gives us all a thrill. So that's what we're up to very specifically. Again, is there more that we could do? I'm certain there is. Do we feel like we're in a pretty good place? We're grateful that we do feel that way right now. \n In terms of retention, our turnover rate is roughly half of the industries. That's been true for about the past 18 months. There have been times when it's been about 70% of industry levels. It's been trending down at a time when I think, in general, turnover is trending up. So we feel good about that. And that's another measure of how we're doing, so we focus on it. I'm not sure I entirely follow your question. The development cycles for our core immersive releases are still significant. It takes some time to make what we hope will be the best titles in the business. And development cycles are not getting shorter for core immersive releases, and I wouldn't necessarily expect them to. \n I think what's changed is that in between big releases, we continue to engage consumers with add-on content and with opportunities to engage in online versions of the game in certain instances and multiplayer opportunities as well. So that's what created recurrent consumer spending. But much more importantly, recurrent consumer spending reflects consumer activity and engagement. But that doesn't really change development cycles. So did I miss your question in some way? We needed more time to polish them and make sure that they're the best titles they possibly can be. No, our team has been incredibly productive throughout the pandemic. And even though we have a lot of work going on at home, productivity is high. It's a great market for us. We have the #1 PC online sports title in China with 54 million registered users. NBA 2K Online continues to grow in China. We also have console titles for China, and we have titles that are being approved. We have great relationships in China with Tencent and others. And so we think there's plenty of upside going forward. We haven't seen any change in the market yet, and valuations remain frothy, I think, because of the growth of the sector and enthusiasm around the sector. However, our discipline has really paid off in the past 14 years. Knock wood, we haven't made a failed acquisition. Our acquisitions are accretive, usually right away. Sometimes it could take a little bit of time. But we're happy that we've done every deal that we've done. We did miss out on a few that we wish we had done, but frankly, not all that many. \n I think you raised a good point, which is over time, will it be harder for smaller companies to compete in the space? And I think that will be true. The answer will be yes with regard to both mobile and console. The resources required are significant. The risk profile is significant. And the history of the entertainment business is that over time, those that are very creative become very successful. Those that are very successful become bigger. Those that are bigger have the opportunity to acquire smaller enterprises. And as long as the focus remains on creativity, innovation and efficiency and as long as the culture that has made the company successful in the first place is maintained, there's an opportunity for continued success even with scale. And that's certainly how we see ourselves and how we envision our future. Yes. Our views remain unchanged. We think that a subscription model can make sense for deep catalog titles, but it doesn't really make sense for frontline titles. And for any business model that makes sense in the entertainment business, it has to work for the creators of the entertainment as well as the consumers of the entertainment. And I think catalog can make sense for the publishers. It can make sense for consumers who are avid, who really want access to a lot of product. \n But if you're getting into frontline product, then the economics are much more difficult to make sense of. And remember, consumers who are involved with interactive entertainment have different consumption patterns than those involved with linear entertainment. Linear entertainment consumers consume something like 150 hours of programming a month. That's probably well over 100 different titles. In the case of interactive entertainment, consumers are consuming something like 45 hours a month, and that may be 1, 2, 3, 4 titles, but it's certainly not 100 titles. \n So from a consumer point of view, it's not clear that a subscription model really makes sense for the bulk of consumers. That remains to be seen. We're open-minded. We have made catalog titles available for subscription services. Very occasionally, we've made frontline titles available as well. But we do see this more as a catalog offering than a frontline offering. It's been good news. We've added players. It's been good for the main game. It's been good for Red Dead Online. I think the timing was excellent. Again, I think you can do almost anything from a marketing point of view if you're mindful of creating appropriate marketing windows. It's a mix. People are back at work in China, for example, and other parts of the globe. We have some people back at work at offices in the U.S. as well. We are very mindful of what's going on. Our colleague's safety and health comes first. And thankfully, everyone's highly productive wherever they are. In terms of takedowns, we're pretty flexible, frankly. That said, if the economy is threatened or if there's bad behavior, and we know how to define that, then we would issue a takedown notice. I'm sorry, what was your second question, Mike? And the opportunity with regard to what, just so I understand your question. I'm not sure how to answer it. And so I'm going to be judicious and probably not going to answer it. I will note that we were in business many years ago with the NCAA, and we know longer are. And we're always looking for opportunities to grow our business and our sports business. It's awfully hard to measure something like that, but demand for NBA 2K has been very strong this year. We've had a great year. We've sold in over 11 million units. And certainly, ongoing demand for Grand Theft Auto V has been huge. We've sold in over 150 million units. So I'm not sure we've seen -- I'm not sure we could measure it in any case. I don't know -- we have to do tailored research and it still wouldn't tell us anything that we could do differently. But I remain of the view that the enhanced edition of Grand Theft Auto V will be highly appealing to consumers with next-gen platforms or now current-gen platforms. But that remains to be seen. We know that demand for consoles remains high. That's not in doubt. We're hopeful that supply will be enhanced by year-end, and it will be in a good place. But most importantly, the demand is there. And in terms of the pipeline, yes, we said we expected sequential growth in fiscal '23, and we expect to set new operating records in the coming years. And we still have both of those expectations. Thank you so much for joining us today. I want to, as always, emphatically thank all of our colleagues all around the world who delivered these great results. And it has been a challenging time to deliver the results. And our team shows up and does their best work every day, and work continues to pay off. We're so grateful. We're also grateful to our shareholders who have been so supportive over these years. And I want to wish you all a happy, healthy and safe remainder of the summer. Thanks for joining us."

I'm pleased to report that we concluded fiscal 2023 by delivering strong fourth quarter results, including net bookings of $1.4 billion, which were above the high end of our expectations. On behalf of our management team, I'd like to thank all of our colleagues around the world for helping us achieve these results and supporting our vision to become a more scaled, diverse industry-leading organization especially as we navigate an oftentimes volatile and uncertain economic landscape. With fiscal 2024 underway, our initial expectation is to deliver full year net bookings in the range of $5.45 billion to $5.55 billion. We're assuming a continuation of the current challenging consumer backdrop within our forecast. Additionally, the development timelines of some of our titles lengthened especially as we strive to redefine the creative standards of excellence of our industry, which affect our release slate for the year. Looking ahead, fiscal 2025 is a highly anticipated year for our company. For the last several years, we've been preparing our business to release an incredibly robust pipeline of projects that we believe will take our company to even greater levels of success. In fiscal 2025, we expect to enter this new era by launching several groundbreaking titles that we believe will set new standards in our industry and enable us to achieve over $8 billion in net bookings and over $1 billion in adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow. We expect to sustain this momentum by delivering even higher levels of operating results in fiscal 2026 and beyond. I'd now like to discuss several key highlights from fiscal 2023, which was a milestone year in the 30-year history of our organization. We delivered net bookings of $5.3 billion, which reflects both the transformative evolution of our company through our combination with Zynga, and our ability to create market and distribute the highest quality entertainment experiences. We made excellent progress integrating Zynga. The combination has been highly accretive to our business as we've embarked on new revenue-driven opportunities, exceeded our anticipated cost synergies for year one and enhance further our mobile platform through select acquisitions. As we approach the one-year anniversary of our combination, we're immensely proud of the trajectory of our integration and the strength of our shared culture and values. Our headcount now stands at nearly 12,000 talented individuals, including approximately 9,000 developers in our studios throughout the world, which positions us exceedingly well to reach the full potential of our pipeline. And we've maintained our focus on our core tenet of efficiency. We've taken a rigorous approach to our cost reduction program announced in February, which we believe will surpass meaningfully the $50 million in annual savings that we originally anticipated. Our fourth quarter outperformance was led by strong results from Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Online, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Zynga's mobile portfolio. Broadly speaking, the macroeconomic environment remained relatively consistent with what we experienced throughout the third quarter holiday season, while consumers continue to exercise restraint with their purchasing behaviors they prioritized blockbuster franchises and titles that offered great value. As a result, our vast catalog of proven high-quality titles achieved strong results. As part of our ongoing portfolio management measures, we made the decision to cancel several unannounced titles in development, which we believe will enable us to tighten our focus and reallocate resources to projects for which our creative teams have higher levels of conviction expectations of success. Excluding the associated write-offs, our fourth quarter and full year management earnings results were above the high-end of our guidance. We manage our pipeline actively, sometimes making difficult decisions to ensure that we're meeting our creative standards and achieving financial returns that are consistent with the goals of our company. We believe that an evolving robust pipeline is an essential part of our long-term strategy to expand, enhance and diversify our portfolio to grow our player base and to launch a multitude of new hit franchises across an array of platforms and business models. Turning to the performance of our titles for the period. Grand Theft Auto V exceeded our expectations, and to-date, the title has sold in more than 180 million units worldwide. As hardware supply constraints receded, Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online adoption on the latest generation of platforms continued to grow. For the first 3 weeks of Grand Theft Auto Online's Holiday update, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles grew to 14% of its audience penetration and 25% of its revenue penetration, up from 11% and 20%, respectively, versus last summer's content update for the comparable period. During the period, Rockstar Games continue to support the passionate global Grand Theft Auto online community with an array of new content offerings, including The Last Dose an epic finale of the Los Santos Drug Wars update as well as the roving Gun Van, Taxi Work Missions, a new 50 Car Garage, new vehicles, clothes, weapons, modes and much more. Los Santos Drug Wars introduced a phased approach to delivering high-value content, creating a much longer tail of sustained engagement in net bookings than we've seen with previous content updates. Additionally, GTA plus Rockstar's premium membership program continues to perform well, driven by a positive response to monthly events since the launch of Los Santos Drug Wars. Red Dead Redemption 2 outperformed our plans and to date, the title has sold in more than 53 million units worldwide. We're also pleased with the continued engagement of players with Red Dead Online as demonstrated by its 10% year-on-year increase in new online players on all platforms. NBA 2K23 continues to grow its audience with the title selling in over 11 million units to date, a record for the series at this stage and achieving its highest ever virtual currency sales. In addition, engagement with NBA 2K23 remained incredibly strong, with approximately 2.3 million daily active users, including growth in The City, MyCAREER and MyTeam users. NBA 2K23 arcade addition continues to bring the best basketball experience to mobile devices and has maintained its number one position on Apple arcade. Building upon Visual Concepts\u2019 resounding success and reinvigorating our WWE franchise last year, WWE 2K23 enjoys the highest metacritic review score average in the history of the series. Engagement with the game has been outstanding, players logging nearly 8 million hours of gameplay and facing off of more than 100 million matches. 2K is supporting the title with a series of add-on content that can be purchased individually or as part of the season pass. We value deeply our relationship with the WWE and look forward to continuing and expanding upon our successful partnership in the years to come. Private Division and Intercept Games launched Kerbal Space Program 2 in early access for PC on Steam, Epic Games Store and other storefronts. Our teams are encouraged by the incoming player feedback, and we've already implemented several updates with more on the way as development continues. Last week, Private Division announced a partnership with Game Freak to publish their upcoming new action-adventure IP, which is one of Private Division's most ambitious projects to date. In addition, Private Division and the Roll7 studio were recently honored with 2 prestigious industry awards, the BAFTA for Best British game for Rollerdrome and Best Sports Game at DICE for OlliOlli World. Zynga's mobile business had a strong finish to the year. In-app purchases were above our expectations. Momentum has continued and we were pleased to experience strong demand over the Easter holiday. Efforts to increase our advertising business are tracking well with ad revenue growing quarter-over-quarter and accounting for approximately 27% of Zynga's net bookings. Our teams are successfully increasing advertising supply in our games, investing in optimization and implementing new ad products, which are helping us monetize a much broader cohort of users. Our direct-to-consumer efforts are tracking well with numerous titles currently in our platforms and plans for nearly all mobile games across our labels to leverage our highly profitable proprietary distribution channel over the next few years. A few highlights of Zynga's offerings during the period include Empires and Puzzles, Zynga's highest grossing title drove engagement through its new in-game event, Season of Love. Zynga's social casino portfolio had its best quarter in nearly two years, driven by record performance from Game of Thrones Slots Casino and strong overall results from Zynga Poker, Hit it Rich! and Wizard of Oz Slots. Top Eleven had a robust quarter and launched its Proving Ground: England mini game update in February, which challenged players to recreate the greatest moments in the English football history. The new Race Pass from CSR Racing 2 continued to drive player engagement, retention and monetization with innovative new profile banners for players to collect.  We remain quite pleased with our hyper casual mobile business. Popcore achieved strong results during its first full quarter under our ownership. Additionally, Rollic has increased its profitability and the studio celebrated several milestones during the period, including the first anniversary of its hit title Fill the Fridge!, and social media inspired Pressure Washing Run, reaching the number one most downloaded spot in Apple's U.S. App Store. In closing, as we continue to pursue our mission to be the most creative, the most innovative and the most efficient entertainment company in the world, we do so incredibly well positioned with a broader portfolio of owned intellectual property, a deeper pool of the industry's top creative talent, and the sound infrastructure to capitalize on the vast opportunities on the horizon. As we execute on our strategy, we believe that we can increase meaningfully our scale and prominence within the industry, grow margins and achieve record-breaking operating results for fiscal 2025 and beyond. I'll now turn the call over to Karl.\nKarl Slatoff: Thanks, Strauss. I'd like to thank our colleagues around the world for delivering another momentous year for Take-Two. Our integration with Zynga has gone incredibly well, and we continue to release many of the industry's highest quality, most engaging entertainment experiences, thanks to the incredible passion and talent of our teams. We are extremely excited about our release pipeline, which includes approximately 52 titles through fiscal 2026. Our revised plan reflects several title cancellations as well as the reclassification of our mobile games to include only those titles currently in our plans for worldwide launch. For fiscal 2024, our pipeline includes 16 planned releases. We expect to deliver 3 immersive core offerings. This includes NBA 2K24 and WWE 2K24, our genre defining sports titles developed by Visual Concepts. Additionally, we expect to release an eagerly anticipated new IP from one of our premier studios later this fiscal year. We plan to release 2 mid-core arcade titles, which includes LEGO 2K Drive, the ultimate driving adventure game from 2K and Visual Concepts. LEGO 2K Drive brings the iconic LEGO Play experience into a vast open world where players of all ages can build any vehicle, drive anywhere and become a LEGO racing legend. LEGO 2K Drive is the first release in a multi-title partnership between 2K and the LEGO Group. We are confident that 2K's proven expertise in creating high-quality and engaging interactive entertainment properties combined with the LEGO Group's unprecedented cultural reach, will evolve the iconic LEGO games experience that fans love in exciting new ways. We also plan to launch 2 new iterations of previously released titles and 3 independent titles, including private divisions planned May 23 release of After Us from Piccolo Studios. Players of After Us will navigate stunning environments in a surrealistic world to salvage the souls of extinct animals and restore life on Earth. And lastly, we expect to release 6 mobile titles during the year, including Zynga's Star Wars Hunters, which offers players the opportunity to join the greatest hunters from across the Star Wars Galaxy. Players will engage in thrilling third-person combat in a range of competitive game modes across battlegrounds steady both the iconic worlds of Star Wars. Throughout the year, our Hyper-Casual studios will release the steady cadence of mobile titles, focusing on games that have the potential for enhanced retention rates and a mix of in-app purchases and advertising to drive higher modernization and profitability. Our labels will also continue to provide new content and experiences that drive engagement and recurrent consumer spending across many of our hit franchises, including Grand Theft Auto Online, Red Dead Online, WWE 2K, LEGO 2K Drive, PGA TOUR 2K and throughout Zynga's mobile portfolio. Looking ahead, we currently expect to deliver 36 titles throughout fiscal 2025 and 2026. As always, these plans are a snapshot of our current development pipeline. It is likely that some of these titles will not be developed through completion, that launch timing may change and that we will also add new titles to our slate. Our release slate for fiscal 2025 and 2026 includes 14 immersive core releases, 6 of which are sports simulation games, 2 mid-core games, one of which will be sports-oriented, 4 new iterations of previously released titles, 4 independent titles from Private Division, 2 of which include our previously announced partnerships with W\u0113t\u0101 Workshop and Game Freak and 12 mobile games. In addition to our full game releases, we will continue to offer post-launch content for nearly all of our titles, including Virtual Currency, DLC packs and Season Passes. Given the strength of our upcoming release schedule and the high degree of visibility we have into our pipeline, we believe that we'll achieve the record levels of results that Strauss mentioned. Including over $8 billion in net bookings and over $1 billion in adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow in fiscal 2025 with further growth in fiscal 2026 and beyond. As we approach the significant inflection point in our business, we believe our expanding scale and margins will generate industry-leading returns for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Lainie.\nLainie Goldstein: Thanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll discuss the key highlights from our fourth quarter and fiscal 2023 before reviewing our financial outlook for the full year and first quarter of fiscal 2024. Please note that our results include our combination with Zynga, which affects the comparability of our results relative to last year. Additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release. I'm so proud of our team for their strong execution and unwavering focus throughout the year. We made fantastic progress on our integration with Zynga delivered incredible high-quality content and announced several exciting new games from our pipeline. Efficiency was also a major area of focus. We announced our cost reduction program in February, and as part of our ongoing portfolio management process, we canceled several titles that we anticipated would not meet our internal hurdle rates. We are confident that all these steps will help grow our scale, enhance our long-term margin structure and ultimately deliver sustainable returns for our stakeholders. As Strauss mentioned, we finished fiscal 2023 with momentum and delivered fourth quarter net bookings of $1.39 billion, which was above our guidance range of $1.31 billion to $1.36 billion. This reflected better-than-expected results from Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Zynga's mobile portfolio. During the period, recurring consumer spending growth 115%, which was above our outlook of 105% growth and accounted for 78% of net bookings. The outperformance was primarily driven by Zynga and Grand Theft Auto Online. Digitally delivered net bookings increased 76%, above our guidance of 70% growth and accounted for 97% of the total. During the quarter, 78% of console game sales were delivered digitally, up from 75% last year. GAAP net revenue increased 56% to $1.45 billion, and cost of revenue increased 207% to $1.22 billion which included impairment charges of $465 million related to intangible assets acquired from Zynga, reflecting forecast changes for a few titles and $54 million relating to capitalized software and development costs for unreleased and canceled console and PC title, a lot of which was included in our management results. Operating expenses increased by 130% to $926 million, which primarily reflected the addition of Zynga, which is partially offset by lower marketing expenses. And GAAP net loss was $610 million or $3.62 per share, which includes $302 million of amortization of acquired intangibles and $45 million of business acquisition costs. Excluding the $54 million impairment charge, our management earnings would have been above the high end of our guidance range. Turning to our fiscal 2023 results. Total net bookings were $5.28 billion, which was above our guidance of $5.2 billion to $5.25 billion. While the challenging macroeconomic backdrop affected certain components of our portfolio, we experienced favorable performance within our catalog of industry-leading intellectual properties and Zynga had a strong finish to the year. The recurrent consumer spending increased 88%, which was slightly above our outlook of 85% growth and accounted for 78% of net bookings. Digitally delivered net bookings increased 63%, which was also above our guidance of 60% growth and accounted for 95% of the total. And during the year, 74% of our console game sales were delivered digitally up from 68% last year. Non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow was $56 million as compared to our outlook of over $400 million. During fiscal 2023, we spent $204 million on capital expenditures. At fiscal year end, we had cash and short-term investments of approximately $1 billion and debt of $3.1 billion. GAAP net revenue grew 53% to $5.35 billion in cost of revenue income 100% to $3.1 billion, which included impairment charges of $465 million related to intangible assets acquired from Zynga and $79 million related to capitalized software and development costs for unreleased and canceled titles, the latter of which was included in our management results. Operating expenses increased by 131% to $3.45 billion, which primarily reflected the addition of Zynga as well as higher personnel, stock compensation and IT expenses. And GAAP net loss was $1.12 billion or $7.03 per share, which includes $1.04 billion of amortization of acquired intangibles and $270 million of business acquisition costs. Today, we provided our initial outlook for fiscal 2024. We project net bookings to range from $5.45 billion to $5.55 billion. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, and Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, our Hyper-Casual mobile portfolio, Empires & Puzzles, Toon Blast, Words with Friends, Merge Dragons, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online and Zynga Poker. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our label to be roughly 53% Zynga, 31% 2K, 15% Rockstar Games and 1% other. And we forecast our geographic net booking site about 57% in United States and 33% international. We saw recurrent consumer spending to be up approximately 5% compared to fiscal 2023 and represents 79% of net bookings. Our forecast assumes 76% of console game sales will be delivered digitally. We expect to generate approximately $100 million in non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow, and we plan to deploy approximately $180 million for capital expenditures. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $5.37 billion to $5.47 billion and cost of revenue to range from $2.51 billion to $2.54 billion. Our total operating expenses are expected to range from $3.39 billion to $3.41 billion as compared to $3.45 billion last year. At the midpoint, this represents a 1% reduction, reflecting lower acquisition costs, the realization of synergies from our combination with Zynga and savings from our cost reduction program, which are partly offset by a full year of Zynga, higher stock compensation and personnel expenses driven by the annualization of new hires and the effect of inflation on other business operating expenses primarily reflected in IT costs. We expect the GAAP net loss ranging from $477 million to $518 million or $2.80 to $3.05 per share, which assumes a basic share count of 170.1 million shares. For management reporting purposes, we expect our tax rate to be 18% throughout fiscal 2024. I'd like to acknowledge that our current forecast for fiscal 2024 reflects the continuation of the challenging economic environment as well as an extension of the development time lines for several high-profile and long-awaited titles. While this affects our expectations for our current fiscal year, our high degree of visibility into our pipeline gives us confidence that we are approaching a significant inflection point in our business where we will achieve new record levels of results for our business next year and beyond. Now moving on to our guidance for the fiscal first quarter. We project net bookings to range from $1.15 billion to $1.2 billion, which reflects the full quarter of Zynga compared to $1 billion in the first quarter last year. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online, Grand Theft Auto V, a Hyper-Casual mobile portfolio, Empires & Puzzles, Toon Blast, Merge Dragons, Words with Friends, Zynga Poker, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online. We project recurrent consumer spending to increase by 35%. Our forecast assumes that 79% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from slightly from 77% in the same period last year. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $1.21 billion to $1.26 billion and cost of revenue to range from $572 million to $592 million. Operating expenses are expected to range from $827 million to $837 million. At the midpoint, this represents an 18% increase over last year, which reflects the full quarter of Zynga and higher stock compensation, personnel and IT expenses based on the factors I mentioned previously. And GAAP net loss is expected to range from $161 million to $178 million, or $0.95 to $1.05 per share, which assumes a basic share count of 169.4 million shares. The good thing is we believe that we are very well positioned in our industry to deliver the highest quality content, gain market share and enhance our profitability as we grow our scale and maintain our focus on efficiency. We're extremely excited about our next chapter of growth, and we look forward to our label, sharing more detail about the many exciting projects we have underway. Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Strauss.\nStrauss Zelnick: Thank you, Karl, and Lainie, and thank you to all of our colleagues for your dedication, your hard work and these terrific results. We will now take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Uerkwitz with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Uerkwitz: I guess I'll just skip right to fiscal '25 and '26. It's pretty rare that you guys give to your guide like this and we've seen quite a few delays across the industry. Could you just give a little additional color on where the confidence is coming from on being able to provide that to us today?\nStrauss Zelnick: Yes, you're right. It's very uncharacteristic of us to talk about subsequent years at this time. We're doing so because we've been investing in a pipeline for a long time. And we now have a great deal of confidence that, that pipeline will be delivered in the next 3 years, 12 titles in fiscal '24, 36 in the following 2 years, up 44% of that is new intellectual property. The rest is new iterations of existing franchises, and that's mobile, console, PC and numerous business models. We couldn't be more excited, fiscal '24 titles look good and as I said, we're very confident in the years to come as well. And we thought it was important to convey that with transparency today.\nAndrew Uerkwitz: And then just with the, I think, 44% of new IP, when you're looking this far out, can you walk us through a little bit like how you think about modeling those, the conservatism you're thinking about in some of those? Or just kind of how you come up with the forecast for the new IP?\nKarl Slatoff: So as you know, new IP is always a little bit of a wildcard, and it's difficult to predict exactly how it's going to behave. Obviously, we're not completely flying blind because we do have a pretty comprehensive process of doing comps in the market. But you really just never know, which is one of the reasons why when we model out in our product investment review process, new IP, we typically -- actually, we never model out big hits nor its upside. I don't want to necessarily call it a conservative approach, but we don't look at any sort of outlying success. Obviously, everything that we invest in and everything that we release, we're looking to achieve that outlying success, and we know for a fact that not every single one of our titles will achieve that. But that is the game we're in, and that's why we're making these investments in new IP, which ultimately is the lifeblood of our industry, and that's why we're still very much dedicated to doing that.\nOperator: Our next question is from Matthew Thornton with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nMatthew Thornton: Maybe two from me. Strauss has been another 3 months and AI remains a hot topic. I'm sure you and team have had more time to digest and think about it. I'm just kind of curious of your latest thoughts on how you think it will influence the business and the industry. And then just secondly, as we think about the headcount and the infrastructure that we now have in place, are we kind of at a place where you have what you need to pursue this aggressive pipeline? Or do we still need some more investment. I'm just trying to think about the OpEx leverage and how to think about that as we kind of flow through the out years?\nStrauss Zelnick: Yes, as you know, I'm usually a skeptic when others engage in hyperbole. In the case of AI, I'm pretty enthusiastic. First of all, despite the fact that artificial intelligence is an oxymoron as is machine learning. This company has been involved in those activities no matter what words used to describe them for its entire history, and we're a leader in the space. So while the most recent developments in AI are surprising and exciting to many they are exciting to us, but not at all surprising. Our view is that AI will allow us to do a better job and to do a more efficient job. When you're talking about tools and they are simply better and more effective tools. I wish I could say that the advances in AI will make it easier to create hits. Obviously, it won't. Hits are created by Genius, and data sets plus compute, plus large language models does not equal Genius. Genius is in the domain of human beings, and I believe we'll stay that way. However, I think jobs can be made a whole lot easier and more efficient by developments in AI, and we're certainly looking forward to that. And as I said, we're already putting it in practice every day.\nKarl Slatoff: So your second question in terms of costs. I'm not sure exactly what you meant by operating expenses. So I'll just kind of break it down about overhead. So publishing, overhead and corporate overhead. I would say, generally speaking, we're kind of at scale. We have what we need that's not to say - to achieve our plan over the next few years. That's not to say that we won't still be investing in those areas, and there will be cost increases associated with that. We're always looking for efficiencies but people do get raises, and we find needs as new opportunities arise. So I can't stand here and say that we don't have any more investment on publishing and corporate overhead, but we certainly believe that we're at scale. And we also believe that that's an opportunity for us to expand our margins based on the fact that we are at scale or very nearly at scale in that regard. On the development side, we do intend over the next few years to continue to add to our development capacity. That's something that we have been able to do successfully about 9,000 developers in-house today. That doesn't include our third-party relationships, which are vast and strong. And part of our plan is to continue investing in that area.\nOperator: Our next question is from Matthew Cost with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nMatthew Cost: The first one is just about the long-term guidance. I think you mentioned growth in fiscal '26 off of a base in fiscal '25. Presumably, there's quite a few units of new games that are being launched in that year. I guess when you think out into fiscal '26, what are the moving pieces that you see driving growth year-over-year off of what looks to be based on the numbers you've just provided a very, very strong year in fiscal '25. And then the second question is just on mobile. You announced that you're going to be launching Star Wars Hunters this fiscal year, I think the game has been in development for some time. Are you seeing something in the mobile gaming market as sort of stabilization or improvement of marketing efficiency that makes you feel this is the right time to come out with the game?\nKarl Slatoff: So in terms of our confidence in talking about what would grow as fiscal '26 over '25? It's the same answer what would grow '25 or '24, which is our pipeline, and it's the makeup of that pipeline. And I don't want to get into too much detail about what title unit expectations are, whether it's unit, it's title units or it's recurrent consumer spending because the fact is it's all of the above. But in the end, it's based on us delivering the pipeline that we have on plan and achieving the results that we expect. I really don't have much more to say beyond that. You want to do Hunters?\nStrauss Zelnick: Yes. On Star Wars, Hunters, you asked about the market backdrop. We are seeing some improvement in year-over-year comps. Mobile really was under a lot of pressure. The market is recovering a bit. It's still down year-over-year. In certain instances, we appear to be overperforming. And we're excited about many developments at Zynga. For example, advertising penetration, advertising that represents 27% of Zynga's net bookings, which is great. That will continue to improve. We're excited also about our direct-to-consumer platform, which obviously has an effect on our margins, a beneficial effect on our margins. So I think the backdrop is stable and perhaps improving a little bit. At the end of the day, what will matter, of course, is the quality of the title. Mobile is a very competitive space. We feel really good about Star Wars Hunters.\nOperator: Our next question is from Colin Sebastian with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nColin Sebastian: Strauss, you talk about setting new standards in the industry, and I know quality is a big piece of that. But would be also curious to know beyond that, what specific areas of innovation within your games, you would say, keep the portfolio ahead of the competition? And then, regarding the fiscal '25 commentary, I'd just be curious how of that more than $2.5 billion in incremental bookings next year. What portion of that should we think of as falling into RCS versus, I guess, unit sales? Thank you.\nStrauss Zelnick: Yes. Thanks for your question. In terms of how do you define innovation, if it had one definition, I think it would stop being innovation pretty quickly. But I think our labels are known for leading in new areas, whether that's a 3D view when there wasn't one before, whether that was downloadable add-on content many years ago or in-game purchases, virtual currency or the like that was the neighborhood or the city and NBA 2K, GTA Online, Red Dead Online, what you could do in those online environments, all of those were innovations driven by our labels. And everyone who works in the creative capacity at this company is trying to think about how do we engage and entertain consumers in a way that's novel that hasn't been seen before. We actually just had an internal e-mail exchange earlier today talking about the unknowns that we know in the next 10 years, there will be extraordinary changes in this industry. This is a highly dynamic industry. And we need to be not only current, we need to be leading the charge. Sometimes historically, we have. Other times, we've missed the boat, and we want to be at the front of the line and our creative folks work in service of their passions to make the best entertainment, anyone creates on earth. And again, we don't always succeed, but often we do. Our track record is pretty great creatively. And that's thanks to our 9,000 developers who work here and another 1,500 who work outside of our 4 walls to do work that Take-Two brings to market. So I'm sort of highly optimistic on the one hand and very mindful that this is a really ambitious challenge and the ambition is it's been emotional burden for everyone who works here, but also a great benefit when we succeed. On your second point, I think you asked us to distinguish between RCS and console sale and full game sales.\nLainie Goldstein: So for fiscal year '25, we are really excited to talk about it. It's a highly anticipated year. And we're really happy to talk about us hitting $8 billion in net bookings, but we aren't talking about what the detail of that is at this time.\nOperator: Our next question is from Doug Creutz with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nDoug Creutz: I just wanted to talk about your adjusted operating cash flow margins for a minute. If I go back to fiscal '18 through fiscal '21, you were pretty consistently in the low mid-20% range. It slipped down below then since then, I think, is a function of you investing against your future pipeline. Your fiscal '25 guide is over $1 billion in OCF against over $8 billion in bookings, which is still only about a 12.5% margin, if my math is correct, which seems low. Do you expect that in fiscal '25, you're still going to be investing heavily against future opportunities? Do you expect to get back to that 20% plus range in '25 or thereafter? Any kind of color you've given that would be great.\nLainie Goldstein: Sure. It's definitely still going to be investing in the pipeline going forward. And we still have interest payments and tax payments through those years, but we definitely will see a lot of the titles that we have been building up on to the balance sheet coming out those years. So that will definitely be affecting the AOCF in those years as well. Operator Our next question is from Clay Griffin with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question.\nClay Griffin: I guess I'm thinking about the marketing strategies for some of these big highly anticipated title is different now than they were, say, maybe in the Red Dead 2 launch. I mean, notwithstanding the fact that a larger number of titles ought to bring a higher level of marketing support in the aggregate. I'm curious if the overall level of marketing efficiency against bookings is materially different now maybe the prior generation, I guess, in other words, awareness of your IP is already quite high. So just curious on that.\nKarl Slatoff: Hey, Clay. I wouldn't say that the overall marketing spend levels are different. I think we continue to spend in a consistent manner. Although the makeup of that spending and the timing of the spending is definitely different now than it has been in the past. We don't spend a heck of a lot of money on TV, really, if any, at this point. Outdoor, a lot of those items are not really in our media plan. We have a lot more social spending than we did before, targeted spending performance marketing, et cetera. And it also used to be that a big portion of the marketing budget was spent prior to the release in the weeks prior to the release and certainly within the couple of weeks following the release. We still will spend a significant amount of marketing in and around the launch date, but it is much more spread out because we have the ability to monetize for a much longer period of time, and there are certain opportunities for us to market additional content drops. So you would see our marketing budgets are definitely spread out, longer than they would have been in the past. So those are really the two changes. But no, I don't really think there'd be a significant change in the scale of what we spend.\nClayGriffin: Got it. And there was some commentary about what sounded like a onetime cash tax issue in Q4. I just wanted to confirm that. And maybe just give us a sense of I mean what that was, we expect that to repeat? And just kind of general framework for thinking about cash taxes going forward? Thanks.\nLainie Goldstein: It wasn't really like a one-time taxing. It was a timing issue. So it's not something that will repeat, but it is our tax balances for each year. So it's something that we'll have tax payments every year going forward.\nClay Griffin: But the rate that you guys have been speaking to is there's no sense that that's moving one direction or the other.\nLainie Goldstein: Well, it's like 18% estimated tax rate is in our management rate and that's in the annual rate that we use for every year.\nOperator: Our next question is from Omar Dessouky with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nOmar Dessouky: So I guess I was wondering if you could maybe parse out a little bit implied in your operating income guidance, mobile versus PC console. I think a number of your peers guided profits roughly at the same levels for calendar '23 as was calendar '22. And I was just wondering, just for starters, whether your implied guide is up or down, if you could tell me that? And then I have a follow-up question.\nLainie Goldstein: Can you repeat the first question? I'm sorry.\nOmar Dessouky: Yes. No problem. A number of your peers that publish only mobile games have guided profits at similar levels in 2023 full year as 2022 full year. And I was wondering whether your guidance implies your profitability for Zynga and your Take-Two Mobile business up or down. I realize there's a number of moving pieces such as potential revenue synergies, reducing the cost of advertising and, of course, cost synergies. But is your implied guide for mobile up or down versus last year, like-for-like, including 53 days of Zynga.\nLainie Goldstein: Yes. So on a like-for-like basis for a comparable 12 months, the Zynga mobile business is up year-over-year.\nOmar Dessouky: Okay. Okay. Great. And I'm also glad that you guys addressed the $500 million of annual net bookings opportunities in the presentation. So I wanted to dig into that for a second. The first question on that is, can you give us any sense of the cadence of how you might get to $500 million? In terms of like fiscal '24, fiscal '25, fiscal '26. The reason I asked that is because you guys did put out a cadence in the S-4, obviously, that's a long time ago, but any update there would be great. So the cadence first. And then the second, the ramp to $500 million. And then the second one is you have a couple of bullet points here establishing a more meaningful presence in key mobile first emerging markets and introducing mobile games from some of our most popular improvement intellectual properties. So does that include high fidelity mobile games? Is that what you're referring to there? And specifically for Asian markets, potentially using some of your PC console IP. Lots of questions I appreciate your responses.\nKarl Slatoff: Hey. It's Karl. So in terms of some of the cadence around the $500 million revenue synergies, obviously, we're still very committed to that, and we feel very good about those opportunities for us. I think in the near-term, there are several meaningful opportunities that we believe our teams can actually start to begin to activate this fiscal year. And those are really more around expanding our D2C efforts more meaningfully in some of our other games. And also things like implementing new bold beats, marketing beats across the company, user acquisition optimization, creating centralized library of customer data across the company, integrating the Take-Two databases with the Zynga databases. All those things we're going to be able to start realizing some of that in this fiscal year and then obviously accelerate that into the next few years as well. In terms of the immediate and long-term, I think this will answer I think both of your questions. We do have a vision to introduce mobile games to some of some of our most popular properties on the T2 side into the mobile space. That's something that we're having conversations right now, nothing to announce specifically but the conversations are happening, and I would characterize them as very positive, and people are excited about that opportunity. I'm not really sure I understood the sort of reference to Asia and high fidelity, et cetera. But these are intellectual properties think about them as some of our more core type games. And by definition, you would expect and again, I don't have anything to announce right now because we don't have any games necessarily in development in that regard, that those games would be a little bit more upmarket because we do believe that there's a market for that. You've seen some success in the mobile space with other folks bringing their titles to market. Call Duty is a perfect example of that. We think that there is several of our titles that have that kind of opportunity. And I would expect those games to be a little bit more towards the mid-core arena. I hope that answers your question.\nOperator: Our next question is from Martin Yang with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nMartin Yang: First question on Zynga, can you tell us that Zynga's developer headcount growth since it was acquired?\nStrauss Zelnick: Yes, we don't break out the headcount label by label, but we did say that we have about 9,000 internal development people at the company.\nMartin Yang: My second question is broader. I want to get your broader view on console cycles. When do you plan to stop supporting past gen consoles? And what goes into the decision of stopping for the past gen consoles for certain franchise or for overall Take-Two release games?\nStrauss Zelnick: It really varies. I mean, obviously, our labels will continue to support platforms for which they believe there's a meaningful audience. And if and when the audience diminishes to a point where it's not economical to do so, we stop supporting the platforms. But in general, we're pretty supportive on an ongoing basis.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brian Fitzgerald with Wells Fargo. Please go proceed with your question.\nBrian Fitzgerald: A couple of questions on consumer pricing, not with your titles, but we've seen discounting on some of your competitors' recent releases they were anticipated AAA titles but were being discounted within days and weeks. So do you think the gamer is still struggling a little bit with coming to terms of $70 price points, maybe still macro impacted? And then the second one related to pricing is, again, you saw a strong RCS performance. Historically, the narrative has been gaming spending is resilient because even in macro because you get that bang for buck, relatively low cost per hour of entertainment. At the same time, the model is evolving to more live services, more RCS. Is that RCS spend just as resilient as the historical industry consumer spend has been?\nStrauss Zelnick: Yes. We've talked about this in the past. I mean, to take your second question first. We do think that live services spending is probably more affected by macroeconomic conditions because you don't need to spend. If you have the game, you can enjoy the game. There are certain titles that we don't really put ours into this category where you kind of have toll boots. If you don't pay, you really can't play, but that doesn't describe any of our titles mobile or console. So we think spending in a live services environment is a nice to have for the consumer, not a must-have. And as a result, if the consumer is feeling a pinch that might be an area that would be more likely to be influenced negatively. In terms of the pricing point that you raised, we're not seeing a pushback on frontline price. What we're seeing is consumers are seeking to limit their spending by going either to the stuff they really, really care about blockbusters or to value. And sometimes it could be both. And the good news is like we have a bunch of blockbusters, and we have a wonderful catalog. The other news is we also have a robust frontline release schedule and without regard to price, there has been some pressure as a result. If a consumer sees something is interesting but not necessarily yet a huge blockbuster. We think that will change. This is a growth business, and this is a unique market. And nothing that's going on now is inconsistent with the view that we outlined during the pandemic. We said at that time, we were benefiting greatly from people being at home and an odd turn of events. And we set our expectations post-pandemic, as an industry be in a better place than pre-pandemic in a worse place than during time when people were sheltering at home. And that's exactly what's happened exacerbated by a challenging mixed economy and what I believe is a recession, at least if you look at it through the lens of people who purvey digital entertainment consumed at home and e-commerce suppliers. There's a lot of pressure in those markets. But the overall tailwinds of the industry will continue. This is a growth business. It will remain fastest-growing part of the entertainment business for the next 20-plus years. And we will have those tailwinds. Now we still have to deliver in that context, and we intend to. But to torture the metaphor, the winds at our back.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Hickey with Benchmark. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Hickey: Congrats on your '25 guide, no pressure guys on $8 billion in revenue. Just curious, you didn't guide to profitability expecting to now that $8 billion was a little bit above consensus view. Just curious how we should think about profitability, I think consensus for is over $8 in EPS. I don't expect you to confirm that either way, but just thoughts on how we should think about profitability on '25, especially given that we have extended timelines now on development and what impact that could have? And then the second question, just another one on AI, Strauss. I'm glad to hear your positive on it. That's nice. Just curious on the mobile side with AI and barriers to entry. Just curious if you think that will have any challenges in terms of more competitors coming to the market? Thanks guys.\nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks, Mike. Well, we basically have indicated profitability by talking about our operating cash flow. You're right. We haven't gotten granular because we're not providing initial specific guidance, but we do expect that fiscal '25, '26 and beyond will be highly profitable years. And we've said repeatedly in these remarks today, we expect to grow our margins. That's a big part of what our financial objectives include. With regard to AI and mobile, I think the implication of your question is does generative AI allow people who aren't in the business to make mobile hits by saying to ChatGPT, \u201cCome up with a great idea for a new mobile hit. Oh, and by the way, please code it for me, too.\u201d And while you can do that now, you should give it a try and you'll see what happens because we certainly have tried it around here. And let's just say that, no, you will not be able to create hits that way. I mean remember, what you're looking at with AI and what you will always be looking at is a data set compute and at least sitting here today, large language models. And in the future, you may not be looking at large language models or they will change, but you'll still be looking at a data set and compute. And a data set by definition, is backward-looking and hits in the entertainment business by definition are forward-looking. And no matter how intelligent and I use the word in quotes very much in quotes, maybe multiple quotes. \u201cA machine is not going to be able to look forward. A machine can predict based on data sets and using massive compute and using large language models.\u201d We're all super excited about what we see because we haven't seen before the possibility of doing a natural language query and getting a natural language result. That looks incredibly cool. But to confuse that result with intelligence and creativity is like confusing a magic trick with magic. It's not magic. It's still a magic trick. So that's where I'm at on this. No AI is not going to allow people to push a button to make a hit. However, AI is going to make certain elements of any process that requires coding easier for everyone, for everyone, not disproportionately for anyone, for everyone.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Gerrick Johnson with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nGerrick Johnson: On the topic of delivering mobile games direct-to-consumer, what kind of share are you targeting for downloads in MTX? And then, what kind of margin lift would you see on a game-by-game basis as well as a consolidated basis?\nKarl Slatoff: So we haven't disclosed what our target is. We do think it's a significant opportunity for us. So it certainly is greater than zero and less than 100%. We don't think that it makes sense in all cases to go to direct-to-consumer, but we do think there's a lot of room for us to grow from where we are right now. I think it's the second question. What was the second?\nStrauss Zelnick: What was the second part of your question?\nGerrick Johnson: Margin list.\nKarl Slatoff: Yes. Well, I mean, again, I don't think we've talked about the margins, but you can kind of back into them yourself. I mean we're doing it ourselves and the sort of the take rate, obviously, is much, much, much lower because you're really talking about payment clearances and things of that nature. When you go to do the rates, other rates that may be in them.\nOperator: Our next question is from Benjamin Soff with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nBenjamin Soff: Just one on the slide. So LEGO Drive is listed under the mid-core section, but it seems like a $70 price point with a full year of seasonal updates. And to me that would seem like an AAA title. So do you mind expanding a bit on the difference between immersive and mid-core in your mind? And then apologies if I missed it, but are you expecting both top line and bottom-line growth in fiscal '26? Thanks.\nKarl Slatoff: It's a funny question you asked because we've debated this exact thing internally, whether or not like a LEGO title, for example, is a mid-core/arcade or is it immersive. And it really isn't a question of quality and the amount of gameplay that's involved. So the $70 price point, I would say, is a bit of a red herring. We think that the game is certainly worthwhile with that experience. But the experience itself when you look at sort of the over -- if you compare that experience to a Grand Theft Auto, for example, obviously, there's a big difference. In the depth of the storyline, the vastness of the world, et cetera, LEGO Drive is an open world driving experiences, but it's not Los Santos, so there's quite a bit. It's probably not even the City with NBA. So the term is probably a little bit of art in terms of how we classify things. But in this particular case, just given the look in the field of the game, we thought that mid-core/arcade was the right categorization of it. But there's no specific guideline other than kind of in this particular case, it kind of felt that way. And I should also say, sorry, Lainie was about to answer the other question. Whether it's mid-core or arcade versus core or immersive, that doesn't necessarily indicate our expectations about commercial success because you can have a commercially successful title, that's mid-core or casual.\nBenjamin Soff: Yes. Okay. Got it. Go ahead.\nLainie Goldstein: For fiscal '26, what we've said is that we expect net bookings and operational results to be higher than fiscal '25. So that would imply that both would be growing.\nOperator: Our next question is from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Ju: Okay. Thank you. So Strauss, I certainly do not want to put words in your mouth, but your answer to one of the prior questions. It sounded like you were talking about incremental barbelling of industry dollars, I guess, similar to what you were seeing during the financial crisis. And then I guess in an environment where only the AAA and the value games are going to capture dollars and the stuff in the middle may be in some trouble. So what are you doing at the studio level that is different now to maybe adjust for that environment. And Karl, like what are you doing at the private division level to adjust to what might be the new normal? Thanks.\nStrauss Zelnick: I think that's right. But at the end of the day, it just means quality. Just means you have to put out great stuff and that speaks to private division as well and that's always the case. This is less about changing strategy because our strategy is that everything that we put out should be just spectacular and more just a reflection of where the consumer sits. And the consumer will return, and this is going to be a growth business. As long as we make the highest quality titles, we should do just fine. Private Division's approach has never been based on sort of taking a shortcut on quality. Its approach has been let's bring into the 10 developers who might not otherwise bring their products to Take-Two. And in certain instances, we can deliver an A+ title on a more economical level than we might be able to do in-house. And that's been proven out and Private Division has generated a lot of successful titles. And in fact, virtually everything they've done, not everything, but virtually everything has been successful.\nOperator: Our next question is from Matthew Thornton with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nMatthew Thornton: Hey, guys. Just a quick follow-up. I'm not sure if this is for Strauss or Karl. We've talked about DTC on the mobile side. You guys have DTC experience with the Rockstar launch or on the PC side, if we think out a couple of years, given the scale you're going to be at as the world perhaps starts to take more steps towards streaming. Do you see the opportunity to perhaps partner on the back end or white label the streaming back end to go D2C on streaming, again, given the scale you'll be in a couple of years. Just kind of curious if you're thinking about that yet. Thanks again.\nStrauss Zelnick: Our strategy has always been to have the broadest possible distribution. We were a leader in digital distribution in the very beginning. And one of the reasons we did so well is that we basically were willing to do business with everyone whose terms made sense to us and who were good market participants in terms of security and compliance. And to the extent that streaming is a viable business opportunity and technology for our industry. Of course, we'll avail ourselves of it. And I'm certain we'll work with third parties as we have in the past. We were I think the first license for Stadia, for example, sorry, didn't work out, but we were there to support the effort. And equally to the extent that it makes sense to have our own platform, we will do that, too. But we're not very unlikely to be exclusively limited in one direction or the other. We want to be where the consumer is.\nStrauss Zelnick: So I think that's all the questions we have today. Thank you so much for joining us. We're thrilled with these results. We're more than thrilled with our outlook. I want to reiterate our gratitude to our teams around the world who show up every day with more or less with smiles on their faces, mostly with smiles. Aiming to do their very best work in pursuing their passions. I want to thank our business teams who bring their great work to market and make sure that we run our business in a first-class fashion. And of course, I want to thank our shareholders for their support and confidence in us. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference.

            "name": "Karl Slatoff",
            "content": "Thanks, Strauss. I'd like to thank our colleagues around the world for delivering another momentous year for Take-Two. Our integration with Zynga has gone incredibly well, and we continue to release many of the industry's highest quality, most engaging entertainment experiences, thanks to the incredible passion and talent of our teams. We are extremely excited about our release pipeline, which includes approximately 52 titles through fiscal 2026. Our revised plan reflects several title cancellations as well as the reclassification of our mobile games to include only those titles currently in our plans for worldwide launch. For fiscal 2024, our pipeline includes 16 planned releases. We expect to deliver 3 immersive core offerings. This includes NBA 2K24 and WWE 2K24, our genre defining sports titles developed by Visual Concepts. Additionally, we expect to release an eagerly anticipated new IP from one of our premier studios later this fiscal year. We plan to release 2 mid-core arcade titles, which includes LEGO 2K Drive, the ultimate driving adventure game from 2K and Visual Concepts. LEGO 2K Drive brings the iconic LEGO Play experience into a vast open world where players of all ages can build any vehicle, drive anywhere and become a LEGO racing legend. LEGO 2K Drive is the first release in a multi-title partnership between 2K and the LEGO Group. We are confident that 2K's proven expertise in creating high-quality and engaging interactive entertainment properties combined with the LEGO Group's unprecedented cultural reach, will evolve the iconic LEGO games experience that fans love in exciting new ways. We also plan to launch 2 new iterations of previously released titles and 3 independent titles, including private divisions planned May 23 release of After Us from Piccolo Studios. Players of After Us will navigate stunning environments in a surrealistic world to salvage the souls of extinct animals and restore life on Earth. And lastly, we expect to release 6 mobile titles during the year, including Zynga's Star Wars Hunters, which offers players the opportunity to join the greatest hunters from across the Star Wars Galaxy. Players will engage in thrilling third-person combat in a range of competitive game modes across battlegrounds steady both the iconic worlds of Star Wars. Throughout the year, our Hyper-Casual studios will release the steady cadence of mobile titles, focusing on games that have the potential for enhanced retention rates and a mix of in-app purchases and advertising to drive higher modernization and profitability. Our labels will also continue to provide new content and experiences that drive engagement and recurrent consumer spending across many of our hit franchises, including Grand Theft Auto Online, Red Dead Online, WWE 2K, LEGO 2K Drive, PGA TOUR 2K and throughout Zynga's mobile portfolio. Looking ahead, we currently expect to deliver 36 titles throughout fiscal 2025 and 2026. As always, these plans are a snapshot of our current development pipeline. It is likely that some of these titles will not be developed through completion, that launch timing may change and that we will also add new titles to our slate. Our release slate for fiscal 2025 and 2026 includes 14 immersive core releases, 6 of which are sports simulation games, 2 mid-core games, one of which will be sports-oriented, 4 new iterations of previously released titles, 4 independent titles from Private Division, 2 of which include our previously announced partnerships with We\u0304ta\u0304 Workshop and Game Freak and 12 mobile games. In addition to our full game releases, we will continue to offer post-launch content for nearly all of our titles, including Virtual Currency, DLC packs and Season Passes. Given the strength of our upcoming release schedule and the high degree of visibility we have into our pipeline, we believe that we'll achieve the record levels of results that Strauss mentioned. Including over $8 billion in net bookings and over $1 billion in adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow in fiscal 2025 with further growth in fiscal 2026 and beyond. As we approach the significant inflection point in our business, we believe our expanding scale and margins will generate industry-leading returns for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Lainie. So as you know, new IP is always a little bit of a wildcard, and it's difficult to predict exactly how it's going to behave. Obviously, we're not completely flying blind because we do have a pretty comprehensive process of doing comps in the market. But you really just never know, which is one of the reasons why when we model out in our product investment review process, new IP, we typically -- actually, we never model out big hits nor its upside. I don't want to necessarily call it a conservative approach, but we don't look at any sort of outlying success. Obviously, everything that we invest in and everything that we release, we're looking to achieve that outlying success, and we know for a fact that not every single one of our titles will achieve that. But that is the game we're in, and that's why we're making these investments in new IP, which ultimately is the lifeblood of our industry, and that's why we're still very much dedicated to doing that. So your second question in terms of costs. I'm not sure exactly what you meant by operating expenses. So I'll just kind of break it down about overhead. So publishing, overhead and corporate overhead. I would say, generally speaking, we're kind of at scale. We have what we need that's not to say - to achieve our plan over the next few years. That's not to say that we won't still be investing in those areas, and there will be cost increases associated with that. We're always looking for efficiencies but people do get raises, and we find needs as new opportunities arise. So I can't stand here and say that we don't have any more investment on publishing and corporate overhead, but we certainly believe that we're at scale. And we also believe that that's an opportunity for us to expand our margins based on the fact that we are at scale or very nearly at scale in that regard. On the development side, we do intend over the next few years to continue to add to our development capacity. That's something that we have been able to do successfully about 9,000 developers in-house today. That doesn't include our third-party relationships, which are vast and strong. And part of our plan is to continue investing in that area. So in terms of our confidence in talking about what would grow as fiscal '26 over '25? It's the same answer what would grow '25 or '24, which is our pipeline, and it's the makeup of that pipeline. And I don't want to get into too much detail about what title unit expectations are, whether it's unit, it's title units or it's recurrent consumer spending because the fact is it's all of the above. But in the end, it's based on us delivering the pipeline that we have on plan and achieving the results that we expect. I really don't have much more to say beyond that. You want to do Hunters? Hey, Clay. I wouldn't say that the overall marketing spend levels are different. I think we continue to spend in a consistent manner. Although the makeup of that spending and the timing of the spending is definitely different now than it has been in the past. We don't spend a heck of a lot of money on TV, really, if any, at this point. Outdoor, a lot of those items are not really in our media plan. We have a lot more social spending than we did before, targeted spending performance marketing, et cetera. And it also used to be that a big portion of the marketing budget was spent prior to the release in the weeks prior to the release and certainly within the couple of weeks following the release. We still will spend a significant amount of marketing in and around the launch date, but it is much more spread out because we have the ability to monetize for a much longer period of time, and there are certain opportunities for us to market additional content drops. So you would see our marketing budgets are definitely spread out, longer than they would have been in the past. So those are really the two changes. But no, I don't really think there'd be a significant change in the scale of what we spend. Hey. It's Karl. So in terms of some of the cadence around the $500 million revenue synergies, obviously, we're still very committed to that, and we feel very good about those opportunities for us. I think in the near-term, there are several meaningful opportunities that we believe our teams can actually start to begin to activate this fiscal year. And those are really more around expanding our D2C efforts more meaningfully in some of our other games. And also things like implementing new bold beats, marketing beats across the company, user acquisition optimization, creating centralized library of customer data across the company, integrating the Take-Two databases with the Zynga databases. All those things we're going to be able to start realizing some of that in this fiscal year and then obviously accelerate that into the next few years as well. In terms of the immediate and long-term, I think this will answer I think both of your questions. We do have a vision to introduce mobile games to some of some of our most popular properties on the T2 side into the mobile space.

Today, I'll discuss the key highlights from our fourth quarter and fiscal 2023 before reviewing our financial outlook for the full year and first quarter of fiscal 2024. Please note that our results include our combination with Zynga, which affects the comparability of our results relative to last year. Additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release. I'm so proud of our team for their strong execution and unwavering focus throughout the year. We made fantastic progress on our integration with Zynga delivered incredible high-quality content and announced several exciting new games from our pipeline. Efficiency was also a major area of focus. We announced our cost reduction program in February, and as part of our ongoing portfolio management process, we canceled several titles that we anticipated would not meet our internal hurdle rates. We are confident that all these steps will help grow our scale, enhance our long-term margin structure and ultimately deliver sustainable returns for our stakeholders. As Strauss mentioned, we finished fiscal 2023 with momentum and delivered fourth quarter net bookings of $1.39 billion, which was above our guidance range of $1.31 billion to $1.36 billion. This reflected better-than-expected results from Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Zynga's mobile portfolio. During the period, recurring consumer spending growth 115%, which was above our outlook of 105% growth and accounted for 78% of net bookings. The outperformance was primarily driven by Zynga and Grand Theft Auto Online. Digitally delivered net bookings increased 76%, above our guidance of 70% growth and accounted for 97% of the total. During the quarter, 78% of console game sales were delivered digitally, up from 75% last year. GAAP net revenue increased 56% to $1.45 billion, and cost of revenue increased 207% to $1.22 billion which included impairment charges of $465 million related to intangible assets acquired from Zynga, reflecting forecast changes for a few titles and $54 million relating to capitalized software and development costs for unreleased and canceled console and PC title, a lot of which was included in our management results. Operating expenses increased by 130% to $926 million, which primarily reflected the addition of Zynga, which is partially offset by lower marketing expenses. And GAAP net loss was $610 million or $3.62 per share, which includes $302 million of amortization of acquired intangibles and $45 million of business acquisition costs. Excluding the $54 million impairment charge, our management earnings would have been above the high end of our guidance range. Turning to our fiscal 2023 results. Total net bookings were $5.28 billion, which was above our guidance of $5.2 billion to $5.25 billion. While the challenging macroeconomic backdrop affected certain components of our portfolio, we experienced favorable performance within our catalog of industry-leading intellectual properties and Zynga had a strong finish to the year. The recurrent consumer spending increased 88%, which was slightly above our outlook of 85% growth and accounted for 78% of net bookings. Digitally delivered net bookings increased 63%, which was also above our guidance of 60% growth and accounted for 95% of the total. And during the year, 74% of our console game sales were delivered digitally up from 68% last year. Non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow was $56 million as compared to our outlook of over $400 million. During fiscal 2023, we spent $204 million on capital expenditures. At fiscal year end, we had cash and short-term investments of approximately $1 billion and debt of $3.1 billion. GAAP net revenue grew 53% to $5.35 billion in cost of revenue income 100% to $3.1 billion, which included impairment charges of $465 million related to intangible assets acquired from Zynga and $79 million related to capitalized software and development costs for unreleased and canceled titles, the latter of which was included in our management results. Operating expenses increased by 131% to $3.45 billion, which primarily reflected the addition of Zynga as well as higher personnel, stock compensation and IT expenses. And GAAP net loss was $1.12 billion or $7.03 per share, which includes $1.04 billion of amortization of acquired intangibles and $270 million of business acquisition costs. Today, we provided our initial outlook for fiscal 2024. We project net bookings to range from $5.45 billion to $5.55 billion. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, and Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, our Hyper-Casual mobile portfolio, Empires & Puzzles, Toon Blast, Words with Friends, Merge Dragons, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online and Zynga Poker. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our label to be roughly 53% Zynga, 31% 2K, 15% Rockstar Games and 1% other. And we forecast our geographic net booking site about 57% in United States and 33% international. We saw recurrent consumer spending to be up approximately 5% compared to fiscal 2023 and represents 79% of net bookings. Our forecast assumes 76% of console game sales will be delivered digitally. We expect to generate approximately $100 million in non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow, and we plan to deploy approximately $180 million for capital expenditures. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $5.37 billion to $5.47 billion and cost of revenue to range from $2.51 billion to $2.54 billion. Our total operating expenses are expected to range from $3.39 billion to $3.41 billion as compared to $3.45 billion last year. At the midpoint, this represents a 1% reduction, reflecting lower acquisition costs, the realization of synergies from our combination with Zynga and savings from our cost reduction program, which are partly offset by a full year of Zynga, higher stock compensation and personnel expenses driven by the annualization of new hires and the effect of inflation on other business operating expenses primarily reflected in IT costs. We expect the GAAP net loss ranging from $477 million to $518 million or $2.80 to $3.05 per share, which assumes a basic share count of 170.1 million shares. For management reporting purposes, we expect our tax rate to be 18% throughout fiscal 2024. I'd like to acknowledge that our current forecast for fiscal 2024 reflects the continuation of the challenging economic environment as well as an extension of the development time lines for several high-profile and long-awaited titles. While this affects our expectations for our current fiscal year, our high degree of visibility into our pipeline gives us confidence that we are approaching a significant inflection point in our business where we will achieve new record levels of results for our business next year and beyond. Now moving on to our guidance for the fiscal first quarter. We project net bookings to range from $1.15 billion to $1.2 billion, which reflects the full quarter of Zynga compared to $1 billion in the first quarter last year. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online, Grand Theft Auto V, a Hyper-Casual mobile portfolio, Empires & Puzzles, Toon Blast, Merge Dragons, Words with Friends, Zynga Poker, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online. We project recurrent consumer spending to increase by 35%. Our forecast assumes that 79% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from slightly from 77% in the same period last year. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $1.21 billion to $1.26 billion and cost of revenue to range from $572 million to $592 million. Operating expenses are expected to range from $827 million to $837 million. At the midpoint, this represents an 18% increase over last year, which reflects the full quarter of Zynga and higher stock compensation, personnel and IT expenses based on the factors I mentioned previously. And GAAP net loss is expected to range from $161 million to $178 million, or $0.95 to $1.05 per share, which assumes a basic share count of 169.4 million shares. The good thing is we believe that we are very well positioned in our industry to deliver the highest quality content, gain market share and enhance our profitability as we grow our scale and maintain our focus on efficiency. We're extremely excited about our next chapter of growth, and we look forward to our label, sharing more detail about the many exciting projects we have underway. Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Strauss. So for fiscal year '25, we are really excited to talk about it. It's a highly anticipated year. And we're really happy to talk about us hitting $8 billion in net bookings, but we aren't talking about what the detail of that is at this time. Sure. It's definitely still going to be investing in the pipeline going forward. And we still have interest payments and tax payments through those years, but we definitely will see a lot of the titles that we have been building up on to the balance sheet coming out those years. So that will definitely be affecting the AOCF in those years as well. Operator Our next question is from Clay Griffin with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question. It wasn't really like a one-time taxing. It was a timing issue. So it's not something that will repeat, but it is our tax balances for each year. So it's something that we'll have tax payments every year going forward. Well, it's like 18% estimated tax rate is in our management rate and that's in the annual rate that we use for every year. Can you repeat the first question? I'm sorry. Yes. So on a like-for-like basis for a comparable 12 months, the Zynga mobile business is up year-over-year. For fiscal '26, what we've said is that we expect net bookings and operational results to be higher than fiscal '25. So that would imply that both would be growing."

            "name": "Strauss Zelnick",
            "content": "Thanks, Nicole. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we concluded fiscal 2023 by delivering strong fourth quarter results, including net bookings of $1.4 billion, which were above the high end of our expectations. On behalf of our management team, I'd like to thank all of our colleagues around the world for helping us achieve these results and supporting our vision to become a more scaled, diverse industry-leading organization especially as we navigate an oftentimes volatile and uncertain economic landscape. With fiscal 2024 underway, our initial expectation is to deliver full year net bookings in the range of $5.45 billion to $5.55 billion. We're assuming a continuation of the current challenging consumer backdrop within our forecast. Additionally, the development timelines of some of our titles lengthened especially as we strive to redefine the creative standards of excellence of our industry, which affect our release slate for the year. Looking ahead, fiscal 2025 is a highly anticipated year for our company. For the last several years, we've been preparing our business to release an incredibly robust pipeline of projects that we believe will take our company to even greater levels of success. In fiscal 2025, we expect to enter this new era by launching several groundbreaking titles that we believe will set new standards in our industry and enable us to achieve over $8 billion in net bookings and over $1 billion in adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow. We expect to sustain this momentum by delivering even higher levels of operating results in fiscal 2026 and beyond. I'd now like to discuss several key highlights from fiscal 2023, which was a milestone year in the 30-year history of our organization. We delivered net bookings of $5.3 billion, which reflects both the transformative evolution of our company through our combination with Zynga, and our ability to create market and distribute the highest quality entertainment experiences. We made excellent progress integrating Zynga. The combination has been highly accretive to our business as we've embarked on new revenue-driven opportunities, exceeded our anticipated cost synergies for year one and enhance further our mobile platform through select acquisitions. As we approach the one-year anniversary of our combination, we're immensely proud of the trajectory of our integration and the strength of our shared culture and values. Our headcount now stands at nearly 12,000 talented individuals, including approximately 9,000 developers in our studios throughout the world, which positions us exceedingly well to reach the full potential of our pipeline. And we've maintained our focus on our core tenet of efficiency. We've taken a rigorous approach to our cost reduction program announced in February, which we believe will surpass meaningfully the $50 million in annual savings that we originally anticipated. Our fourth quarter outperformance was led by strong results from Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Online, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Zynga's mobile portfolio. Broadly speaking, the macroeconomic environment remained relatively consistent with what we experienced throughout the third quarter holiday season, while consumers continue to exercise restraint with their purchasing behaviors they prioritized blockbuster franchises and titles that offered great value. As a result, our vast catalog of proven high-quality titles achieved strong results. As part of our ongoing portfolio management measures, we made the decision to cancel several unannounced titles in development, which we believe will enable us to tighten our focus and reallocate resources to projects for which our creative teams have higher levels of conviction expectations of success. Excluding the associated write-offs, our fourth quarter and full year management earnings results were above the high-end of our guidance. We manage our pipeline actively, sometimes making difficult decisions to ensure that we're meeting our creative standards and achieving financial returns that are consistent with the goals of our company. We believe that an evolving robust pipeline is an essential part of our long-term strategy to expand, enhance and diversify our portfolio to grow our player base and to launch a multitude of new hit franchises across an array of platforms and business models. Turning to the performance of our titles for the period. Grand Theft Auto V exceeded our expectations, and to-date, the title has sold in more than 180 million units worldwide. As hardware supply constraints receded, Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online adoption on the latest generation of platforms continued to grow. For the first 3 weeks of Grand Theft Auto Online's Holiday update, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles grew to 14% of its audience penetration and 25% of its revenue penetration, up from 11% and 20%, respectively, versus last summer's content update for the comparable period. During the period, Rockstar Games continue to support the passionate global Grand Theft Auto online community with an array of new content offerings, including The Last Dose an epic finale of the Los Santos Drug Wars update as well as the roving Gun Van, Taxi Work Missions, a new 50 Car Garage, new vehicles, clothes, weapons, modes and much more. Los Santos Drug Wars introduced a phased approach to delivering high-value content, creating a much longer tail of sustained engagement in net bookings than we've seen with previous content updates. Additionally, GTA plus Rockstar's premium membership program continues to perform well, driven by a positive response to monthly events since the launch of Los Santos Drug Wars. Red Dead Redemption 2 outperformed our plans and to date, the title has sold in more than 53 million units worldwide. We're also pleased with the continued engagement of players with Red Dead Online as demonstrated by its 10% year-on-year increase in new online players on all platforms. NBA 2K23 continues to grow its audience with the title selling in over 11 million units to date, a record for the series at this stage and achieving its highest ever virtual currency sales. In addition, engagement with NBA 2K23 remained incredibly strong, with approximately 2.3 million daily active users, including growth in The City, MyCAREER and MyTeam users. NBA 2K23 arcade addition continues to bring the best basketball experience to mobile devices and has maintained its number one position on Apple arcade. Building upon Visual Concepts' resounding success and reinvigorating our WWE franchise last year, WWE 2K23 enjoys the highest metacritic review score average in the history of the series. Engagement with the game has been outstanding, players logging nearly 8 million hours of gameplay and facing off of more than 100 million matches. 2K is supporting the title with a series of add-on content that can be purchased individually or as part of the season pass. We value deeply our relationship with the WWE and look forward to continuing and expanding upon our successful partnership in the years to come. Private Division and Intercept Games launched Kerbal Space Program 2 in early access for PC on Steam, Epic Games Store and other storefronts. Our teams are encouraged by the incoming player feedback, and we've already implemented several updates with more on the way as development continues. Last week, Private Division announced a partnership with Game Freak to publish their upcoming new action-adventure IP, which is one of Private Division's most ambitious projects to date. In addition, Private Division and the Roll7 studio were recently honored with 2 prestigious industry awards, the BAFTA for Best British game for Rollerdrome and Best Sports Game at DICE for OlliOlli World. Zynga's mobile business had a strong finish to the year. In-app purchases were above our expectations. Momentum has continued and we were pleased to experience strong demand over the Easter holiday. Efforts to increase our advertising business are tracking well with ad revenue growing quarter-over-quarter and accounting for approximately 27% of Zynga's net bookings. Our teams are successfully increasing advertising supply in our games, investing in optimization and implementing new ad products, which are helping us monetize a much broader cohort of users. Our direct-to-consumer efforts are tracking well with numerous titles currently in our platforms and plans for nearly all mobile games across our labels to leverage our highly profitable proprietary distribution channel over the next few years. A few highlights of Zynga's offerings during the period include Empires and Puzzles, Zynga's highest grossing title drove engagement through its new in-game event, Season of Love. Zynga's social casino portfolio had its best quarter in nearly two years, driven by record performance from Game of Thrones Slots Casino and strong overall results from Zynga Poker, Hit it Rich! and Wizard of Oz Slots. Top Eleven had a robust quarter and launched its Proving Ground: England mini game update in February, which challenged players to recreate the greatest moments in the English football history. The new Race Pass from CSR Racing 2 continued to drive player engagement, retention and monetization with innovative new profile banners for players to collect.  We remain quite pleased with our hyper casual mobile business. Popcore achieved strong results during its first full quarter under our ownership. Additionally, Rollic has increased its profitability and the studio celebrated several milestones during the period, including the first anniversary of its hit title Fill the Fridge!, and social media inspired Pressure Washing Run, reaching the number one most downloaded spot in Apple's U.S. App Store. In closing, as we continue to pursue our mission to be the most creative, the most innovative and the most efficient entertainment company in the world, we do so incredibly well positioned with a broader portfolio of owned intellectual property, a deeper pool of the industry's top creative talent, and the sound infrastructure to capitalize on the vast opportunities on the horizon. As we execute on our strategy, we believe that we can increase meaningfully our scale and prominence within the industry, grow margins and achieve record-breaking operating results for fiscal 2025 and beyond. I'll now turn the call over to Karl. Thank you, Karl, and Lainie, and thank you to all of our colleagues for your dedication, your hard work and these terrific results. We will now take your questions. Operator? Yes, you're right. It's very uncharacteristic of us to talk about subsequent years at this time. We're doing so because we've been investing in a pipeline for a long time. And we now have a great deal of confidence that, that pipeline will be delivered in the next 3 years, 12 titles in fiscal '24, 36 in the following 2 years, up 44% of that is new intellectual property. The rest is new iterations of existing franchises, and that's mobile, console, PC and numerous business models. We couldn't be more excited, fiscal '24 titles look good and as I said, we're very confident in the years to come as well. And we thought it was important to convey that with transparency today. Yes, as you know, I'm usually a skeptic when others engage in hyperbole. In the case of AI, I'm pretty enthusiastic. First of all, despite the fact that artificial intelligence is an oxymoron as is machine learning. This company has been involved in those activities no matter what words used to describe them for its entire history, and we're a leader in the space. So while the most recent developments in AI are surprising and exciting to many they are exciting to us, but not at all surprising. Our view is that AI will allow us to do a better job and to do a more efficient job. When you're talking about tools and they are simply better and more effective tools. I wish I could say that the advances in AI will make it easier to create hits. Obviously, it won't. Hits are created by Genius, and data sets plus compute, plus large language models does not equal Genius. Genius is in the domain of human beings, and I believe we'll stay that way. However, I think jobs can be made a whole lot easier and more efficient by developments in AI, and we're certainly looking forward to that. And as I said, we're already putting it in practice every day. Yes. On Star Wars, Hunters, you asked about the market backdrop. We are seeing some improvement in year-over-year comps. Mobile really was under a lot of pressure. The market is recovering a bit. It's still down year-over-year. In certain instances, we appear to be overperforming. And we're excited about many developments at Zynga. For example, advertising penetration, advertising that represents 27% of Zynga's net bookings, which is great. That will continue to improve. We're excited also about our direct-to-consumer platform, which obviously has an effect on our margins, a beneficial effect on our margins. So I think the backdrop is stable and perhaps improving a little bit. At the end of the day, what will matter, of course, is the quality of the title. Mobile is a very competitive space. We feel really good about Star Wars Hunters. Yes. Thanks for your question. In terms of how do you define innovation, if it had one definition, I think it would stop being innovation pretty quickly. But I think our labels are known for leading in new areas, whether that's a 3D view when there wasn't one before, whether that was downloadable add-on content many years ago or in-game purchases, virtual currency or the like that was the neighborhood or the city and NBA 2K, GTA Online, Red Dead Online, what you could do in those online environments, all of those were innovations driven by our labels. And everyone who works in the creative capacity at this company is trying to think about how do we engage and entertain consumers in a way that's novel that hasn't been seen before. We actually just had an internal e-mail exchange earlier today talking about the unknowns that we know in the next 10 years, there will be extraordinary changes in this industry. This is a highly dynamic industry. And we need to be not only current, we need to be leading the charge. Sometimes historically, we have. Other times, we've missed the boat, and we want to be at the front of the line and our creative folks work in service of their passions to make the best entertainment, anyone creates on earth. And again, we don't always succeed, but often we do. Our track record is pretty great creatively. And that's thanks to our 9,000 developers who work here and another 1,500 who work outside of our 4 walls to do work that Take-Two brings to market. So I'm sort of highly optimistic on the one hand and very mindful that this is a really ambitious challenge and the ambition is it's been emotional burden for everyone who works here, but also a great benefit when we succeed. On your second point, I think you asked us to distinguish between RCS and console sale and full game sales. Yes, we don't break out the headcount label by label, but we did say that we have about 9,000 internal development people at the company. It really varies. I mean, obviously, our labels will continue to support platforms for which they believe there's a meaningful audience. And if and when the audience diminishes to a point where it's not economical to do so, we stop supporting the platforms. But in general, we're pretty supportive on an ongoing basis. Yes. We've talked about this in the past. I mean, to take your second question first. We do think that live services spending is probably more affected by macroeconomic conditions because you don't need to spend. If you have the game, you can enjoy the game. There are certain titles that we don't really put ours into this category where you kind of have toll boots. If you don't pay, you really can't play, but that doesn't describe any of our titles mobile or console. So we think spending in a live services environment is a nice to have for the consumer, not a must-have. And as a result, if the consumer is feeling a pinch that might be an area that would be more likely to be influenced negatively. In terms of the pricing point that you raised, we're not seeing a pushback on frontline price. What we're seeing is consumers are seeking to limit their spending by going either to the stuff they really, really care about blockbusters or to value. And sometimes it could be both. And the good news is like we have a bunch of blockbusters, and we have a wonderful catalog. The other news is we also have a robust frontline release schedule and without regard to price, there has been some pressure as a result. If a consumer sees something is interesting but not necessarily yet a huge blockbuster. We think that will change. This is a growth business, and this is a unique market. And nothing that's going on now is inconsistent with the view that we outlined during the pandemic. We said at that time, we were benefiting greatly from people being at home and an odd turn of events. And we set our expectations post-pandemic, as an industry be in a better place than pre-pandemic in a worse place than during time when people were sheltering at home. And that's exactly what's happened exacerbated by a challenging mixed economy and what I believe is a recession, at least if you look at it through the lens of people who purvey digital entertainment consumed at home and e-commerce suppliers. There's a lot of pressure in those markets. But the overall tailwinds of the industry will continue. This is a growth business. It will remain fastest-growing part of the entertainment business for the next 20-plus years. And we will have those tailwinds. Now we still have to deliver in that context, and we intend to. But to torture the metaphor, the winds at our back. Thanks, Mike. Well, we basically have indicated profitability by talking about our operating cash flow. You're right. We haven't gotten granular because we're not providing initial specific guidance, but we do expect that fiscal '25, '26 and beyond will be highly profitable years. And we've said repeatedly in these remarks today, we expect to grow our margins. That's a big part of what our financial objectives include. With regard to AI and mobile, I think the implication of your question is does generative AI allow people who aren't in the business to make mobile hits by saying to ChatGPT, \u201cCome up with a great idea for a new mobile hit. Oh, and by the way, please code it for me, too.\u201d And while you can do that now, you should give it a try and you'll see what happens because we certainly have tried it around here. And let's just say that, no, you will not be able to create hits that way. I mean remember, what you're looking at with AI and what you will always be looking at is a data set compute and at least sitting here today, large language models. And in the future, you may not be looking at large language models or they will change, but you'll still be looking at a data set and compute. And a data set by definition, is backward-looking and hits in the entertainment business by definition are forward-looking. And no matter how intelligent and I use the word in quotes very much in quotes, maybe multiple quotes. \u201cA machine is not going to be able to look forward. A machine can predict based on data sets and using massive compute and using large language models.\u201d We're all super excited about what we see because we haven't seen before the possibility of doing a natural language query and getting a natural language result. That looks incredibly cool. But to confuse that result with intelligence and creativity is like confusing a magic trick with magic. It's not magic. It's still a magic trick. So that's where I'm at on this. No AI is not going to allow people to push a button to make a hit. However, AI is going to make certain elements of any process that requires coding easier for everyone, for everyone, not disproportionately for anyone, for everyone. What was the second part of your question? I think that's right. But at the end of the day, it just means quality. Just means you have to put out great stuff and that speaks to private division as well and that's always the case. This is less about changing strategy because our strategy is that everything that we put out should be just spectacular and more just a reflection of where the consumer sits. And the consumer will return, and this is going to be a growth business. As long as we make the highest quality titles, we should do just fine. Private Division's approach has never been based on sort of taking a shortcut on quality. Its approach has been let's bring into the 10 developers who might not otherwise bring their products to Take-Two. And in certain instances, we can deliver an A+ title on a more economical level than we might be able to do in-house. And that's been proven out and Private Division has generated a lot of successful titles. And in fact, virtually everything they've done, not everything, but virtually everything has been successful. Our strategy has always been to have the broadest possible distribution. We were a leader in digital distribution in the very beginning. And one of the reasons we did so well is that we basically were willing to do business with everyone whose terms made sense to us and who were good market participants in terms of security and compliance. And to the extent that streaming is a viable business opportunity and technology for our industry. Of course, we'll avail ourselves of it. And I'm certain we'll work with third parties as we have in the past. We were I think the first license for Stadia, for example, sorry, didn't work out, but we were there to support the effort. And equally to the extent that it makes sense to have our own platform, we will do that, too. But we're not very unlikely to be exclusively limited in one direction or the other. We want to be where the consumer is. So I think that's all the questions we have today. Thank you so much for joining us. We're thrilled with these results. We're more than thrilled with our outlook. I want to reiterate our gratitude to our teams around the world who show up every day with more or less with smiles on their faces, mostly with smiles. Aiming to do their very best work in pursuing their passions. I want to thank our business teams who bring their great work to market and make sure that we run our business in a first-class fashion. And of course, I want to thank our shareholders for their support and confidence in us. Have a great day."

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. During the third quarter, we continued to execute on our ambition to create the highest quality, most engaging interactive entertainment franchises in the industry to deliver them across an array of platforms and to captivate our global audiences. All of our new game releases and post-launch content have received significant critical acclaim, and we're pleased to have the highest catalog sales based on units sold in the Americas. The strength of our portfolio reflects the passion, vision, artistic acumen and hard work of our world-renowned development teams and studios, and we're immensely proud of our long-standing commitment to quality. Notwithstanding our creative achievements, our third quarter net bookings of $1.38 billion were slightly below our prior guidance. We believe that as a result of macroeconomic conditions, consumers shifted holiday spending toward established blockbuster franchises and titles that were offered with pricing promotions. While our catalog benefited from this trend, it affected the performance of certain of our new releases and recurrent consumer spending for some of our console and PC games. Despite the current market, we believe that our long-term success will be driven by our consistent ability to create the best entertainment experiences, including sequels of our beloved franchises and the introduction of engaging new intellectual properties. Sales of Grand Theft Auto V exceeded our expectations during the holiday season. And to date, the title has sold in more than 175 million units. During the quarter, Rockstar Games released an array of new content for both, Halloween and the holiday season as well as a new story-driven update Los Santos Drug Wars. The update launched in December and continues to deliver exciting new story and gameplay features to players across the winter season, including a new business, tax emissions and much more to come, which is continuous to drive stronger engagement with our player race. We were also pleased with the performance of Red Dead Redemption 2, which outpaced our expectations driven by successful holiday promotions and events. To-date, the title has sold in more than 50 million units. During the quarter, Rockstar Games continued to release new updates for Red Dead Online, including a new Halloween Hardcore Telegram Mission and new Call to Arms locations for Halloween and the holidays. We remain incredibly pleased with the enduring quality of these entertainment experiences. Grand Theft Auto V was ranked number three for units sold in the US during calendar year 2022 on all platforms and was number two overall for 2022 on Steam. Additionally, 2022 was GTA V's tenth consecutive year in the NPD top five for unit sales. Red Dead Redemption 2 also continues to resonate strongly with players, ranking as the number one selling game on Steam for the quarter end, number three for 2022. NBA 2K23, which remains the number one selling sports title in North America continues to expand its audience and to date has sold in over 8 million units. Full game sales for NBA 2K23 are up 3% year-over-year, and MyTEAM users grew more than 50% over last year, as players enjoyed assembling the rosters of the NBA's all-time greatest stars to dominate the competition. In addition, NBA 2K23 Arcade Edition remains the number one game in Apple Arcade since its launch in October. 2K and HB Studios supported PGA TOUR 2K23 with the limited-edition holiday bundle that included NBA 2K23 and new content featuring branded gear from Barstool Sports, 100 Thieves, and Dude Perfect. HB Studios will release more content and features, including the addition of Pebble Beach, cosplay functionality and ranked patch making. On December 2, 2K and Firaxis Games launched Marvel's Midnight Suns on Windows PC via Steam and Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. The title launched a critical acclaim with BGC rating at a five out of five, calling it a modern strategy classic. PC Gamer said it was completely brilliant, scoring at 88 out of 100 and Rock Paper Shotgun called it one of the best Superhero games. The title is being supported with a series of post-launch content that can be purchased individually or as part of the game seasons pass. During the quarter, Zynga's in-app purchases performed in line with our expectations, and we saw mobile trends improve from prior lows, particularly during the holiday season. The label continued to experience strong engagement among its active players and we believe that we're maintaining our global market share. Our advertising business outpaced the broader industry, as we continue to introduce new ad supply and products, optimize our networks to increase ad yields and roll out Chart boost throughout our inventory. A few key highlights of our mobile offerings during the quarter include Empires & Puzzles was a top performer due to strong seasonal content and Black Friday offerings. This is one of our first titles to leverage our direct-to-consumer platform for in-app purchases, which we believe can enhance significantly the margins for our mobile portfolio over the next few years. Rollic\u2019s Balls\u2019n Ropes reached the number one spot for most downloaded game in the US in December, giving Rollic a look a total of 20 games that have reached the number one or number two spot in Apple's US App Store. We acquired Popcore, which offers a unique balance of hyper-casual experiences that also prioritize long-term player retention rates. This strengthens our leadership among hyper-casual publishers with respect to downloads in revenue. Following the acquisition, Popcore's game Tap Away reached the number one spot for most downloaded game multiple times throughout the quarter in Apple's US App Store. Zynga's casino titles remained resilient with Game of Thrones Slots posting its best quarter ever. Top 11 had a strong quarter, driven by various in-game updates celebrating the World Cup. CSR Racing 2 released Race Pass, which features innovative new rewards that are driving stronger retention and monetization. Our combination with Zynga remains highly accretive to our business. We remain committed to delivering our planned synergies, and we're well on our way to exceed our target of $100 million in annual cost savings within the first two years post close. During the quarter, recurrent consumer spending rose 117% and accounted for 78% of net bookings. Turning to our outlook. We're operating in an environment that is, in many ways, more challenging than we anticipated. And we're lowering our fiscal 2023 net bookings guidance to $5.2 billion to $5.25 billion to take this backdrop into account. To be clear, I take personal responsibility for our revised downward guidance. We believe there's always more to achieve, particularly when we fall short of our expectations. We've embarked on a company-wide cost reduction program that will optimize our expense structure, while also positioning us to deliver on our anticipated growth trajectory. We expect to achieve savings in excess of $50 million as a result of this initiative. Our balance sheet remains strong, allowing us to navigate these uncertain times with confidence. We've always managed our business for the long term as we achieve the powerful synergies from our combination with Zynga, release new titles from our robust multiyear pipeline and execute on our cost savings initiatives we expect to deliver sequential growth and record performance over the next several years. Our business and creative teams have done a phenomenal job during these challenging times, and I'd like to thank all of our colleagues for their tireless work. I'd also like to thank our shareholders for their continued support. I look forward to sharing our progress with you on all of our key initiatives. I'll now turn the call over to Karl.\nKarl Slatoff: Thanks, Strauss. As we focus on the remainder of the year and beyond, we remain steadfast in our commitment to providing the most captivating and engaging entertainment experiences for our audiences across all platforms and geographies. We believe this is the best strategy and path forward to achieving our goals, driving our expected long-term growth and bringing value to our shareholders. Turning to our upcoming releases. On February 24, Private Division and Intercept Games will launch Kerbal Space Program 2, its early access for PC on Steam, Epic Games Store and other storefronts. KSP 2 will bring an array of content for players to explore and the title promises to be the most visually impressive game in the franchise. Those that purchased KSP 2 in early access will help inform the future development of the game by providing feedback directly to its creators leading up to the full launch of the title. In addition, Private Division has announced several new projects. After us, a riveting exploration debenture game from Piccolo Studios is expected to launch this spring during fiscal 2024 for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series excellence. Private Division announced a publishing partnership with Bluebird team to develop a new survival harder game expected to launch after calendar 2024. And we unveiled our new Private Division development fund to support smaller independent teams with project financing and mentorship opportunities. On March 17, 2K and Visual Concepts will release WWE 2K23 for PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC on Steam. In celebration of John Cena\u2019s 20th anniversary as a WWE superstar, the 16-time World Champion\u2019s record-setting philanthropist and WWE 2K23 Executive soundtrack producer will be featured on the cover of each addition of the game. In addition, global music phenom Bad Bunny, 2022's most streamed artist in the world will make his WWE 2K debut as a preorder bonus. Building upon the success of WWE 2K22, this year's installment features a unique take on the 2K showcase, the introduction of the fan-favorite WarGames matches and expenses to several marquee games. Fans can look forward to a deep roster of WWE Superstars and Legends, including Roman Reigns, American Nightmare Cody Rhodes, Ronda Rousey, Brock Lesnar, Stone Cold Steve Austin and more. 2K will support the game with an array of post-launch content and may be purchased individually or through a season pass. Throughout the balance of the fiscal year, Rockstar Games will continue to support Grand Theft Auto Online with additional content updates. And 2K and Firaxis games will continue to release add-on content from Marvel's Midnight Suns and Sid Meier's Civilization VI: Leader Pass. In mobile, Zynga\u2019s Rollic studio will release a vast array of titles as they've done previously, while the label\u2019s other studios remain at work on a variety of games, including several in soft launch that we expect to release in fiscal 2024. We will have more to share on our pipeline when we report our fourth quarter results in May. I'll now turn the call over to Lainie.\nLainie Goldstein: Thanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll discuss the key highlights from our third quarter, before reviewing our guidance for fiscal year 2023 and our fourth quarter. Please note that our third quarter results include our combination with Zynga, with respect to the comparability of our results relative to last year. Additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release. As Strauss mentioned, we delivered net bookings of $1.38 billion, which was slightly below our prior guidance, as consumers displayed more cautionary purchasing behaviors during the holiday season. As in prior periods of economic headwinds, full game sales from our catalog of industry-leading intellectual properties were relatively resilient. However, we felt pressure on some of our newer releases that are in earlier stages of building their player base, alongside softness in recurrent consumer spending. During the period, recurrent consumer spending rose 117% and accounted for 78% of net bookings. Zynga\u2019s in-app purchases performed in line with our revised expectations. However, this was offset by weakness in recurrent consumer spending for several of our console and PC games. Digitally delivered net bookings increased 72% and accounted for 95% of the total. During the quarter, 69% of console game sales were delivered digitally, up from 63% last year. GAAP net revenue increased 56% to $1.41 billion, and cost of revenue increased 97% to $692 million. Operating expenses increased by 123% to $889 million, primarily driven by the addition of Zynga, as well as higher marketing and stock-based compensation expenses. The GAAP net loss was $153 million, $0.91 per share, which was impacted by $302 million of amortization of acquired intangibles and $24 million of business acquisition costs. Our management tax rate for the period was 18% as compared to 60% in the prior year as a result of our combination with Zynga. We ended the quarter with over $1.1 billion of cash and short-term investments and paid down $200 million of revolver borrowings, reducing our debt to $3.1 billion. Turning to our guidance. I'll begin with our full fiscal year expectations. We now expect to deliver net bookings of $5.2 billion to $5.25 billion. Our forecast takes into account the current economic environment and consumer purchasing trends that we have been experiencing, which we expect to continue into the fourth quarter, including lower expectations for some of our recent game releases and softer recurrent consumer spending as well as the shift of an unannounced mobile title and a focus on enhanced profitability for our hyper-casual business. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Empires & Puzzles, Toon Blast, Rollic\u2019s hyper-casual mobile portfolio, and Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be 46% Zynga, 36% 2K, 17% Rockstar Games and 1% private division. We forecast our geographic net bookings split to be about 65% United States and 35% international. We expect recurrent consumer spending to grow by approximately 85% and represents 77% of total net bookings. Our digitally delivered net workings are expected to grow by approximately 60% and represent 95% of the total. Our forecast assumes that 74% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 68% last year. We expect to generate more than $400 million in non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow, and we expect to deploy approximately $170 million for capital expenditures. Our GAAP net revenue to range from $5.24 billion to $5.29 billion and cost of revenue to range from $2.53 billion to $2.55 billion, which includes approximately $694 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Total operating expenses are expected to range from $3.4 billion to $3.41 billion as compared to $1.5 billion last year. This increase reflects the inclusion of Zynga, business acquisition costs and higher personnel compensation and marketing expenses, which we anticipate will be slightly offset by our expected cost synergies from our integration with Zynga. As we've mentioned on prior calls, in light of the current backdrop, we have been evaluating cost savings opportunities that can structurally enhance our margin and make our company more efficient and nimble for the long-term. After a comprehensive review, we now believe that we can deliver over $50 million of annual savings, which we will begin to execute on this quarter opportunities include personnel, processes, infrastructure and other areas, particularly in publishing and corporate funding. This program is in addition to the over $100 million of annual cost synergies from our combination with Zynga and is not expected to impact the delivery of our robust multiyear pipeline. We expect the GAAP net loss ranging from $704 million to $721 million or $4.40 to $4.50 per share, which assumes the basic share count of 159.8 million shares. We expect our management tax rate to be 18% throughout the year. Now moving to our guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter. We project net bookings to range from $1.31 billion to $1.36 billion, compared to $846 million in the fourth quarter last year. The largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, and Empires and Puzzles, Toon Blast, Rollic\u2019s hyper-casual mobile portfolio, and WWE 2K23  We project recurrent consumer spending to grow approximately 105% and digitally delivered net book to increase approximately 70%. Our forecast assumes that 80% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up 75% last year. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $1.34 billion to $1.39 billion and cost of revenues to range from $688 million to $708 million, which includes approximately $198 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Operating expenses are expected to range from $871 million to $881 million. At the midpoint, this represents a 120% increase over last year. This increase reflects the inclusion of Zynga, business acquisition costs and higher marketing and personnel expenses, which we believe will be slightly offset by the realization of some of our anticipated cost synergies. And GAAP net loss is expected to range from $197 million to $214 million of $1.17 to $1.27 per share, which assumes a basic share count of 168 million shares. In closing, while we are disappointed to have lowered our outlook for the year, we are highly confident in our long-term growth potential. We believe that the actions we are taking now will position us to deliver sequential growth and record performance over the next several years, which we anticipate will drive meaningful shareholder value. I'd like to thank all of our stakeholders again for their support. Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Strauss.\nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for their firm commitment to creativity, innovation and efficiency as we continue to navigate a challenging economic landscape. I'd also like to express our appreciation to our shareholders for their continued support. We'll now take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Eric Handler with MKM Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nEric Handler: Good afternoon, and thanks for the question. Strauss, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about mobile advertising, specifically, have you been able to integrate advertising into Zynga games that previously had not included advertising? And what about the 2K games prior to the acquisition of Zynga? And then secondly, if you could just talk a little bit more about the direct-to-consumer platform with mobile virtual currency purchasing. Besides Empire & Puzzles, how many other games have integrated the DTC capabilities?\nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks, Eric. I appreciate it. To answer your question, we have enhanced advertising within the Zynga portfolio. Certain titles within that portfolio did not have advertising and now do. And at 2K, with regard to their mobile titles, there's no change. With regard to console titles, we have a limited amount of advertising, but there's no change there as well. With regard to direct-to-consumer, that's a new initiative for us and for the team at Zynga that's being rolled out modestly. We are seeing early signs of success. And obviously, that has a very significant effect on our contribution margins.\nEric Handler: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Matthew Thornton with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nMatthew Thornton: Hey. Good afternoon, everybody. May be two, if I could. Coming back to mobile. I don't know if this one\u2019s for Strauss, but can you give us maybe your higher level thoughts as you think about the mobile market? And I know it's hard to tease apart macro versus what's going on, on the user acquisition side with Apple ATT. But, I guess, putting macro aside, if you think about the mobile market over the next couple of years, how do you think about the growth rate of that business? And how are you thinking maybe different about the mix of in-app purchase versus ad revenue or the right genres or new IP versus existing franchises, the right cost structure, there's more opportunity there. Just how are you thinking about that as that market has obviously been very dynamic? And then I have a follow-up, but I'll stop there.\nStrauss Zelnick: Well, I'll see how I do it then you can determine what your follow-up is like. So in terms of the mobile market, look, the reason we were interested in combining with Zynga is we believe that mobile will continue to be the fastest-growing part of the interactive entertainment business, and we still are of that belief. Yes, there's been some year-over-year pressure, which is, in our view, related to the economy primarily and to a lesser extent, probably, sort of, post-pandemic changes in demand. We think those are near term. And in fact, the trends recently are quite positive in terms of demand. And Zynga has the best portfolio of mobile games in the business. Most of our competitors, good as they may be, have one, two, three, four titles that matter. We have a whole lot more than that. We have these forever franchises. And we also are blessed with phenomenal leadership in that division. So we remain highly optimistic about the growth in the future. I'm not sure I can give you an exact growth rate, but I do think it will continue to be a rapidly growing part of the business. It also diversifies us. We attach a different audience on the mobile side, skews more female. It skews older. And by having a diverse company that has console and PC and mobile titles, we address every part of the interactive entertainment business, and we find ourselves as one of the top three pure plays in the business. With regard to our expectations about in-app purchases and ad revenue going forward, look, in-app purchases still are only relevant for about 10% of the market for 90% of the users, that's not something they're interested in. So if you're selective and careful about how you target it, advertising makes all the sense in the world, because we ought to be able to find a way to monetize all of the viewing, all of the engagement, not just the engagement that leads to spending, particularly because we're not in the toll booth business. We're in the entertainment business. And we want to be able to deliver titles that consumers can enjoy without regard to spending. Spending should enhance the experience for sure, and it does. But in order to be commercial, we should have a robust advertising business that's not intrusive, that's positive for the consumer than consumer experience, and that's exactly what Zynga is building. With regards to new IP -- I'll finish your, I wrote down your questions. So let me just grab you on new IP and then I'll stop talking. On new IP, that remains the biggest challenge in the mobile business. And making new hits in mobile is really, really, really hard. We're working on a bunch of titles about which we're very excited, but it's super hard to make hits. Hit ratios in the business are low.\nMatthew Thornton: Yes. Just one quick follow-up, Strauss, and that's really impressive that you got all those, by the way. I was keeping note. So that's impressive. On the -- any -- you talked about the next couple of years getting back to record bookings, which you've talked about for a while now. I think you talked about sequential growth. Does that apply to fiscal 2024? I guess just any early thoughts about how we can start thinking about fiscal 2024? And then I'll hop back in the queue. Thanks again.\nStrauss Zelnick : What we said today is we expect sequential growth and record results over the next couple of years, and that remains our expectations. We'll give you exact outlooks, including guidance in the coming months.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Matthew Cost with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nMatthew Cost : Hi, everybody. Thanks for taking the questions. Could you go into a little more detail about where you saw the strength in PC and console versus where some of the softness was? Was it more on recurrent consumer spending or unit sales? And how does that compare to past periods of macro weakness that you've seen?\nKarl Slatoff : So in terms of the strength of PC and console, really our strength has been in the catalog. I mean what we have said before is that -- what we've observed over this period of time is that folks that the big established franchises, particularly those that have been discounted did quite well over the last quarter, and that was our experience as well. So that part of the business did very well for us. A little bit tougher on sort of new releases that are still establishing their player basis. And when folks making difficult choices between games if they can afford to play, they're obviously going to gravitate towards things that they know that they're more familiar with. So, a little bit tougher on the new releases for the younger games. In terms of RCS, we already said on the mobile side, our in-app purchases were in line with expectations, and we continue to buck the trend in advertising. And we did experience some softness on the PC and console side in RCS. And again, that dynamic is what we expect that dynamic in this kind of economic environment. So really -- maybe it was a little bit more exacerbated than we originally expected, but we are continuing to see that.\nMatthew Cost : Great. Thank you. And then just on the cost savings side, is the cost reduction program, is it particularly focused on the mobile business or various areas? Or is it kind of just general corporate overhead?\nLainie Goldstein : It's a combination of our corporate departments and also some of our publishing functions. So it includes all of our labels. And it's outside of the $100 million plus in synergies between Take-Two and Zynga that we've talked about already that has to do with the acquisition of Zynga.\nMatthew Cost : Great. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Drew Crum with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nDrew Crum: Okay, thanks. Hey, guys, good afternoon. Just sticking with Zynga, I think you mentioned in your preamble that mobile trends had improved, maybe a little bit more detail there? And can you comment on whether Zynga's net bookings were up quarter-on-quarter. And if you've seen this improving trend line continue into the current quarter? And then I have a follow-up.\nKarl Slatoff : Yes, I think the way to characterize it is we have seen some improving trends and the way to describe it is it's really been some improvement off of the lows that we've seen in the past.\nDrew Crum: Okay. And then Strauss, some of your competitors have suggested the market is shifting towards these mega franchises. Curious if you agree with that premise? And does this in any way if you do, impact how you invest across your development pipeline? And are you inclined to hold back with the launch of titles until market conditions become more favorable? Thanks.\nStrauss Zelnick : Yes, we emphatically agree. The strategy of our company is to make hits across the board. We believe that we have the best collection of owned intellectual property across console, PC and mobile in the marketplace. And our approach has always been to bring out new iterations of beloved franchises. We have 11 franchises that have each sold over 5 million units in an individual release, well over 65 that have sold over 2 million units in an individual release. I don't think anyone else can say that. And look, we have the highest grossing entertainment property ever created of any sort of within our four walls, thanks to the focus of Rockstar. So that is very much our approach. And the truth of the entertainment business is, whether you like it or not, the entertainment business is a top 20 business on a good day and top 10 business on a less good day. We need to be there and that has always been our strategy.\nDrew Crum: Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Omar Dessouky with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nOmar Dessouky: Hi, everybody. So I'm looking at your grid, the grid of games that you plan to release from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2025 and next to mobile, you have 38 games. And it looks like 10 of them were not Zynga Games. Are you still confident that you can get all those games to scale? And is $100 million in annual bookings still the level that you aspire to as it was for Zynga's forever franchises prior to the acquisition? And then I have a follow-up, please.\nKarl Slatoff: Sure. I'll take that one. So I would say, the aspiration for any title that we released in the mobile context would be the $100 million of annual bookings. But I can tell you for sure that, that won't be the case release, with that entire release. So our expectation going in, again, the -- how we release mobile is you take it out, you see how it does, you invest a little bit more, you revamp it, you rebalance it, you invest a little bit more, and then you grow from there. What we know that there are going to be titles that we put out that will fall on the mobile side. But the idea is that we need to put the titles out in order to find the ones that can reach that $100 million level or plus. So that is certainly -- that is the strategy, and that's going to be our path going forward. So that's still our expectation.\nOmar Dessouky: Okay. And it's -- do you think versus when you acquired Zynga, it's going to be harder to get to that $100 million threshold, and will that affect kind of the number of new games that you guys will be potentially launching over the next year or two?\nStrauss Zelnick: No, I don't think the business has gotten easier or harder. I think it's pretty much what we expected. As I said, hit ratios in mobile are low, we really good about what's being developed.\nOmar Dessouky: And just as -- I have one quick follow-up here. So some experts have noticed that Google has begun sending rejection notices for ads exposures and formats that are not compliant with its new better ads experience policy. This poll this allows interruptive interstitial ads among other practices, and it was announced back in July. So are you starting to see the effects of this policy for Rollic hyper casual games on Android?\nStrauss Zelnick: We are not. We're largely compliant.\nOmar Dessouky: Okay. That's my question. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mario Lu with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nMario Lu: Great. Thanks for taking the question. The first one is on RCS this quarter in terms of the growth came in a bit below expectation. You mentioned that Zynga was in line and the weakness was from console PC. Any franchise to highlight that kind of came in below expectations or any factors that led to this underperformance.\nLainie Goldstein: No, there's nothing really to point out. It was really across several of our console and PC games.\nMario Lu: Okay. Got it. And then just a follow-up on NBA 2K. You mentioned that MyTeam's players were up 50% year-on-year, which is a fairly large amount. So are there any kind of main drivers to highlight there? And were these gains partially offset by declines potentially in MyCAREER mode? Or was it mostly additive? Thanks.\nKarl Slatoff: Yes. I wouldn't say that it would necessarily offset by declines in MyCAREER mode. I think that the goal for NBA is to -- and how we've been growing over the years and how our path to growth in the future is to get more players involved in more modes, so driving across all of the loans. Now we know that we're not going to get everybody to play the game a 100% across every single mode, but that is certainly the goal, because the more engagement, the better ultimately the RCS performance is for those titles and also the more loyal the audience and it's a much better path for us to grow. So our focus has really been on getting players across those modes, and we've had some great success, as you can see on -- not just on MyCAREER, but across the -- in MyTeam area, but across the board.\nMario Lu: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nEric Sheridan: Thank you for taking the questions. Maybe two, if I could. First, on the mobile front, obviously, we've lapped the launch of IDFA. And I wanted to get your perspective on whether you feel like, in terms of driving a mixture of user growth and in-game monetization and in-game engagement, whether you've successfully sort of realigned your marketing strategy in mobile to address a post-IDFA world or whether you're still thinking it's sort of a work in progress, so that once demand is back in the mobile landscape, you can sort of capitalize on it? That'd be number one. And number two, a competitor of yours talked about withdrawing or pulling back from the mobile shooter market earlier in the earnings season. I'd love to get your perspective on how you think about developing, implementing and sort of launching AAA titles either alongside traditional PC console titles in the mobile format? Or how we should be thinking about even mobile-only formats of what historically have been AAA type quality titles? Thanks, so much.\nKarl Slatoff: So in terms of the effect of IDFA, we've been living that for quite a while now. And I would certainly say that, that has stabilized. And I don't think we're expecting -- there's no surprises down the road that we're expecting at this point. And there's been some improvement in how we are able to target since then. So I think there's been some adjusting going on. I don't want to characterize that as we're sort of back to where we were, because that would be a mischaracterization. But we certainly feel like we've got our hands around it, and then we're going in the other direction. So that's positive in terms of our ability to target. I would also mention, too, that in the hypercasual space, it is a much wider funnel and targeting is not -- it doesn't require as much targeting as it does in the normal mobile business. So that's also helped our ability to attract new audiences.\nStrauss Zelnick: Yes. And on the second part of the question, we've said all along, and I said it today, the hit ratios in the mobile business are very low. And when we announced the combination with Zynga, the most current question was, well, obviously, you're going to take Take-Two IP to mobile is not great. And my answer was, that is potentially a very exciting opportunity, but it's really, really hard to do. One of our competitors has done it really well with the title, and we're impressed by that and admire it. But we have a healthy respect for how difficult it is. The vast majority of hits in mobile are native to mobile. They are not based on existing IP. They do not come from a console. I'm very optimistic that we're going to give it a try, and I'm really hopeful that we'll do well with it. But it's not a slam dunk.\nEric Sheridan : Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Creutz with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.\nDoug Creutz : Hey, thanks. Just in your commentary about some of the new release underperformance. You're essentially attributing to macro or at least partially due to macro, but there's been two other companies who have sort of had the same problem. You have several other patters that have had record launches in the quarter, and it seems from the data that's been released, overall console spending was pretty stable versus a year ago. What makes you think the issue is macro-related versus this is just the way the video game industry is going to be from now on? And if that's case, how does that cause you to rethink your pipeline going forward?\nStrauss Zelnick : It's a really good question. What causes us to believe that it's macro related is that we don't just pull our expectations out of the year. We based our expectations on prior performance of similarly rated titles within that genre. And so in the case of certain of these titles, we've had great scores and terrific critical acclaim and yet the unit sales were lower than expected on an apples-to-apples basis by comparison to prior releases and prior periods. So that is -- that sort of leads us to believe, okay, that's probably a macro result. But I don't mean to imply for minute that quality doesn't matter, quality does matter and the biggest titles will obviously continue to perform with regard to market conditions. So what you're saying is, does that mean you should only put out blockbusters and anything that's short of an expected blockbuster, you can't put out. I think the answer is semi-yes. We can't put out something that we think is going to be a B title. It's never been the case. We have to put out AAA titles. However, not everything is ever going to be Grand Theft Auto. It just isn't going to be that way. And we have shown that we have the ability to launch new franchises. In the case of Borderlands or more recently, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands. Going back farther BioShock, from Rockstar, Red Dead Redemption. These are new intellectual properties, and we were willing to take the risk and support our creative team's vision and passion, and we've been able to create big hits. That's not changing. And there's nothing in our recent performance that leads us to say, we shouldn't invest in this way to the contrary. I believe we should continue to invest in this way. But right now, is the market more selective? Sure. In tougher times when food and fuel is more expensive and people are a little worried, they're going to be more selective. And when they're more selective, they're going to go to promotional titles and they're going to go to blockbusters.\nDoug Creutz : Thanks, Strauss\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Clay Griffin with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question.\nClay Griffin : Thanks. Good evening. It sounds like this has been mostly in monetization, as I apologize if I missed it, but it would be helpful just to get a sense of overall engagement in the quarter as a metric for the market right now. It sounds like apart from the new releases that some of your base titles actually had pretty solid engagement. Is that fair?\nKarl Slatoff : Engagement has definitely been strong across the board. And I would characterize it certainly as a modernization -- as a monetization issue. And we've seen that not just on the PC and console business, but also in the mobile business as well. So, that is specifically engagement that seems to be -- is not the issue for us.\nClay Griffin : Right. And just a follow-up on that. Is there anything that you guys have seen to suggest that Game Pass may be changing the way people engage with new titles or just a sense of if that has had an impact in terms of engagement in the quarter over the last several quarters?\nStrauss Zelnick: I don't really think so. I mean, we don't make our frontline titles available day in date. We're thrilled to be in business with subscription services for our catalog titles at the appropriate time. We think that's the right way to support subscription. And subscription is still a relatively small business -- you're talking about businesses. I think the last announcement of Game Pass was 25 million subs. We're not talking about huge broad-based business yet. And in any case, no, I don't believe the business is cannibalizing our business.\nClay Griffin: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Martin Yang with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nMartin Yang: Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I have two. Can you first give us more details on Zynga's direct-to-consumer effort? Do you see a certain region or user cohort responded more strongly to the channel?\nStrauss Zelnick: No, we're not seeing any regional differences, particularly. I'm not sure we've been looking for them though, because it's really early still.\nMartin Yang: Got it. Thank you. My second question is on the impact of more discounting in December. And how would you characterize the environment in the March quarter, is discounting still affecting negatively on the guidance for March?\nStrauss Zelnick: I don't think that discounting in particular is driving our expectations for the quarter. What's driving our expectations for the quarter is just our perception of market demand.\nMartin Yang: Okay. Thanks, Strauss.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Matti Littunen with Bernstein.\nMatti Littunen: Just wondering if you changed your typical marketing approach for these new titles that launched in the holiday season and -- if not, do you plan to do that in the current quarter in response to what you're seeing in the market trends you discussed? Thank you.\nStrauss Zelnick: No, we didn't change our approach to marketing. Our marketing approach varies title by title and reflects our view at any given time for what the opportunity is and in the context of the cost of the marketing programs. But if your question is, did we create a sort of self-inflicted wound by somehow spending less, for example, on marketing and getting worse results? The answer is no. But equally, it's not like we've created a self-inflicted wound by spending more on marketing and not getting results. We tailored the marketing to the opportunity. Unfortunately, the opportunity set was a little smaller than we thought.\nMatti Littunen: Very clear. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Hickey with Benchmark. Please proceed with your question\nMike Hickey: Hey, Charles, Karl, Lainie thanks for taking my questions. Two from each, just curious, specifically, I know you haven't called out titles, but for the quarter on the weakness in recurrent spend the Grand Theft Auto Online and NBA 2K Live Service, did they meet your expectations for the quarter? And have you changed your forward view of growth from those games? Obviously, they're a big portion of your ex-oil live service business. And the second question, on your cost reduction plan, $50 million, do you feel like that's sort of a starting point or you sort of grow that as you think about it more over time? Or do you feel like that's enough. Thanks, guys.\nLainie Goldstein: So for the quarter, our NBA business was in line with our expectations. Our other titles were a bit lower than what we had expected. As I mentioned, our PC and our console business for RCS was overall lower than what we had expected. And for the $50 million, this is like an ongoing cost reduction initiative. So we expect this number will grow over time. So efficiency is one of our core tenants as a company. So we're always looking for efficiency throughout the organization. And these are permanent and structural changes to the organization's overall corporate overhead structure, so these are expenses that we expect to reduce our overall structure over time.\nMike Hickey: Thanks, Lainie.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Bazinet: I just had a slightly longer-term question. Can you guys talk a little bit about whether or not you're a believer in sort of cloud gaming moving to the fore over the next five years? And, if so, what implications, if any, does it have on how you think about the business, your business? Thanks.\nStrauss Zelnick: Yes. I mean, we\u2019ve been believers in our gaming. We were one of the first licensees, if not first license -- licensor, sorry, to Stadia, to support that project. But remember, cloud gaming is a technology. It's not a business model. It's a distribution technology. And our view is, broader distribution is always a good thing in the entertainment business. If we can reach more consumers with our properties, we're happy to do it as long as the terms make sense. And I think broader distribution over time probably benefits us in any number of ways, including the cost of distribution, which I believe will go down over time. That said, I've never felt like cloud gaming would be size -- would represent a seismic change. Because I think if you're prepared to pay $60 or $70 for frontline title, you're also prepared to buy a console. And I think Stadia found that out. So bringing high-quality titles to consumers who don't have consoles will probably have an effect around the edges, but I don't think it will be a revolution in the business, I think it will be more an evolution in the business. And there's still technical challenges to be addressed.\nJason Bazinet: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Matthew Thornton with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nMatthew Thornton: Yes, thanks. Hey, Strauss, another big picture question. As you look out over the next several years, maybe in the next 5 to 10 years, I'm curious, kind of, your thoughts on how AI can impact the business good or bad? Or again, what you see on the horizon as potential disruption opportunity? Just any thoughts there would be helpful, particularly how you're thinking about AI. Thanks, again.\nStrauss Zelnick: You know, I'm the first person to be skeptical of other people's side. And I would like to note that, AI stands for artificial intelligence, and there is no such thing as artificial intelligence. All that said, I'm really excited about what we're seeing right now with ChatGPT and other leaps forward in artificial intelligence and machine learning. And I do think that we'll be and others will be creating tools that will enhance our development and probably reduce some of the costs for what we have to do today. But I don't think you're going to see it have an effect on the overall cost structure of the business, because I think it will just raise the bar. I think any time you make things easier, we're going to want to do more and our teams will want to do more. The belief among college students, the ChatGPT is not going to allow them to just make a query in sending their homework. The problem is -- the question is describe what actually happened on the night of Paul Revere's ride, if that's the question, and everyone gets the same question, which you do in class and everyone uses ChatGPT, whoops, everyone's going to submit the same assay last time I checked. And so ChatGPT is today's hand calculator. When I was a kid, there was no such thing. I hate to admit, but it's true. So I had to do math longhand. And then hand calculators came along and parents were up in arms that thought, 'Oh, kids won't have to learn math anymore. And the answer is yes, you still have to learn math, turns out. You absolutely have to learn math. Like you have a tool that makes it easier to do. And ChatGPT is the same thing. We are ushering in a very exciting era of new tools. And they're going to allow our teams and our competitors' teams to do really interesting things more efficiently. So we're going to want to do more. We're going to want to be even more creative. And no, it's not going to allow someone to say, please develop the competitor to Grand Theft Auto that's better than Grand Theft Auto, and then they will just send it out and ship it digitally and then that will be that. People will try, but that won't happen.\nMatthew Thornton : Okay. Maybe I'll sneak in one -- a second one, if I could, as well. Just really around productivity. Obviously, you guys are pretty far along in the return to office. When you step back and think about that big pipeline and all the projects that you've laid out, how do you feel like things are progressing from a productivity standpoint now that, again, you're pretty far along in the return to office. Thanks again.\nStrauss Zelnick : We've been pretty flexible about return to office, and our teams have been great. One of the many wonderful things about working at Take-Two, the amazing people that we work with. We're more than 11,000 people strong around the world. And our attrition rate remains much, much lower than the industry average. And I think that's because -- this is an extraordinary place to work where we seek the best and the brightest on both the business and the creative side, and we encourage people to pursue their passions and excellence at the same time. So productivity is strong. Performance is strong. We probably never had a period this long with all of our titles showing up or performing. I believe in the last two years, we've had the best reviews and the best scores we've ever had. And that's why the business challenges are a bit frustrating, because our people are delivering. And we will deliver over time as long as we keep doing that, and that's the plan.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Strauss Zelnick for any closing comments.\nStrauss Zelnick: Thank you for joining us today. I wish we were giving you better news across the board. There is so much good news here, and we're really proud of it. As I said just a minute ago, the thing we're most proud of is our phenomenal colleagues all around the world to whom all of us are so grateful. And as for our results, we plan to do better. We thank you for your support.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Thanks, Strauss. As we focus on the remainder of the year and beyond, we remain steadfast in our commitment to providing the most captivating and engaging entertainment experiences for our audiences across all platforms and geographies. We believe this is the best strategy and path forward to achieving our goals, driving our expected long-term growth and bringing value to our shareholders. Turning to our upcoming releases. On February 24, Private Division and Intercept Games will launch Kerbal Space Program 2, its early access for PC on Steam, Epic Games Store and other storefronts. KSP 2 will bring an array of content for players to explore and the title promises to be the most visually impressive game in the franchise. Those that purchased KSP 2 in early access will help inform the future development of the game by providing feedback directly to its creators leading up to the full launch of the title. In addition, Private Division has announced several new projects. After us, a riveting exploration debenture game from Piccolo Studios is expected to launch this spring during fiscal 2024 for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series excellence. Private Division announced a publishing partnership with Bluebird team to develop a new survival harder game expected to launch after calendar 2024. And we unveiled our new Private Division development fund to support smaller independent teams with project financing and mentorship opportunities. On March 17, 2K and Visual Concepts will release WWE 2K23 for PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC on Steam. In celebration of John Cena's 20th anniversary as a WWE superstar, the 16-time World Champion's record-setting philanthropist and WWE 2K23 Executive soundtrack producer will be featured on the cover of each addition of the game. In addition, global music phenom Bad Bunny, 2022's most streamed artist in the world will make his WWE 2K debut as a preorder bonus. Building upon the success of WWE 2K22, this year's installment features a unique take on the 2K showcase, the introduction of the fan-favorite WarGames matches and expenses to several marquee games. Fans can look forward to a deep roster of WWE Superstars and Legends, including Roman Reigns, American Nightmare Cody Rhodes, Ronda Rousey, Brock Lesnar, Stone Cold Steve Austin and more. 2K will support the game with an array of post-launch content and may be purchased individually or through a season pass. Throughout the balance of the fiscal year, Rockstar Games will continue to support Grand Theft Auto Online with additional content updates. And 2K and Firaxis games will continue to release add-on content from Marvel's Midnight Suns and Sid Meier's Civilization VI: Leader Pass. In mobile, Zynga's Rollic studio will release a vast array of titles as they've done previously, while the label's other studios remain at work on a variety of games, including several in soft launch that we expect to release in fiscal 2024. We will have more to share on our pipeline when we report our fourth quarter results in May. I'll now turn the call over to Lainie. So in terms of the strength of PC and console, really our strength has been in the catalog. I mean what we have said before is that -- what we've observed over this period of time is that folks that the big established franchises, particularly those that have been discounted did quite well over the last quarter, and that was our experience as well. So that part of the business did very well for us. A little bit tougher on sort of new releases that are still establishing their player basis. And when folks making difficult choices between games if they can afford to play, they're obviously going to gravitate towards things that they know that they're more familiar with. So, a little bit tougher on the new releases for the younger games. In terms of RCS, we already said on the mobile side, our in-app purchases were in line with expectations, and we continue to buck the trend in advertising. And we did experience some softness on the PC and console side in RCS. And again, that dynamic is what we expect that dynamic in this kind of economic environment. So really -- maybe it was a little bit more exacerbated than we originally expected, but we are continuing to see that. Yes, I think the way to characterize it is we have seen some improving trends and the way to describe it is it's really been some improvement off of the lows that we've seen in the past. Sure. I'll take that one. So I would say, the aspiration for any title that we released in the mobile context would be the $100 million of annual bookings. But I can tell you for sure that, that won't be the case release, with that entire release. So our expectation going in, again, the -- how we release mobile is you take it out, you see how it does, you invest a little bit more, you revamp it, you rebalance it, you invest a little bit more, and then you grow from there. What we know that there are going to be titles that we put out that will fall on the mobile side. But the idea is that we need to put the titles out in order to find the ones that can reach that $100 million level or plus. So that is certainly -- that is the strategy, and that's going to be our path going forward. So that's still our expectation. Yes. I wouldn't say that it would necessarily offset by declines in MyCAREER mode. I think that the goal for NBA is to -- and how we've been growing over the years and how our path to growth in the future is to get more players involved in more modes, so driving across all of the loans. Now we know that we're not going to get everybody to play the game a 100% across every single mode, but that is certainly the goal, because the more engagement, the better ultimately the RCS performance is for those titles and also the more loyal the audience and it's a much better path for us to grow. So our focus has really been on getting players across those modes, and we've had some great success, as you can see on -- not just on MyCAREER, but across the -- in MyTeam area, but across the board. So in terms of the effect of IDFA, we've been living that for quite a while now. And I would certainly say that, that has stabilized. And I don't think we're expecting -- there's no surprises down the road that we're expecting at this point. And there's been some improvement in how we are able to target since then. So I think there's been some adjusting going on. I don't want to characterize that as we're sort of back to where we were, because that would be a mischaracterization. But we certainly feel like we've got our hands around it, and then we're going in the other direction. So that's positive in terms of our ability to target. I would also mention, too, that in the hypercasual space, it is a much wider funnel and targeting is not -- it doesn't require as much targeting as it does in the normal mobile business. So that's also helped our ability to attract new audiences. Engagement has definitely been strong across the board. And I would characterize it certainly as a modernization -- as a monetization issue. And we've seen that not just on the PC and console business, but also in the mobile business as well. So, that is specifically engagement that seems to be -- is not the issue for us."

            "name": "Lainie Goldstein",
            "content": "Thanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll discuss the key highlights from our third quarter, before reviewing our guidance for fiscal year 2023 and our fourth quarter. Please note that our third quarter results include our combination with Zynga, with respect to the comparability of our results relative to last year. Additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release. As Strauss mentioned, we delivered net bookings of $1.38 billion, which was slightly below our prior guidance, as consumers displayed more cautionary purchasing behaviors during the holiday season. As in prior periods of economic headwinds, full game sales from our catalog of industry-leading intellectual properties were relatively resilient. However, we felt pressure on some of our newer releases that are in earlier stages of building their player base, alongside softness in recurrent consumer spending. During the period, recurrent consumer spending rose 117% and accounted for 78% of net bookings. Zynga's in-app purchases performed in line with our revised expectations. However, this was offset by weakness in recurrent consumer spending for several of our console and PC games. Digitally delivered net bookings increased 72% and accounted for 95% of the total. During the quarter, 69% of console game sales were delivered digitally, up from 63% last year. GAAP net revenue increased 56% to $1.41 billion, and cost of revenue increased 97% to $692 million. Operating expenses increased by 123% to $889 million, primarily driven by the addition of Zynga, as well as higher marketing and stock-based compensation expenses. The GAAP net loss was $153 million, $0.91 per share, which was impacted by $302 million of amortization of acquired intangibles and $24 million of business acquisition costs. Our management tax rate for the period was 18% as compared to 60% in the prior year as a result of our combination with Zynga. We ended the quarter with over $1.1 billion of cash and short-term investments and paid down $200 million of revolver borrowings, reducing our debt to $3.1 billion. Turning to our guidance. I'll begin with our full fiscal year expectations. We now expect to deliver net bookings of $5.2 billion to $5.25 billion. Our forecast takes into account the current economic environment and consumer purchasing trends that we have been experiencing, which we expect to continue into the fourth quarter, including lower expectations for some of our recent game releases and softer recurrent consumer spending as well as the shift of an unannounced mobile title and a focus on enhanced profitability for our hyper-casual business. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Empires & Puzzles, Toon Blast, Rollic's hyper-casual mobile portfolio, and Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be 46% Zynga, 36% 2K, 17% Rockstar Games and 1% private division. We forecast our geographic net bookings split to be about 65% United States and 35% international. We expect recurrent consumer spending to grow by approximately 85% and represents 77% of total net bookings. Our digitally delivered net workings are expected to grow by approximately 60% and represent 95% of the total. Our forecast assumes that 74% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 68% last year. We expect to generate more than $400 million in non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow, and we expect to deploy approximately $170 million for capital expenditures. Our GAAP net revenue to range from $5.24 billion to $5.29 billion and cost of revenue to range from $2.53 billion to $2.55 billion, which includes approximately $694 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Total operating expenses are expected to range from $3.4 billion to $3.41 billion as compared to $1.5 billion last year. This increase reflects the inclusion of Zynga, business acquisition costs and higher personnel compensation and marketing expenses, which we anticipate will be slightly offset by our expected cost synergies from our integration with Zynga. As we've mentioned on prior calls, in light of the current backdrop, we have been evaluating cost savings opportunities that can structurally enhance our margin and make our company more efficient and nimble for the long-term. After a comprehensive review, we now believe that we can deliver over $50 million of annual savings, which we will begin to execute on this quarter opportunities include personnel, processes, infrastructure and other areas, particularly in publishing and corporate funding. This program is in addition to the over $100 million of annual cost synergies from our combination with Zynga and is not expected to impact the delivery of our robust multiyear pipeline. We expect the GAAP net loss ranging from $704 million to $721 million or $4.40 to $4.50 per share, which assumes the basic share count of 159.8 million shares. We expect our management tax rate to be 18% throughout the year. Now moving to our guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter. We project net bookings to range from $1.31 billion to $1.36 billion, compared to $846 million in the fourth quarter last year. The largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, and Empires and Puzzles, Toon Blast, Rollic's hyper-casual mobile portfolio, and WWE 2K23  We project recurrent consumer spending to grow approximately 105% and digitally delivered net book to increase approximately 70%. Our forecast assumes that 80% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up 75% last year. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $1.34 billion to $1.39 billion and cost of revenues to range from $688 million to $708 million, which includes approximately $198 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Operating expenses are expected to range from $871 million to $881 million. At the midpoint, this represents a 120% increase over last year. This increase reflects the inclusion of Zynga, business acquisition costs and higher marketing and personnel expenses, which we believe will be slightly offset by the realization of some of our anticipated cost synergies. And GAAP net loss is expected to range from $197 million to $214 million of $1.17 to $1.27 per share, which assumes a basic share count of 168 million shares. In closing, while we are disappointed to have lowered our outlook for the year, we are highly confident in our long-term growth potential. We believe that the actions we are taking now will position us to deliver sequential growth and record performance over the next several years, which we anticipate will drive meaningful shareholder value. I'd like to thank all of our stakeholders again for their support. Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Strauss. It's a combination of our corporate departments and also some of our publishing functions. So it includes all of our labels. And it's outside of the $100 million plus in synergies between Take-Two and Zynga that we've talked about already that has to do with the acquisition of Zynga. No, there's nothing really to point out. It was really across several of our console and PC games. So for the quarter, our NBA business was in line with our expectations. Our other titles were a bit lower than what we had expected. As I mentioned, our PC and our console business for RCS was overall lower than what we had expected. And for the $50 million, this is like an ongoing cost reduction initiative. So we expect this number will grow over time. So efficiency is one of our core tenants as a company. So we're always looking for efficiency throughout the organization. And these are permanent and structural changes to the organization's overall corporate overhead structure, so these are expenses that we expect to reduce our overall structure over time."

            "name": "Strauss Zelnick",
            "content": "Thanks, Nicole. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. During the third quarter, we continued to execute on our ambition to create the highest quality, most engaging interactive entertainment franchises in the industry to deliver them across an array of platforms and to captivate our global audiences. All of our new game releases and post-launch content have received significant critical acclaim, and we're pleased to have the highest catalog sales based on units sold in the Americas. The strength of our portfolio reflects the passion, vision, artistic acumen and hard work of our world-renowned development teams and studios, and we're immensely proud of our long-standing commitment to quality. Notwithstanding our creative achievements, our third quarter net bookings of $1.38 billion were slightly below our prior guidance. We believe that as a result of macroeconomic conditions, consumers shifted holiday spending toward established blockbuster franchises and titles that were offered with pricing promotions. While our catalog benefited from this trend, it affected the performance of certain of our new releases and recurrent consumer spending for some of our console and PC games. Despite the current market, we believe that our long-term success will be driven by our consistent ability to create the best entertainment experiences, including sequels of our beloved franchises and the introduction of engaging new intellectual properties. Sales of Grand Theft Auto V exceeded our expectations during the holiday season. And to date, the title has sold in more than 175 million units. During the quarter, Rockstar Games released an array of new content for both, Halloween and the holiday season as well as a new story-driven update Los Santos Drug Wars. The update launched in December and continues to deliver exciting new story and gameplay features to players across the winter season, including a new business, tax emissions and much more to come, which is continuous to drive stronger engagement with our player race. We were also pleased with the performance of Red Dead Redemption 2, which outpaced our expectations driven by successful holiday promotions and events. To-date, the title has sold in more than 50 million units. During the quarter, Rockstar Games continued to release new updates for Red Dead Online, including a new Halloween Hardcore Telegram Mission and new Call to Arms locations for Halloween and the holidays. We remain incredibly pleased with the enduring quality of these entertainment experiences. Grand Theft Auto V was ranked number three for units sold in the US during calendar year 2022 on all platforms and was number two overall for 2022 on Steam. Additionally, 2022 was GTA V's tenth consecutive year in the NPD top five for unit sales. Red Dead Redemption 2 also continues to resonate strongly with players, ranking as the number one selling game on Steam for the quarter end, number three for 2022. NBA 2K23, which remains the number one selling sports title in North America continues to expand its audience and to date has sold in over 8 million units. Full game sales for NBA 2K23 are up 3% year-over-year, and MyTEAM users grew more than 50% over last year, as players enjoyed assembling the rosters of the NBA's all-time greatest stars to dominate the competition. In addition, NBA 2K23 Arcade Edition remains the number one game in Apple Arcade since its launch in October. 2K and HB Studios supported PGA TOUR 2K23 with the limited-edition holiday bundle that included NBA 2K23 and new content featuring branded gear from Barstool Sports, 100 Thieves, and Dude Perfect. HB Studios will release more content and features, including the addition of Pebble Beach, cosplay functionality and ranked patch making. On December 2, 2K and Firaxis Games launched Marvel's Midnight Suns on Windows PC via Steam and Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. The title launched a critical acclaim with BGC rating at a five out of five, calling it a modern strategy classic. PC Gamer said it was completely brilliant, scoring at 88 out of 100 and Rock Paper Shotgun called it one of the best Superhero games. The title is being supported with a series of post-launch content that can be purchased individually or as part of the game seasons pass. During the quarter, Zynga's in-app purchases performed in line with our expectations, and we saw mobile trends improve from prior lows, particularly during the holiday season. The label continued to experience strong engagement among its active players and we believe that we're maintaining our global market share. Our advertising business outpaced the broader industry, as we continue to introduce new ad supply and products, optimize our networks to increase ad yields and roll out Chart boost throughout our inventory. A few key highlights of our mobile offerings during the quarter include Empires & Puzzles was a top performer due to strong seasonal content and Black Friday offerings. This is one of our first titles to leverage our direct-to-consumer platform for in-app purchases, which we believe can enhance significantly the margins for our mobile portfolio over the next few years. Rollic's Balls'n Ropes reached the number one spot for most downloaded game in the US in December, giving Rollic a look a total of 20 games that have reached the number one or number two spot in Apple's US App Store. We acquired Popcore, which offers a unique balance of hyper-casual experiences that also prioritize long-term player retention rates. This strengthens our leadership among hyper-casual publishers with respect to downloads in revenue. Following the acquisition, Popcore's game Tap Away reached the number one spot for most downloaded game multiple times throughout the quarter in Apple's US App Store. Zynga's casino titles remained resilient with Game of Thrones Slots posting its best quarter ever. Top 11 had a strong quarter, driven by various in-game updates celebrating the World Cup. CSR Racing 2 released Race Pass, which features innovative new rewards that are driving stronger retention and monetization. Our combination with Zynga remains highly accretive to our business. We remain committed to delivering our planned synergies, and we're well on our way to exceed our target of $100 million in annual cost savings within the first two years post close. During the quarter, recurrent consumer spending rose 117% and accounted for 78% of net bookings. Turning to our outlook. We're operating in an environment that is, in many ways, more challenging than we anticipated. And we're lowering our fiscal 2023 net bookings guidance to $5.2 billion to $5.25 billion to take this backdrop into account. To be clear, I take personal responsibility for our revised downward guidance. We believe there's always more to achieve, particularly when we fall short of our expectations. We've embarked on a company-wide cost reduction program that will optimize our expense structure, while also positioning us to deliver on our anticipated growth trajectory. We expect to achieve savings in excess of $50 million as a result of this initiative. Our balance sheet remains strong, allowing us to navigate these uncertain times with confidence. We've always managed our business for the long term as we achieve the powerful synergies from our combination with Zynga, release new titles from our robust multiyear pipeline and execute on our cost savings initiatives we expect to deliver sequential growth and record performance over the next several years. Our business and creative teams have done a phenomenal job during these challenging times, and I'd like to thank all of our colleagues for their tireless work. I'd also like to thank our shareholders for their continued support. I look forward to sharing our progress with you on all of our key initiatives. I'll now turn the call over to Karl. Thanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for their firm commitment to creativity, innovation and efficiency as we continue to navigate a challenging economic landscape. I'd also like to express our appreciation to our shareholders for their continued support. We'll now take your questions. Operator? Thanks, Eric. I appreciate it. To answer your question, we have enhanced advertising within the Zynga portfolio. Certain titles within that portfolio did not have advertising and now do. And at 2K, with regard to their mobile titles, there's no change. With regard to console titles, we have a limited amount of advertising, but there's no change there as well. With regard to direct-to-consumer, that's a new initiative for us and for the team at Zynga that's being rolled out modestly. We are seeing early signs of success. And obviously, that has a very significant effect on our contribution margins. Well, I'll see how I do it then you can determine what your follow-up is like. So in terms of the mobile market, look, the reason we were interested in combining with Zynga is we believe that mobile will continue to be the fastest-growing part of the interactive entertainment business, and we still are of that belief. Yes, there's been some year-over-year pressure, which is, in our view, related to the economy primarily and to a lesser extent, probably, sort of, post-pandemic changes in demand. We think those are near term. And in fact, the trends recently are quite positive in terms of demand. And Zynga has the best portfolio of mobile games in the business. Most of our competitors, good as they may be, have one, two, three, four titles that matter. We have a whole lot more than that. We have these forever franchises. And we also are blessed with phenomenal leadership in that division. So we remain highly optimistic about the growth in the future. I'm not sure I can give you an exact growth rate, but I do think it will continue to be a rapidly growing part of the business. It also diversifies us. We attach a different audience on the mobile side, skews more female. It skews older. And by having a diverse company that has console and PC and mobile titles, we address every part of the interactive entertainment business, and we find ourselves as one of the top three pure plays in the business. With regard to our expectations about in-app purchases and ad revenue going forward, look, in-app purchases still are only relevant for about 10% of the market for 90% of the users, that's not something they're interested in. So if you're selective and careful about how you target it, advertising makes all the sense in the world, because we ought to be able to find a way to monetize all of the viewing, all of the engagement, not just the engagement that leads to spending, particularly because we're not in the toll booth business. We're in the entertainment business. And we want to be able to deliver titles that consumers can enjoy without regard to spending. Spending should enhance the experience for sure, and it does. But in order to be commercial, we should have a robust advertising business that's not intrusive, that's positive for the consumer than consumer experience, and that's exactly what Zynga is building. With regards to new IP -- I'll finish your, I wrote down your questions. So let me just grab you on new IP and then I'll stop talking. On new IP, that remains the biggest challenge in the mobile business. And making new hits in mobile is really, really, really hard. We're working on a bunch of titles about which we're very excited, but it's super hard to make hits. Hit ratios in the business are low. What we said today is we expect sequential growth and record results over the next couple of years, and that remains our expectations. We'll give you exact outlooks, including guidance in the coming months. Yes, we emphatically agree. The strategy of our company is to make hits across the board. We believe that we have the best collection of owned intellectual property across console, PC and mobile in the marketplace. And our approach has always been to bring out new iterations of beloved franchises. We have 11 franchises that have each sold over 5 million units in an individual release, well over 65 that have sold over 2 million units in an individual release. I don't think anyone else can say that. And look, we have the highest grossing entertainment property ever created of any sort of within our four walls, thanks to the focus of Rockstar. So that is very much our approach. And the truth of the entertainment business is, whether you like it or not, the entertainment business is a top 20 business on a good day and top 10 business on a less good day. We need to be there and that has always been our strategy. No, I don't think the business has gotten easier or harder. I think it's pretty much what we expected. As I said, hit ratios in mobile are low, we really good about what's being developed. We are not. We're largely compliant. Yes. And on the second part of the question, we've said all along, and I said it today, the hit ratios in the mobile business are very low. And when we announced the combination with Zynga, the most current question was, well, obviously, you're going to take Take-Two IP to mobile is not great. And my answer was, that is potentially a very exciting opportunity, but it's really, really hard to do. One of our competitors has done it really well with the title, and we're impressed by that and admire it. But we have a healthy respect for how difficult it is. The vast majority of hits in mobile are native to mobile. They are not based on existing IP. They do not come from a console. I'm very optimistic that we're going to give it a try, and I'm really hopeful that we'll do well with it. But it's not a slam dunk. It's a really good question. What causes us to believe that it's macro related is that we don't just pull our expectations out of the year. We based our expectations on prior performance of similarly rated titles within that genre. And so in the case of certain of these titles, we've had great scores and terrific critical acclaim and yet the unit sales were lower than expected on an apples-to-apples basis by comparison to prior releases and prior periods. So that is -- that sort of leads us to believe, okay, that's probably a macro result. But I don't mean to imply for minute that quality doesn't matter, quality does matter and the biggest titles will obviously continue to perform with regard to market conditions. So what you're saying is, does that mean you should only put out blockbusters and anything that's short of an expected blockbuster, you can't put out. I think the answer is semi-yes. We can't put out something that we think is going to be a B title. It's never been the case. We have to put out AAA titles. However, not everything is ever going to be Grand Theft Auto. It just isn't going to be that way. And we have shown that we have the ability to launch new franchises. In the case of Borderlands or more recently, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands. Going back farther BioShock, from Rockstar, Red Dead Redemption. These are new intellectual properties, and we were willing to take the risk and support our creative team's vision and passion, and we've been able to create big hits. That's not changing. And there's nothing in our recent performance that leads us to say, we shouldn't invest in this way to the contrary. I believe we should continue to invest in this way. But right now, is the market more selective? Sure. In tougher times when food and fuel is more expensive and people are a little worried, they're going to be more selective. And when they're more selective, they're going to go to promotional titles and they're going to go to blockbusters. I don't really think so. I mean, we don't make our frontline titles available day in date. We're thrilled to be in business with subscription services for our catalog titles at the appropriate time. We think that's the right way to support subscription. And subscription is still a relatively small business -- you're talking about businesses. I think the last announcement of Game Pass was 25 million subs. We're not talking about huge broad-based business yet. And in any case, no, I don't believe the business is cannibalizing our business. No, we're not seeing any regional differences, particularly. I'm not sure we've been looking for them though, because it's really early still. I don't think that discounting in particular is driving our expectations for the quarter. What's driving our expectations for the quarter is just our perception of market demand. No, we didn't change our approach to marketing. Our marketing approach varies title by title and reflects our view at any given time for what the opportunity is and in the context of the cost of the marketing programs. But if your question is, did we create a sort of self-inflicted wound by somehow spending less, for example, on marketing and getting worse results? The answer is no. But equally, it's not like we've created a self-inflicted wound by spending more on marketing and not getting results. We tailored the marketing to the opportunity. Unfortunately, the opportunity set was a little smaller than we thought. Yes. I mean, we've been believers in our gaming. We were one of the first licensees, if not first license -- licensor, sorry, to Stadia, to support that project. But remember, cloud gaming is a technology. It's not a business model. It's a distribution technology. And our view is, broader distribution is always a good thing in the entertainment business. If we can reach more consumers with our properties, we're happy to do it as long as the terms make sense. And I think broader distribution over time probably benefits us in any number of ways, including the cost of distribution, which I believe will go down over time. That said, I've never felt like cloud gaming would be size -- would represent a seismic change. Because I think if you're prepared to pay $60 or $70 for frontline title, you're also prepared to buy a console. And I think Stadia found that out. So bringing high-quality titles to consumers who don't have consoles will probably have an effect around the edges, but I don't think it will be a revolution in the business, I think it will be more an evolution in the business. And there's still technical challenges to be addressed. You know, I'm the first person to be skeptical of other people's side. And I would like to note that, AI stands for artificial intelligence, and there is no such thing as artificial intelligence. All that said, I'm really excited about what we're seeing right now with ChatGPT and other leaps forward in artificial intelligence and machine learning. And I do think that we'll be and others will be creating tools that will enhance our development and probably reduce some of the costs for what we have to do today. But I don't think you're going to see it have an effect on the overall cost structure of the business, because I think it will just raise the bar. I think any time you make things easier, we're going to want to do more and our teams will want to do more. The belief among college students, the ChatGPT is not going to allow them to just make a query in sending their homework. The problem is -- the question is describe what actually happened on the night of Paul Revere's ride, if that's the question, and everyone gets the same question, which you do in class and everyone uses ChatGPT, whoops, everyone's going to submit the same assay last time I checked. And so ChatGPT is today's hand calculator. When I was a kid, there was no such thing. I hate to admit, but it's true. So I had to do math longhand. And then hand calculators came along and parents were up in arms that thought, 'Oh, kids won't have to learn math anymore. And the answer is yes, you still have to learn math, turns out. You absolutely have to learn math. Like you have a tool that makes it easier to do. And ChatGPT is the same thing. We are ushering in a very exciting era of new tools. And they're going to allow our teams and our competitors' teams to do really interesting things more efficiently. So we're going to want to do more. We're going to want to be even more creative. And no, it's not going to allow someone to say, please develop the competitor to Grand Theft Auto that's better than Grand Theft Auto, and then they will just send it out and ship it digitally and then that will be that. People will try, but that won't happen. We've been pretty flexible about return to office, and our teams have been great. One of the many wonderful things about working at Take-Two, the amazing people that we work with. We're more than 11,000 people strong around the world. And our attrition rate remains much, much lower than the industry average. And I think that's because -- this is an extraordinary place to work where we seek the best and the brightest on both the business and the creative side, and we encourage people to pursue their passions and excellence at the same time. So productivity is strong. Performance is strong. We probably never had a period this long with all of our titles showing up or performing. I believe in the last two years, we've had the best reviews and the best scores we've ever had. And that's why the business challenges are a bit frustrating, because our people are delivering. And we will deliver over time as long as we keep doing that, and that's the plan. Thank you for joining us today. I wish we were giving you better news across the board. There is so much good news here, and we're really proud of it. As I said just a minute ago, the thing we're most proud of is our phenomenal colleagues all around the world to whom all of us are so grateful. And as for our results, we plan to do better. We thank you for your support."

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we delivered another consecutive quarter of solid results with net bookings of $1.5 billion. We experienced healthy player engagement, driven by exciting new game releases, post-launch content updates and bold beats for many of our mobile offerings, even as consumers continue to navigate the effects of various macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. We made excellent progress with our integration of Zynga, and we remain highly optimistic about the vast long-term growth potential for the mobile industry, which is expected to reach over $160 billion in gross bookings within the next four years. Some of our key achievements in the period include: we successfully reached our 100-day integration milestone at the end of August. Zynga's President, Frank Gibeau and his leadership team have evaluated our mobile portfolio, including existing games and titles in development, and they've identified numerous opportunities to enhance our performance. These initiatives include reorganizing several teams, sharing development tools, resources and best practices across our mobile studios, conceptualizing new bold beats and leveraging Zynga's highly valuable publishing platform, which is now even stronger following the recent acquisition of Storemaven. We're also starting to expand our direct-to-consumer efforts more meaningfully across our mobile portfolio further to enhance profitability. We remain committed to delivering $500 million of annual net bookings opportunities over time. The Zynga team has been working with our other labels to explore potential creative projects. As part of this process, we've identified certain underrepresented genres in our mobile portfolio that we believe we can pursue more aggressively over time. Our efforts to deliver cost synergies are tracking extremely well, and we're now confident that we can achieve over $100 million of annual savings within the first two years post close. I'd like to thank Frank, his leadership team and all of our new colleagues at Zynga once again for helping to make our combination happen so seamlessly. We're thrilled to have Zynga as part of our Take-Two family. Turning to our second quarter results. Our net bookings performance was within our guidance range, led by Grand Theft Auto V, which exceeded our expectations and to date has sold more than 170 million units worldwide. Starting July 26, Grand Theft Auto Online launched its latest major update, The Criminal Enterprises, introducing expanded gameplay across the Criminal Careers of Executives, Bikers, Nightclub Owners, and Gunrunners, as well as the opportunity to work with federal agents to uncover a criminal conspiracy in the new Operation Paper Trail series of Contact Missions. The update also featured a range of new vehicles, and more, including the new Community Series, showcasing some of the most fun and unique experiences created by players across the globe. This major update also delivered a host of overall improvements to the gameplay experience, including increased payouts across a wide array of activities and several other player-requested features. The Criminal Enterprises was very well received, and we have seen millions of players engaging with significant new features such as the ability to run Sell Missions in Private Lobbies, New Weapon Wheel Controls, and more. In addition, Rockstar Games GTA+ subscription service continues to grow its members who enjoy a rotation of numerous exclusive in-game benefits, including vehicles, upgrades, and gear every month. On September 9th, 2K and Visual Concepts successfully launched NBA 2K23, with the title earning an 80+ Metacritic rating at launch, and receiving praise for raising the bar on the top-selling sports title in the U.S. To date, NBA 2K23 has sold-in nearly 5 million units, alongside significant growth in virtual currency sales and a higher average selling price compared to NBA 2K22. Player engagement has been very strong, with more than 2 million daily active users, and 4% growth in average days played. We believe that NBA 2K23 will continue to grow its audience, as the title provides a year-round experience for its fervent community of players throughout the world. I'd like to congratulate the teams at 2K and Visual Concepts for once again delivering such a stellar basketball experience. The franchise\u2019s momentum extends beyond the core console experience, with NBA 2K22 Arcade Edition for Apple Arcade remaining the #1 game on the platform, and our recent launch of NBA 2K23 Arcade Edition offering many new features and improvements. Furthermore, NBA 2K Online in China continues to be the #1 PC online sports game in the country with nearly 59 million registered users. Red Dead Redemption 2 is continuing to impress, with sell-in of more than 46 million units worldwide to-date and more active players in this second quarter than we have seen for the comparable period in previous years. 2K supported WWE 2K22 and Tiny Tina\u2019s Wonderlands with the final downloadable content packs for each title, which were made available individually and as part of the games\u2019 Season Passes. During the quarter, recurrent consumer spending rose 76% and accounted for 80% of net bookings. Zynga continued to experience strong engagement amongst its active players, and we believe that we are maintaining our market share globally. Our mobile business delivered mid-teens growth in advertising bookings on a year-over-year basis, outperforming the broader industry. At the same time, in-app purchases continued to be under some pressure due to current macroeconomic conditions. Some key highlights of our mobile offerings during the quarter include: The Rollic business remained very strong and exceeded our plan. Notably, Rollic surpassed 2 billion lifetime downloads worldwide and has now launched 19 titles that have reached the #1 or #2 most downloaded game position in the U.S. App Store. Several of Zynga\u2019s titles celebrated milestones, including the 2nd anniversary of Harry Potter: Puzzles and Spells; the 10th anniversary of Farmville; and the 15th anniversary of Zynga Poker. Each of these anniversaries was supported with an array of in-game events and unique content offerings. Zynga unveiled several high-profile brand integrations, including Socialpoint\u2019s partnership with AMC Network\u2019s The Walking Dead in Dragon City and Monster Legends; CSR2\u2019s debut of Pagani\u2019s new multi-million-dollar Utopia hypercar; and Game of Thrones Slots Casino launched a new ingame event, Week of the Dragon, in conjunction with HBO\u2019s new hit fantasy series, House of the Dragon. Turning to our outlook, we now expect to deliver net bookings of $5.4 billion to $5.5 billion in fiscal 2023. Our reduced forecast reflects shifts in our pipeline, fluctuations in FX rates, and a more cautious view of the current macroeconomic backdrop, particularly in mobile. Lainie will provide more detail on our outlook shortly. Despite these headwinds and their effect on our guidance for the year, we remain highly confident in our diverse and extensive development pipeline that we expect will deliver us sequential growth and record performance over the next several years. Take-Two has a proven strategy and consistent track record of success, driven by our core tenets: We aspire to be the most creative, the most innovative, and the most efficient entertainment company in the world. As we strive to capitalize on the numerous opportunities ahead of us, we are committed to creating significant long-term value for our shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Karl.\nKarl Slatoff: I'd like to begin by thanking our teams for delivering another strong quarter, which reflects our ability to captivate and engage audiences consistently by delivering the highest-quality entertainment experiences across all platforms. I\u2019ll now discuss our recent releases. On October 14th , 2K and HB Studios launched PGA TOUR 2K23, the latest entry in our golf simulation franchise, to positive community sentiment and great critical acclaim, including GameSpot calling the title \u201cThe best simulation golf game ever made\u201d. PGA TOUR 2K23 features golf icon and all-time sports great, Tiger Woods, and celebrates his legacy by introducing him as both a playable in-game pro and an Executive Director who advised the game\u2019s development team. The game features several new additions and improvements, including an enhanced roster of male and female pros; the ability to play as NBA legends Michael Jordan and Steph Curry; a Topgolf mode; a deeper array of personalization options and gear; licensed courses and the ability to design original courses; and multiplayer offerings. HB Studios will continue to support the game with additional pros and courses, as well as seasonal updates and the Clubhouse Pass. On October 21st, 2K and Gearbox Software released New Tales from the Borderlands, a choice-based, narrative adventure game that is a successor to the beloved Telltale Games title. The franchise has always been an incredible canvas for storytelling and we are pleased to add this new offering to the portfolio. On November 2nd, Private Division and Roll7 released Finding the Flowzone, the second and final DLC expansion for the critically acclaimed skateboarding action-platformer, OlliOlli World. The release has received praise from critics including Eurogamer who commended Finding the Flowzone as a \u201cfond goodbye to this magnificent game,\u201d and stating that the expansion \u201cis completely rad.\u201d Now, I will discuss our announced offerings for the balance of Fiscal 2023 and beyond. On December 2nd, 2K and Firaxis Games will launch Marvel's Midnight Suns on Windows PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5. The Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch versions will follow at a later date. In support of the upcoming launch, 2K has produced five short videos that are being released weekly on Marvel Entertainment\u2019s YouTube channel, which provides the backstory of how the game\u2019s lead character, Lilith, became the Mother of Demons, and how Super Heroes like Blade, Magik, Ghost Rider and Nico Minoru came together to form the young core of the Midnight Suns. During the fourth quarter, 2K and Visual Concepts will launch WWE 2K23. Building upon the success of 2K22, which had nearly 450 million matches played and 10 million hours of game content viewed on Twitch, fans can look forward to the series once again redefining interactive entertainment within the squared circle. We are grateful to have such a supportive and collaborative partnership with WWE, and 2K will have more to share about WWE 2K23 in the coming months. On February 24th, Private Division and Intercept Games will launch Kerbal Space Program 2, the sequel to the beloved rocket building sim, in Early Access for PC on Steam, Epic Games Store, and other digital storefronts. KSP2 will bring an array of content at the launch of Early Access, making this the most visually impressive KSP game yet. The game will also feature improved tutorials and user onboarding to provide players with the necessary knowledge to excel at space flight. Built from the ground up, KSP2 will also introduce the ability to customize and paint vehicles, leading to deeper personalization and expression in every build. Those that purchase KSP2 in Early Access will help inform the future development of the game by providing feedback directly to Intercept Games leading up to the full launch of the title. We can\u2019t wait for the incredibly passionate KSP community to take flight in this new entry to the series. Throughout the balance of the fiscal year, Rockstar Games will continue to support Grand Theft Auto Online with additional major content updates, alongside popular annual seasonal-themed offerings and more. o In mobile, Zynga\u2019s Rollic studio will continue to release a consistent cadence of titles, while the label\u2019s other studios remain hard at work on a variety of offerings, including several titles that are currently in soft launch and expected to release in Fiscal Year 2024. Turning to eSports, the NBA 2K League is currently gearing up for its sixth season, which will tip off in Spring 2023. Last month, the League announced a landmark agreement with Australia\u2019s National Basketball League to launch an expansion team, NBL Oz Gaming. Not only is this the first time an Australian professional sports league has joined a global esports league, but it also marks our third expansion team from outside of North America. We remain very excited about the continued growth and success of the NBA 2K League. In closing, we believe that Take-Two is home to the best talent in our industry across all segments of interactive entertainment. With an expanding portfolio of the most exciting and commercially successful owned intellectual property, and the ability to deliver consistently deeply engaging and captivating entertainment experiences to a broad array of audiences around the world, we believe that we are well-positioned to deliver long-term value for our shareholders. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Lainie.\nLainie Goldstein: Thanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll discuss the key highlights from our second quarter before reviewing our guidance for fiscal year 2023 and our third quarter. Please note that our second quarter results include our combination with Zynga, which affects the comparability of our results relative to last year. Additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release. As Strauss mentioned, our combination with Zynga is tracking very well, from the progress we are making against our integration milestones with the net bookings and cost synergy realization that we are working towards and our highly complementary company cultures. We have great confidence that over the long term, our portfolio is poised to benefit from the significant expected growth in mobile gaming, evolving player dynamics towards more immersive mobile content and our massive combined scale, which will enable our teams to cross-promote titles and build stronger tools to connect with new users. During the quarter, we identified additional cost savings opportunities, and we now feel confident that we can deliver over $100 million of annual synergies within the first two years post close. We're also evaluating other efficiencies across our core businesses while ensuring that we have the appropriate resources to deliver on our significant growth prospects. Our second quarter results were solid, and we delivered net bookings of $1.5 billion, which was within our prior guidance range. The movement in foreign currency exchange rates negatively affected our net bookings by approximately 1%. With consumers navigating ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties, we believe that our financial performance truly demonstrates the incredible quality of our games and the significant value that our interactive entertainment experiences provide to our players. During the period, recurrent consumer spending rose 76% and accounted for 80% of net bookings. NBA 2K and Rollic\u2019s hyper-casual mobile portfolio outperformed our plans, while we experienced some softness across other parts of our portfolio as the interactive entertainment industry faced continued headwinds. Digitally-delivered net bookings increased 62% and accounted for 94% of the total. During the quarter, 73% of console game sales were delivered digitally, up from 65% last year. GAAP net revenue increased 62% to $1.4 billion and cost of revenue increased 56% to $714 million. Operating expenses increased by 144% to $932 million, primarily driven by the addition of Zynga; and business acquisition and higher personnel costs; which was partly offset by lower console and PC marketing expenses. And, GAAP net loss was $257 million, or $1.54, which was impacted by $320 million of amortization of acquired intangibles and $37 million of business acquisition costs. Our management tax rate for the period was 18% as compared to 16% in the prior year as a result of our combination with Zynga. We ended the quarter with over $1.3 billion of Cash and Short-Term Investments and $3.3 billion of debt. Turning to our guidance, I\u2019ll begin with our full fiscal year expectations. As Strauss mentioned, we are revising our guidance, and we now expect to deliver net bookings of $5.4 to $5.5 billion. Approximately 70% of the downward revision reflects lowered expectations for our mobile business and shifts in our release slate, while the balance reflects an updated view for the rest of our portfolio, based on current business trends across the interactive entertainment industry. Our guidance reflects $50 million of FX headwinds. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Empires & Puzzles, Rollic\u2019s hyper-casual mobile portfolio, Toon Blast, and Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be 45% Zynga which includes our former T2 mobile titles, 36% 2K, 18% Rockstar Games, and 1% Private Division. We forecast our geographic net bookings split to be about 60% United States and 40% International. We now expect recurrent consumer spending to grow by approximately 90% and represent 77% of total net bookings. Our digitally-delivered Net Bookings are expected to grow by approximately 70% and represent 96% of the total. Our forecast assumes that 75% of console game sales will be delivered-digitally, up from 68% last year. We expect to generate more than $650 million in non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow and we expect to deploy approximately $150 million for capital expenditures. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $5.41 billion to $5.51 billion and cost of revenue to range from $2.61 billion to $2.64 billion, which includes approximately $694 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Total operating expenses are expected to range from $3.4 billion to $3.42 billion as compared to $1.5 billion last year. This increase reflects the inclusion of Zynga; business acquisition costs; and higher personnel, marketing, and IT expenses; which we anticipate will be slightly offset by our expected cost synergies. In light of the current economic backdrop, we continue to monitor our costs prudently to find potential areas of savings this year, while being mindful of the resources we need to support our robust multiyear release schedule. And, we expect a GAAP net loss ranging from $631 million to $674 million, or $3.95 to $4.22 per share, which assumes a basic share count of 159.8 million shares. Our revised forecast includes an increase in amortization for intangible assets acquired from Zynga based on updated valuation estimates. We expect our management tax rate to be 18% throughout the year. Now, moving to our guidance for the fiscal third quarter: We project net bookings to range from $1.41 billion to $1.46 billion, compared to $866 million in the third quarter last year. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Empires and Puzzles, Rollic\u2019s hyper-casual mobile portfolio, and Toon Blast. We project recurrent consumer spending to grow approximately 125% and digitally-delivered net bookings to increase approximately 80%. Our forecast assumes that 72% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 63% last year. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $1.43 billion to $1.48 billion and cost of revenue to range from $690 million to $710 million, which includes approximately $198 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Operating expenses are expected to range from $897 to $907 million. At the midpoint, this represents a 126% increase over last year. This increase reflects the inclusion of Zynga; business acquisition costs; and higher marketing, which we believe will be slightly offset by the realization of some of our anticipated cost synergies and cost savings efforts. And, GAAP net loss is expected to range from $142 million to $160 million, or $0.85 to $0.95 per share, which assumes a basic share count of 167.7 million shares. In closing, we continue to focus on our execution against an uncertain economic backdrop, and we are highly optimistic about our future growth trajectory. Our long-term development pipeline is stronger than ever, and we are excited to deliver high-profile sequels and engaging new properties that have the potential to enhance our financial profile even further. At the same time, we are confident in our ability to create significant shareholder value as we continue our integration of Zynga by collaborating on new creative projects, leveraging our combined scale, unlocking greater potential from their mobile platform, and entering new business models and geographies. Thank you. I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Strauss.\nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for delivering another solid quarter. And to our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued support. We'll now take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Eric Handler with MKM Partners.\nEric Handler: Wonder if you could just give us a little bit of insight into the mobile business. Do you feel like we're sort of close to a stabilization for that business? And we've been hearing everything -- a lot of different things about what's going on in mobile now, specifically top games are doing well, it's the smaller games that are having some problems. Are you seeing issues with maintaining DAUs or is it spending? Any insight you can give would be greatly appreciated.\nStrauss Zelnick: Look, engagement is very stable. We got a lot of terrific hit titles at Zynga. It's what we like about the company. Unlike many mobile businesses of this kind of scale, our bookings are not concentrated in two or three titles. We have more than 10 big titles and more coming. So engagement is incredibly solid. We are seeing some pressure on in-game spending. We also have a great story in advertising bookings because our advertising bookings are up mid-double digits year-over-year. And so there are plenty of bright spots in the business as well. The most important spot, people love mobile games. They love our mobile games, they continue to play them, and we're seeing no significant change in engagement across our titles. In terms of what I expect to change, look, it's very hard to say. I think that's -- it's anyone's guess what the economy will do. My own opinion, and it's really just one person's opinion, as we're looking -- we should be looking at three to six more months of downward pressure. And I expect by the end of '23, we'll be in good shape.\nEric Handler: Great. That's helpful. I wonder, just as a follow-up, it looks like just going between your company presentations, it looks like your pipeline of games from fiscal '23 to fiscal '25 is unchanged. Is that a pretty fair assessment?\nStrauss Zelnick: It is. We have 87 titles coming across mobile, PC and console. And it's the most robust pipeline we've ever had certainly and one would argue, one of the most robust pipelines in the industry.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Uerkwitz with Jefferies.\nAndrew Uerkwitz: I guess there's a lot of frustration. You had the S-4 out earlier in the year. We've gotten two cuts here. And the move in the pipeline around is part of the blame. What -- is there anything you guys can share that gives you confidence that there's going to be growth next year, especially in the core Take-Two? It looks like part of the cut is half 2K, if I'm doing my math right. So just curious, what is giving you that confidence or anything you can share that gives us the confidence to go along with it here?\nStrauss Zelnick: It's driven by the pipeline, of course. So we know what the release schedule is and we feel really good about it. And if we didn't, we wouldn't call for a sequential growth and record results in the next three years. But I understand the frustration. And look, we call it as we see it and I think we're known for that. Had we expected where we were right now, then we wouldn't be guiding down. We're guiding down because things have materialized in a way that's different than our expectations. Some of that is related to pipeline, but frankly, not most of it. Most of it's related to mobile, a significant amount of FX as well. But there have been some modest pipeline shifts. So the good news is those titles are, of course, coming.\nAndrew Uerkwitz: Got it. And then if I could just throw one follow-on there. You guys are known for quality and I'm sure a lot of the delays or shifts are related to polish. But is there something you guys are seeing that's -- it's just too much going on? Just kind of just walk us through kind of the thought process behind it. It just seems like -- was COVID a bigger impact? This will be, I think, two or three years now with record pipeline and so far, just we're all being patient here.\nStrauss Zelnick: I understand the concern and I understand the question as well. No, we're not seeing any productivity issues, for example. We definitely have very high quality expectations in the bands, and that's reflected in the fact that we're performing across the board. So this company is a hit factory. We haven't had a disappointing release in as long as I can remember. And that's honestly the most important thing. So we would much rather -- if you have to choose, I'd much rather have the situation we're in, which is we've had some delays and we have had to revise down guidance. I'll choose that any day over taking some flops. That's really the key in this business. We've had issues -- I mean, we've been around here long enough to remember them. Where in the past, we had delays in titles and it was ultimately always worth waiting for because when we got to the other side, the results were delivered, and the small amount of the time delay didn't ultimately matter in the context of the results that we were able to deliver. I'm hopeful that will be the case here as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs.\nEric Sheridan: Maybe I could just go back to the mobile business for a minute. In terms of what you've learned about the mobile business over the last 12, 15 months, some of before the close and since the close in Zynga, how do you think about what you need to build for the long-term versus some of the elements of change that you can see on some of the distribution platforms from Apple and Google, and how that might impact what you need to build and scale on either the acquisition front or the monetization front for the long-term?\nKarl Slatoff: It's Karl. So really, what it means to us, what we're working on building is Zynga and this is what's happening obviously well before we merged with the company, as we're working on building the mobile platform. And one of the most exciting things and obviously, Zynga has got some amazing forever franchises and some great IP and some good titles and some great titles coming out. But a huge part of the value is that platform and the ability to manage the customer life cycle very effectively. And you can see the company investing in that over time and we continue to invest that. And as we bring together the databases across our entire company, that power of data management, particularly in the context of IDFA and some of the challenges that privacy rules may sent to us, the better your data, the broader your data set and the better the bigger and broader your platform and the more capabilities you have in your platform will enable you to mitigate those effects. And we're already seeing some of that. And that's been a focus for Zynga for quite some time, and we're going to continue to invest in that. You saw it with the acquisition of Chartboost, the acquisition of Storemaven, but also bringing all of the Zynga portfolio and the new Take-Two portfolio onto the centralized Zynga platform is going to yield significant results for us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Thornton with Truist Securities.\nMatthew Thornton: Maybe two, if I could. One for Strauss. Strauss, you talked about sequential years of growth and a record performance. I guess the question there is, what are you alluding to? Is that EBITDA, earnings per share, margins? Any meat you can kind of put on that would be helpful. And then just second one for Lainie. Lainie, I think you called out $50 million in -- I interpreted that as incremental currency headwind impacting the full year guide, but you also alluded to pipeline moving around. Could you quantify what that impact is and kind of what that is for the year?\nStrauss Zelnick: Yes. What I was referring to is top and bottom line, so net bookings and income, however you describe EBITDA as a handy measure.\nLainie Goldstein: Yes. And for the full year, I mentioned that about 70% of the downward revision is the mobile business and the release slate together, and about $50 million is for the FX currency headwinds.\nMatthew Thornton: And is there any color on what slipped in the pipeline? And I'm sorry if I missed that.\nLainie Goldstein: Sure. For -- the changes in release schedule, there are several changes that happened during the quarter. So there was one mobile title from 2K that moved and Gen 8 and Switch versions of the Marvel's Midnight Suns moved into fiscal '24. And also KSP2 has now shifted to early access this year. So those are the major changes in the release schedule.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Cost with Morgan Stanley.\nMatthew Cost: Just on the PC console business, are you seeing a divergence between the performance of Grand Theft Auto and NBA 2K, specifically where NBA 2K RCS is outperforming Grand Theft Auto? And if so, can you give any more color on the player and consumption dynamics you're seeing in GTA? And then on the mobile side, you highlighted how the advertising business is hanging in there and growing a fair bit better than that purchases. Do you expect the advertising to materially outperform in-app purchases over the next couple of quarters? The reason I ask is because presumably, a lot of those ad dollars are coming from other game companies. And then I wonder if eventually that feels the pain from in-app purchases across the industry going down.\nStrauss Zelnick: Yes. Thanks for your questions. Look, GTA Online and NBA 2K are very different animals. GTA Online has been around for nearly 10 years. It's beloved by a massive audience. GTA V, the underlying title has sold in more than 170 million units. NBA 2K is an annualized release, and so we get an annual snapshot of how virtual currency is doing. Engagement is very high indeed. Virtual currency is up in NBA 2K23. The mobile advertising business, look, these are two different businesses and the vast majority of our net bookings at Zynga comes from in-app purchases still. So yes, we expect the growth rate in advertising probably to exceed the growth rate in in-app purchases, certainly for the next year. Beyond that, I think it's too early to say.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Drew Crum with Stifel.\nDrew Crum: Maybe just piggying back and off the last question, asking more broadly. With your guidance update and the impact from more cautious macro backdrop, if you isolate your console PC business, can you discuss it in any way you change your view on RCS for this part of the business, so excluding multiple? And then separately, can you talk about the decision to close Playdots? And is this, in any way, factors into that $100 million-plus of cost synergies that accompanied the Zynga transaction?\nLainie Goldstein: So for RCS, we did lower our expectations. Most of it was for mobile since our prior guidance assumed that mobile would experience some improvement in the second half of the year. But we no longer expect that since the current data for the industry and our real-time performance has shown that we think it will lower in the second half of the year. But we are also assuming some softer performance for several of our large non-mobile titles that are meaningful contributors to RCS. So that's why our expectations for RCS are to come down in the second half of the year.\nStrauss Zelnick: And with regard to Playdots, we've relocated the operations of our successful game, Two Dots to another studio. And yes, that was driven by the integration benefits that we felt we could achieve.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mario Lu with Barclays.\nMario Lu: Wanted to ask about mobile. With the full year guidance, 70% of it coming from mobile but Rollic outperformed in the second quarter. So is there some main factors you can point to that separates Rollic from the rest of the mobile portfolio. Is it being kind of immune to IDFA? Is it competition? And then lastly, just curious to hear your thoughts on potentially leveraging the success of Rollic with perhaps cross promotion to other mobile games?\nLainie Goldstein: So Mario, 70% is mobile and the movement in the release schedule, so it's a combination of both of those two items. So it's not only mobile. But you're right, Rollic did outperform in Q2 so that business is doing really well.\nKarl Slatoff: And some of the reasons because the Rollic is doing well is obviously, it's an advertising-driven business, and we've had some success from an advertising perspective, both in terms of efficiency and inventory availability. And also, it's just given the nature of the hypercasual business, it's not necessarily reliant as much on targeted advertising. So it's a little bit easier to grow your UA in that context because -- where you have situations like IDFA doesn't necessarily Rollic business or the hypercasual business in the same way that it would in the normal bubble business. I'm sorry, I missed the second question. What was that, about cross-promotion?\nMario Lu: Yes, the question was, your thoughts on potentially leveraging the success of Rollic to cross-promotion or view that as an acquisition channel to other mobile\u2026?\nKarl Slatoff: Yes, there are certainly opportunities to do that. You can make an argument that it's a different kind of a customer. I think there's obviously overlap. There may be some differences. But the fact that you've got a large funnel of players coming into your database always going to be something that's going to help your UA strategy across your entire enterprise and specifically on the mobile side of the business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan.\nDavid Karnovsky: Just regarding the $500 million of revenue synergies with Zynga, which you reiterated, any early opportunities you're seeing across your portfolio to execute on this? And then Lainie, you mentioned other potential cost opportunities that could come up. Is that something that's factored into your guide or would that be incremental to it?\nStrauss Zelnick: Yes. On the first question, yes, there are a number of early opportunities that we've identified, including our approach directly to the consumer on the mobile business, which is pretty exciting and could generate material benefits. And we're working on a number of properties as well. It will take longer to bring some titles to market but that's super exciting.\nLainie Goldstein: And in terms of the operating expense synergies, we do have some of the synergies with Zynga included in our guide. But in terms of the other areas of efficiencies, we don't have those in our guide yet. We have some ideas that we're looking at. So like on a multiyear basis, we're evaluating our real estate footprint as we adopt flexible work policies. We're also looking at identifying some core functions that we can centralize across our labels, determining the necessity of some opening to hire positions and also negotiating some vendor contracts more effectively across the company. So those are additional opportunities that we're seeing in our cost structure. So we'll be looking at achieving those in the next year or so.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Creutz with Cowen.\nDoug Creutz: Just to tie a couple of things that have already been said together. You mentioned that you've been assuming that mobile would improve in the back half of the year and now you're not assuming that. Is it simply to say that you thought it would get better isn't or that it's actually continued to deteriorate since the last call?\nStrauss Zelnick: It's the former.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Martin Yang with Oppenheimer.\nMartin Yang: My first question is on NBA 2K's ASP trends. You mentioned there's some year-over-year improvement. Can you maybe dig into details on what contributed to the ASP improvement?\nKarl Slatoff: Yes, it\u2019s basically we came out with a Championship Edition this year. Every year, we do different marketing packages or different SKUs. We had a particularly successful one this year that features some very prominent basketball players, and that carries a much higher average selling price and that's affecting the ASP. So it really is just sort of -- it's the SKU mix of the title.\nMartin Yang: Got it. And then a follow-up question regarding your mobile synergy. Is there any milestones you could share with us updating where the teams are at? Are new teams being formed to build mobile game space on your core IP? Is there any games in aviation phase or any other milestones will be appreciated?\nKarl Slatoff: Yes. We don't have anything specific to announce right now. And I assume your question is really related, as it relates to releasing Take-Two IP or games, yes. Because obviously, there's a lot of other smaller things we can do with leads, et cetera, and also just the efficiencies about bringing the companies together, T2 mobile and Zynga -- the acquired Zynga component. But yes, there are a lot of conversations going on. There are a lot of ideas flowing back and forth. We don't have anything to announce right now, but those conversations are going very well and they're exciting. When it materializes, it's difficult to assess. The creative process is a very specific process and some of them take longer than others. And the most important thing is that we have game concepts that make sense from a commercial perspective but also from a brand perspective. So the teams are having those conversations for now. So stay tuned.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matti Littunen with Bernstein.\nMatti Littunen: First question on NBA units. So it sounds like, if I heard correctly, that the unit number so far is very similar to what you said a year ago. So could you just confirm, has it been broadly similar? Has there been any slight growth or decline on that? And then on the live services revenue, could you give us any color in terms of how that revenue is currently split between MyCAREER and MyTEAM and maybe how that's trending over time?\nStrauss Zelnick: Yes. It's roughly the same number of units year-over-year and virtual currency spending is up. And we don't split out the spending in the different modes for the purpose of this call.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Fitzgerald with Wells Fargo.\nBrian Fitzgerald: Lainie, you talked to this a little bit. But in terms of labor, how do you think about things improving as the market cools off a bit for tech employees? And how are you thinking about headcount growth and retention from here? Does the cooling labor market give you any leverage in terms of getting developers back to the office? Does that help things? Any color there would be great.\nStrauss Zelnick: Well, we don't really look at our relations with our colleagues as one of leverage, so we probably wouldn't describe it through that lens. I do think that it's probably going to become easier to hire people when a lot of tech businesses are laying people off. We don't expect a rip and we don't have a hiring freeze. We're always judicious about the people we bring on board. We pride ourselves on being highly efficient, and we believe we are highly efficient now. So I do think that this may make it somewhat easier to hire really talented people, but we wouldn't use these times to apply leverage. We believe that we have great relationships with our workforce and those are terribly important to us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Omar Dessouky with Bank of America.\nOmar Dessouky: My question is about mobile advertising efficiency. How has mobile advertising efficiency in the September quarter trended versus the March and the June quarters, especially at Zynga? And what are your go-forward assumptions for the December and March quarter? And what I mean by advertising efficiency is the kind of in-app purchase bookings divided by the advertising spend?\nKarl Slatoff: Just to be clear, you define advertising efficiency as in-app purchases divided by advertising spend?\nOmar Dessouky: Yes, or the reciprocal of that. So like the total advertising spend as a percentage of bookings. Sorry, I should have said it that way.\nKarl Slatoff: Right. So I think, look, we don't break -- we're not necessarily breaking that out specifically and I'm not sure that I would characterize that as efficiency, but it certainly would be an interesting measure to look at. And as we said before, we've experienced pretty strong growth in our advertising business and we've had some pressure on in-app purchases. So it stands to reason that, that ratio would probably be going more in favor of the advertising business versus in-app purchases. That isn't necessarily a long-term trend. That's just something that we're seeing in the short run. We fully expect in-app purchases to come back at one point in the future. As Strauss said before, a little hard to gauge that when that may happen, but that is our expectation. So those ratios, I don't believe are necessarily going to be fixed over time or necessarily moving in a specific direction, again, depending on what happens in the broader market.\nOmar Dessouky: Okay. And just a follow-up on that would be, have you changed which channels you're using for user acquisition for mobile, specifically for Zynga? Or how do you, for example, concentrate your spend in specific channels? Has that changed at all?\nKarl Slatoff: Yes, I don't think the mix in terms of where we're spending concentrating has changed dramatically based on anything that we've seen in the market. You can certainly expect that day-to-day, quarter-to-quarter, month-to-month, you're going to see variations depending on where media opportunities exist. So I'm sure you're going to see some variation depending on what happens in specific media outlets. But I don't see a broader trend that's pushing us towards any particular asset versus another.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Hickey with Benchmark.\nMichael Hickey: The first one is on your guidance for '23. I mean, obviously, a couple of revisions here. Do you feel like you're sort of being conservative enough? Obviously, a lot of uncertainty on the macro mobile, but is there still downside risk and where would that be? And then on '24, you said growth sequentially. You've given us some data on the S-4 and I think on your presentation with Zynga. Street is looking for $8 billion in revenue, [759] in ETFs. Obviously, that's a pretty big step-up. Guessing it's coming from premium as mobile is slowing here. Obviously, live service is not great. Is it just one, two, three titles on premium or any sort of granularity, I guess, on the '24 growth would be great. And then the second question is on the very unfortunate GTA League. Just curious how you and your teams are sort of managing through that impact, if you feel that there's a residual advantage or not and how you sort of move forward and think about timing.\nLainie Goldstein: So in terms of the guidance for '23 on being conservative or still downside risk, we always guide based on what we know at the time that we know it. So I wouldn't say they're conservative or a risk either way. I feel like we gave the best information that we have at the time that we have it. So it's what we know right now. And hopefully, the -- it gets better, but that's what we feel the numbers are at this time. And in terms of the CAGR and the fiscal -- the numbers that were in the S-4, we generally do not provide long-term growth targets in our normal course of business. We only did that previously because of the pending combination with Zynga. And as you know, the in our business because of the changes in the shifts in the release slate can happen, it really doesn't make sense for us to give long-term numbers on a regular basis. So we've never really done that in the past. But we're really continuing to be very excited about our pipeline of the strong titles that we have, and we have many large-scale projects underway. So the potential of the titles in the pipeline, that has not changed at all. We remain highly confident that they're going to deliver us sequential years of growth and record performance in the next few years. So that hasn't changed. So we really feel great about our numbers in the next few years, as we said.\nStrauss Zelnick: And with regard to the leak, it was terribly unfortunate and we take those sorts of incidents very seriously indeed. There's no evidence that any material assets were taken, which is a good thing. And certainly, the leak won't have any influence on development or anything of the sort. But it is terribly disappointing and causes us to be ever more vigilant on matters relating to cybersecurity.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Clay Griffin with MoffettNathanson.\nClay Griffin: I guess two. It seems like the legacy Take-Two mobile games are holding in a bit better than the legacy Zynga. I guess, what would you attribute that to? Is it just kind of a life cycle of where those titles are relative to kind of when IDFA ATT dropped? And then secondly, just curious, Strauss, I think Phil Spencer was talking about Game Pass and essentially implying that they were nearing saturation, I guess, relative to kind of where the Xbox console installed bases. Just curious if your thoughts about subscription models relative to the traditional premium window have changed over time? I think his comments generally, I think, could be characterized as lining up maybe what your view of the value proposition for a subscription product.\nKarl Slatoff: So in terms of the legacy Take-Two mobile business versus the Zynga business, I wouldn't necessarily -- I mean, again, we don't really disclose that so I don't think there's any really way try to see that behavior. But I can tell you that we wouldn't look at it that way because there are certain games within the Take-Two legacy portfolio and the games in the Zynga portfolio, some are doing better than others and some are doing great, some are not doing as well. So there's a lot of variation within the portfolio itself. So I wouldn't necessarily characterize it as the T2 mobile businesses are doing better than Zynga or vice versa. It's not really how we look at the business anymore.\nStrauss Zelnick: It's all one, it's all Zynga. It's managed by the Zynga team and we have a lot of great titles.\nKarl Slatoff: Yes. And we're specifically hoping that with the T2 mobile titles, and we're starting to see some of this collaboration happening that we're going to be -- they're going to be able to benefit from the power of the Zynga mobile platform, which has some really interesting opportunities for us to be more efficient and opportunistic in the consumer life cycle management.\nStrauss Zelnick: And on the subscription side, look, we've been very cooperative with both Sony and Microsoft on their subscription offerings when it makes sense for us. And my own views have not changed at all since I first started talking about subscription, which is now, I want to say, probably four years ago. The interactive entertainment business is very different than the linear entertainment business. People consume far fewer hours of interactive entertainment in a given month than they do of linear entertainment. And within that consumption, there are far fewer titles consumed in interactive entertainment than there are with linear entertainment. So I, at least, pose the question as to whether subscription makes as much sense for interactive entertainment as it does for linear entertainment and registered some skepticism, which I still hold. I think the second area of skepticism was whether it made sense -- and this is a rhetorical question because I think the answer is no, to offer frontline titles [day and day] with titles on a subscription service. I don't think that ever made sense. I still don't think it makes sense. And I believe that it's now becoming obvious that it doesn't make sense. It's just a lost opportunity for the publisher. So I wouldn't want to speak for my friend, Phil, but our views remain unchanged. There probably is a subscription business. It's a catalog business. It's probably best aimed at very avid consumers because those are the consumers who are interested in playing catalog titles, implying a whole bunch of different titles in a given month. But I don't think it's a mass market service that supplants the interactive entertainment business as we know it at all. And I don't think there's any evidence to the contrary so far.\nOperator: We have a follow-up question from Matthew Thornton with Truist.\nMatthew Thornton: Maybe two quick follow-ups. First one on coming back to mobile, again. Maybe this is for Strauss. How do you think about what's currently going on from a macro perspective as opposed to just a user acquisition perspective, given what's going on in the iOS environment, in particular? Is there a way to tease apart what percentage of the pressure is from one versus the other? And relatedly, what's your level of confidence that we come out of? I mean, macro will resolve itself. But from a UA perspective, from an ecosystem perspective, what's your level of confidence that you can kind of control coming out of this doldrum? That's the first question. The second one is a really easy one. Given where the stock price is, I'm kind of curious your appetite around buybacks. I know you guys have been fairly opportunistic in the past. Obviously, we've taken on some leverage with Zynga, but I'm kind of curious how you're thinking about that, given where the share price is.\nStrauss Zelnick: Yes. In terms of mobile, from a macro perspective, I think that you're right. There's a difference between user acquisition and retention and conversion. And on user acquisition, I think we and everyone else is just going to be a bit more selective to drive efficiency. And in terms of retention and conversion, that's a reflection of people just not having to spend mobile. You can enjoy a title without spending in-game. 90-plus percent of consumers do not spend in-game. And so at times when consumers are feeling the pressure of higher prices for fuel and food, for example, they may be less likely to spend money on entertainment, especially when you can have the experience anyhow. So in terms of our expectations, I think this is -- it's a moment where we will, in fact, tune up our UA spend to become more efficient. That's a good thing. And yes, we will probably see some pressure on in-game purchases for a period of time. As I said earlier in the call, not that I think you can underwrite to this because it's just 1 person's opinion, I think there'll be pressure for three to six months at least that's driven by the economy and geopolitical factors. And I'm hoping that by the end of '23 -- I believe that by the end of '23, things will normalize and will be on an upward swing again. And Lainie will take the question about buybacks.\nLainie Goldstein: Sure. So we continue to believe in returning value to the shareholders and via share buyback, but we'll only do so when the conditions are right. And obviously, we believe that there is deep value in our market price currently. But in order to do a share repurchase, we would need to do it in an open trading window and also have the optimal capital structure that supports the purchases. So we'll see when it makes sense for us to do it. So that's how we see it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Martin Yang with Oppenheimer.\nMartin Yang: This is a question referring to your earlier definition of Take-Two\u2019s identity as a hit factory. I want to know if you hold a similar view over your mobile game portfolio. Do you feel there's a need for a portfolio review on mobile games based on the quality and future potentials?\nStrauss Zelnick: Yes. At any given time, we're always reviewing our portfolio, both in terms of the performance of the current titles and the potential for new titles that we're working on. And Frank and his team are very focused on making sure to optimize the current title lineup and to make sure that our development for new titles is as effective and poised for success as it possibly can be. Good news is we have a terrific lineup of great titles and our mobile titles all make money.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Omar Dessouky with Bank of America.\nOmar Dessouky: I'm just going to sneak a quick one in here. And apologies if Karl had already answered this by saying that you don't have the details. But in terms of part of your synergies may come from applying PC console IP to the casual mobile market using the Zynga development resources, I think when I've spoken with you in the past, you called out an example of like a Red Dead Redemption poker game, for example. Are these mobile games you're envisioning targeted towards fans of the existing PC console franchises like Red Dead or towards mobile-first casual gamers that would play -- that would otherwise play games like Zynga Poker or Empires & Puzzles?\nStrauss Zelnick: I think it's a great question, thank you. And I think the bottom line is you're probably not going to convert a console player to become a mobile player. You have to appeal to a mobile player. And we believe that legacy IP, when properly developed as a great title, can do just that. But it's not a SLAM DUNK by any means. It's still got to be a great game. But you're not going to convince someone who never plays a mobile title to play a mobile title just because it's based on console IP.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll hand the floor back to management.\nStrauss Zelnick: Want to thank everyone for joining us today. I want to say thanks particularly to our dedicated team of colleagues all around the world who continue to do a great job. While it would be nice always to have the best possible news in an upward sloping curve, this is a business that occasionally does present us with challenges. This team is well suited to challenges. We have a great pipeline, we have a great team. We have the ability to deliver, and we wish you all a great holiday season. Thank you joining us. And thank you for your support.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. All parties may disconnect. Have a great evening.",

            "content": "I'd like to begin by thanking our teams for delivering another strong quarter, which reflects our ability to captivate and engage audiences consistently by delivering the highest-quality entertainment experiences across all platforms. I'll now discuss our recent releases. On October 14th , 2K and HB Studios launched PGA TOUR 2K23, the latest entry in our golf simulation franchise, to positive community sentiment and great critical acclaim, including GameSpot calling the title \u201cThe best simulation golf game ever made\u201d. PGA TOUR 2K23 features golf icon and all-time sports great, Tiger Woods, and celebrates his legacy by introducing him as both a playable in-game pro and an Executive Director who advised the game's development team. The game features several new additions and improvements, including an enhanced roster of male and female pros; the ability to play as NBA legends Michael Jordan and Steph Curry; a Topgolf mode; a deeper array of personalization options and gear; licensed courses and the ability to design original courses; and multiplayer offerings. HB Studios will continue to support the game with additional pros and courses, as well as seasonal updates and the Clubhouse Pass. On October 21st, 2K and Gearbox Software released New Tales from the Borderlands, a choice-based, narrative adventure game that is a successor to the beloved Telltale Games title. The franchise has always been an incredible canvas for storytelling and we are pleased to add this new offering to the portfolio. On November 2nd, Private Division and Roll7 released Finding the Flowzone, the second and final DLC expansion for the critically acclaimed skateboarding action-platformer, OlliOlli World. The release has received praise from critics including Eurogamer who commended Finding the Flowzone as a \u201cfond goodbye to this magnificent game,\u201d and stating that the expansion \u201cis completely rad.\u201d Now, I will discuss our announced offerings for the balance of Fiscal 2023 and beyond. On December 2nd, 2K and Firaxis Games will launch Marvel's Midnight Suns on Windows PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5. The Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch versions will follow at a later date. In support of the upcoming launch, 2K has produced five short videos that are being released weekly on Marvel Entertainment's YouTube channel, which provides the backstory of how the game's lead character, Lilith, became the Mother of Demons, and how Super Heroes like Blade, Magik, Ghost Rider and Nico Minoru came together to form the young core of the Midnight Suns. During the fourth quarter, 2K and Visual Concepts will launch WWE 2K23. Building upon the success of 2K22, which had nearly 450 million matches played and 10 million hours of game content viewed on Twitch, fans can look forward to the series once again redefining interactive entertainment within the squared circle. We are grateful to have such a supportive and collaborative partnership with WWE, and 2K will have more to share about WWE 2K23 in the coming months. On February 24th, Private Division and Intercept Games will launch Kerbal Space Program 2, the sequel to the beloved rocket building sim, in Early Access for PC on Steam, Epic Games Store, and other digital storefronts. KSP2 will bring an array of content at the launch of Early Access, making this the most visually impressive KSP game yet. The game will also feature improved tutorials and user onboarding to provide players with the necessary knowledge to excel at space flight. Built from the ground up, KSP2 will also introduce the ability to customize and paint vehicles, leading to deeper personalization and expression in every build. Those that purchase KSP2 in Early Access will help inform the future development of the game by providing feedback directly to Intercept Games leading up to the full launch of the title. We can't wait for the incredibly passionate KSP community to take flight in this new entry to the series. Throughout the balance of the fiscal year, Rockstar Games will continue to support Grand Theft Auto Online with additional major content updates, alongside popular annual seasonal-themed offerings and more. o In mobile, Zynga's Rollic studio will continue to release a consistent cadence of titles, while the label's other studios remain hard at work on a variety of offerings, including several titles that are currently in soft launch and expected to release in Fiscal Year 2024. Turning to eSports, the NBA 2K League is currently gearing up for its sixth season, which will tip off in Spring 2023. Last month, the League announced a landmark agreement with Australia's National Basketball League to launch an expansion team, NBL Oz Gaming. Not only is this the first time an Australian professional sports league has joined a global esports league, but it also marks our third expansion team from outside of North America. We remain very excited about the continued growth and success of the NBA 2K League. In closing, we believe that Take-Two is home to the best talent in our industry across all segments of interactive entertainment. With an expanding portfolio of the most exciting and commercially successful owned intellectual property, and the ability to deliver consistently deeply engaging and captivating entertainment experiences to a broad array of audiences around the world, we believe that we are well-positioned to deliver long-term value for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Lainie. It's Karl. So really, what it means to us, what we're working on building is Zynga and this is what's happening obviously well before we merged with the company, as we're working on building the mobile platform. And one of the most exciting things and obviously, Zynga has got some amazing forever franchises and some great IP and some good titles and some great titles coming out. But a huge part of the value is that platform and the ability to manage the customer life cycle very effectively. And you can see the company investing in that over time and we continue to invest that. And as we bring together the databases across our entire company, that power of data management, particularly in the context of IDFA and some of the challenges that privacy rules may sent to us, the better your data, the broader your data set and the better the bigger and broader your platform and the more capabilities you have in your platform will enable you to mitigate those effects. And we're already seeing some of that. And that's been a focus for Zynga for quite some time, and we're going to continue to invest in that. You saw it with the acquisition of Chartboost, the acquisition of Storemaven, but also bringing all of the Zynga portfolio and the new Take-Two portfolio onto the centralized Zynga platform is going to yield significant results for us. And some of the reasons because the Rollic is doing well is obviously, it's an advertising-driven business, and we've had some success from an advertising perspective, both in terms of efficiency and inventory availability. And also, it's just given the nature of the hypercasual business, it's not necessarily reliant as much on targeted advertising. So it's a little bit easier to grow your UA in that context because -- where you have situations like IDFA doesn't necessarily Rollic business or the hypercasual business in the same way that it would in the normal bubble business. I'm sorry, I missed the second question. What was that, about cross-promotion? Yes, there are certainly opportunities to do that. You can make an argument that it's a different kind of a customer. I think there's obviously overlap. There may be some differences. But the fact that you've got a large funnel of players coming into your database always going to be something that's going to help your UA strategy across your entire enterprise and specifically on the mobile side of the business. Yes, it's basically we came out with a Championship Edition this year. Every year, we do different marketing packages or different SKUs. We had a particularly successful one this year that features some very prominent basketball players, and that carries a much higher average selling price and that's affecting the ASP. So it really is just sort of -- it's the SKU mix of the title. Yes. We don't have anything specific to announce right now. And I assume your question is really related, as it relates to releasing Take-Two IP or games, yes. Because obviously, there's a lot of other smaller things we can do with leads, et cetera, and also just the efficiencies about bringing the companies together, T2 mobile and Zynga -- the acquired Zynga component. But yes, there are a lot of conversations going on. There are a lot of ideas flowing back and forth. We don't have anything to announce right now, but those conversations are going very well and they're exciting. When it materializes, it's difficult to assess. The creative process is a very specific process and some of them take longer than others. And the most important thing is that we have game concepts that make sense from a commercial perspective but also from a brand perspective. So the teams are having those conversations for now. So stay tuned. Just to be clear, you define advertising efficiency as in-app purchases divided by advertising spend? Right. So I think, look, we don't break -- we're not necessarily breaking that out specifically and I'm not sure that I would characterize that as efficiency, but it certainly would be an interesting measure to look at. And as we said before, we've experienced pretty strong growth in our advertising business and we've had some pressure on in-app purchases. So it stands to reason that, that ratio would probably be going more in favor of the advertising business versus in-app purchases. That isn't necessarily a long-term trend. That's just something that we're seeing in the short run. We fully expect in-app purchases to come back at one point in the future. As Strauss said before, a little hard to gauge that when that may happen, but that is our expectation. So those ratios, I don't believe are necessarily going to be fixed over time or necessarily moving in a specific direction, again, depending on what happens in the broader market. Yes, I don't think the mix in terms of where we're spending concentrating has changed dramatically based on anything that we've seen in the market. You can certainly expect that day-to-day, quarter-to-quarter, month-to-month, you're going to see variations depending on where media opportunities exist. So I'm sure you're going to see some variation depending on what happens in specific media outlets. But I don't see a broader trend that's pushing us towards any particular asset versus another. So in terms of the legacy Take-Two mobile business versus the Zynga business, I wouldn't necessarily -- I mean, again, we don't really disclose that so I don't think there's any really way try to see that behavior. But I can tell you that we wouldn't look at it that way because there are certain games within the Take-Two legacy portfolio and the games in the Zynga portfolio, some are doing better than others and some are doing great, some are not doing as well. So there's a lot of variation within the portfolio itself. So I wouldn't necessarily characterize it as the T2 mobile businesses are doing better than Zynga or vice versa. It's not really how we look at the business anymore. Yes. And we're specifically hoping that with the T2 mobile titles, and we're starting to see some of this collaboration happening that we're going to be -- they're going to be able to benefit from the power of the Zynga mobile platform, which has some really interesting opportunities for us to be more efficient and opportunistic in the consumer life cycle management."

            "name": "Lainie Goldstein",
            "content": "Thanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll discuss the key highlights from our second quarter before reviewing our guidance for fiscal year 2023 and our third quarter. Please note that our second quarter results include our combination with Zynga, which affects the comparability of our results relative to last year. Additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release. As Strauss mentioned, our combination with Zynga is tracking very well, from the progress we are making against our integration milestones with the net bookings and cost synergy realization that we are working towards and our highly complementary company cultures. We have great confidence that over the long term, our portfolio is poised to benefit from the significant expected growth in mobile gaming, evolving player dynamics towards more immersive mobile content and our massive combined scale, which will enable our teams to cross-promote titles and build stronger tools to connect with new users. During the quarter, we identified additional cost savings opportunities, and we now feel confident that we can deliver over $100 million of annual synergies within the first two years post close. We're also evaluating other efficiencies across our core businesses while ensuring that we have the appropriate resources to deliver on our significant growth prospects. Our second quarter results were solid, and we delivered net bookings of $1.5 billion, which was within our prior guidance range. The movement in foreign currency exchange rates negatively affected our net bookings by approximately 1%. With consumers navigating ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties, we believe that our financial performance truly demonstrates the incredible quality of our games and the significant value that our interactive entertainment experiences provide to our players. During the period, recurrent consumer spending rose 76% and accounted for 80% of net bookings. NBA 2K and Rollic's hyper-casual mobile portfolio outperformed our plans, while we experienced some softness across other parts of our portfolio as the interactive entertainment industry faced continued headwinds. Digitally-delivered net bookings increased 62% and accounted for 94% of the total. During the quarter, 73% of console game sales were delivered digitally, up from 65% last year. GAAP net revenue increased 62% to $1.4 billion and cost of revenue increased 56% to $714 million. Operating expenses increased by 144% to $932 million, primarily driven by the addition of Zynga; and business acquisition and higher personnel costs; which was partly offset by lower console and PC marketing expenses. And, GAAP net loss was $257 million, or $1.54, which was impacted by $320 million of amortization of acquired intangibles and $37 million of business acquisition costs. Our management tax rate for the period was 18% as compared to 16% in the prior year as a result of our combination with Zynga. We ended the quarter with over $1.3 billion of Cash and Short-Term Investments and $3.3 billion of debt. Turning to our guidance, I'll begin with our full fiscal year expectations. As Strauss mentioned, we are revising our guidance, and we now expect to deliver net bookings of $5.4 to $5.5 billion. Approximately 70% of the downward revision reflects lowered expectations for our mobile business and shifts in our release slate, while the balance reflects an updated view for the rest of our portfolio, based on current business trends across the interactive entertainment industry. Our guidance reflects $50 million of FX headwinds. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Empires & Puzzles, Rollic's hyper-casual mobile portfolio, Toon Blast, and Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be 45% Zynga which includes our former T2 mobile titles, 36% 2K, 18% Rockstar Games, and 1% Private Division. We forecast our geographic net bookings split to be about 60% United States and 40% International. We now expect recurrent consumer spending to grow by approximately 90% and represent 77% of total net bookings. Our digitally-delivered Net Bookings are expected to grow by approximately 70% and represent 96% of the total. Our forecast assumes that 75% of console game sales will be delivered-digitally, up from 68% last year. We expect to generate more than $650 million in non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow and we expect to deploy approximately $150 million for capital expenditures. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $5.41 billion to $5.51 billion and cost of revenue to range from $2.61 billion to $2.64 billion, which includes approximately $694 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Total operating expenses are expected to range from $3.4 billion to $3.42 billion as compared to $1.5 billion last year. This increase reflects the inclusion of Zynga; business acquisition costs; and higher personnel, marketing, and IT expenses; which we anticipate will be slightly offset by our expected cost synergies. In light of the current economic backdrop, we continue to monitor our costs prudently to find potential areas of savings this year, while being mindful of the resources we need to support our robust multiyear release schedule. And, we expect a GAAP net loss ranging from $631 million to $674 million, or $3.95 to $4.22 per share, which assumes a basic share count of 159.8 million shares. Our revised forecast includes an increase in amortization for intangible assets acquired from Zynga based on updated valuation estimates. We expect our management tax rate to be 18% throughout the year. Now, moving to our guidance for the fiscal third quarter: We project net bookings to range from $1.41 billion to $1.46 billion, compared to $866 million in the third quarter last year. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Empires and Puzzles, Rollic's hyper-casual mobile portfolio, and Toon Blast. We project recurrent consumer spending to grow approximately 125% and digitally-delivered net bookings to increase approximately 80%. Our forecast assumes that 72% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 63% last year. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $1.43 billion to $1.48 billion and cost of revenue to range from $690 million to $710 million, which includes approximately $198 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Operating expenses are expected to range from $897 to $907 million. At the midpoint, this represents a 126% increase over last year. This increase reflects the inclusion of Zynga; business acquisition costs; and higher marketing, which we believe will be slightly offset by the realization of some of our anticipated cost synergies and cost savings efforts. And, GAAP net loss is expected to range from $142 million to $160 million, or $0.85 to $0.95 per share, which assumes a basic share count of 167.7 million shares. In closing, we continue to focus on our execution against an uncertain economic backdrop, and we are highly optimistic about our future growth trajectory. Our long-term development pipeline is stronger than ever, and we are excited to deliver high-profile sequels and engaging new properties that have the potential to enhance our financial profile even further. At the same time, we are confident in our ability to create significant shareholder value as we continue our integration of Zynga by collaborating on new creative projects, leveraging our combined scale, unlocking greater potential from their mobile platform, and entering new business models and geographies. Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Strauss. Yes. And for the full year, I mentioned that about 70% of the downward revision is the mobile business and the release slate together, and about $50 million is for the FX currency headwinds. Sure. For -- the changes in release schedule, there are several changes that happened during the quarter. So there was one mobile title from 2K that moved and Gen 8 and Switch versions of the Marvel's Midnight Suns moved into fiscal '24. And also KSP2 has now shifted to early access this year. So those are the major changes in the release schedule. So for RCS, we did lower our expectations. Most of it was for mobile since our prior guidance assumed that mobile would experience some improvement in the second half of the year. But we no longer expect that since the current data for the industry and our real-time performance has shown that we think it will lower in the second half of the year. But we are also assuming some softer performance for several of our large non-mobile titles that are meaningful contributors to RCS. So that's why our expectations for RCS are to come down in the second half of the year. So Mario, 70% is mobile and the movement in the release schedule, so it's a combination of both of those two items. So it's not only mobile. But you're right, Rollic did outperform in Q2 so that business is doing really well. And in terms of the operating expense synergies, we do have some of the synergies with Zynga included in our guide. But in terms of the other areas of efficiencies, we don't have those in our guide yet. We have some ideas that we're looking at. So like on a multiyear basis, we're evaluating our real estate footprint as we adopt flexible work policies. We're also looking at identifying some core functions that we can centralize across our labels, determining the necessity of some opening to hire positions and also negotiating some vendor contracts more effectively across the company. So those are additional opportunities that we're seeing in our cost structure. So we'll be looking at achieving those in the next year or so. So in terms of the guidance for '23 on being conservative or still downside risk, we always guide based on what we know at the time that we know it. So I wouldn't say they're conservative or a risk either way. I feel like we gave the best information that we have at the time that we have it. So it's what we know right now. And hopefully, the -- it gets better, but that's what we feel the numbers are at this time. And in terms of the CAGR and the fiscal -- the numbers that were in the S-4, we generally do not provide long-term growth targets in our normal course of business. We only did that previously because of the pending combination with Zynga. And as you know, the in our business because of the changes in the shifts in the release slate can happen, it really doesn't make sense for us to give long-term numbers on a regular basis. So we've never really done that in the past. But we're really continuing to be very excited about our pipeline of the strong titles that we have, and we have many large-scale projects underway. So the potential of the titles in the pipeline, that has not changed at all. We remain highly confident that they're going to deliver us sequential years of growth and record performance in the next few years. So that hasn't changed. So we really feel great about our numbers in the next few years, as we said. Sure. So we continue to believe in returning value to the shareholders and via share buyback, but we'll only do so when the conditions are right. And obviously, we believe that there is deep value in our market price currently. But in order to do a share repurchase, we would need to do it in an open trading window and also have the optimal capital structure that supports the purchases. So we'll see when it makes sense for us to do it. So that's how we see it."

            "name": "Strauss Zelnick",
            "content": "Thanks, Nicole. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we delivered another consecutive quarter of solid results with net bookings of $1.5 billion. We experienced healthy player engagement, driven by exciting new game releases, post-launch content updates and bold beats for many of our mobile offerings, even as consumers continue to navigate the effects of various macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. We made excellent progress with our integration of Zynga, and we remain highly optimistic about the vast long-term growth potential for the mobile industry, which is expected to reach over $160 billion in gross bookings within the next four years. Some of our key achievements in the period include: we successfully reached our 100-day integration milestone at the end of August. Zynga's President, Frank Gibeau and his leadership team have evaluated our mobile portfolio, including existing games and titles in development, and they've identified numerous opportunities to enhance our performance. These initiatives include reorganizing several teams, sharing development tools, resources and best practices across our mobile studios, conceptualizing new bold beats and leveraging Zynga's highly valuable publishing platform, which is now even stronger following the recent acquisition of Storemaven. We're also starting to expand our direct-to-consumer efforts more meaningfully across our mobile portfolio further to enhance profitability. We remain committed to delivering $500 million of annual net bookings opportunities over time. The Zynga team has been working with our other labels to explore potential creative projects. As part of this process, we've identified certain underrepresented genres in our mobile portfolio that we believe we can pursue more aggressively over time. Our efforts to deliver cost synergies are tracking extremely well, and we're now confident that we can achieve over $100 million of annual savings within the first two years post close. I'd like to thank Frank, his leadership team and all of our new colleagues at Zynga once again for helping to make our combination happen so seamlessly. We're thrilled to have Zynga as part of our Take-Two family. Turning to our second quarter results. Our net bookings performance was within our guidance range, led by Grand Theft Auto V, which exceeded our expectations and to date has sold more than 170 million units worldwide. Starting July 26, Grand Theft Auto Online launched its latest major update, The Criminal Enterprises, introducing expanded gameplay across the Criminal Careers of Executives, Bikers, Nightclub Owners, and Gunrunners, as well as the opportunity to work with federal agents to uncover a criminal conspiracy in the new Operation Paper Trail series of Contact Missions. The update also featured a range of new vehicles, and more, including the new Community Series, showcasing some of the most fun and unique experiences created by players across the globe. This major update also delivered a host of overall improvements to the gameplay experience, including increased payouts across a wide array of activities and several other player-requested features. The Criminal Enterprises was very well received, and we have seen millions of players engaging with significant new features such as the ability to run Sell Missions in Private Lobbies, New Weapon Wheel Controls, and more. In addition, Rockstar Games GTA+ subscription service continues to grow its members who enjoy a rotation of numerous exclusive in-game benefits, including vehicles, upgrades, and gear every month. On September 9th, 2K and Visual Concepts successfully launched NBA 2K23, with the title earning an 80+ Metacritic rating at launch, and receiving praise for raising the bar on the top-selling sports title in the U.S. To date, NBA 2K23 has sold-in nearly 5 million units, alongside significant growth in virtual currency sales and a higher average selling price compared to NBA 2K22. Player engagement has been very strong, with more than 2 million daily active users, and 4% growth in average days played. We believe that NBA 2K23 will continue to grow its audience, as the title provides a year-round experience for its fervent community of players throughout the world. I'd like to congratulate the teams at 2K and Visual Concepts for once again delivering such a stellar basketball experience. The franchise's momentum extends beyond the core console experience, with NBA 2K22 Arcade Edition for Apple Arcade remaining the #1 game on the platform, and our recent launch of NBA 2K23 Arcade Edition offering many new features and improvements. Furthermore, NBA 2K Online in China continues to be the #1 PC online sports game in the country with nearly 59 million registered users. Red Dead Redemption 2 is continuing to impress, with sell-in of more than 46 million units worldwide to-date and more active players in this second quarter than we have seen for the comparable period in previous years. 2K supported WWE 2K22 and Tiny Tina's Wonderlands with the final downloadable content packs for each title, which were made available individually and as part of the games' Season Passes. During the quarter, recurrent consumer spending rose 76% and accounted for 80% of net bookings. Zynga continued to experience strong engagement amongst its active players, and we believe that we are maintaining our market share globally. Our mobile business delivered mid-teens growth in advertising bookings on a year-over-year basis, outperforming the broader industry. At the same time, in-app purchases continued to be under some pressure due to current macroeconomic conditions. Some key highlights of our mobile offerings during the quarter include: The Rollic business remained very strong and exceeded our plan. Notably, Rollic surpassed 2 billion lifetime downloads worldwide and has now launched 19 titles that have reached the #1 or #2 most downloaded game position in the U.S. App Store. Several of Zynga's titles celebrated milestones, including the 2nd anniversary of Harry Potter: Puzzles and Spells; the 10th anniversary of Farmville; and the 15th anniversary of Zynga Poker. Each of these anniversaries was supported with an array of in-game events and unique content offerings. Zynga unveiled several high-profile brand integrations, including Socialpoint's partnership with AMC Network's The Walking Dead in Dragon City and Monster Legends; CSR2's debut of Pagani's new multi-million-dollar Utopia hypercar; and Game of Thrones Slots Casino launched a new ingame event, Week of the Dragon, in conjunction with HBO's new hit fantasy series, House of the Dragon. Turning to our outlook, we now expect to deliver net bookings of $5.4 billion to $5.5 billion in fiscal 2023. Our reduced forecast reflects shifts in our pipeline, fluctuations in FX rates, and a more cautious view of the current macroeconomic backdrop, particularly in mobile. Lainie will provide more detail on our outlook shortly. Despite these headwinds and their effect on our guidance for the year, we remain highly confident in our diverse and extensive development pipeline that we expect will deliver us sequential growth and record performance over the next several years. Take-Two has a proven strategy and consistent track record of success, driven by our core tenets: We aspire to be the most creative, the most innovative, and the most efficient entertainment company in the world. As we strive to capitalize on the numerous opportunities ahead of us, we are committed to creating significant long-term value for our shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Karl. Thanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for delivering another solid quarter. And to our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued support. We'll now take your questions. Operator? Look, engagement is very stable. We got a lot of terrific hit titles at Zynga. It's what we like about the company. Unlike many mobile businesses of this kind of scale, our bookings are not concentrated in two or three titles. We have more than 10 big titles and more coming. So engagement is incredibly solid. We are seeing some pressure on in-game spending. We also have a great story in advertising bookings because our advertising bookings are up mid-double digits year-over-year. And so there are plenty of bright spots in the business as well. The most important spot, people love mobile games. They love our mobile games, they continue to play them, and we're seeing no significant change in engagement across our titles. In terms of what I expect to change, look, it's very hard to say. I think that's -- it's anyone's guess what the economy will do. My own opinion, and it's really just one person's opinion, as we're looking -- we should be looking at three to six more months of downward pressure. And I expect by the end of '23, we'll be in good shape. It is. We have 87 titles coming across mobile, PC and console. And it's the most robust pipeline we've ever had certainly and one would argue, one of the most robust pipelines in the industry. It's driven by the pipeline, of course. So we know what the release schedule is and we feel really good about it. And if we didn't, we wouldn't call for a sequential growth and record results in the next three years. But I understand the frustration. And look, we call it as we see it and I think we're known for that. Had we expected where we were right now, then we wouldn't be guiding down. We're guiding down because things have materialized in a way that's different than our expectations. Some of that is related to pipeline, but frankly, not most of it. Most of it's related to mobile, a significant amount of FX as well. But there have been some modest pipeline shifts. So the good news is those titles are, of course, coming. I understand the concern and I understand the question as well. No, we're not seeing any productivity issues, for example. We definitely have very high quality expectations in the bands, and that's reflected in the fact that we're performing across the board. So this company is a hit factory. We haven't had a disappointing release in as long as I can remember. And that's honestly the most important thing. So we would much rather -- if you have to choose, I'd much rather have the situation we're in, which is we've had some delays and we have had to revise down guidance. I'll choose that any day over taking some flops. That's really the key in this business. We've had issues -- I mean, we've been around here long enough to remember them. Where in the past, we had delays in titles and it was ultimately always worth waiting for because when we got to the other side, the results were delivered, and the small amount of the time delay didn't ultimately matter in the context of the results that we were able to deliver. I'm hopeful that will be the case here as well. Yes. What I was referring to is top and bottom line, so net bookings and income, however you describe EBITDA as a handy measure. Yes. Thanks for your questions. Look, GTA Online and NBA 2K are very different animals. GTA Online has been around for nearly 10 years. It's beloved by a massive audience. GTA V, the underlying title has sold in more than 170 million units. NBA 2K is an annualized release, and so we get an annual snapshot of how virtual currency is doing. Engagement is very high indeed. Virtual currency is up in NBA 2K23. The mobile advertising business, look, these are two different businesses and the vast majority of our net bookings at Zynga comes from in-app purchases still. So yes, we expect the growth rate in advertising probably to exceed the growth rate in in-app purchases, certainly for the next year. Beyond that, I think it's too early to say. And with regard to Playdots, we've relocated the operations of our successful game, Two Dots to another studio. And yes, that was driven by the integration benefits that we felt we could achieve. Yes. On the first question, yes, there are a number of early opportunities that we've identified, including our approach directly to the consumer on the mobile business, which is pretty exciting and could generate material benefits. And we're working on a number of properties as well. It will take longer to bring some titles to market but that's super exciting. It's the former. Yes. It's roughly the same number of units year-over-year and virtual currency spending is up. And we don't split out the spending in the different modes for the purpose of this call. Well, we don't really look at our relations with our colleagues as one of leverage, so we probably wouldn't describe it through that lens. I do think that it's probably going to become easier to hire people when a lot of tech businesses are laying people off. We don't expect a rip and we don't have a hiring freeze. We're always judicious about the people we bring on board. We pride ourselves on being highly efficient, and we believe we are highly efficient now. So I do think that this may make it somewhat easier to hire really talented people, but we wouldn't use these times to apply leverage. We believe that we have great relationships with our workforce and those are terribly important to us. And with regard to the leak, it was terribly unfortunate and we take those sorts of incidents very seriously indeed. There's no evidence that any material assets were taken, which is a good thing. And certainly, the leak won't have any influence on development or anything of the sort. But it is terribly disappointing and causes us to be ever more vigilant on matters relating to cybersecurity. It's all one, it's all Zynga. It's managed by the Zynga team and we have a lot of great titles. And on the subscription side, look, we've been very cooperative with both Sony and Microsoft on their subscription offerings when it makes sense for us. And my own views have not changed at all since I first started talking about subscription, which is now, I want to say, probably four years ago. The interactive entertainment business is very different than the linear entertainment business. People consume far fewer hours of interactive entertainment in a given month than they do of linear entertainment. And within that consumption, there are far fewer titles consumed in interactive entertainment than there are with linear entertainment. So I, at least, pose the question as to whether subscription makes as much sense for interactive entertainment as it does for linear entertainment and registered some skepticism, which I still hold. I think the second area of skepticism was whether it made sense -- and this is a rhetorical question because I think the answer is no, to offer frontline titles [day and day] with titles on a subscription service. I don't think that ever made sense. I still don't think it makes sense. And I believe that it's now becoming obvious that it doesn't make sense. It's just a lost opportunity for the publisher. So I wouldn't want to speak for my friend, Phil, but our views remain unchanged. There probably is a subscription business. It's a catalog business. It's probably best aimed at very avid consumers because those are the consumers who are interested in playing catalog titles, implying a whole bunch of different titles in a given month. But I don't think it's a mass market service that supplants the interactive entertainment business as we know it at all. And I don't think there's any evidence to the contrary so far. Yes. In terms of mobile, from a macro perspective, I think that you're right. There's a difference between user acquisition and retention and conversion. And on user acquisition, I think we and everyone else is just going to be a bit more selective to drive efficiency. And in terms of retention and conversion, that's a reflection of people just not having to spend mobile. You can enjoy a title without spending in-game. 90-plus percent of consumers do not spend in-game. And so at times when consumers are feeling the pressure of higher prices for fuel and food, for example, they may be less likely to spend money on entertainment, especially when you can have the experience anyhow. So in terms of our expectations, I think this is -- it's a moment where we will, in fact, tune up our UA spend to become more efficient. That's a good thing. And yes, we will probably see some pressure on in-game purchases for a period of time. As I said earlier in the call, not that I think you can underwrite to this because it's just 1 person's opinion, I think there'll be pressure for three to six months at least that's driven by the economy and geopolitical factors. And I'm hoping that by the end of '23 -- I believe that by the end of '23, things will normalize and will be on an upward swing again. And Lainie will take the question about buybacks. Yes. At any given time, we're always reviewing our portfolio, both in terms of the performance of the current titles and the potential for new titles that we're working on. And Frank and his team are very focused on making sure to optimize the current title lineup and to make sure that our development for new titles is as effective and poised for success as it possibly can be. Good news is we have a terrific lineup of great titles and our mobile titles all make money. I think it's a great question, thank you. And I think the bottom line is you're probably not going to convert a console player to become a mobile player. You have to appeal to a mobile player. And we believe that legacy IP, when properly developed as a great title, can do just that. But it's not a SLAM DUNK by any means. It's still got to be a great game. But you're not going to convince someone who never plays a mobile title to play a mobile title just because it's based on console IP. Want to thank everyone for joining us today. I want to say thanks particularly to our dedicated team of colleagues all around the world who continue to do a great job. While it would be nice always to have the best possible news in an upward sloping curve, this is a business that occasionally does present us with challenges. This team is well suited to challenges. We have a great pipeline, we have a great team. We have the ability to deliver, and we wish you all a great holiday season. Thank you joining us. And thank you for your support."

Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that Fiscal 2023 is off to a great start, highlighted by first quarter Net Bookings of $1 billion. Our performance demonstrates the quality of our games and our ability to engage audiences across the globe, despite the impacts of various macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. This has been a milestone period in the history of our Company, as we closed our combination with Zynga. This transaction firmly establishes Take-Two\u00e2\u0080\u0099s position as one of the largest pure-play interactive entertainment companies in the world. We are home to the industry's top creative talent and we own and control an exceptional, diverse portfolio of intellectual properties encompassing all key platforms and genres. We are exceedingly optimistic about the long-term growth potential for the mobile industry, as well as our ability to create greater shareholder value as a combined entity. Over the past few months, we have made significant progress in our integration efforts. Zynga, which is being run by the label\u00e2\u0080\u0099s President, Frank Gibeau, established its ongoing leadership structure. Alongside Frank, we are fortunate to have numerous, proven senior executives who will be instrumental in overseeing Zynga\u00e2\u0080\u0099s day-to-day operations and taking our combined mobile business to the next level of success. The integration of our corporate functions and systems has been tracking well, and we are pleased that our Day 1 plans were executed seamlessly, with no disruptions to our business operations or player communities. While it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still early, we are confident that we can realize $100 million of annual cost synergies within two years post-close and we are exploring additional areas of efficiencies. Our creative teams are in active discussions about potential projects, and we remain committed to delivering over $500 million of annual Net Bookings opportunities over time. There are several meaningful drivers in mobile that we believe our teams can begin to activate this fiscal year, including implementing new bold beats, driven by new content and other live-service enhancements; user acquisition optimization; creating a centralized library for development technologies and tools; enhancing the monetization of in-game advertising; and continuing to invest in our ad tech platform with Chartboost. Over the intermediate and long-term, our vision is to introduce mobile games for some of our most popular and proven intellectual properties that have the potential to be greatly additive to our financial profile. We have observed positive signs that some mobile players are looking for more sophisticated and immersive content, and we look forward to participating in this trend that should continue for the foreseeable future. We also see a tremendous opportunity to establish a more meaningful presence in key mobile-first emerging markets. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Turning to our first quarter results, on a pre-combination basis, our Net Bookings of $731 million were within our previously stated outlook range, led by the outperformance of NBA 2K22 and WWE 2K22. Zynga's offerings complemented our results significantly for the period. NBA 2K22 continued to dominate as the industry's leading basketball game, with sell-in of over 12 million units to date, exceeding the series\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sell-in from the prior year. During the first quarter, engagement with the title remained strong, with average games played per user increasing 16% year-over-year. In addition, NBA 2K22 Arcade Edition remains the #1 game on Apple Arcade since its launch in October 2021, and downloads of NBA 2K Mobile remained robust, driven by the Courtside Pass updates and content surrounding the NBA Playoffs and Finals. Our partnership with the NBA remains incredibly strong and we look forward to the launch of NBA 2K23 in September. Throughout the first quarter, 2K and Visual Concepts released a series of DLC packs to support WWE 2K22, which brought even more fan-favorite superstars into the ring for what has been hailed by critics and consumers alike as our best WWE offering in the series. Engagement with the title has been outstanding, with more than 330 million in-game matches played and over 8.5 million hours of WWE 2K22 content viewed on Twitch. We greatly value our partnership with the WWE and are thrilled about the long-term opportunity to grow the franchise further together. Rockstar Games capitalized on the momentum from last quarter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s releases of Grand Theft Auto V for PlayStation 5 and Xbox series X/S, Grand Theft Auto Online standalone, and the launch of GTA+, as the experience continues to captivate players. Latest generation console players of Grand Theft Auto Online grew over 40% this quarter and are monetizing at a rate 36% higher than players on the previous generation. GTA+, the premium membership available exclusively on those consoles, has seen consistent growth since launch. The GTA Online community remains strong, and its audience size is operating at a new normal that is 49% higher than the pre-pandemic first quarter of fiscal 2020. Sales of Grand Theft Auto V also remained strong, and to date, the title has sold-in nearly 170 million units. With development of the next entry in the Grand Theft Auto series well underway, the Rockstar Games team is determined to once again set creative benchmarks for the series, our industry, and for all entertainment, just as the label has done with every one of their frontline releases. We were pleased with the performance of Red Dead Redemption 2, which continues to expand its audience and, to date, has sold-in more than 45 million units worldwide. Tiny Tina\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Wonderlands exceeded our expectations and continued to sustain healthy player engagement, due in part to its robust post-launch content, which will continue throughout the Fiscal Year. The title has resonated with core fans and new audiences, with nearly 40% of players having never before played a Borderlands title. Additionally, Tiny Tina\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Wonderlands launched on Steam in June alongside its previously released DLC offerings. Also in June, 2K and Supermassive Games launched The Quarry, an all-new horror narrative game, where every choice, big or small, shapes your story and determines who lives to tell the tale. The title launched to strong reviews, with NPR declaring it \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis summer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best horror game,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and Variety calling it \u00e2\u0080\u009cevery horror fan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dream video game.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And, Private Division released Void Riders, the first expansion for their critically acclaimed skateboarding action title, OlliOlli World, from Roll 7. The expansion earned an 87 on OpenCritic, which was even higher than the base game\u00e2\u0080\u0099s excellent review scores. Private Division will share more details regarding the game\u00e2\u0080\u0099s second expansion later this year. Recurrent consumer spending rose 48% and accounted for 73% of Net Bookings. This was significantly above our prior guidance due to the inclusion of Zynga for part of the quarter, which was not included previously, as well as outperformance from our core portfolio. During the period, Zynga continued to experience strength in player engagement and retention, and we believe that we are maintaining our healthy market share on a global basis. Additionally, we delivered significant growth in advertising Net Bookings, which was offset by some pressure on in-app purchases due to current macroeconomic conditions and seasonality. Some key highlights of our mobile offerings during the quarter include: Harry Potter: Puzzles & Spells featured an in-game event to celebrate the cinematic release of \"Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore.\" Empires & Puzzles introduced the game's fifth season, Dynasty of Dunes. Zynga Poker released the Omaha update, giving players a new way to enjoy the popular game. Words With Friends introduced Clubs, a new feature that expands the game's social experience by offering shared spaces that players can enjoy together. Rollic launched 11 games in the quarter and Colors Runners! reached the #1 top free downloaded games position in the U.S. App Store in June. Turning to our outlook, we now expect to deliver Net Bookings of $5.8 billion to $5.9 billion, which includes Zynga for part of the year. Our pipeline for the year continues to look very strong, and we are excited to expand significantly our mobile presence with a best-in-class platform. Our new forecast also takes into account some movement in our release slate for the year, foreign currency pressures, and macroeconomic uncertainty. Lainie will provide more details shortly. Looking ahead, our long-term vision is clearer than ever, and we believe that our combination with Zynga will enable us to capitalize better on the evolving dynamics of the interactive entertainment industry. As we deliver our expansive, diverse pipeline and pursue the vast opportunities that we have identified through our combination with Zynga, we see a path to engage even greater audiences around the world, grow our scale, and enhance our margins. I will now turn the call over to Karl.\nKarl Slatoff: Thanks, Strauss. I'd like to begin by thanking our teams for a great start to the year driven by their tireless passion, creativity and commitment to deliver the best entertainment experiences in the world. I'll now discuss our recent releases. On July 7, 2K and Supermassive Games launched an update to the popular horror experience, The Quarry, which introduced several new features, including Wolfpack, a new online multiplayer mode where the host can invite other players to help shape the story as a collaborative group. In addition, all six episodes of the Bizarre Yet Bonafide podcast featured in The Quarry are now available in-game and in their entirety. The podcast, which was previously available only on select streaming platforms, follows two fictional paranormal investigators as they delve into the troubling secrets of The Quarry. On July 19th, 2K and Visual Concepts released the fifth and final DLC pack for WWE 2K22, entitled \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Whole Dam Pack.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The update features pop-culture icon Machine Gun Kelly, social media megastar Logan Paul, and high-flying, hard-hitting WWE Hall of Famer Rob Van Dam, alongside franchise debuts from LA Knight, Xia Li, Commander Azeez, and Sarray. We are very proud to have delivered such a stellar WWE offering this year and to support the title with our fans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 most beloved superstars. On July 26th, Rockstar Games continued to grow and evolve the world of Grand Theft Auto Online across all platforms with the launch of The Criminal Enterprises, a sweeping update bringing new business prospects for Criminal Careers, plus new, elaborate Contact Missions, auto showrooms to test drive and purchase vehicles, and many other upgrades rolling out all summer long. The update also delivers highly-requested experience improvements as well as increased payouts across a range of gameplay, offering players more choices and freedom as they climb their way up the criminal ranks. We remain incredibly excited about our pipeline for Fiscal 2023 and beyond. On August 16th, Private Division and Roll7 will release Rollerdrome, a brand-new third-person, single-player shooter. This stylish, high-octane game combines adrenaline-fueled skate stunts with intense combat in a retro-futuristic world. The title will be available on Steam and for PlayStation Plus members for an introductory price just under $20, after which it will retail for $29.99. Additionally, PlayStation Plus Premium members will be able to play a free trial of the game when it launches. On September 9th, 2K and Visual Concepts will launch NBA 2K23, the next offering from our industry-leading NBA series. Phoenix Suns\u00e2\u0080\u0099 shooting guard, three-time NBA All-Star, and 2021-22 Kia All-NBA First Team selection, Devin Booker, is featured on this year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Standard Edition and cross-gen Digital Deluxe Edition. The Iconic Michael Jordan appears on the cover of the NBA 2K23 Michael Jordan Edition and the brand-new NBA 2K23 Championship Edition, which retails for $149.99 and delivers incredible value by including a 12-month subscription to the NBA League Pass for the first time. In the U.S. and Canada, players can purchase the WNBA Edition as a GameStop exclusive, featuring Phoenix Mercury superstar Diana Taurasi, along with Seattle Storm legend Sue Bird. 2K has partnered with Every Kid Sports to support greater representation of females in basketball with a $100,000 donation that will enable girls across the U.S. to participate in youth sports. 2K will reveal more details of NBA 2K23 in the coming weeks. We have made the decision to move back the launch timing of Marvel's Midnight Suns to ensure the teams at Firaxis Games and 2K deliver the best possible experience for our fans. The title will launch later this fiscal year on Windows PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5. The Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch versions will follow at a later date. During the fourth quarter, Private Division and Intercept games will launch Kerbal Space Program 2 on PC. The game\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dedicated community can look forward to more information about the game and its new features from the title\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ongoing gameplay reveal video series. 2K\u00e2\u0080\u0099s teams at Visual Concepts and HB Studios remain hard at work on their upcoming launches of WWE 2K23 and PGA TOUR 2K23. 2K will have more to share on these annual sports offerings shortly. Zynga has a handful of games that are currently in soft-launch, with more on the horizon, and we expect some of these titles will begin launching worldwide in our next fiscal year. This includes Star Wars Hunters, which is continuing to regularly roll out new content updates and features as it progresses through to a more mature phase of soft launch in strategic territories. At the same time, Rollic will continue to release a high volume of mobile titles as it has done previously. Turning to eSports, the NBA 2K League Championships tip off will take place in Indianapolis at the Pavilion at Pan Am, with 3v3 play August 17th through the 20th, and 5v5 play August 24th through the 27th . We remain excited about the continued success and growth of the NBA 2K League. In closing, we believe that our Company today is the strongest and most diverse it has ever been. With approximately 11,000 of the industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best and brightest talent, the most exciting and commercially successful portfolio of owned intellectual property, and the ability to deliver deeply captivating and engaging entertainment experiences on any platform anywhere in the world, we believe that we are well-positioned to deliver long-term value for our shareholders. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll now turn the call over to Lainie\nLainie Goldstein: Thanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll discuss the key highlights from our first quarter before reviewing our financial outlook for the fiscal year 2023 and second quarter. Please note that our first quarter results include Zynga's financial performance for 39 days of the quarter, which impacts the comparability of our results relative to last year, as well as to our prior guidance, which did not include the contribution from Zynga. Also, any references to Take-Two\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pre-combination results are referring to our financial performance excluding the acquired Zynga business. Additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release. As Strauss mentioned, this was a momentous quarter for our organization as we closed our transaction with Zynga and made significant progress on our integration efforts. Our teams created detailed plans to realize at least $100 million of annual cost synergies and we continue to expect approximately $50 million to be achieved within the first twelve months post-close. The largest opportunities include reducing duplicative corporate overhead and contracts, consolidating systems, rationalizing our real estate footprint, and leveraging Zynga's marketing functions across our other mobile titles. We are also exploring additional areas of efficiencies. At the same time, we delivered strong first quarter results, driven by Net Bookings of $1 billion. On a pre-combination basis, our Net Bookings were $731 million, which grew 3% compared to last year and was within our guidance range of $700 million to $750 million. The movement in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted our Net Bookings by approximately 1%. We were also pleased with Zynga\u00e2\u0080\u0099s contribution for part of the quarter. With consumers today navigating various macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, we believe that our financial performance truly demonstrates the resiliency of our business model, driven by the incredible quality of our games and the significant value that our interactive entertainment experiences provide our players. During the period, recurrent consumer spending rose 48% and accounted for 73% of Net Bookings. This was significantly above our prior guidance due to the inclusion of Zynga for part of the quarter, as well as the outperformance of our pre-combination portfolio, led by NBA 2K22, Tiny Tina\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Wonderlands, and Top Eleven. Digitally-delivered Net Bookings increased 41% and accounted for 95% of the total. During the quarter, 77% of console game sales were delivered digitally, up from 73% last year. GAAP net revenue increased 36% to $1.1 billion and cost of revenue increased 32% to $436 million, which included a $20 million impairment charge related to our decision not to proceed with further development of a title from an unannounced new franchise. Operating expenses increased by 125% to $704 million, primarily driven by the addition of Zynga and a full quarter of Nordeus, business acquisition costs and higher personnel and marketing expenses. And our GAAP net loss was $104 million, or $0.76 per share, which was largely impacted by $117 million of amortization of acquired intangibles and $165 million of business acquisition costs. Our GAAP net loss benefited from a reversal of expense of approximately $48 million related to forfeitures of previously granted stock awards. In the first quarter last year, our GAAP net income was $152 million, or $1.30. Our management tax rate for the period was 18% as compared to 16% in the prior year as a result of our combination with Zynga. On a pre-combination basis, our management results excluding the impacts of the Zynga transaction exceeded the high end of our guidance range by $0.06, despite the impairment charge taken during the quarter and the higher tax rate. We ended the quarter with over $1.3 billion of cash and short-term Investments and $3.3 billion of debt. Turning to our guidance, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll begin with our full fiscal year expectations. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 As Strauss mentioned, we are initiating new guidance that includes our combination with Zynga for approximately 10 months of our fiscal year. We now expect to deliver Net Bookings of $5.8 billion to $5.9 billion. Our assumptions take into consideration some shifts in our pipeline for the year, as well as movement in foreign exchange rates and the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. The largest contributors to Net Bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Empires & Puzzles, Rollic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hypercasual mobile portfolio, Toon Blast, and Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online. We expect the Net Bookings breakdown from our labels to be 45% Zynga, which includes our former T2 mobile titles, 37% 2K, 17% Rockstar Games, and 1% Private Division. We forecast our geographic Net Bookings split to be about 60% United States and 40% International. We now expect recurrent consumer spending to grow by approximately 110% and represent 77% of total Net Bookings. Our digitally-delivered Net Bookings are expected to grow by approximately 80% and represent 96% of Net Bookings. Our forecast assumes that 74% of console game sales will be delivered-digitally, up from 68% last year. We expect to generate more than $700 million in Non-GAAP Adjusted Unrestricted Operating Cash Flow and we expect to deploy approximately $135 million for capital expenditures. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $5.73 billion to $5.83 billion and cost of revenue to range from $2.74 billion to $2.79 billion, which includes approximately $700 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Total operating expenses are expected to range from $3.37 billion to $3.38 billion as compared to $1.5 billion last year. This increase reflects the inclusion of Zynga; business acquisition costs; and higher personnel, marketing, and IT expenses, which is slightly offset by our anticipated cost synergies for the year. And, we expect a GAAP net loss ranging from $398 million to $438 million, or $2.50 to $2.75 per share, which assumes a basic share count of 159.2 million shares. We expect our management tax rate to be 18% throughout the year. Now, moving to our guidance for the fiscal second quarter: We project net bookings to range from $1.5 billion to $1.55 billion, compared to $985 million in the second quarter last year. The largest contributors to net Bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Empires and Puzzles, Rollic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hypercasual mobile portfolio, and Toon Blast. We project recurrent consumer spending to grow approximately 85% and digitally-delivered Net Bookings to increase approximately 70%. Our forecast assumes that 73% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 65% last year. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $1.37 billion to $1.42 billion and cost of revenue to range from $700 million to $719 million, which includes approximately $200 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Operating expenses are expected to range from $849 million to $859 million. At the midpoint, this represents a 125% increase over last year. This increase reflects the inclusion of Zynga and business acquisition costs, as well as higher marketing and personnel expenses, which we believe will be slightly offset by the realization of some of our anticipated cost synergies. And, GAAP net loss is expected to range from $144 million to $160 million, or $0.86 to $0.96 per share, which assumes a basic share count of 166.4 million shares. In closing, we had a great start to the year and we believe that our combination with Zynga will enhance our positioning as one of the top interactive entertainment companies in the world. As our teams continue to leverage the core competencies from Zynga\u00e2\u0080\u0099s publishing platform, we believe that we will be able to engage our player base more deeply, add new dimensions to our existing portfolio, and deliver significant long-term growth and margin expansion for our shareholders. Thank you. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll now turn the call back to Strauss.\nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for delivering an excellent start to the year. And to our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued support. We'll now take your questions. Operator?\nOperator:  Our first question comes from Eric Handler with MKM Partners.\nEric Handler : Two questions. First, Lainie, I wonder if you could sort of size the changes in guidance in terms of how we might have been thinking about Marvel's Midnight Sun versus what's changed with FX and macro.\nLainie Goldstein : So for the difference in the pre-combination business, we had some shifts in the pipeline for the year. And then there was a movement in the foreign exchange rates. And then there's also the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. So I would say that the shifts in our pipeline were the most meaningful to our numbers. So I would say we had some titles that moved within the year. And that was Marvel Midnight Sun\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and then there was an unannounced title that moved out of the year as well. So I would say definitely the pipeline changes that were the most -- to the change in the guidance.\nEric Handler : Great. And then Strauss, I wondered if you could talk a little bit about the state of the mobile industry right now. There has been a little bit of headwinds with growth for the industry in this year. And wondering as you look at Zynga's portfolio and combining it with your portfolio, how fast can you integrate sort of the ad network? Are things changing relative to what you were thinking maybe at the time the acquisition closed or maybe even when you first made the acquisition?\nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks, Eric. There's a lot there. We are seeing some softness in the mobile market. The good news is, I think we're doing better than most, if not all. And I think we're seeing an offsetting increase in our market share. I think the reason we're seeing probably a bit more softness in mobile than in console is in console to participate you have to buy. And in mobile, by definition, you're in a free-to-play environment. You can play without paying if you are feeling the pinch of inflation, specifically with regard to nondiscretionary expenditures like fuel and food, you could imagine that if you're playing the game, you might choose to spend a bit less or spend a bit less frequently. That said, we think Zynga\u00e2\u0080\u0099s highly diverse portfolio of terrific games is a meaningful offset. And as I said, I think we're outperforming the market. That's our belief. We're also seeing growth in advertising revenues. And because I think we under-index in advertising, that's an opportunity that will be offsetting to the broader market even if we see ongoing softness. But as you know, we always call it the way we see it. And what we're seeing is overall some softness in the marketplace. When you have 50% of big bank economists saying we think we might be in a recession in the next quarter or 2, my attitude is the market believes we're in a recession right now. And as a consumer-facing company, we are seeing some softness. With regard to the integration, I'm not sure you asked about how it's going, but it's going really well. And we expect to meet or exceed our cost synergy expectations, both in terms of magnitude and timing. And more importantly, we fit really well together culturally. And I think all of us at Zynga and now all of us at Take-Two are very excited about the combination of the way things are going and how well the teams do fit together. And we had a sense of that during the diligence period, but it's always nice to know post closing that that's the case. And I think you alluded to whether we can sort of create one broader integrated platform. As you know, Take-Two Mobile Games has been folded into the Zynga division, which is operated by Frank Gibeau and his team, highly independently. And one of their key priorities is to create an integrated platform that will bring the best out in all of our games. So enhance our acquisition and enhance our conversion, enhance our retention, enhance our lifetime value and also enhance, as I said, our advertising revenue. Zynga has a proprietary ad tech platform driven by their Chartboost division. And we're excited about what that can bring to Zynga and also bring to all of Take-Two.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Thornton with Truist Securities.\nMatthew Thornton : Maybe two, if I could. First one, Lainie, I've been wondering if you'd be able to give us what the RCS percentage of bookings was for legacy Take-Two for the quarter. I think it was 73% total with Zynga. I'm curious kind of what that number was without the quarter. And then just secondly, Strauss, any movement in the out-year pipeline if we think about how things are progressing and developing. I guess what's your general sense about progress maybe when we last talked 3 months ago, that would be helpful.\nLainie Goldstein : In terms of the RCS for the pre-combination, we're not really breaking that out anymore. We're really looking at the business overall as one business. But I can tell you that we did outperform NBA 2K 22, Tiny Tina's Wonderland and top 11 versus our guidance for the quarter. So those 3 titles did better than we had expected.\nStrauss Zelnick: And in terms of the pipeline, yes, as Lainie mentioned, we did have a number of titles that have effect that has been shifting around that affected our pipeline and some of our results for fiscal '23. Generally speaking, we obviously don't take these shifts lightly. We have seen them before. The most important thing for us is always to put up the best game we possibly can because that's what builds franchise value and ultimately, that's what drives the success of our organization. So it's worth the wait. Typically, that is the best economic decision that we can make. And I would say that I'd characterize the pipeline shifts as well these things do move around and you may have -- that may affect a specific year. It does -- hasn't really changed at all our overall perspective on the growth in the intermediate and long term.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Cost with Morgan Stanley.\nMatthew Cost : I have 2. So I guess just kind of following up on the Chartboost point. I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks and then just now in the Q&A about leveraging those marketing capabilities inside Zynga across other titles. I guess what are you envisioning that looks like? And is that something that can be used to promote titles or cross-promote titles on PC and console in addition to mobile? And then just on the commentary, I think, in the press release about the $500 million of synergies now that you kind of have your hands dirty, you've gotten under the hood with Zynga, do you have a sense of how long it will take to establish feasibility and start working through those projects to get a sense of how long they might take? Is it a 5-year process to get those done? What might that timing look like?\nStrauss Zelnick: Look, I think to the extent that Zynga succeeds in building a robust ad tech platform, then it will affect all of our live services businesses, not just Zynga's live services businesses. And we're really optimistic about that. To be clear, we haven't baked any of that into our cost synergy expectations. And as you know, we've not included our revenue synergy expectations in our forward-looking projections. So that's all upside if we're able to achieve that. But I feel very good about the exercise. And yes, we'll cross over to the entire company's live services offerings. In terms of the timing for new projects, very hard to call that now. There's a lot of excitement internally. We're working on a lot of interesting potential ideas. And certainly, the development for mobile is much quicker than it is for console. -- but it would be premature to state in a particular time. And of course, all product announcements do come from our labels.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mario Lu with Barclays.\nMario Lu: Great. The first one is just a follow-up on the full year guidance, the updated one with Zynga. I was hoping if you could help kind of clarify what items are kind of moved around within the Zynga side. I know that Star Wars: Hunters got pushed back. It sounds like macro weakness deepened a little bit. So any other color you can provide in terms of the Zynga side would be great.\nLainie Goldstein : Sure. There were some movements in their pipeline. There was some changes in the FX rate. The Russia sales were removed from their financials. And then also, there was some overall ad market that the ad market has experienced some pressure. So those are most of the changes that we saw in our numbers over the last few months.\nMario Lu: Okay. And then a follow-up on the recurring consumer spending. I just wanted to make sure for mobile advertising revenue, that's all included, right, in RCS? Or is that categorized somewhere else?\nStrauss Zelnick: Yes, it is indeed .\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Creutz with Cowen.\nDoug Creutz: First, I was just wondering if you're willing to share what Zynga's pro forma rev would have been for the entire quarter. And then secondly, Google is implementing some advertising formatting changes. And there's been some speculation that this could negatively impact the hypercasual ad business. Just wondering what your take is on that. Do you see any risk there -- you think you can manage through?\nLainie Goldstein : We're going to manage their business as one combined entity. So therefore, we're not going to break out the Zynga piece for the quarter. So it's not been our practice to break out our results for the -- with our prior acquisitions. So we're not going to do that here as well.\nStrauss Zelnick: And with regard to a change in ad formats with Google, I don't have a point of view yet about how that may or may not affect us. I would say we're not concerned at the moment.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Omar Dessouky with Bank of America.\nOmar Dessouky: Two questions. So just a little bit of clarification on the business plan for Chartboost specifically. Could you clarify whether you're intending to turn that into a third-party broker advertising network that cross promotes third-party games on third-party ad inventory similar to companies like ironSource, AppLovin or Unity. Or it's more of an internal advertising technology tool? That's my first question.\nKarl Slatoff : So in terms of chartboost, chartboost does actually deals third parties today. We certainly haven't announced any changes. But that is one area that we're very excited about. Look, the bigger the business is, the more valuable the platform is going to be. It's going to be certainly valuable from a tech perspective internally. But we think it's a great product and whether or not it's got great growth prospects to the third-party market remains to be seen, but that's certainly something that we're -- that is under consideration.\nOmar Dessouky: Okay. And then the second question is with regards to the mobile game market and specifically the Zynga assets. If you think about what your outlook for the growth in the expense base was in January when you announced the acquisition versus what you're guiding today, is it about the same? Is it significantly lower given that in the first half, the mobile video game market seems to have not performed terribly well?\nLainie Goldstein : In terms of the changes in the -- in our guidance, it's -- when we're looking at our OpEx, there's an increase in terms of our expenses from Zynga, but then also in terms of against our guidance. We have some lower marketing and some lower headcount expenses due to less new hires due to timing. So that's the big changes between our operating expenses between this guidance and last guidance.\nKarl Slatoff : And on the revenue side, there are -- obviously, there are some things that happen in the short term that Lainie and Strauss have always spoken about that can affect what our expectations are, where they are today in the short run versus where they were in January. But overall, our mid- to long-term prospects, growth prospects for the business have not changed. We're still very excited about the prospects.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Martin Yang with Oppenheimer.\nMartin Yang: My first question is on your investments into the development resources in the future. Can you maybe talk about your plan for mobile or for Zynga, particularly versus rest of more PC and console facing part of Take-Two in terms of headcount increase or any other support infrastructure you have in plan after integration?\nStrauss Zelnick: I think the good news is that we have a very robust team now. We have 11,000 colleagues around the world. And we have the ability to pursue a very ambitious program of development and publishing. And at the same time, we're a growth business, and we expect to continue to grow. So we don't have expectations that we will significantly increase our headcount anytime soon. At the same time, assuming we grow in the way we expect to, and we have an expectation to grow very significantly in the next 3 years, I assume we will increase our development headcount somewhat.\nMartin Yang: One more question, if I may. Can you maybe give us more details on the pipeline shift in Take-Two? Is there more conventional reasons like the game is not ready? Or is there any macro factors play into that decision in terms of you feel that market isn't ready for the game, you want to wait until the broader consumer spending environment becomes more friendly to the games released?\nKarl Slatoff : Yes. I mean it really is simply that the game is -- to the extent that we're moving games -- shifting later, which is when we have pipeline shifts, that's typically the case. We typically don't move games up. But that is really based on where the game is in development. We would not hold a game that's ready to release based on any overall economic trend or something going on in the market. Potentially, we would maybe move a game a week or 2, depending on -- for marketing windows. But generally speaking, when the game is ready, that's when we release it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Fitzgerald with Wells Fargo.\nBrian Fitzgerald : A couple of quick ones. Maybe rifting on that macro theme. For a long time, we've accepted the narrative that gaming spend is really resilient in a recession because of the low cost per hour of entertainment. But at the same time, the model has shifted towards digital and RCS. Strauss, you hit upon mobile consumer discretionary, mobile advertising. How resilient do you think overall RCS consumer, PC would be if we came into more of a macro environment? It seems that would be a little more resilient than free-to-play type of models on the mobile side. And then a quick follow-up, kind of an odd question. Does your PGA Tour business, is it seeing any impact from the Live Tour and the noise around that?\nStrauss Zelnick: So on your first point, I've been asked about the potential impact of the recession on our business since I started with these conference calls some 15 years ago. And over and over again, I said I don't believe the entertainment business is recession proof or even necessarily recession resistant. And I think we're seeing now the decline in consumer spending and increase in inflation will have an impact on the industry. You've seen it from our report today and from our competitors' reports as well. I think conceptually, the impact is probably greater on free-to-play for the reasons that I said earlier in the call, that you can play those titles without spending money. And you may just decide to spend less frequently or less in aggregate. With regard to the console experience, you have to buy the game to play. And so I think if you want the title, you're going to buy it. And as you point out, it's a very good value for consumers. And on your second point, no, we haven't seen any impact on our ongoing sales or engagement with PGA Tour based on, as you put it, the noise around this new offering.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matti Littunen with Bernstein.\nMatti Littunen: A question on IDFA. Now you pointed out your outperformance on mobile. Now I was just wondering if the Chartboost stacked at Zynga would have helped you perhaps navigate some of the headwinds that some of your mobile peers have pointed out in regards to IDFA. So could that user acquisition advantage maybe help there with the outperformance? And then just to check on that macro pressure on the business. Are there any interesting geographic trends in terms of differences, for example, between the U.S. market and elsewhere, as you look at those macro headwinds you're seeing so far this year?\nStrauss Zelnick: Look, the change in IDFA is the new reality. And we've been operating within that new reality for some time. I do think that our massive consumer database gives us a benefit in that we have all kinds of in-house proprietary information that will help us with our marketing. I do think that the ad tech platform that Zynga has and is building further, including Chartboost, will help us, as I said earlier, do even better. I don't -- I'm really not concerned about this post-IDFA world. And in terms of the macro trends, no, the world tends to kind of move in lockstep on an economic basis. So we don't see any particular geographic changes that meaningfully influence our company.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs.\nEric Sheridan : Maybe I'll ask a big picture one. Strauss, we're coming up on the beginning of the third year of this console cycle at the end of this year. Any thoughts about what you've seen from new console adoption and what it's meant for overall gaming habits among your users? And how do you think longer term about aligning some of your more interesting content until we get much deeper into the penetration curve because this console cycle has been very different because of elements around the supply chain dynamic.\nStrauss Zelnick: I think you nailed it. It's hard to call what's going on because it would normally be early 3 years in, but it has been because of the incredible supply constraints. What we have seen though is when people are buying new consoles, they're highly engaged. So the users, for example, of GTA 5 who are on NuGen are much more engaged than prior gen users. Now that may simply be because they have new machines, and they're excited about them. But it may also be, and it wouldn't surprise me if this were the case, that because the new consoles offer a better experience, it's a more engaging experience. And that historically has been the case, that our business has grown coincident with the growth and exploitation of increasingly robust technology. And I would expect that to continue for some time to come.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Hickey with the Benchmark Company.\nMichael Hickey : Congrats on the quarter and congrats on your acquisition, pretty exciting. Two questions for me. First one on your new mobile games from existing IP. Are we -- are you sort of thinking casual spin-offs here like a Red Dead Poker or GTA Casino? Are you thinking more core mobile game releases off your IP? If it is core, do you feel like you have the resources now that you've added Zynga just to make kind of core mobile games? Or would you need to be in a position to hire or create new teams or partner? That's sort of the first question. And the second question on Gen Z and Gen Alpha. Besides being very useful when you think about your biggest IP and where you've had the most last year over the decades, curious what you think your biggest opportunities and challenges are for sort of this emerging new generation of gamers.\nStrauss Zelnick: So thanks, Mike, for your comments and your question. With regard to the creation of new mobile titles based on legacy Take-Two IP, it remains to be seen what those expressions will look like. It will be driven by the passion and the talent of the teams. And to your question regarding whether Zynga has the ability to do that development in-house, I think the answer is unquestionably they do. Zynga has many number of talented studios all around the world. That distinguishes Zynga from virtually all other mobile developers and publishers. And it's one of the things that we found most exciting about the company now the label. In terms of the next generation of gamers, I mean the evidence is that they play more. They're more engaged and they play more. And that makes sense because what was new technology 15 years ago, to them, is just part of the landscape. They've grown up and it's like fish in water. People -- kids start playing with smartphones as early as they can play with blocks. So I have to believe that interactive entertainment will continue to grow disproportionately to the rest of the audiovisual entertainment businesses. There's ongoing evidence that is and will remain the fastest-growing segment within the entertainment industry. And I think this next generation will just put a finer and finer point on that. In terms of what we have to give them to engage them, that, that is still the same, which is the highest quality entertainment experience that is available on the face of the earth, and that's our job, that's our mission and that's what drives us all every day.\nOperator: Our next question is from Drew Crum with Stifel.\nDrew Crum : Maybe for Strauss or Karl. Guys, are you seeing any changes with the development cycle? And specifically, has COVID in any way elongated the time it takes to complete a game? And is that something that could put the development pipeline at risk? And then separately, guys, what is the company's plan around debt reduction for fiscal '23?\nKarl Slatoff : So in terms of development cycles, I think development cycles are ever changing. And obviously, it varies game by game. The games are getting bigger. They're getting more complicated. There's new technology out there that we can avail ourselves to. So -- and all of that's a learning process. And that learning curve is often very steep. And -- but I would say there's nothing specific about the changing development cycles that we haven't seen before. It's just that the games are bigger and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re more complicated and there's more to do. And that's actually what makes our business so exciting.\nLainie Goldstein : In terms of debt reduction, we have a strong cash flow. The business will be generating a lot of cash this year. We look at paying down as much debt it makes sense to at the end of the year. But at the same time, we look at acquisition opportunities as well. So if there's something that makes sense for us to buy during the year, we would also look to do that. So I'd love to see what it looks like at the end of the year based on what the needs are during the rest of the year.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan.\nDavid Karnovsky : Just following up on mobile advertising at Zynga. I think you mentioned you were up year-over-year. Given the overall mobile environment is seeing macro pressure, just wondering how you kind of reconcile that with the advertising gains? Is that about market share? And then I wanted to see if you could just speak to the decision to delay the full launch of Star Wars: Hunters beyond its initial time line? And is that game still slated for a cross-platform just because the platform is listed as TBA in the release?\nKarl Slatoff : So in terms of the advertising business, yes, the overall advertising market, generally speaking, has experienced year-over-year declines due to ad tech consolidation and the lower spend on digital advertising. Our advertising revenues have -- the growth has decelerated from the last quarter, but they grew notably versus last year. And we believe we outperformed the industry trends. We expect this trend to improve over the course of the year with natural seasonality and optimizations we're making in our network mix and pricing. So what was the second question? Yes, in terms of Star Wars: Hunters release, it really is just a matter of making sure that the game is delivered at the highest possible quality, and we have not changed anything around platforms.\nOperator: Our next question is from Andrew Marok with Raymond James.\nAndrew Marok: Two for me, please. Given the Criminal enterprises in the last few GTA Online expansions have been received pretty well, how should we be thinking about the GTA Online content pipeline or philosophy as development on the next premium GTA ramps and resources are reallocated? And then second, could softness in the ad market create opportunities for lower-cost marketing or changed marketing strategies ahead of some of your frontline releases?\nStrauss Zelnick: Thank you. The Rockstar Games has been supplying ongoing content updates for Grand Theft Auto Online since its release in 2013. The most recent one was well received and they continue to put out terrific content. Any announcements about upcoming properties do come from the labels. So we don't tend to talk about them here. And a great question about advertising cost. I think it's a fair one, which is if you're seeing softness in the market, does that mean you can market your titles more cheaply going forward? And the answer is we might see some minor adjustment in the cost profile. But at the end of the day, we spend a lot to support our console -- big console launches. And I don't think that softness in the ad market would probably have a material impact on that.\nOperator: Our next question is from Clay Griffin with MoffettNathanson.\nClay Griffin : Notwithstanding the impact of the higher ASP on the Championship Edition of 2K, I'm just wondering if you're seeing any material change in mix as we head into this kind of preorder window? I guess in light of some of the softness in free-play mobile. I guess the question back, do you have any flexibility to maybe go a bit more aggressively with bundled virtual currency in the preorder window?\nKarl Slatoff : Yes. I think -- I don't know that there's anything specifically in the market that would change our philosophy on how we package our product. I think we always are trying new models and new pricing practices to try to optimize the situation. But I don't really see a market-driven specific opportunity arising. But you'll see us experimenting all the time.\nClay Griffin : And no real change in mix versus last year, normalizing for this championship position?\nKarl Slatoff : There'll be some mix -- changes in mix, but we haven't really talked about it at this point.\nOperator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Strauss Zelnick for closing comments.\nStrauss Zelnick: We'd just like to thank you all for joining us. We're really proud of how the company is performing. Our combination with Zynga is off to a terrific start culturally, financially, strategically and creatively. And I want to reiterate my appreciation to our colleagues all around the world. We'll be talking to all of them tomorrow in our various town hall meetings. These results are thanks to their hard, dedicated and creative work. Thank you all.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",

The gamea\u0302\u0080\u0099s dedicated community can look forward to more information about the game and its new features from the titlea\u0302\u0080\u0099s ongoing gameplay reveal video series. 2Ka\u0302\u0080\u0099s teams at Visual Concepts and HB Studios remain hard at work on their upcoming launches of WWE 2K23 and PGA TOUR 2K23. 2K will have more to share on these annual sports offerings shortly. Zynga has a handful of games that are currently in soft-launch, with more on the horizon, and we expect some of these titles will begin launching worldwide in our next fiscal year. This includes Star Wars Hunters, which is continuing to regularly roll out new content updates and features as it progresses through to a more mature phase of soft launch in strategic territories. At the same time, Rollic will continue to release a high volume of mobile titles as it has done previously. Turning to eSports, the NBA 2K League Championships tip off will take place in Indianapolis at the Pavilion at Pan Am, with 3v3 play August 17th through the 20th, and 5v5 play August 24th through the 27th . We remain excited about the continued success and growth of the NBA 2K League. In closing, we believe that our Company today is the strongest and most diverse it has ever been. With approximately 11,000 of the industrya\u0302\u0080\u0099s best and brightest talent, the most exciting and commercially successful portfolio of owned intellectual property, and the ability to deliver deeply captivating and engaging entertainment experiences on any platform anywhere in the world, we believe that we are well-positioned to deliver long-term value for our shareholders. Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099ll now turn the call over to Lainie So in terms of chartboost, chartboost does actually deals third parties today. We certainly haven't announced any changes. But that is one area that we're very excited about. Look, the bigger the business is, the more valuable the platform is going to be. It's going to be certainly valuable from a tech perspective internally. But we think it's a great product and whether or not it's got great growth prospects to the third-party market remains to be seen, but that's certainly something that we're -- that is under consideration. And on the revenue side, there are -- obviously, there are some things that happen in the short term that Lainie and Strauss have always spoken about that can affect what our expectations are, where they are today in the short run versus where they were in January. But overall, our mid- to long-term prospects, growth prospects for the business have not changed. We're still very excited about the prospects. Yes. I mean it really is simply that the game is -- to the extent that we're moving games -- shifting later, which is when we have pipeline shifts, that's typically the case. We typically don't move games up. But that is really based on where the game is in development. We would not hold a game that's ready to release based on any overall economic trend or something going on in the market. Potentially, we would maybe move a game a week or 2, depending on -- for marketing windows. But generally speaking, when the game is ready, that's when we release it. So in terms of development cycles, I think development cycles are ever changing. And obviously, it varies game by game. The games are getting bigger. They're getting more complicated. There's new technology out there that we can avail ourselves to. So -- and all of that's a learning process. And that learning curve is often very steep. And -- but I would say there's nothing specific about the changing development cycles that we haven't seen before. It's just that the games are bigger and theya\u0302\u0080\u0099re more complicated and there's more to do. And that's actually what makes our business so exciting. So in terms of the advertising business, yes, the overall advertising market, generally speaking, has experienced year-over-year declines due to ad tech consolidation and the lower spend on digital advertising. Our advertising revenues have -- the growth has decelerated from the last quarter, but they grew notably versus last year. And we believe we outperformed the industry trends. We expect this trend to improve over the course of the year with natural seasonality and optimizations we're making in our network mix and pricing. So what was the second question? Yes, in terms of Star Wars: Hunters release, it really is just a matter of making sure that the game is delivered at the highest possible quality, and we have not changed anything around platforms. Yes. I think -- I don't know that there's anything specifically in the market that would change our philosophy on how we package our product. I think we always are trying new models and new pricing practices to try to optimize the situation. But I don't really see a market-driven specific opportunity arising. But you'll see us experimenting all the time. There'll be some mix -- changes in mix, but we haven't really talked about it at this point."

            "name": "Lainie Goldstein",
            "content": "Thanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll discuss the key highlights from our first quarter before reviewing our financial outlook for the fiscal year 2023 and second quarter. Please note that our first quarter results include Zynga's financial performance for 39 days of the quarter, which impacts the comparability of our results relative to last year, as well as to our prior guidance, which did not include the contribution from Zynga. Also, any references to Take-Twoa\u0302\u0080\u0099s pre-combination results are referring to our financial performance excluding the acquired Zynga business. Additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release. As Strauss mentioned, this was a momentous quarter for our organization as we closed our transaction with Zynga and made significant progress on our integration efforts. Our teams created detailed plans to realize at least $100 million of annual cost synergies and we continue to expect approximately $50 million to be achieved within the first twelve months post-close. The largest opportunities include reducing duplicative corporate overhead and contracts, consolidating systems, rationalizing our real estate footprint, and leveraging Zynga's marketing functions across our other mobile titles. We are also exploring additional areas of efficiencies. At the same time, we delivered strong first quarter results, driven by Net Bookings of $1 billion. On a pre-combination basis, our Net Bookings were $731 million, which grew 3% compared to last year and was within our guidance range of $700 million to $750 million. The movement in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted our Net Bookings by approximately 1%. We were also pleased with Zyngaa\u0302\u0080\u0099s contribution for part of the quarter. With consumers today navigating various macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, we believe that our financial performance truly demonstrates the resiliency of our business model, driven by the incredible quality of our games and the significant value that our interactive entertainment experiences provide our players. During the period, recurrent consumer spending rose 48% and accounted for 73% of Net Bookings. This was significantly above our prior guidance due to the inclusion of Zynga for part of the quarter, as well as the outperformance of our pre-combination portfolio, led by NBA 2K22, Tiny Tinaa\u0302\u0080\u0099s Wonderlands, and Top Eleven. Digitally-delivered Net Bookings increased 41% and accounted for 95% of the total. During the quarter, 77% of console game sales were delivered digitally, up from 73% last year. GAAP net revenue increased 36% to $1.1 billion and cost of revenue increased 32% to $436 million, which included a $20 million impairment charge related to our decision not to proceed with further development of a title from an unannounced new franchise. Operating expenses increased by 125% to $704 million, primarily driven by the addition of Zynga and a full quarter of Nordeus, business acquisition costs and higher personnel and marketing expenses. And our GAAP net loss was $104 million, or $0.76 per share, which was largely impacted by $117 million of amortization of acquired intangibles and $165 million of business acquisition costs. Our GAAP net loss benefited from a reversal of expense of approximately $48 million related to forfeitures of previously granted stock awards. In the first quarter last year, our GAAP net income was $152 million, or $1.30. Our management tax rate for the period was 18% as compared to 16% in the prior year as a result of our combination with Zynga. On a pre-combination basis, our management results excluding the impacts of the Zynga transaction exceeded the high end of our guidance range by $0.06, despite the impairment charge taken during the quarter and the higher tax rate. We ended the quarter with over $1.3 billion of cash and short-term Investments and $3.3 billion of debt. Turning to our guidance, Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099ll begin with our full fiscal year expectations. a\u0302\u0080\u00a2 As Strauss mentioned, we are initiating new guidance that includes our combination with Zynga for approximately 10 months of our fiscal year. We now expect to deliver Net Bookings of $5.8 billion to $5.9 billion. Our assumptions take into consideration some shifts in our pipeline for the year, as well as movement in foreign exchange rates and the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. The largest contributors to Net Bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Empires & Puzzles, Rollica\u0302\u0080\u0099s hypercasual mobile portfolio, Toon Blast, and Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online. We expect the Net Bookings breakdown from our labels to be 45% Zynga, which includes our former T2 mobile titles, 37% 2K, 17% Rockstar Games, and 1% Private Division. We forecast our geographic Net Bookings split to be about 60% United States and 40% International. We now expect recurrent consumer spending to grow by approximately 110% and represent 77% of total Net Bookings. Our digitally-delivered Net Bookings are expected to grow by approximately 80% and represent 96% of Net Bookings. Our forecast assumes that 74% of console game sales will be delivered-digitally, up from 68% last year. We expect to generate more than $700 million in Non-GAAP Adjusted Unrestricted Operating Cash Flow and we expect to deploy approximately $135 million for capital expenditures. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $5.73 billion to $5.83 billion and cost of revenue to range from $2.74 billion to $2.79 billion, which includes approximately $700 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Total operating expenses are expected to range from $3.37 billion to $3.38 billion as compared to $1.5 billion last year. This increase reflects the inclusion of Zynga; business acquisition costs; and higher personnel, marketing, and IT expenses, which is slightly offset by our anticipated cost synergies for the year. And, we expect a GAAP net loss ranging from $398 million to $438 million, or $2.50 to $2.75 per share, which assumes a basic share count of 159.2 million shares. We expect our management tax rate to be 18% throughout the year. Now, moving to our guidance for the fiscal second quarter: We project net bookings to range from $1.5 billion to $1.55 billion, compared to $985 million in the second quarter last year. The largest contributors to net Bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Empires and Puzzles, Rollica\u0302\u0080\u0099s hypercasual mobile portfolio, and Toon Blast. We project recurrent consumer spending to grow approximately 85% and digitally-delivered Net Bookings to increase approximately 70%. Our forecast assumes that 73% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 65% last year. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $1.37 billion to $1.42 billion and cost of revenue to range from $700 million to $719 million, which includes approximately $200 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Operating expenses are expected to range from $849 million to $859 million. At the midpoint, this represents a 125% increase over last year. This increase reflects the inclusion of Zynga and business acquisition costs, as well as higher marketing and personnel expenses, which we believe will be slightly offset by the realization of some of our anticipated cost synergies. And, GAAP net loss is expected to range from $144 million to $160 million, or $0.86 to $0.96 per share, which assumes a basic share count of 166.4 million shares. In closing, we had a great start to the year and we believe that our combination with Zynga will enhance our positioning as one of the top interactive entertainment companies in the world. As our teams continue to leverage the core competencies from Zyngaa\u0302\u0080\u0099s publishing platform, we believe that we will be able to engage our player base more deeply, add new dimensions to our existing portfolio, and deliver significant long-term growth and margin expansion for our shareholders. Thank you. Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099ll now turn the call back to Strauss. So for the difference in the pre-combination business, we had some shifts in the pipeline for the year. And then there was a movement in the foreign exchange rates. And then there's also the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. So I would say that the shifts in our pipeline were the most meaningful to our numbers. So I would say we had some titles that moved within the year. And that was Marvel Midnight Suna\u0302\u0080\u0099s and then there was an unannounced title that moved out of the year as well. So I would say definitely the pipeline changes that were the most -- to the change in the guidance. In terms of the RCS for the pre-combination, we're not really breaking that out anymore. We're really looking at the business overall as one business. But I can tell you that we did outperform NBA 2K 22, Tiny Tina's Wonderland and top 11 versus our guidance for the quarter. So those 3 titles did better than we had expected. Sure. There were some movements in their pipeline. There was some changes in the FX rate. The Russia sales were removed from their financials. And then also, there was some overall ad market that the ad market has experienced some pressure. So those are most of the changes that we saw in our numbers over the last few months. We're going to manage their business as one combined entity. So therefore, we're not going to break out the Zynga piece for the quarter. So it's not been our practice to break out our results for the -- with our prior acquisitions. So we're not going to do that here as well. In terms of the changes in the -- in our guidance, it's -- when we're looking at our OpEx, there's an increase in terms of our expenses from Zynga, but then also in terms of against our guidance. We have some lower marketing and some lower headcount expenses due to less new hires due to timing. So that's the big changes between our operating expenses between this guidance and last guidance. In terms of debt reduction, we have a strong cash flow. The business will be generating a lot of cash this year. We look at paying down as much debt it makes sense to at the end of the year. But at the same time, we look at acquisition opportunities as well. So if there's something that makes sense for us to buy during the year, we would also look to do that. So I'd love to see what it looks like at the end of the year based on what the needs are during the rest of the year."

            "name": "Strauss Zelnick",
            "content": "Thanks, Nicole. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that Fiscal 2023 is off to a great start, highlighted by first quarter Net Bookings of $1 billion. Our performance demonstrates the quality of our games and our ability to engage audiences across the globe, despite the impacts of various macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. This has been a milestone period in the history of our Company, as we closed our combination with Zynga. This transaction firmly establishes Take-Twoa\u0302\u0080\u0099s position as one of the largest pure-play interactive entertainment companies in the world. We are home to the industry's top creative talent and we own and control an exceptional, diverse portfolio of intellectual properties encompassing all key platforms and genres. We are exceedingly optimistic about the long-term growth potential for the mobile industry, as well as our ability to create greater shareholder value as a combined entity. Over the past few months, we have made significant progress in our integration efforts. Zynga, which is being run by the labela\u0302\u0080\u0099s President, Frank Gibeau, established its ongoing leadership structure. Alongside Frank, we are fortunate to have numerous, proven senior executives who will be instrumental in overseeing Zyngaa\u0302\u0080\u0099s day-to-day operations and taking our combined mobile business to the next level of success. The integration of our corporate functions and systems has been tracking well, and we are pleased that our Day 1 plans were executed seamlessly, with no disruptions to our business operations or player communities. While ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s still early, we are confident that we can realize $100 million of annual cost synergies within two years post-close and we are exploring additional areas of efficiencies. Our creative teams are in active discussions about potential projects, and we remain committed to delivering over $500 million of annual Net Bookings opportunities over time. There are several meaningful drivers in mobile that we believe our teams can begin to activate this fiscal year, including implementing new bold beats, driven by new content and other live-service enhancements; user acquisition optimization; creating a centralized library for development technologies and tools; enhancing the monetization of in-game advertising; and continuing to invest in our ad tech platform with Chartboost. Over the intermediate and long-term, our vision is to introduce mobile games for some of our most popular and proven intellectual properties that have the potential to be greatly additive to our financial profile. We have observed positive signs that some mobile players are looking for more sophisticated and immersive content, and we look forward to participating in this trend that should continue for the foreseeable future. We also see a tremendous opportunity to establish a more meaningful presence in key mobile-first emerging markets. a\u0302\u0080\u00a2 Turning to our first quarter results, on a pre-combination basis, our Net Bookings of $731 million were within our previously stated outlook range, led by the outperformance of NBA 2K22 and WWE 2K22. Zynga's offerings complemented our results significantly for the period. NBA 2K22 continued to dominate as the industry's leading basketball game, with sell-in of over 12 million units to date, exceeding the seriesa\u0302\u0080\u0099 sell-in from the prior year. During the first quarter, engagement with the title remained strong, with average games played per user increasing 16% year-over-year. In addition, NBA 2K22 Arcade Edition remains the #1 game on Apple Arcade since its launch in October 2021, and downloads of NBA 2K Mobile remained robust, driven by the Courtside Pass updates and content surrounding the NBA Playoffs and Finals. Our partnership with the NBA remains incredibly strong and we look forward to the launch of NBA 2K23 in September. Throughout the first quarter, 2K and Visual Concepts released a series of DLC packs to support WWE 2K22, which brought even more fan-favorite superstars into the ring for what has been hailed by critics and consumers alike as our best WWE offering in the series. Engagement with the title has been outstanding, with more than 330 million in-game matches played and over 8.5 million hours of WWE 2K22 content viewed on Twitch. We greatly value our partnership with the WWE and are thrilled about the long-term opportunity to grow the franchise further together. Rockstar Games capitalized on the momentum from last quartera\u0302\u0080\u0099s releases of Grand Theft Auto V for PlayStation 5 and Xbox series X/S, Grand Theft Auto Online standalone, and the launch of GTA+, as the experience continues to captivate players. Latest generation console players of Grand Theft Auto Online grew over 40% this quarter and are monetizing at a rate 36% higher than players on the previous generation. GTA+, the premium membership available exclusively on those consoles, has seen consistent growth since launch. The GTA Online community remains strong, and its audience size is operating at a new normal that is 49% higher than the pre-pandemic first quarter of fiscal 2020. Sales of Grand Theft Auto V also remained strong, and to date, the title has sold-in nearly 170 million units. With development of the next entry in the Grand Theft Auto series well underway, the Rockstar Games team is determined to once again set creative benchmarks for the series, our industry, and for all entertainment, just as the label has done with every one of their frontline releases. We were pleased with the performance of Red Dead Redemption 2, which continues to expand its audience and, to date, has sold-in more than 45 million units worldwide. Tiny Tinaa\u0302\u0080\u0099s Wonderlands exceeded our expectations and continued to sustain healthy player engagement, due in part to its robust post-launch content, which will continue throughout the Fiscal Year. The title has resonated with core fans and new audiences, with nearly 40% of players having never before played a Borderlands title. Additionally, Tiny Tinaa\u0302\u0080\u0099s Wonderlands launched on Steam in June alongside its previously released DLC offerings. Also in June, 2K and Supermassive Games launched The Quarry, an all-new horror narrative game, where every choice, big or small, shapes your story and determines who lives to tell the tale. The title launched to strong reviews, with NPR declaring it a\u0302\u0080\u009cthis summera\u0302\u0080\u0099s best horror game,a\u0302\u0080\u009d and Variety calling it a\u0302\u0080\u009cevery horror fana\u0302\u0080\u0099s dream video game.a\u0302\u0080\u009d And, Private Division released Void Riders, the first expansion for their critically acclaimed skateboarding action title, OlliOlli World, from Roll 7. The expansion earned an 87 on OpenCritic, which was even higher than the base gamea\u0302\u0080\u0099s excellent review scores. Private Division will share more details regarding the gamea\u0302\u0080\u0099s second expansion later this year. Recurrent consumer spending rose 48% and accounted for 73% of Net Bookings. This was significantly above our prior guidance due to the inclusion of Zynga for part of the quarter, which was not included previously, as well as outperformance from our core portfolio. During the period, Zynga continued to experience strength in player engagement and retention, and we believe that we are maintaining our healthy market share on a global basis. Additionally, we delivered significant growth in advertising Net Bookings, which was offset by some pressure on in-app purchases due to current macroeconomic conditions and seasonality. Some key highlights of our mobile offerings during the quarter include: Harry Potter: Puzzles & Spells featured an in-game event to celebrate the cinematic release of \"Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore.\" Empires & Puzzles introduced the game's fifth season, Dynasty of Dunes. Zynga Poker released the Omaha update, giving players a new way to enjoy the popular game. Words With Friends introduced Clubs, a new feature that expands the game's social experience by offering shared spaces that players can enjoy together. Rollic launched 11 games in the quarter and Colors Runners! reached the #1 top free downloaded games position in the U.S. App Store in June. Turning to our outlook, we now expect to deliver Net Bookings of $5.8 billion to $5.9 billion, which includes Zynga for part of the year. Our pipeline for the year continues to look very strong, and we are excited to expand significantly our mobile presence with a best-in-class platform. Our new forecast also takes into account some movement in our release slate for the year, foreign currency pressures, and macroeconomic uncertainty. Lainie will provide more details shortly. Looking ahead, our long-term vision is clearer than ever, and we believe that our combination with Zynga will enable us to capitalize better on the evolving dynamics of the interactive entertainment industry. As we deliver our expansive, diverse pipeline and pursue the vast opportunities that we have identified through our combination with Zynga, we see a path to engage even greater audiences around the world, grow our scale, and enhance our margins. I will now turn the call over to Karl. Thanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for delivering an excellent start to the year. And to our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued support. We'll now take your questions. Operator? Thanks, Eric. There's a lot there. We are seeing some softness in the mobile market. The good news is, I think we're doing better than most, if not all. And I think we're seeing an offsetting increase in our market share. I think the reason we're seeing probably a bit more softness in mobile than in console is in console to participate you have to buy. And in mobile, by definition, you're in a free-to-play environment. You can play without paying if you are feeling the pinch of inflation, specifically with regard to nondiscretionary expenditures like fuel and food, you could imagine that if you're playing the game, you might choose to spend a bit less or spend a bit less frequently. That said, we think Zyngaa\u0302\u0080\u0099s highly diverse portfolio of terrific games is a meaningful offset. And as I said, I think we're outperforming the market. That's our belief. We're also seeing growth in advertising revenues. And because I think we under-index in advertising, that's an opportunity that will be offsetting to the broader market even if we see ongoing softness. But as you know, we always call it the way we see it. And what we're seeing is overall some softness in the marketplace. When you have 50% of big bank economists saying we think we might be in a recession in the next quarter or 2, my attitude is the market believes we're in a recession right now. And as a consumer-facing company, we are seeing some softness. With regard to the integration, I'm not sure you asked about how it's going, but it's going really well. And we expect to meet or exceed our cost synergy expectations, both in terms of magnitude and timing. And more importantly, we fit really well together culturally. And I think all of us at Zynga and now all of us at Take-Two are very excited about the combination of the way things are going and how well the teams do fit together. And we had a sense of that during the diligence period, but it's always nice to know post closing that that's the case. And I think you alluded to whether we can sort of create one broader integrated platform. As you know, Take-Two Mobile Games has been folded into the Zynga division, which is operated by Frank Gibeau and his team, highly independently. And one of their key priorities is to create an integrated platform that will bring the best out in all of our games. So enhance our acquisition and enhance our conversion, enhance our retention, enhance our lifetime value and also enhance, as I said, our advertising revenue. Zynga has a proprietary ad tech platform driven by their Chartboost division. And we're excited about what that can bring to Zynga and also bring to all of Take-Two. And in terms of the pipeline, yes, as Lainie mentioned, we did have a number of titles that have effect that has been shifting around that affected our pipeline and some of our results for fiscal '23. Generally speaking, we obviously don't take these shifts lightly. We have seen them before. The most important thing for us is always to put up the best game we possibly can because that's what builds franchise value and ultimately, that's what drives the success of our organization. So it's worth the wait. Typically, that is the best economic decision that we can make. And I would say that I'd characterize the pipeline shifts as well these things do move around and you may have -- that may affect a specific year. It does -- hasn't really changed at all our overall perspective on the growth in the intermediate and long term. Look, I think to the extent that Zynga succeeds in building a robust ad tech platform, then it will affect all of our live services businesses, not just Zynga's live services businesses. And we're really optimistic about that. To be clear, we haven't baked any of that into our cost synergy expectations. And as you know, we've not included our revenue synergy expectations in our forward-looking projections. So that's all upside if we're able to achieve that. But I feel very good about the exercise. And yes, we'll cross over to the entire company's live services offerings. In terms of the timing for new projects, very hard to call that now. There's a lot of excitement internally. We're working on a lot of interesting potential ideas. And certainly, the development for mobile is much quicker than it is for console. -- but it would be premature to state in a particular time. And of course, all product announcements do come from our labels. Yes, it is indeed . And with regard to a change in ad formats with Google, I don't have a point of view yet about how that may or may not affect us. I would say we're not concerned at the moment. I think the good news is that we have a very robust team now. We have 11,000 colleagues around the world. And we have the ability to pursue a very ambitious program of development and publishing. And at the same time, we're a growth business, and we expect to continue to grow. So we don't have expectations that we will significantly increase our headcount anytime soon. At the same time, assuming we grow in the way we expect to, and we have an expectation to grow very significantly in the next 3 years, I assume we will increase our development headcount somewhat. So on your first point, I've been asked about the potential impact of the recession on our business since I started with these conference calls some 15 years ago. And over and over again, I said I don't believe the entertainment business is recession proof or even necessarily recession resistant. And I think we're seeing now the decline in consumer spending and increase in inflation will have an impact on the industry. You've seen it from our report today and from our competitors' reports as well. I think conceptually, the impact is probably greater on free-to-play for the reasons that I said earlier in the call, that you can play those titles without spending money. And you may just decide to spend less frequently or less in aggregate. With regard to the console experience, you have to buy the game to play. And so I think if you want the title, you're going to buy it. And as you point out, it's a very good value for consumers. And on your second point, no, we haven't seen any impact on our ongoing sales or engagement with PGA Tour based on, as you put it, the noise around this new offering. Look, the change in IDFA is the new reality. And we've been operating within that new reality for some time. I do think that our massive consumer database gives us a benefit in that we have all kinds of in-house proprietary information that will help us with our marketing. I do think that the ad tech platform that Zynga has and is building further, including Chartboost, will help us, as I said earlier, do even better. I don't -- I'm really not concerned about this post-IDFA world. And in terms of the macro trends, no, the world tends to kind of move in lockstep on an economic basis. So we don't see any particular geographic changes that meaningfully influence our company. I think you nailed it. It's hard to call what's going on because it would normally be early 3 years in, but it has been because of the incredible supply constraints. What we have seen though is when people are buying new consoles, they're highly engaged. So the users, for example, of GTA 5 who are on NuGen are much more engaged than prior gen users. Now that may simply be because they have new machines, and they're excited about them. But it may also be, and it wouldn't surprise me if this were the case, that because the new consoles offer a better experience, it's a more engaging experience. And that historically has been the case, that our business has grown coincident with the growth and exploitation of increasingly robust technology. And I would expect that to continue for some time to come. So thanks, Mike, for your comments and your question. With regard to the creation of new mobile titles based on legacy Take-Two IP, it remains to be seen what those expressions will look like. It will be driven by the passion and the talent of the teams. And to your question regarding whether Zynga has the ability to do that development in-house, I think the answer is unquestionably they do. Zynga has many number of talented studios all around the world. That distinguishes Zynga from virtually all other mobile developers and publishers. And it's one of the things that we found most exciting about the company now the label. In terms of the next generation of gamers, I mean the evidence is that they play more. They're more engaged and they play more. And that makes sense because what was new technology 15 years ago, to them, is just part of the landscape. They've grown up and it's like fish in water. People -- kids start playing with smartphones as early as they can play with blocks. So I have to believe that interactive entertainment will continue to grow disproportionately to the rest of the audiovisual entertainment businesses. There's ongoing evidence that is and will remain the fastest-growing segment within the entertainment industry. And I think this next generation will just put a finer and finer point on that. In terms of what we have to give them to engage them, that, that is still the same, which is the highest quality entertainment experience that is available on the face of the earth, and that's our job, that's our mission and that's what drives us all every day. Thank you. The Rockstar Games has been supplying ongoing content updates for Grand Theft Auto Online since its release in 2013. The most recent one was well received and they continue to put out terrific content. Any announcements about upcoming properties do come from the labels. So we don't tend to talk about them here. And a great question about advertising cost. I think it's a fair one, which is if you're seeing softness in the market, does that mean you can market your titles more cheaply going forward? And the answer is we might see some minor adjustment in the cost profile. But at the end of the day, we spend a lot to support our console -- big console launches. And I don't think that softness in the ad market would probably have a material impact on that. We'd just like to thank you all for joining us. We're really proud of how the company is performing. Our combination with Zynga is off to a terrific start culturally, financially, strategically and creatively. And I want to reiterate my appreciation to our colleagues all around the world. We'll be talking to all of them tomorrow in our various town hall meetings. These results are thanks to their hard, dedicated and creative work. Thank you all."

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Nicole Shevins, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Thank you. You may begin.\nNicole Shevins: Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss our results for the Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2024 ended March 31, 2024.

Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we concluded fiscal 2024 with strength, including net bookings of $1.35 billion, which exceeded the high end of our guidance range. Contributing to our positive results was the outperformance of NBA 2K24, Zynga's in-app purchases, led by Toon Blast and our newest hit, Match Factory, and the Red Dead Redemption and Grand Theft Auto series. During Fiscal 2024, we generated net bookings of $5.33 billion, driven by our high quality titles and our ability to engage consistently our player communities. With fiscal 2025 underway, our portfolio is gaining momentum and we have many exciting releases planned for the year. We expect net bookings to be in the range of $5.55 billion to $5.65 billion, representing 5% year-over-year growth. Our outlook reflects a narrowing of Rockstar Games' previously established window of Calendar 2025 to fall of Calendar 2025 for Grand Theft Auto VI. We're highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience and our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase. As we release our groundbreaking pipeline, we expect to achieve tremendous growth, including sequential increases in net bookings in fiscal 2025, 2026, and 2027. We've been executing our substantial cost reduction program, which we now anticipate will result in over $165 million of annual cost savings from our current and future expenses. This will enable us to run our business more efficiently and achieve greater operating leverage as our large-scale titles come to market. Now turning to our performance during the quarter. NBA 2K24, which remains the number one basketball simulation experience in our industry, surpassed our expectations as players responded to our promotions, in-game content strategy, and updates within seasons. To-date, the title has sold in over 9 million units. Engagement remains high with nearly 2 million consumers playing daily. Our industry-leading NBA 2K brand also continues to expand its audience through several innovative mobile experiences including NBA 2K24 MyTEAM, the new free-to-download mobile experience that allows players to sync progress between console and mobile devices, as they play their favorite MyTEAM modes on the go, NBA 2K Mobile and NBA 2K24 Arcade Edition, which is consistently in the top five on Apple Arcade. The Grand Theft Auto series delivered another fantastic quarter, partially driven by an array of free content updates for Grand Theft Auto Online, including new vehicles, drag races, holiday themed items to celebrate Lunar New Year and Valentine's Day, new community series jobs, and more. Unit sales for Grand Theft Auto V exceeded our forecast, and to-date the title is sold in approximately 200 million units worldwide. We're thrilled that more than a decade after their initial releases, Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online grew their audience size by an incredible 35% and 23% respectively for the full year. Grand Theft Auto V also reclaimed its top spot as the most watched video game across all platforms according to StreamHatchet, thanks largely to the tremendous viewership from the series' thriving role-play community. Rockstar\u2019s premium subscription service, GTA+, also continues to grow, with membership for the quarter almost doubling over the same period in the prior year as Rockstar continues to add valuable benefits to players. Red Dead Redemption 2 also surpassed our expectations and has sold-in nearly 64 million units worldwide. We continue to expand the audience for the series, with Red Dead Redemption and Undead Nightmare, recently added to the roster of games included within the GTA+ library. Borderlands 3 outpaced our forecasts and we are thrilled that Randy Pitchford and Gearbox Entertainment are slated to join officially 2K\u2019s renowned internal studios in the coming weeks. We have already identified many potential growth opportunities for the Borderlands series and Gearbox\u2019s catalog, which we plan to pursue once the studio is integrated into our organization. We are also excited to see growing buzz for the star-studded Borderlands feature film which is planned for release by Lionsgate this summer. WWE 2K24 has been a resounding success and is the highest rated sports simulation of 2024. The title is also the highest-rated installment in the history of our popular wrestling franchise on Xbox, with an 83 average Metacritic score. Engagement has been exceptional with players logging over 11 million hours across more than 110 million played matches. In addition, the [40 years] (ph) of WrestleMania Pack has the highest attach rate for a Super Deluxe DLC in the series\u2019 history, with more than 25% of WWE 2K24 players owning it. 2K and Visual Concepts are continuing to support the title and will have additional packs launching throughout the Fall. I\u2019d like to thank our friends, Nick Kahn and Ari Emanuel over at WWE, TKO, and WME for their continued support. Additionally, I\u2019d like to express our immense gratitude to our team at Visual Concepts for their outstanding work on our WWE 2K and NBA 2K franchises, which are both important annual contributors for our Company. Zynga delivered outstanding results for the period, led by robust in-app purchases. Match Factory is accelerating and proving to be a hit, already establishing itself as a Top 20 grossing game in the US Apple App Store and reaching millions of new users with its launch on the Google Play store. We are pleased that new bold beats and other exciting features have propelled average daily play time to around 60 minutes per user. Toon Blast maintained its positive momentum, achieving nearly 20% growth of in-app purchases compared to the third quarter, driven by a new Dragons\u2019 Treasure competition and many other features. We\u2019d like to congratulate the team at Peak for their incredible performance. Top Troops launched several content updates, as well as a major cross-media collaboration with the popular influencer, MrBeast. The team plans to release additional enhancements to core gameplay and progression systems to drive further growth. Momentum continues at Rollic, with the studio crossing 3.5 billion all-time downloads and announcing a new partnership with Mattel to introduce a mass-market Barbie mobile game later this calendar year. Our blended monetization efforts in hyper-casual are progressing well within Rollic, which has resulted in Twisted Tangle and Screw Jam both becoming Top-100 grossing games on the U.S. Apple App Store. Our direct-to-consumer business continues to grow, and our teams are working actively to add more titles each quarter to this highly accretive, owned distribution channel. Looking ahead, Zynga has numerous titles in development and soft launch that we are eager to release worldwide this fiscal year, including Star Wars Hunters and Game of Thrones: Legends. In closing, I am highly confident in our business, led by our top creative talent, our industry leading portfolio of owned intellectual property, our sound balance sheet and our increasingly efficient infrastructure. Our teams are laser-focused on our core tenets of creativity, innovation, and efficiency, and as we deliver our ground-breaking pipeline over the next several years, we are poised also to deliver industry-leading growth and shareholder returns. I will now turn the call over to Karl.\nKarl Slatoff: Thanks, Strauss. I\u2019d like to thank our teams for their dedication and hard work as we continue to build the foundation for our future which we believe is more promising than ever. We are extremely excited about our upcoming pipeline which includes approximately 40 titles through Fiscal 2027. Our updated release schedule reflects the actions of our recent cost-reduction program, through which we cancelled several titles to focus our efforts and resources on the franchises we believe represent our best opportunities to achieve significant critical and commercial success. These titles did not include any of our core franchises and were not expected to materially affect our net bookings growth. Turning to Fiscal 2025, we have 16 titles in our pipeline, three of which have already been released. We have seven immersive core titles, including TopSpin, NBA and WWE 2K25, and the next iteration in one of 2K\u2019s biggest and most beloved franchises, with the first details coming in just a few short weeks at Summer Games Fest Kickoff Live. Of these titles, TopSpin 2K25 was released by 2K and Hangar 13 on April 26. The revival of our popular tennis franchise has been well-received by critics and provides deep personalization, iconic venues, and industry-leading gameplay. With TopSpin 2K25, we continue to broaden our sports offerings, and 2K will support the title with season packs throughout the year. We have two independent titles from Private Division, the first of which is Moon Studio\u2019s No Rest for the Wicked, which launched on April 18th into Early Access on PC. This new ARPG was well received for its visceral combat, distinct art style and rich narrative. Private Division, along with W\u0113t\u0101 Workshop, also announced Tales of the Shire: A The Lord of the Rings Game, which is planned for release later this year. The teams recently revealed a new trailer for this cozy, hobbit life sim, which is set in the Middle-earth universe of J.R.R. Tolkien. We have five mobile titles, including NFL 2K Playmakers, Star Wars Hunters, and Game of Thrones Legends. NFL 2K Playmakers was released on April 23rd by 2K and Cat Daddy Games for iOS and Android devices. In this non-simulation tactical card battle players can collect NFL player cards to assemble an exciting roster, while also experiencing a variety of game modes and features. We\u2019re proud to add NFL 2K Playmakers to our ever-growing mobile portfolio in partnership with the NFL and the NFL Player\u2019s Association. Lastly, we have two new iterations of prior releases planned for the year. As always, our labels will continue to provide new content and experiences that drive engagement and recurrent consumer spending across many of our key offerings. Looking ahead, our pipeline for Fiscal 2026 and 2027 has 24 titles planned, including, l5 immersive core releases, six of which are sports simulation games, one independent title; five mobile games; and three new iterations of previously-released titles. In closing, we believe that the many opportunities ahead of us will deliver a period of meaningful long-term growth, margin expansion, and shareholder returns. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Lainie.\nLainie Goldstein: Thanks Karl and good afternoon everyone. We delivered a strong finish to Fiscal 2024 and are entering Fiscal 2025 with momentum, including healthy trends across our key franchises. Throughout the year, we released successful hit titles, engaged players with a steady cadence of in-game content, and continued to position our organization for the long-term. We also deepened our commitment to efficiency and made some decisions that, while difficult will align our resources with the initiatives for which we have the highest levels of conviction. We are confident that, over time these steps will drive our scale, enhance our margins, and deliver industry-leading returns for our shareholders. I\u2019d like to thank our teams for their vision, passion, and dedication. Turning to our results, we delivered fourth quarter net bookings of $1.35 billion, which was above our guidance range of $1.27 billion to $1.32 billion. This reflected better-than-expected results from NBA 2K24; Zynga\u2019s in-app purchases, led by Toon Blast and Match Factory; the Red Dead Redemption series and the Grand Theft Auto series. Recurrent consumer spending declined 2% for the period and accounted for 79% of net bookings. This was above our outlook, driven by the outperformance of NBA 2K, Toon Blast, and Match Factory. Recurrent consumer spending declined for Grand Theft Auto Online, although it was up for virtual currency and GTA+. NBA 2K was in-line with the prior year; and mobile increased slightly. During the quarter, we successfully launched WWE 2K24, which demonstrates 2K and Visual Concept\u2019s ability to raise the bar further for our popular wrestling series. GAAP net revenue decreased 3% to $1.4 billion, while cost of revenue declined 24% to $930 million and included an impairment charge of $304 million related to acquired intangible assets. Operating expenses increased by 244% to $3.2 billion, due to a goodwill impairment charge of $2.2 billion and $93 million of business reorganization expenses related to our recently announced cost-reduction program. On a management basis, operating expenses rose 20% year-over-year, which was slightly above our guidance, due to higher personnel and IT expenses, and professional fees. For fiscal 2024, we achieved net bookings of $5.33 billion, which was slightly above our revised guidance range of $5.25 billion to $5.3 billion. Recurrent consumer spending grew 2%, which exceeded our outlook, and accounted for 78% of net bookings. Recurrent consumer spending for mobile increased high single-digits; NBA 2K virtual currency and seasons was up slightly; and Grand Theft Auto Online virtual currency and GTA+ membership was flat. Non-GAAP Adjusted Unrestricted Operating Cash Flow was $42 million as compared to our outlook of approximately $100 million due to higher external developer advances, cash tax and interest payments. We spent approximately $142 million on capital expenditures, primarily for game technology and office build outs. GAAP net revenue was flat at $5.35 billion, and cost of revenue increased 1% to $3.1 billion, which included an impairment charge of $577 million related to acquired intangible assets. Operating expenses increased 69% to $5.8 billion, due to an impairment charge of $2.3 billion related to goodwill and a $105 million business reorganization charge related to our cost-reduction programs. On a management basis, operating expenses rose 15% year-over-year and were slightly above our guidance, due to the factors I mentioned earlier that affected the fourth quarter. Today, we provided our outlook for Fiscal 2025. We project net bookings to range from $5.55 billion to $5.65 billion, which represents 5% growth over Fiscal 2024. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, the Grand Theft Auto series, Toon Blast, Empires & Puzzles, our hyper-casual mobile portfolio, Match Factory, the Red Dead Redemption series, an unannounced immersive core title from 2K, and Words With Friends. We expect recurrent consumer spending to be up approximately 3% compared to fiscal 2024, and to represent 76% of net bookings. Our recurrent consumer spending forecast assumes high single-digit growth for mobile, a slight increase for NBA 2K, and a decline for Grand Theft Auto Online. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 50% Zynga, 31% 2K, 17% Rockstar Games, and 2% Other. And, we forecast our geographic net bookings split to be about 60% United States and 40% International. We expect Non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow to be an outflow of $200 million, and we plan to deploy approximately $140 million for capital expenditures, primarily for game technology and office buildouts. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $5.57 billion to $5.67 billion and cost of revenue to range from $2.43 billion to $2.46 billion. Turning to operating expenses, we recently implemented a cost reduction program that is expected to deliver over $165 million of annual cost savings across our entire business. As part of these efforts, we have eliminated several projects in development that we did not anticipate would meet our financial benchmarks. We also took actions to streamline our organizational structure, which reduced both existing headcount and future hiring needs. Our total operating expenses are expected to range from $3.56 billion to $3.58 billion as compared to $5.83 billion last year. On a management basis, we expect operating expense growth of approximately 7% year-over-year, which is largely due to an increase in ongoing marketing support for Match Factory, as well as other mobile and immersive core launches planned for the year, partially offset by savings from our cost reduction program. Looking ahead, and as Strauss mentioned earlier, we have narrowed the previously established release window for Grand Theft Auto VI to Fall of Calendar 2025 from Calendar 2025. As development advances, our confidence in the title and its potential commercial impact continue to grow. That said, we are not providing specific guidance beyond fiscal 2025, as our release schedule includes numerous titles each year and even modest shifts can have a significant effect on results in any given period. Our outlook for the lifetime value of our pipeline remains as strong as ever and we expect sequential growth in net bookings in Fiscal 2025, 2026, and 2027. Now, moving onto our guidance for the fiscal first quarter. We project net bookings to range from $1.2 billion to $1.25 billion, compared to $1.2 billion in the first quarter last year. Our release slate for the quarter includes TopSpin 2K25, No Rest for the Wicked on Early Access for PC and NFL 2K Playmakers, all of which have already released, and Star Wars Hunters. The largest contributors to Net Bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, the Grand Theft Auto series, Toon Blast, Empires & Puzzles, our hyper-casual mobile portfolio, Match Factory, the Red Dead Redemption series, Words With Friends, and Zynga Poker. We project recurrent consumer spending to increase by approximately 1%, which assumes mid single-digit growth in mobile, flat results for NBA 2K, and a decline for Grand Theft Auto Online. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $1.3 billion to $1.35 billion. Operating expenses are planned to range from $928 million to $938 million. On a management basis, operating expenses are expected to grow by approximately 14% year-over-year, which is primarily driven by additional marketing for Match Factory, partially offset by our cost reduction program. In closing, we believe that we are very well positioned to deliver the highest quality content in our industry and to enhance our profitability, as we grow our scale and maintain our focus on efficiency. We are extremely excited about our path for the future, and we look forward to sharing more details about the many catalysts ahead for our Company. Thank you. I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Strauss.\nStrauss Zelnick : Thanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for their dedication to our business and for creating the highest quality, most engaging entertainment franchises to captivate our global audiences. And to our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued support. We'll now take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Eric Handler with Roth MKM. Please proceed with your question.\nEric Handler: Good afternoon. Thanks for the question. Strauss, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the Gearbox acquisition. In the past, you've expressed that you never really felt the need to own all of gearbox here you are about to own all of Gearbox. Can you talk about how you think about now owning all of Gearbox and some of the opportunities that you have with that?\nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks, Eric. What I was referring to is when asked, when Gearbox was sold to Embracer whether that caused us to have any concern, my response was no because we have a long-term publishing agreement, and that's been mutually beneficial for our company and for Gearbox and as it was for Embracer. However, when the opportunity presented itself for us to acquire the company on terms that we felt were reasonable, we frankly jumped at the opportunity. We have all the respect in the world for Randy Pitchford and his team. He has the ability to bring AAA products to market, responsibly and on a very reliable and rather rapid cadence. And he is a hit maker. And it's very hard to make a new hit, and [Tiny Tino] (ph) was a new hit. And of course, Borderlands just goes from strength to strength. So we're thrilled to have Gearbox in the family.\nEric Handler: Okay. And then, Lainie, with regards to the annual cost savings that you announced, how much of that should be seen in fiscal '25?\nLainie Goldstein: So we'll start to see it in fiscal '25, but we'll see a full annualization of it in fiscal year '26. So the majority of the plan was executed in Q4 and Q1, but pieces of it will come through this year.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Doug Creutz with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nDoug Creutz: Hi, thank you. The ability of Rollic to launch top 100 grossing games is a really pleasant surprise. Just wondering if you could talk about how to think about the life cycle of those games. Typically, Rollic's games are sort of -- they're hot for a while and then they move on to something next, something else. Is this going to be the case for these monetizing games as well? Or is it a plan to have a longer life cycle. Thank you.\nStrauss Zelnick: Undoubtedly, this so-called hybrid casual approach should lead to longer life cycles because the hypercasual approach really was put it out there, get a bunch of downloads offer a rather light experience, generate advertising revenue, have the users move on to the next. And that was great while it lasted, but long-term entertainment businesses are all driven by great content. And Rollic's proving that it has the ability with its partner studios to do just that and to deliver content that is durable and long lasting. It remains to be seen whether we can truly create forever franchises at Rollic. I believe we can. We haven't done so yet, but we are off to a really good start.\nDoug Creutz: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nColin Sebastian: Thanks, good afternoon. Maybe a couple for me. I guess, first off on the change to the guidance and the outlook. What is your level of confidence, Strauss, in the calendar '25 launch of GTA VI. And is there anything else more specific you can talk about that's behind that postponement. And then secondly, on the high single-digit mobile growth. I'm curious how much of that is related to any recovery you're seeing broadly in mobile gaming? Or is that more specific to the increase in marketing spend and these titles that are outperforming your expectations for this year? Thank you.\nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks, Colin. We actually narrowed calendar 2025 to fall of 2025, and we feel really good about that release date. And obviously, we feel great about the title that is to come. And with regard to mobile, what we do at Zynga because we are a market leader, of course, is driven by the market in which we live. And it is gratifying that after a down year and then a slightly down year we're heading into a flatter up year for the industry. Obviously, though, what's driving our expected results would be our hits, including Match Factory!, which is performing really, really well. And we said that we were spending a lot on UA in the fourth quarter we did, and that's turned out to be productive spending.\nColin Sebastian: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Cost with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nMatthew Cost: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I guess between the success you've had with Match Factory! and some new launch titles setting release date for Star Wars Hunters and then the incremental marketing behind mobile. It seems like there is definitely more momentum in that business, which is great to see. I guess when we think about your analytical framework for investing in the marketing behind mobile, what are you targeting from a margin or payback perspective? And when should we expect to see this investment turn into a profitable flow-through from the mobile side?\nStrauss Zelnick: So I hope like everyone else, we look at the very same metrics, which is cost of acquisition, what kind of retention you expect which is to say what kind of churn you get. The spending that you have on average and therefore the lifetime value. And the longer payback period you're willing to accept, of course the more risk you take in those calculations because they're all based on extrapolating from current data and past data and they change at any given time. So I'm not prepared to share sort of our outside payback period. Suffice to say, though that we want to have a great deal of confidence that we're looking at a positive LTV.\nMatthew Cost: Great. Thank you. And when would you expect to see mobile this investment that you\u2019re making in mobile flip from a cost center due to driving incremental profit?\nStrauss Zelnick: So of course, our mobile division is profitable. I understand what you're asking which is frankly, just another way of asking the same question you asked before, which I decline to answer. However, I do give you extra credit points for rephrasing it in a way that I might dive into it. However -- so we don't share our exact payback periods. We do however tailor our user acquisition spending so that we expect a meaningfully positive LTV in a period of time such that we have confidence that even if we're wrong, we're not so wrong that we're not making money. I hope that clarifies it a bit.\nMatthew Cost: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nDrew Crum: Thanks. Hi guys, good afternoon. So could you address your forecast for NBA 2K RCS in fiscal '25 for a slight increase, is low single digits growth the new normal for this going forward? Or is there something unique in fiscal '25 that's influencing that view? Thanks.\nKarl Slatoff: So we absolutely expect growth in NBA. And that's not just on the RCS side but also on the full game sales side as well. This year is a little bit more challenging because we are still in the transition from Gen 8 to Gen 9. And Gen 9 is outperforming our expectations and doing fantastically well. I'd say we're a little bit more challenged on the Gen 8 side. As we continue to transition, I think we are going to see more tailwinds than headwinds in that regard. And when you look at the recurring consumer spending, specifically when you look at it specifically as it relates to Gen 9, it's off the chart. It is fantastic. So we\u2019ve seen significant growth there. So again, I think we will have momentum just as we transition to Gen 9 and as people continue to engage more deeply in the game, we\u2019re going to continue to see very strong RCS growth.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Benjamin Soff with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nBenjamin Soff: Hi guys. Thanks for the question. I was wondering if you guys could talk a little bit more about the change in bookings this year versus what you guys were talking about last quarter, how much comes from moving GTA versus any other shifts versus the restructuring? And then, yes, I guess I'll stop there. Thanks.\nLainie Goldstein: So for fiscal year '25, the outlook reflects a narrowing of Rockstar Games previously established window from the calendar 2025 to fall, as we mentioned, also some other movements within the release schedule and also with our cost-cutting plan that is also part of the overall results for that year.\nBenjamin Soff: Got it. And then a housekeeping question. Does your current outlook reflects the acquisition of Gearbox, or is that going to be updated next quarter after it's closed?\nLainie Goldstein: No, it is not included since the transaction hasn't closed yet. So we will expect to include it next quarter when we close, and we expect it to be slightly accretive to our management results.\nBenjamin Soff: Okay. That\u2019s helpful, thanks guys.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Martin Yang with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nMartin Yang: Hi, thank you for taking my question. First question on statistics. With a narrow window of release, is there any associated changes to your plan regarding the live service portion of GTA 6.\nStrauss Zelnick: So Rockstar hasn't given any details on what its expectations are for the release. It's been a wonderful trailer that they put out that broke the Internet, and more news will come from Rockstar in the fullness of time.\nMartin Yang: Thank you. I have a second question on NBA. How is NBA's transition challenges in between console generations compared to other annually releasing titles on the market, either from 2K or from other external competitors? And do you attribute the challenges to mostly to 2K or to market?\nKarl Slatoff: I'm sorry, was your question about the transition from console generation from the last transition to this transition?\nMartin Yang: Right.\nKarl Slatoff: Okay. So that's going back quite some time. And frankly, I don't have the exact figures in front of me. But generally speaking, I would say that the delta between the games in this year, the Gen 8 game is much broader. And I think that creates a more obvious difference between the two-- to do two games. And frankly, I can't remember if we had two completely separate games back then. But in any case, the Delta is quite significant this time around. So I would expect that the transition is more the effect of the transition is more pronounced in this console generation. And I forget your second question. Was there another one?\nMartin Yang: On this [indiscernible] how does it compare to other studios with annual recurring --.\nKarl Slatoff: Yes. We're not really commenting on our competitors. And most of our other studios, we don't have as much NBA comes out every year. So you're going to see that transition more rightly. We don't have the same effect in most of our other games. Occasionally, we would, but they wouldn't be comparable games to NBA anyway. And again, like I said we don't really comment about the -- our competitors and their experiences.\nMartin Yang: Got it. Thanks Karl.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Hickey with Benchmark. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Hickey: Hi Strauss, Karl, Lainie and Nicole. Congrats on the quarter. Strauss, in your prepared comments, you mentioned that your expectations for the commercial impact from GTA 6 and increased. I'm just curious if you could explain what's driving that up to enthusiasm for the game. And then the second question on your guidance, curious why you're not providing medium-term. You've done that before, and it feels like here you have at least better visibility on the primary catalysts driving that growth. And then on [2027] (ph) tying into that question, I'm wondering where your confidence is that you can grow sequentially [2026] (ph). Is that sort of primarily the GTA ecosystem driving that growth in '27, or is it a combination of that and other AAA games that you plan to release. Thanks guys.\nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks, Mike, for those questions. I think our confidence continues to increase just because Grand Theft Auto V continues to perform so well. We've now sold in over 200 million units. And every quarter, we continue to be pleased by the ongoing sales of the full game and engagement in the past fiscal year with Grand Theft Auto V was up about 35% with Grand Theft Auto Online was up about 23%, I believe. That's extraordinary growth at this stage again more than 10 years after the initial release. So I think we feel as though the market's anticipation is at a fever pitch. And of course expectations are very high everywhere in this boardroom and all around the world for the perfection of what Rockstar typically delivers. In terms of your question, I think you were asking your second question, why didn't we provide very specific guidance for a top-line number going forward? And the answer is, generally speaking, we have not done that except when it was necessary to clarify where we felt the company was going. We think now we are being very specific about this fiscal year and about the next couple of fiscal years by saying we expect relating to your third question, sequential growth on top-line. And we think that pretty much answers the question. Finally, the second part of your third question is that driven by the GTA ecosystem. The answer is certainly, we have expectations for that ecosystem. And again, given that full game sales continue to be strong for GTA V this many years later. At the same time, we also have a number of other powerful releases coming about which we're highly optimistic. And of course we have [car hits] (ph) in the marketplace. Match Factory is a huge hit and only accelerating.\nMike Hickey: Thanks, Strauss. Good luck guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe I can just ask a big picture one that's two parts. When you come out of the activity you just went through in terms of reevaluating your pipeline and looking at resource allocation across the organization what were some of the key learnings on right, the right mix of content is for you guys to meet your hurdle rate going forward? And what were some of the key learnings of how much of the resource allocation decisions are now setting the company up on a multiyear view? Or do you think there are going to be a continued refinement as you look to marry resources and the IP pipeline in the years ahead? Thanks so much.\nKarl Slatoff: So in terms of looking at our pipeline, I mean this is not really new to us. This is a process that we go through that we've been going through for at least the last 17 years as I've been here. And -- but what we're looking for specifically around this -- the look that we just took is that we're looking look -- we understand in the industry right now that the biggest games are winning, and they're taking more share. And that's obviously a fact that we noticed and take us very seriously. We're simply looking for the projects that we think have the highest chance for commercial success and for critical success. And going through and coming through those and going through and then making the tough choices. It's always difficult to cancel any projects. But in this context, it was something that was necessary and really part of our normalized process. So we absolutely expect that, that will continue in the future. This was a pretty tough look and a pretty big look. So I think most of that is behind us. But we will be adding, and we will be subtracting over the next few years, and that's part of what we do. And it will be both with will continue to invest in new IP as well. That is not off the table for us. That's very important. That's the life level blood of the industry. And if you're not investing in new IP, we think it's a biggest [stack] (ph).\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Jason Basmo with Citi. Please proceed with question.\nJason Bazinet: I just had one question on GTA VI. This narrowing from calendar '25 to the fall of 25%. Do you think there's an ancillary benefit of that of sort of syncing up with the holiday season? Or do you feel like GTA is such a powerful franchise that it really doesn't confer any sort of incremental benefit .\nStrauss Zelnick: While it probably doesn't matter, I think we'd all rather be in the release window that we're looking at now.\nJason Bazinet: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of James Heaney with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nJames Heaney: Yeah, thank you for taking the question. What have been some of the unlocks on the mobile side of the business. You did call out the better-than-expected results in Zynga's IP business, but just curious if there's anything you could say specifically on the advertising side of the business. Thank you.\nStrauss Zelnick: Look, we have two important businesses within mobile in-app purchases and advertising and they're both relevant. We hit on advertising as we rethought our hyper-casual business and turned it into a blended hybrid casual business where they are in-app purchases as well. At the same time, we built up advertising inside Mobile by putting advertising units in games that previously did not have them. In any case, advertising should be a meaningful growth area for us in the mobile business. With regards to app purchases, we have the same opportunities and limitations that any other mobile company has and our ability to grow in our purchases is driven by our ability to have people download and play hip titles. That's what we're focused on.\nJames Heaney: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Clay Griffin with Moffett Nathanson. Please proceed with your question.\nClay Griffin: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you. I'm curious if you guys would talk about the broader PC strategy. I know that there's just tons and tons of engagement, particularly for GTA on PC, not all of that gets monetized. I think in the past, you've describe that as maybe it's a good thing to have that there. You don't necessarily need to monetize all of it. But there are some interesting products out there over Wolf and the like. And so maybe I'm just curious what you guys are seeing or thinking about your opportunity to unlock monetization on PC. Thanks.\nKarl Slatoff: So we look at the PC platform as we do any platform, and it all starts with content, first and foremost. And we agree, it's a very powerful platform, and we've got some very strong third-party partners. Also the ability for us to sell directly to the consumer. So these are all compelling things for us, and we'll continue to develop and support the PC platform as long as the gamer is there. Wherever the gamer is, that's where we're going to be. And again, I don't really see us looking at the PC monetization any differently than we would on any other platform. It really is more about game to game. What works for certain games, what doesn't work for certain games. And the overarching edict that we live by is overdeliver on content and the monetization will follow.\nClay Griffin: Great, thanks Karl.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Chris Schoell with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Schoell: Hi, great. Thank you for taking the question. We saw Rockstar announce a price increase for GTA. I recognize it's been 7 years, but can you help us think through the rationale? And as you look at GTA VI, so what are your latest thoughts around the pricing dynamics for the franchise or your portfolio in general as these games continue to get larger with more robust experiences? Thank you.\nStrauss Zelnick: Look, there's more content constantly being made available, and we really aim to deliver great value at any given time. We're so focused on delivering more value than what we charge. And that's sort of the rubric. And any time we establish our prices, we want to make sure that it's good news for the consumer that the experience vastly over delivers in the context of the cost. That's the goal.\nChris Schoell: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Omar Dessouky with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nOmar Dessouky: Sure, I have two questions, one on mobile and then just one again on the sequential growth. So is there any more color at all you can give us on how you're going to grow sequentially in fiscal '27 after lapping just such a tough comp in fiscal '26 when GTA VI is going to launch. It just seems counterintuitive. When I look back at the last 2 times, Rockstar released a mega title, Red Dead Redemption in fiscal '19, fiscal '20 did not grow. And Grand Theft Auto V in fiscal '14, fiscal '15 was down 30% I'm just kind of trying to square those couple of things there. Will it be Rockstar that continues to drive that sequential growth in fiscal '27? Any more color there would be really great.\nStrauss Zelnick: Yes, it's a fair question. Look, the business has really changed and certainly since 2019 and absolutely since 2015 and in ways that are obvious now and in ways that we project in the future. The sequential growth is driven by our overall pipeline, and we're now a large and diversified company. And we do have GTA VI coming. We have great aspirations for GTA VI. And as I said earlier, we've been selling full game, GTA V for over 10 years. And we continue to sell more in a given year than most other standalone releases selling their first year, even at our big competitors company. So we actually think there is a compelling case that the full game sales will continue to be robust for years to come. Equally, we have a pipeline both announced and unannounced, that's very exciting. We have an annualized pipeline that will, of course, continue to come that's quite significant. And we have a mobile business that we frankly feel has been rightsized, well-structured and is now back in growth mode. And there's evidence of that. The performance of Match Factory!, the performance of Toon Blast and the stable performance of many other big titles. There are also geographical growth opportunities that we're very focused on. We don't spend a lot of time talking about it, but it's a huge part of our strategy. Our business and our competitors' businesses remain largely US and Western Europe focused. And we think there are enormous opportunities for growth in Asia, India and Africa, where we and everyone else who isn't located in those geographies are deeply underpenetrated. So there are numerous opportunities for growth, but to put reminded ease, this isn't stick finger in your mouth and hold it in the air and hope for the best kind of number. This is driven by our release schedule and our pipeline.\nOmar Dessouky: Okay. And along kind of the same lines, I think a lot of people are going to be super excited about GTA VI coming out. Do you make any assumptions about the perhaps a reacceleration of growth in the console installed base or console sales, because your title may bring a lot of lapsed gamers back into the ecosystem in your forecasts.\nStrauss Zelnick: We are using IDG's projections, which are pretty substantial. So for Gen 9 alone, their view is that they're about 81 million consoles worldwide currently that was at the end of the last year, they project that will rise to 111 million by the end of this year and [175 million] (ph) by the end of 2027. Now we don't necessarily subscribe or not subscribe to those views, but that shows an awful lot of growth. And we do expect a very significant attach rate.\nOmar Dessouky: Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. And with that, I would like to turn the floor back over to CEO, Strauss Zelnick for any closing comments.\nStrauss Zelnick: Before we sign off, I just want to thank everyone who works at Take-Two in all of our affiliates. These have been challenging times. And in addition to delivering hits, we've asked everyone to dig deep and make sure the business is highly efficient, rightsized. And that's challenging. And one of the most extraordinary things about our organization is the amazing morale and focus on the common good. We are here for our customers for our first and foremost for our colleagues who deliver to our customers every day and for our shareholders. And we're extraordinarily excited both about the position we're in, about the fiscal year in which we're currently operating and about our amazing pipeline in the years ahead. Thank you for joining us today.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Karl Slatoff",
            "content": "Thanks, Strauss. I'd like to thank our teams for their dedication and hard work as we continue to build the foundation for our future which we believe is more promising than ever. We are extremely excited about our upcoming pipeline which includes approximately 40 titles through Fiscal 2027. Our updated release schedule reflects the actions of our recent cost-reduction program, through which we cancelled several titles to focus our efforts and resources on the franchises we believe represent our best opportunities to achieve significant critical and commercial success. These titles did not include any of our core franchises and were not expected to materially affect our net bookings growth. Turning to Fiscal 2025, we have 16 titles in our pipeline, three of which have already been released. We have seven immersive core titles, including TopSpin, NBA and WWE 2K25, and the next iteration in one of 2K's biggest and most beloved franchises, with the first details coming in just a few short weeks at Summer Games Fest Kickoff Live. Of these titles, TopSpin 2K25 was released by 2K and Hangar 13 on April 26. The revival of our popular tennis franchise has been well-received by critics and provides deep personalization, iconic venues, and industry-leading gameplay. With TopSpin 2K25, we continue to broaden our sports offerings, and 2K will support the title with season packs throughout the year. We have two independent titles from Private Division, the first of which is Moon Studio's No Rest for the Wicked, which launched on April 18th into Early Access on PC. This new ARPG was well received for its visceral combat, distinct art style and rich narrative. Private Division, along with We\u0304ta\u0304 Workshop, also announced Tales of the Shire: A The Lord of the Rings Game, which is planned for release later this year. The teams recently revealed a new trailer for this cozy, hobbit life sim, which is set in the Middle-earth universe of J.R.R. Tolkien. We have five mobile titles, including NFL 2K Playmakers, Star Wars Hunters, and Game of Thrones Legends. NFL 2K Playmakers was released on April 23rd by 2K and Cat Daddy Games for iOS and Android devices. In this non-simulation tactical card battle players can collect NFL player cards to assemble an exciting roster, while also experiencing a variety of game modes and features. We're proud to add NFL 2K Playmakers to our ever-growing mobile portfolio in partnership with the NFL and the NFL Player's Association. Lastly, we have two new iterations of prior releases planned for the year. As always, our labels will continue to provide new content and experiences that drive engagement and recurrent consumer spending across many of our key offerings. Looking ahead, our pipeline for Fiscal 2026 and 2027 has 24 titles planned, including, l5 immersive core releases, six of which are sports simulation games, one independent title; five mobile games; and three new iterations of previously-released titles. In closing, we believe that the many opportunities ahead of us will deliver a period of meaningful long-term growth, margin expansion, and shareholder returns. I'll now turn the call over to Lainie. So we absolutely expect growth in NBA. And that's not just on the RCS side but also on the full game sales side as well. This year is a little bit more challenging because we are still in the transition from Gen 8 to Gen 9. And Gen 9 is outperforming our expectations and doing fantastically well. I'd say we're a little bit more challenged on the Gen 8 side. As we continue to transition, I think we are going to see more tailwinds than headwinds in that regard. And when you look at the recurring consumer spending, specifically when you look at it specifically as it relates to Gen 9, it's off the chart. It is fantastic. So we've seen significant growth there. So again, I think we will have momentum just as we transition to Gen 9 and as people continue to engage more deeply in the game, we're going to continue to see very strong RCS growth. I'm sorry, was your question about the transition from console generation from the last transition to this transition? Okay. So that's going back quite some time. And frankly, I don't have the exact figures in front of me. But generally speaking, I would say that the delta between the games in this year, the Gen 8 game is much broader. And I think that creates a more obvious difference between the two-- to do two games. And frankly, I can't remember if we had two completely separate games back then. But in any case, the Delta is quite significant this time around. So I would expect that the transition is more the effect of the transition is more pronounced in this console generation. And I forget your second question. Was there another one? Yes. We're not really commenting on our competitors. And most of our other studios, we don't have as much NBA comes out every year. So you're going to see that transition more rightly. We don't have the same effect in most of our other games. Occasionally, we would, but they wouldn't be comparable games to NBA anyway.

            "name": "Lainie Goldstein",
            "content": "Thanks Karl and good afternoon everyone. We delivered a strong finish to Fiscal 2024 and are entering Fiscal 2025 with momentum, including healthy trends across our key franchises. Throughout the year, we released successful hit titles, engaged players with a steady cadence of in-game content, and continued to position our organization for the long-term. We also deepened our commitment to efficiency and made some decisions that, while difficult will align our resources with the initiatives for which we have the highest levels of conviction. We are confident that, over time these steps will drive our scale, enhance our margins, and deliver industry-leading returns for our shareholders. I'd like to thank our teams for their vision, passion, and dedication. Turning to our results, we delivered fourth quarter net bookings of $1.35 billion, which was above our guidance range of $1.27 billion to $1.32 billion. This reflected better-than-expected results from NBA 2K24; Zynga's in-app purchases, led by Toon Blast and Match Factory; the Red Dead Redemption series and the Grand Theft Auto series. Recurrent consumer spending declined 2% for the period and accounted for 79% of net bookings. This was above our outlook, driven by the outperformance of NBA 2K, Toon Blast, and Match Factory. Recurrent consumer spending declined for Grand Theft Auto Online, although it was up for virtual currency and GTA+. NBA 2K was in-line with the prior year; and mobile increased slightly. During the quarter, we successfully launched WWE 2K24, which demonstrates 2K and Visual Concept's ability to raise the bar further for our popular wrestling series. GAAP net revenue decreased 3% to $1.4 billion, while cost of revenue declined 24% to $930 million and included an impairment charge of $304 million related to acquired intangible assets. Operating expenses increased by 244% to $3.2 billion, due to a goodwill impairment charge of $2.2 billion and $93 million of business reorganization expenses related to our recently announced cost-reduction program. On a management basis, operating expenses rose 20% year-over-year, which was slightly above our guidance, due to higher personnel and IT expenses, and professional fees. For fiscal 2024, we achieved net bookings of $5.33 billion, which was slightly above our revised guidance range of $5.25 billion to $5.3 billion. Recurrent consumer spending grew 2%, which exceeded our outlook, and accounted for 78% of net bookings. Recurrent consumer spending for mobile increased high single-digits; NBA 2K virtual currency and seasons was up slightly; and Grand Theft Auto Online virtual currency and GTA+ membership was flat. Non-GAAP Adjusted Unrestricted Operating Cash Flow was $42 million as compared to our outlook of approximately $100 million due to higher external developer advances, cash tax and interest payments. We spent approximately $142 million on capital expenditures, primarily for game technology and office build outs. GAAP net revenue was flat at $5.35 billion, and cost of revenue increased 1% to $3.1 billion, which included an impairment charge of $577 million related to acquired intangible assets. Operating expenses increased 69% to $5.8 billion, due to an impairment charge of $2.3 billion related to goodwill and a $105 million business reorganization charge related to our cost-reduction programs. On a management basis, operating expenses rose 15% year-over-year and were slightly above our guidance, due to the factors I mentioned earlier that affected the fourth quarter. Today, we provided our outlook for Fiscal 2025. We project net bookings to range from $5.55 billion to $5.65 billion, which represents 5% growth over Fiscal 2024. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, the Grand Theft Auto series, Toon Blast, Empires & Puzzles, our hyper-casual mobile portfolio, Match Factory, the Red Dead Redemption series, an unannounced immersive core title from 2K, and Words With Friends. We expect recurrent consumer spending to be up approximately 3% compared to fiscal 2024, and to represent 76% of net bookings. Our recurrent consumer spending forecast assumes high single-digit growth for mobile, a slight increase for NBA 2K, and a decline for Grand Theft Auto Online. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 50% Zynga, 31% 2K, 17% Rockstar Games, and 2% Other. And, we forecast our geographic net bookings split to be about 60% United States and 40% International. We expect Non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow to be an outflow of $200 million, and we plan to deploy approximately $140 million for capital expenditures, primarily for game technology and office buildouts. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $5.57 billion to $5.67 billion and cost of revenue to range from $2.43 billion to $2.46 billion. Turning to operating expenses, we recently implemented a cost reduction program that is expected to deliver over $165 million of annual cost savings across our entire business. As part of these efforts, we have eliminated several projects in development that we did not anticipate would meet our financial benchmarks. We also took actions to streamline our organizational structure, which reduced both existing headcount and future hiring needs. Our total operating expenses are expected to range from $3.56 billion to $3.58 billion as compared to $5.83 billion last year. On a management basis, we expect operating expense growth of approximately 7% year-over-year, which is largely due to an increase in ongoing marketing support for Match Factory, as well as other mobile and immersive core launches planned for the year, partially offset by savings from our cost reduction program. Looking ahead, and as Strauss mentioned earlier, we have narrowed the previously established release window for Grand Theft Auto VI to Fall of Calendar 2025 from Calendar 2025. As development advances, our confidence in the title and its potential commercial impact continue to grow. That said, we are not providing specific guidance beyond fiscal 2025, as our release schedule includes numerous titles each year and even modest shifts can have a significant effect on results in any given period. Our outlook for the lifetime value of our pipeline remains as strong as ever and we expect sequential growth in net bookings in Fiscal 2025, 2026, and 2027. Now, moving onto our guidance for the fiscal first quarter. We project net bookings to range from $1.2 billion to $1.25 billion, compared to $1.2 billion in the first quarter last year. Our release slate for the quarter includes TopSpin 2K25, No Rest for the Wicked on Early Access for PC and NFL 2K Playmakers, all of which have already released, and Star Wars Hunters. The largest contributors to Net Bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, the Grand Theft Auto series, Toon Blast, Empires & Puzzles, our hyper-casual mobile portfolio, Match Factory, the Red Dead Redemption series, Words With Friends, and Zynga Poker. We project recurrent consumer spending to increase by approximately 1%, which assumes mid single-digit growth in mobile, flat results for NBA 2K, and a decline for Grand Theft Auto Online. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $1.3 billion to $1.35 billion. Operating expenses are planned to range from $928 million to $938 million. On a management basis, operating expenses are expected to grow by approximately 14% year-over-year, which is primarily driven by additional marketing for Match Factory, partially offset by our cost reduction program. In closing, we believe that we are very well positioned to deliver the highest quality content in our industry and to enhance our profitability, as we grow our scale and maintain our focus on efficiency. We are extremely excited about our path for the future, and we look forward to sharing more details about the many catalysts ahead for our Company. Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Strauss. So we'll start to see it in fiscal '25, but we'll see a full annualization of it in fiscal year '26. So the majority of the plan was executed in Q4 and Q1, but pieces of it will come through this year. So for fiscal year '25, the outlook reflects a narrowing of Rockstar Games previously established window from the calendar 2025 to fall, as we mentioned, also some other movements within the release schedule and also with our cost-cutting plan that is also part of the overall results for that year. No, it is not included since the transaction hasn't closed yet. So we will expect to include it next quarter when we close, and we expect it to be slightly accretive to our management results."

            "content": "Thanks, Nicole. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we concluded fiscal 2024 with strength, including net bookings of $1.35 billion, which exceeded the high end of our guidance range. Contributing to our positive results was the outperformance of NBA 2K24, Zynga's in-app purchases, led by Toon Blast and our newest hit, Match Factory, and the Red Dead Redemption and Grand Theft Auto series. During Fiscal 2024, we generated net bookings of $5.33 billion, driven by our high quality titles and our ability to engage consistently our player communities. With fiscal 2025 underway, our portfolio is gaining momentum and we have many exciting releases planned for the year. We expect net bookings to be in the range of $5.55 billion to $5.65 billion, representing 5% year-over-year growth. Our outlook reflects a narrowing of Rockstar Games' previously established window of Calendar 2025 to fall of Calendar 2025 for Grand Theft Auto VI. We're highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience and our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase. As we release our groundbreaking pipeline, we expect to achieve tremendous growth, including sequential increases in net bookings in fiscal 2025, 2026, and 2027. We've been executing our substantial cost reduction program, which we now anticipate will result in over $165 million of annual cost savings from our current and future expenses. This will enable us to run our business more efficiently and achieve greater operating leverage as our large-scale titles come to market. Now turning to our performance during the quarter. NBA 2K24, which remains the number one basketball simulation experience in our industry, surpassed our expectations as players responded to our promotions, in-game content strategy, and updates within seasons. To-date, the title has sold in over 9 million units. Engagement remains high with nearly 2 million consumers playing daily. Our industry-leading NBA 2K brand also continues to expand its audience through several innovative mobile experiences including NBA 2K24 MyTEAM, the new free-to-download mobile experience that allows players to sync progress between console and mobile devices, as they play their favorite MyTEAM modes on the go, NBA 2K Mobile and NBA 2K24 Arcade Edition, which is consistently in the top five on Apple Arcade. The Grand Theft Auto series delivered another fantastic quarter, partially driven by an array of free content updates for Grand Theft Auto Online, including new vehicles, drag races, holiday themed items to celebrate Lunar New Year and Valentine's Day, new community series jobs, and more. Unit sales for Grand Theft Auto V exceeded our forecast, and to-date the title is sold in approximately 200 million units worldwide. We're thrilled that more than a decade after their initial releases, Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online grew their audience size by an incredible 35% and 23% respectively for the full year. Grand Theft Auto V also reclaimed its top spot as the most watched video game across all platforms according to StreamHatchet, thanks largely to the tremendous viewership from the series' thriving role-play community. Rockstar's premium subscription service, GTA+, also continues to grow, with membership for the quarter almost doubling over the same period in the prior year as Rockstar continues to add valuable benefits to players. Red Dead Redemption 2 also surpassed our expectations and has sold-in nearly 64 million units worldwide. We continue to expand the audience for the series, with Red Dead Redemption and Undead Nightmare, recently added to the roster of games included within the GTA+ library. Borderlands 3 outpaced our forecasts and we are thrilled that Randy Pitchford and Gearbox Entertainment are slated to join officially 2K's renowned internal studios in the coming weeks. We have already identified many potential growth opportunities for the Borderlands series and Gearbox's catalog, which we plan to pursue once the studio is integrated into our organization. We are also excited to see growing buzz for the star-studded Borderlands feature film which is planned for release by Lionsgate this summer. WWE 2K24 has been a resounding success and is the highest rated sports simulation of 2024. The title is also the highest-rated installment in the history of our popular wrestling franchise on Xbox, with an 83 average Metacritic score. Engagement has been exceptional with players logging over 11 million hours across more than 110 million played matches. In addition, the [40 years] (ph) of WrestleMania Pack has the highest attach rate for a Super Deluxe DLC in the series' history, with more than 25% of WWE 2K24 players owning it. 2K and Visual Concepts are continuing to support the title and will have additional packs launching throughout the Fall. I'd like to thank our friends, Nick Kahn and Ari Emanuel over at WWE, TKO, and WME for their continued support. Additionally, I'd like to express our immense gratitude to our team at Visual Concepts for their outstanding work on our WWE 2K and NBA 2K franchises, which are both important annual contributors for our Company. Zynga delivered outstanding results for the period, led by robust in-app purchases. Match Factory is accelerating and proving to be a hit, already establishing itself as a Top 20 grossing game in the US Apple App Store and reaching millions of new users with its launch on the Google Play store. We are pleased that new bold beats and other exciting features have propelled average daily play time to around 60 minutes per user. Toon Blast maintained its positive momentum, achieving nearly 20% growth of in-app purchases compared to the third quarter, driven by a new Dragons' Treasure competition and many other features. We'd like to congratulate the team at Peak for their incredible performance. Top Troops launched several content updates, as well as a major cross-media collaboration with the popular influencer, MrBeast. The team plans to release additional enhancements to core gameplay and progression systems to drive further growth. Momentum continues at Rollic, with the studio crossing 3.5 billion all-time downloads and announcing a new partnership with Mattel to introduce a mass-market Barbie mobile game later this calendar year. Our blended monetization efforts in hyper-casual are progressing well within Rollic, which has resulted in Twisted Tangle and Screw Jam both becoming Top-100 grossing games on the U.S. Apple App Store. Our direct-to-consumer business continues to grow, and our teams are working actively to add more titles each quarter to this highly accretive, owned distribution channel. Looking ahead, Zynga has numerous titles in development and soft launch that we are eager to release worldwide this fiscal year, including Star Wars Hunters and Game of Thrones: Legends. In closing, I am highly confident in our business, led by our top creative talent, our industry leading portfolio of owned intellectual property, our sound balance sheet and our increasingly efficient infrastructure. Our teams are laser-focused on our core tenets of creativity, innovation, and efficiency, and as we deliver our ground-breaking pipeline over the next several years, we are poised also to deliver industry-leading growth and shareholder returns. I will now turn the call over to Karl. Thanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for their dedication to our business and for creating the highest quality, most engaging entertainment franchises to captivate our global audiences. And to our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued support. We'll now take your questions. Operator? Thanks, Eric. What I was referring to is when asked, when Gearbox was sold to Embracer whether that caused us to have any concern, my response was no because we have a long-term publishing agreement, and that's been mutually beneficial for our company and for Gearbox and as it was for Embracer. However, when the opportunity presented itself for us to acquire the company on terms that we felt were reasonable, we frankly jumped at the opportunity. We have all the respect in the world for Randy Pitchford and his team. He has the ability to bring AAA products to market, responsibly and on a very reliable and rather rapid cadence. And he is a hit maker. And it's very hard to make a new hit, and [Tiny Tino] (ph) was a new hit. And of course, Borderlands just goes from strength to strength. So we're thrilled to have Gearbox in the family. Undoubtedly, this so-called hybrid casual approach should lead to longer life cycles because the hypercasual approach really was put it out there, get a bunch of downloads offer a rather light experience, generate advertising revenue, have the users move on to the next. And that was great while it lasted, but long-term entertainment businesses are all driven by great content. And Rollic's proving that it has the ability with its partner studios to do just that and to deliver content that is durable and long lasting. It remains to be seen whether we can truly create forever franchises at Rollic. I believe we can. We haven't done so yet, but we are off to a really good start. Thanks, Colin. We actually narrowed calendar 2025 to fall of 2025, and we feel really good about that release date. And obviously, we feel great about the title that is to come. And with regard to mobile, what we do at Zynga because we are a market leader, of course, is driven by the market in which we live. And it is gratifying that after a down year and then a slightly down year we're heading into a flatter up year for the industry. Obviously, though, what's driving our expected results would be our hits, including Match Factory!, which is performing really, really well. And we said that we were spending a lot on UA in the fourth quarter we did, and that's turned out to be productive spending. So I hope like everyone else, we look at the very same metrics, which is cost of acquisition, what kind of retention you expect which is to say what kind of churn you get. The spending that you have on average and therefore the lifetime value. And the longer payback period you're willing to accept, of course the more risk you take in those calculations because they're all based on extrapolating from current data and past data and they change at any given time. So I'm not prepared to share sort of our outside payback period. Suffice to say, though that we want to have a great deal of confidence that we're looking at a positive LTV. So of course, our mobile division is profitable. I understand what you're asking which is frankly, just another way of asking the same question you asked before, which I decline to answer. However, I do give you extra credit points for rephrasing it in a way that I might dive into it. However -- so we don't share our exact payback periods. We do however tailor our user acquisition spending so that we expect a meaningfully positive LTV in a period of time such that we have confidence that even if we're wrong, we're not so wrong that we're not making money. I hope that clarifies it a bit. So Rockstar hasn't given any details on what its expectations are for the release. It's been a wonderful trailer that they put out that broke the Internet, and more news will come from Rockstar in the fullness of time. Thanks, Mike, for those questions. I think our confidence continues to increase just because Grand Theft Auto V continues to perform so well. We've now sold in over 200 million units. And every quarter, we continue to be pleased by the ongoing sales of the full game and engagement in the past fiscal year with Grand Theft Auto V was up about 35% with Grand Theft Auto Online was up about 23%, I believe. That's extraordinary growth at this stage again more than 10 years after the initial release. So I think we feel as though the market's anticipation is at a fever pitch. And of course expectations are very high everywhere in this boardroom and all around the world for the perfection of what Rockstar typically delivers. In terms of your question, I think you were asking your second question, why didn't we provide very specific guidance for a top-line number going forward? And the answer is, generally speaking, we have not done that except when it was necessary to clarify where we felt the company was going. We think now we are being very specific about this fiscal year and about the next couple of fiscal years by saying we expect relating to your third question, sequential growth on top-line. And we think that pretty much answers the question. Finally, the second part of your third question is that driven by the GTA ecosystem. The answer is certainly, we have expectations for that ecosystem. And again, given that full game sales continue to be strong for GTA V this many years later. At the same time, we also have a number of other powerful releases coming about which we're highly optimistic. And of course we have [car hits] (ph) in the marketplace. Match Factory is a huge hit and only accelerating. While it probably doesn't matter, I think we'd all rather be in the release window that we're looking at now. Look, we have two important businesses within mobile in-app purchases and advertising and they're both relevant. We hit on advertising as we rethought our hyper-casual business and turned it into a blended hybrid casual business where they are in-app purchases as well. At the same time, we built up advertising inside Mobile by putting advertising units in games that previously did not have them. In any case, advertising should be a meaningful growth area for us in the mobile business. With regards to app purchases, we have the same opportunities and limitations that any other mobile company has and our ability to grow in our purchases is driven by our ability to have people download and play hip titles. That's what we're focused on. Look, there's more content constantly being made available, and we really aim to deliver great value at any given time. We're so focused on delivering more value than what we charge. And that's sort of the rubric. And any time we establish our prices, we want to make sure that it's good news for the consumer that the experience vastly over delivers in the context of the cost. That's the goal. Yes, it's a fair question. Look, the business has really changed and certainly since 2019 and absolutely since 2015 and in ways that are obvious now and in ways that we project in the future. The sequential growth is driven by our overall pipeline, and we're now a large and diversified company. And we do have GTA VI coming. We have great aspirations for GTA VI. And as I said earlier, we've been selling full game, GTA V for over 10 years. And we continue to sell more in a given year than most other standalone releases selling their first year, even at our big competitors company. So we actually think there is a compelling case that the full game sales will continue to be robust for years to come. Equally, we have a pipeline both announced and unannounced, that's very exciting. We have an annualized pipeline that will, of course, continue to come that's quite significant. And we have a mobile business that we frankly feel has been rightsized, well-structured and is now back in growth mode. And there's evidence of that. The performance of Match Factory!, the performance of Toon Blast and the stable performance of many other big titles. There are also geographical growth opportunities that we're very focused on. We don't spend a lot of time talking about it, but it's a huge part of our strategy. Our business and our competitors' businesses remain largely US and Western Europe focused. And we think there are enormous opportunities for growth in Asia, India and Africa, where we and everyone else who isn't located in those geographies are deeply underpenetrated. So there are numerous opportunities for growth, but to put reminded ease, this isn't stick finger in your mouth and hold it in the air and hope for the best kind of number. This is driven by our release schedule and our pipeline. We are using IDG's projections, which are pretty substantial. So for Gen 9 alone, their view is that they're about 81 million consoles worldwide currently that was at the end of the last year, they project that will rise to 111 million by the end of this year and [175 million] (ph) by the end of 2027. Now we don't necessarily subscribe or not subscribe to those views, but that shows an awful lot of growth. And we do expect a very significant attach rate. Before we sign off, I just want to thank everyone who works at Take-Two in all of our affiliates. These have been challenging times. And in addition to delivering hits, we've asked everyone to dig deep and make sure the business is highly efficient, rightsized. And that's challenging. And one of the most extraordinary things about our organization is the amazing morale and focus on the common good. We are here for our customers for our first and foremost for our colleagues who deliver to our customers every day and for our shareholders. And we're extraordinarily excited both about the position we're in, about the fiscal year in which we're currently operating and about our amazing pipeline in the years ahead. Thank you for joining us today."

I will now turn the conference call over to Nicole Shevins, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Thank you. You may begin.\nNicole Shevins: Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 ended December 31, 2023. Today\u2019s call will be led by Strauss Zelnick, Take-Two\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Karl Slatoff, our President; and Lainie Goldstein, our Chief Financial Officer. We will be available to answer your questions during the Q&A session following our prepared remarks. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that statements made during this call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs of our management as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to us. We have no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Actual operating results may vary significantly from these forward-looking statements based on a variety of factors. These important factors are described in our filings with the SEC including the company\u2019s most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q, including the risks summarized in the section entitled Risk Factors. I\u2019d also like to note that unless otherwise stated, all numbers we will be discussing today are GAAP and all comparisons are year-over-year. Additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release, including the items that our management uses internally to adjust our GAAP financial results in order to evaluate our operating performance. Our press release also contains a reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure. In addition, we have posted to our website a slide deck that visually presents our results and financial outlook. Our press release and filings with the SEC may be obtained from our website at take2games.com. And now, I will turn the call over to Strauss.\nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks, Nicole. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I\u2019m pleased to report that we achieved solid results, including net bookings of $1.3 billion. Our performance reflects our unwavering commitment to quality, the ongoing contributions from our outstanding portfolio, which is one of the strongest and most diverse in the entertainment industry, and our immensely talented creative teams. During the period, Grand Theft Auto V, Grand Theft Auto Online, the Red Dead Redemption series and Zynga\u2019s in-app purchases, led by Toon Blast, exceeded our plans, driven by engaging new content, partnerships and activations. This was partially offset by some softness in mobile advertising and sales for NBA 2K24. 2K is implementing measures to enhance performance for the title, such as offering new events and promotions and delivering an exciting and engaging content lineup. We expect lifetime net bookings for the title to be in line with NBA 2K23. Due to these factors, a planned release moving out of the fourth quarter and increased marketing for Zynga\u2019s new hit mobile title Match Factory!, we\u2019re lowering our full year outlook. While the timing of Match Factory!\u2019s user acquisition expense will reduce our profitability in the current fiscal year, we believe that this investment will allow us to grow our audience meaningfully and increase the lifetime value of the Match Factory! franchise. We have always managed Take-Two for the long-term and we have great confidence in our groundbreaking pipeline for fiscal 2025 and beyond, which we believe will enable us to grow our net bookings, increase our scale and enhance our profitability. At the same time, our teams are always looking for ways in which we can operate at the highest level of efficiency, which is one of our core tenets. We\u2019re currently working on a significant cost reduction program across our entire business to maximize our margins while still investing for growth. These measures are incremental to and even more robust than our prior cost reduction program, and we aim to achieve greater operating leverage as we roll out our eagerly anticipated release schedule. Turning to the performance of our titles during the quarter. Momentum for Grand Theft Auto remains phenomenal. Sales of Grand Theft Auto V exceeded our expectations during the holiday season, and to date, the title is sold in more than 195 million units worldwide. During the quarter, Rockstar Games released its holiday update for Grand Theft Auto Online: The Chop Shop, which captured the highest number of active users in several years, including the largest ever increase in new Grand Theft Auto Online accounts, driven by the variety and depth of new vehicles in robberies, positive community sentiment and the game\u2019s inclusion in various subscription services. The Grand Theft Auto series is also benefiting meaningfully from excitement surrounding Rockstar\u2019s announcement of Grand Theft Auto VI and the release of its first trailer, which, at 93 million views in 24 hours, broke YouTube\u2019s records for a non-music video launch and, along with partner channels, became the biggest video debut ever. Rockstar\u2019s recent partnership with Netflix to launch the GTA Trilogy is also a resounding success, quickly yielding the highest rate of installs and engagement on the subscription services game platform. In addition, Rockstar\u2019s membership program, GTA+, continues to grow rapidly, powered by enhanced benefits for members, including a rotating assortment of classic Rockstar titles. Red Dead Redemption 2 also surpassed our plans, as our exciting holiday promotions and events resonated deeply with players. To-date, the title is sold in more than 61 million units worldwide. During the quarter, Rockstar Games supported Red Dead Online with free updates, including the new All Hallows\u2019 Call to Arms locations, a trio of new Dead of Night maps and a Hardcore Telegram Mission alongside the return of the Halloween Pass 2. NBA 2K24 remains the number one basketball simulation experience in our industry and, to date, is sold in over 7 million units. Unit sales for the Gen 9 version of the game are growing at a double-digit percentage increase over last year due to an enhanced gameplay experience and wider console availability. As players migrate to Gen 9 platforms, we are seeing significant declines in demand for our Gen 8 offering. Players have been highly engaged with many of NBA 2K24\u2019s new features, including a Season Pass that helped average revenue per user grow 30% year-over-year. On October 6, 2K and Gearbox Software launched the Borderlands 3 Ultimate Edition for Nintendo Switch. We\u2019re pleased to expand further our beloved franchise by enabling players to make some mayhem at home or on the go with this thrilling high stakes adventure. Now turning to Zynga. We\u2019re very pleased with the team\u2019s ability to create successful new mobile games, including Peak\u2019s Match Factory!, which launched on iOS in November and Android in late December. The title is a top 30 grossing game on the Apple App Store in key target markets, such as the U.K. and the U.S., and has shown stellar retention and monetization metrics on par with previous category-leading Peak titles such as Toon Blast. Based on these excellent metrics, we see strong long-term potential for the title, and we\u2019re planning to invest in new features and a robust marketing campaign to capitalize on its popularity with consumers and to scale it further. Zynga\u2019s other recent release, Top Troops, increased its engagement by more than 10% over last quarter, propelled by the launch of new features and semi-monthly battles. Looking ahead, the team is focusing on new brand collaborations, player competitions and social and community engagements. Overall, Zynga\u2019s in-app purchases exceeded our expectations with significant sequential improvement compared to last quarter. This was led by Toon Blast, which materially outperformed, delivering its highest ever average revenue per daily average user and over 50% growth in its daily in-app purchase revenue compared to last quarter. While we\u2019re encouraged by the trajectory of Zynga\u2019s in-app purchases, its ad revenues were below our expectations due to some changes that we\u2019re implementing in the hypercasual business, including a heightened focus on our profitability and the launch of new features that deliver blended monetization. Our direct-to-consumer business continues to grow and enjoyed a record holiday season. Our teams are working actively to add more titles each quarter to this highly accretive owned distribution channel. Looking ahead, Zynga has numerous titles in development and soft launch that we\u2019re eager to release worldwide in fiscal 2025 and beyond. It bears noting that launching hit mobile titles is both highly complex and challenging, and we\u2019re gratified by Zynga\u2019s unique ability to release new properties to capture mind share and market share. In closing, although we\u2019re lowering our outlook for the year, we believe that our company\u2019s potential is vast and unique, driven by our creative talent, our owned and controlled intellectual property and our groundbreaking new pipeline for fiscal 2025 and beyond. As we execute on our strategic priorities, we believe that we\u2019ll deliver an array of unparalleled entertainment experiences that can captivate, engage and redefine our industry for audiences around the globe. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Karl.\nKarl Slatoff: Thanks, Strauss. I\u2019d like to thank our teams for delivering another solid quarter and adding to the continued positive momentum of our business. I\u2019ll now turn to our upcoming launches for the balance of fiscal 2024 and beyond. This quarter, Private Division and Evening Star will launch Penny\u2019s Big Breakaway, a 3D platforming game. Private Division will share more news about this exciting release shortly. On March 8, 2K and Visual Concepts will launch WWE 2K24. The title will feature several franchise advancements, including the 2K Showcase...of the Immortals, celebrating 40 years of WrestleMania, four new match types, two new MyRISE experiences and much more. We\u2019re thrilled to build upon our long-standing partnership with WWE and to continue to set new creative benchmarks for this franchise. At The Game Awards in December, Private Division announced No Rest for the Wicked, an action role-playing game from Moon Studios, creators of the critically acclaimed Ori and Blind Forest and Ori and the Will of the Wisps. The title will launch Early Access on PC in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 with a full release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S and PC thereafter. We will reveal more information about the game on March 1 during the label\u2019s Wicked Inside digital showcase. After 13 years, we are pleased that 2K will return to tennis and broaden its sports offerings with the upcoming release of Top Spin 2K25. Developed by Hangar 13, the title was poised to provide an incredibly realistic and engaging tennis simulation featuring the world\u2019s top players and courts. 2K will share more details in the coming weeks, including an expected launch date. Zynga continues to deliver on their outstanding pipeline with their much anticipated titles, Star Wars Hunters and Game of Thrones: Legends, each slated for global release in calendar 2024. We are encouraged by both games\u2019 performances and soft launch and are confident that they will resonate with broad audiences when they debut worldwide. At the same time, Zynga\u2019s hypercasual studios plan to release a steady cadence of mobile titles for games that has the potential for enhanced retention rates and a mix of in-app purchases and advertising to drive higher monetization and profitability. And as always, our labels will continue to provide new content and experiences that drive engagement and recurrent consumer spending across many of our key offerings. Looking ahead, we remain highly optimistic about what we believe to be the strongest and most exciting development pipeline in our company\u2019s history. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Lainie.\nLainie Goldstein: Thanks Karl and good afternoon everyone. We delivered solid holiday results, including net bookings of $1.34 billion, which was within our guidance range. I\u2019d like to thank our talented teams for their commitment to creativity, innovation, quality and value, which allows us to provide outstanding entertainment experiences for our players across the world. Grand Theft Auto V, Grand Theft Auto Online, the Red Dead Redemption series and Zynga\u2019s in-app purchases, led by Toon Blast, exceeded our expectations. This was partially offset by softness in mobile advertising in NBA 2K. Recurrent consumer spending declined 7% for the period and accounted for 75% of net bookings. This was slightly less than our outlook, driven by weakness in mobile advertising and NBA 2K, which was largely due to the effect of lower unit sales on its in-game monetization. Recurrent consumer spending for Grand Theft Auto Online, virtual currency and GTA+ membership was up notably. During the quarter, we launched several mobile titles, including Top Troops, Match Factory! and NBA 2K24 Arcade Edition for Apple Arcade as well as Borderlands 3 Ultimate Edition for Switch. GAAP net revenue decreased 3% to $1.37 billion, and cost of revenue declined 1% to $688 million, which included an impairment charge of $53 million and $177 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Operating expenses decreased by 10% to $808 million. On a management basis, operating expenses rose 4% year-over-year and was favorable to our guidance due to lower marketing and personnel expenses. Turning to our guidance, I\u2019ll begin with our full fiscal year expectations. As Strauss mentioned, we are lowering our outlook to reflect the softness we are currently experiencing in mobile advertising and NBA 2K24, a planned release will be out of the fourth quarter and increased marketing for Zynga\u2019s new hit mobile title Match Factory!, which we believe will enable us to scale it more meaningfully to reach its full long-term potential. Our revised net bookings forecast is $5.25 billion to $5.3 billion. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 51% Zynga, 30% 2K and 19% Rockstar Games. And we forecast a geographic net booking split to be about 60% United States and 40% international. We are projecting recurrent consumer spending of 1% compared to fiscal 2023, which includes a full year of Zynga, partially offset by a slight decline in NBA 2K. Grand Theft Auto Online is expected to deliver modest growth for virtual currency and GTA+ membership. RCS is expected to represent 79% of net bookings. We plan to generate approximately $100 million in non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow and to deploy approximately $150 million for capital expenditures, primarily to support our office build-outs and larger footprint. We now forecast GAAP net revenue to range from $5.27 billion to $5.32 billion. Our total operating expenses are now planned to range from $3.55 billion to $3.56 billion as compared to $3.45 billion last year. On a management basis, we continue to expect operating expense growth of approximately 14% year-over-year due to a full year of Zynga and increase in personnel marketing expenses and higher depreciation, which are being partially offset by the realization of synergies from our combination with Zynga and savings from our prior cost reduction program announced last year. Now moving on to our guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter. We project net bookings to range from $1.27 billion to $1.32 billion compared to $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter last year. Our release slate for the quarter includes WWE 2K24 as well as Penny\u2019s Big Breakaway from Private Division. The largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Toon Blast, our hypercasual mobile portfolio, Empire & Puzzles, WWE 2K24, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Words with Friends and Match Factory!. We project recurrent consumer spending to decrease by approximately 5%, which assumes flat results for Zynga and a decline for NBA 2K with Grand Theft Auto Online, virtual currency and GTA+ membership are expected to be up. We project GAAP net revenue to range from $1.32 billion to $1.37 billion. Operating expenses are planned to range from $896 million to $906 million. On a management basis, operating expenses are expected to grow by approximately 17% year-over-year, driven by the additional marketing expense for Match Factory! that I mentioned previously, higher personnel costs and an increase in depreciation, which are being partially offset by the realization of synergies from our combination with Zynga and savings from our prior cost reduction program that we announced last year. Looking ahead, our teams remain committed to efficiency. We\u2019ve begun a rigorous analysis to identify additional areas for cost optimization. The expected savings are incremental to our previously announced cost reduction program, and we expect that it will be more expansive. We believe that these measures will enhance our margin profile and position our business for greater operating leverage in the future. In closing, while we are disappointed to have lowered our outlook for the year, we are exceedingly confident in our growth prospects. With our industry-leading portfolio and passionate teams, we believe that we are poised to deliver the best content in our industry, reach new record levels of operating performance and deliver long-term value for our shareholders. Thank you for your continued support. I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Strauss.\nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of our entire management team, I\u2019d like to thank our colleagues for enabling us to achieve our goals and deliver another solid quarter. And to our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued support. We will now take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Eric Handler with ROTH MKM. Please proceed.\nEric Handler: Yes, thank you and good afternoon. Wonder if you could maybe give a little meat to the bone, so to speak, with your cost-cutting program. How much cost or net savings have you generated so far? What do you think this next plan could do and over what time?\nStrauss Zelnick: Lainie will take that.\nLainie Goldstein: Sure. So for the synergies with Zynga, we realized over $100 million in savings and the original cost-cutting program that we announced previously was over $50 million. So we do expect this plan to enhance our margins, both by reducing costs from our existing cost base and avoiding future costs and they will be incremental to these other cost-cutting programs that we had and even more robust than the prior cost reduction program. And next quarter, we will be in a position to give a little more details on the plan.\nEric Handler: Helpful. And then with regards to the advertising weakness that you are seeing, is that all related to what\u2019s going on with the hypercasual business or does it extend also to in-game advertising for casual games?\nStrauss Zelnick: This is Strauss. So it\u2019s basically the hypercasual business, and we\u2019re really optimizing the business from profitability. So there\u2019s always a balance. We\u2019re also seeing that we can actually have in-app payments in our hypercasual business. So it\u2019s really moving to a hybrid model, and we\u2019re very excited about that. There\u2019s great opportunity in that business.\nEric Handler: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nDavid Karnovsky: Thank you. I guess, first, with some of the momentum and investment for Match Factory! and the game delay, is there any update to your fiscal \u201825 or \u201826 forecast?\nStrauss Zelnick: Lainie is going to take that.\nLainie Goldstein: Currently, it\u2019s the middle of our budgeting process. At this time, the number is tracking a little above $7 billion for net bookings for the year and given the typical shifts and tweaks that occur in our forecasting process. And this amount is still huge growth over this year. And our pipeline is groundbreaking for next year and beyond, and our teams are making excellent progress on game development. And nothing material has changed with regard to the lifetime value of our portfolio. And both will provide our initial outlook for fiscal year \u201825 when we report our Q4 and full year fiscal year \u201824 results in May.\nDavid Karnovsky: And then just on Match Factory! It looks to be the most substantial new launch for Zynga since the acquisition. Want to see if you could speak kind of more broadly to the process of launching new mobile games, whether this reflects any kind of broader improvement in UA or content generation there? Thanks.\nStrauss Zelnick: I think so. I mean, I\u2019ve said repeatedly in the past few years that the hardest thing that anyone in the industry can do is create a new mobile hit. It\u2019s super hard. And so much so that one of our big competitors just decided they weren\u2019t going to try it anymore. It was off the table. We stuck with it and so did some of our competitors. So clearly, the market\u2019s becoming more receptive and more reactive. There\u2019s a big title from one of our competitors, Monopoly GO!, which is a huge hit. And we\u2019re gratified obviously here to see so much traction already in Top Troops and Match Factory!. And Match Factory!\u2019s already a top 30 title in the U.S. and UK Apple App Stores with lots of continued traction in the rest of the world, and it\u2019s really just beginning. We are supporting the title in the quarter, and that\u2019s not money that we could possibly recoup in the quarter. So to put some color around the guidance change, that\u2019s really good news, not bad news. That\u2019s going to be a very profitable expenditure that will come back to us in the next fiscal year. Because of the way we structure UA, we structure for relatively quick paybacks compared to the industry because we\u2019re conservative. So I do think \u2013 look, I think the team in Zynga is doing a phenomenal job delivering great properties. It starts there. It always starts there. And yes, I also believe the market\u2019s becoming more reactive. Remember, the market was down for the first time in its history in 2022, and it was flattish after that. And there were no new hits for years from us or anyone else. That\u2019s clearly changing. I think it puts further evidence on the table that being exposed to mobile through the Zynga acquisition was a really, really good thing for this company, and we\u2019re highly optimistic going forward.\nDavid Karnovsky: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Doug Creutz with TD Cowen. Please proceed.\nDoug Creutz: Yes. I wonder if you could be a little more specific relative to the guidance cut to the fiscal year, how much came from the title delay on the top line versus the other factors you cited. And to what extent the delay of the title out of the year might have impacted your operating income? Because presumably you will be marketing for it less. Thank you.\nStrauss Zelnick: Lainie?\nLainie Goldstein: So for the full year, when you look at the changes that we made to the fourth quarter forecast, the biggest drivers were towards the user acquisition spend and marketing for Match Factory!, then the lower mobile advertising that we were seeing, updating expectations for NBA 2K24 and the shift of an unnamed title out of the year. So those are the top four primary reasons for the change.\nDoug Creutz: In that order?\nLainie Goldstein: Yes, that was the order of magnitude.\nDoug Creutz: Okay.\nOperator: Our next question is from Andrew Marok with Raymond James. Please proceed.\nAndrew Marok: Hey, thanks for taking my questions. Good commentary on the Netflix tie-up with the GTA Trilogy. I guess going back to maybe how that came about, what made you guys want to partner with that kind of fledgling mobile gaming platform and be one of the first major third-party titles out there?\nStrauss Zelnick: Look, we have to balance all the different elements that go into choosing how, where and when to distribute our titles. And as our titles enter the catalog, we can be flexible about how to distribute. We tend to support all emerging platforms as long as they serve consumers and as long as the terms under which we support the platforms make sense to us.\nAndrew Marok: Great. And then maybe a little bit more of an esoteric question, but interested to maybe dig into that hypercasual commentary. Is there anything that\u2019s maybe changed in the last few months or quarters with player behavior in hypercasual games that they\u2019re now willing to do in-app purchases?\nStrauss Zelnick: All about quality. I think Rollic has been really focused on making more and more robust titles. Remember, hypercasual came about as a business where you\u2019d actually look at hundreds of games a month and put them out into the market and see what would stick and then a game would stick for 3 months and then roll off. And what\u2019s happening now is Rollic has title. Rollic, we believe, is a leader in the space, has titles that are much more durable and long-lasting and turning into games that could be games that last for years. We hope that, that will happen. And as those games are more durable and offer more playing value to consumers, there\u2019s an opportunity in certain of those games to have in-app purchases, so really, moving from hypercasual to hybrid casual. But it\u2019s all about quality and meeting the consumer where they are. And the story of the entertainment business is always a move to quality. And remember, we\u2019re still, in many ways, in the nascent business. Interactive entertainment is roughly 30 years old, mobile\u2019s roughly 12 years old, and these are early-stage businesses. And they started off as glorified toy businesses and then they turned into entertainment businesses and now they\u2019re year-round entertainment businesses. All of that\u2019s great news for a company like ours. We are the number two pure-play interactive entertainment company on earth, and it\u2019s still early innings. And we\u2019re seeing a lot of movement in mobile. Our 3-part strategy includes the word innovation. And innovation means that even if you start as hypercasual, if consumers want you to go upmarket and give them something that\u2019s deeper and more compelling and more long lasting, you have to be there to do it. I would say our hypercasual team, led by Barak Verdal in Istanbul, is first class.\nAndrew Marok: Great. Appreciate the detail.\nOperator: Our next question is from Benjamin Soff with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\nBenjamin Soff: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. A follow-up on the GTA Trilogy for mobile. Does this provide a blueprint for how to bring more of your titles to mobile in the future? And just curious if you see an opportunity for additional partnerships with Netflix for additional mobile titles going forward as well? Thanks.\nStrauss Zelnick: We \u2013 I\u2019m not sure this is a model for mobile distribution, because ultimately, it all depends on how you define mobile. We think of mobile as a game that you typically play on your phone, and we have a big portfolio of games like that. And we\u2019d love to do more with Netflix, who wouldn\u2019t, as long as the consumers are happy to be there and as long as the economics of those arrangements make good sense.\nOperator: Our next question is from Drew Crum with Stifel. Please proceed.\nDrew Crum: Okay, thanks. Hi, guys. Good afternoon. So on NBA 2K, I think it was enjoying some pretty strong engagement in RCS trends into the early part of fiscal 3Q, at least. Any thoughts or explanation around what transpired thereafter? And just any more additional color you can give us in terms of your expectations for fiscal 4Q.\nKarl Slatoff: So \u2013 I\u2019m sorry. Sorry, Strauss. The NBA has \u2013 the game has been incredible for NBA 2K24, and that continues to be the case. We still have very strong momentum around RCS, also driven specifically by our Season Pass. The Gen 9 SKU is performing incredibly well. We\u2019ve got double-digit growth over 2K23 at this point. Yet, the real story here is that Gen 8 is actually underperforming our expectations. And I think as people transition more towards Gen 9 and experience all that NBA, the franchise, has to offer in the Gen 9 SKU, then you\u2019re going to see continued growth in that franchise. So we feel really great about where the engagement is. Engagement in the title is fantastic. It really is \u2013 any sort of softness that we\u2019re seeing is really a story about the Gen 8 product at this point.\nDrew Crum: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Martin Yang with Oppenheimer & Company. Please proceed.\nMartin Yang: Thank you for taking my question. The two-part question regarding GTA trailer\u2019s reception, do you see a meaningful uplift for themselves due to the trailer performance on YouTube? And then given that strong performance, do you think that \u2013 could be future marketing events for GTA could be planned in conjunction with potential updates from other games, GTA, Red Dead? Does that change your view on how to market to GTA VI in the next 12 months?\nStrauss Zelnick: Look, we\u2019re really gratified that the announcement of the trailer was a huge event online, and then the trailer debut between YouTube and other marketing partners set a record for a video to view. So we couldn\u2019t be happier or more excited by the initial trailer. And I do think that excitement around GTA VI has had a halo effect on the entire franchise. We\u2019ve now sold in 195 million units of GTA V, and GTA Online continues to perform above our expectations. So I do think all things GTA lead to more excitement. As far as the marketing programs, I think Rockstar is particularly expert in marketing their titles and, I think, is considering all the appropriate angles.\nMartin Yang: Got it. Thank you. And then another question regarding marketing is we\u2019ve seen Judas and Top Spin with trailers and the revealers or teasers without a release date. Is there overall philosophy to market new games change? Or is it still largely based on studio level decision on when they will release or announce the release dates for new games?\nStrauss Zelnick: Marketing is really driven by our labels and our studios, and we don\u2019t have a fixed march to a release from particular marketing needs.\nMartin Yang: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Timothy O\u2019Shea with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nTimothy O\u2019Shea: Yes. Thank you for taking my question. Back on Grand Theft Auto. We\u2019ve spoken about the Grand Theft Auto trailer. My question is really, is there a way to quantify or maybe compare what you saw in terms of all this anticipation for GTA VI compared with how the level of anticipation that you saw for GTA V ahead of that games announcement? And then I had a follow-up.\nStrauss Zelnick: It is possible to do research around that. And our sense is that the anticipation is much higher, much, much higher. On the other hand, 195 million units to date is nothing to sneeze at. So we stopped well short of making predictions about how the title will do, but clearly, anticipation is running very, very high.\nTimothy O\u2019Shea: Yes. Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful. And then just quickly, can we talk about how you make the decision about when to launch a game like Grand Theft Auto VI, like who makes the call, what motivates them? Assuming this is game quality, game finish polish, maybe there\u2019s a desire to hit a specific launch window or really anything else that might influence Rockstar\u2019s decision about the timing of when to launch this game. Thank you.\nStrauss Zelnick: We\u2019re seeking perfection. And when we feel we\u2019ve optimized creatively, that\u2019s the time to release. So \u2013 and we\u2019re all in this together. In terms of motivations and incentives, the financial incentives of everyone who works at this company are aligned with those of the shareholders. So we essentially have \u2013 call it what you will, we have profit sharing plans throughout the company at the operating level. And at the senior level, compensation is driven largely by TSR. So our goal is to align the interest of everyone who works there with the interest of the shareholders. That keeps us all pointing in the same direction. So you are right, there is inherent tension potentially between getting something to market and creating perfection, but this company errs on the side of perfection.\nTimothy O\u2019Shea: Thanks, Strauss. Yes, anticipation is pretty high around here too. So we look forward to seeing again.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Hickey with Benchmark Company. Please proceed.\nMike Hickey: Hey Strauss, Karl, Lainie and Nicole. Thanks for taking our questions. Lainie, just curious on your updated \u201825 view, I think this is two quarters it\u2019s come down a bit, maybe now more than the last quarter. And I think I heard you said that maybe \u201825 and \u201826 is sort of the same. So, any color you can give us in terms of sort of bridging where you were for \u201825 versus what you are thinking now? And if in fact you are still thinking \u201825 and \u201826 together is kind of where your original guidance was. And then on the cost cutting, obviously, we are seeing a lot of that in the industry. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s unprecedented trials or not, but no doubt, it\u2019s significant. And you have already gone through one round. Just sort of curious your motivation here to take another sort of big cost reduction, especially given what it look like, the next 2 years, you are going to have pretty significant growth given your pipeline coming to fruition. Thanks guys.\nStrauss Zelnick: Lainie?\nLainie Goldstein: Hi Mike. So, for fiscal year \u201825, as I mentioned, it\u2019s really driven by changes in the release schedule. And obviously, that will move some of the titles out into years going forward because the lifetime value of our portfolio hasn\u2019t changed. So, we should \u2013 we do expect to see growth in fiscal year \u201826 over \u201825, so that hasn\u2019t changed. So, it\u2019s just a regular process of re-forecasting and updating the business. And this time, we are working on our budget. So, that\u2019s where the numbers are falling out.\nStrauss Zelnick: And Mike, in terms of cost reduction, as I have said and as you know, we have a three-part strategy that\u2019s supported us well through thick and thin. And that is, first and foremost, to be the most creative company, also to be the most innovative and, finally, always to be the most efficient company in the entertainment business. And that\u2019s a big challenge. And we mean it, and everyone here means it. And I think that it\u2019s time to take another look at efficiency and make sure that everyone is focused on the things that really matter and only the things that really matter and put ourselves in a position where we have the opportunity for great operating leverage as these titles come to market and as the revenues flow through the system.\nMike Hickey: Thanks guys.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brian Fitzgerald with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.\nBrian Fitzgerald: Thanks. Strauss, I just wanted your opinion on this recent Disney and Epic deal. Obviously, you have your own strong IP, but we are just curious how you think that might impact access to license IP maybe for the industry at large, if we continue to see this type of tie-ups? Thanks.\nStrauss Zelnick: It\u2019s a good question. I only know what I read in the release and what you also read. What I read was that they are making an investment in a leading company, Epic, which is \u2013 obviously has a spectacular franchise in Fortnite. And then there was some talk around sort of creating a Fortnite/Disney ecosystem. And I don\u2019t know exactly what that means, but I am not betting against my friends at Epic or Disney. And I wish them well. So, I guess it remains to be seen, but they are two fine companies. I think anything that\u2019s good for consumers and it creates excitement in our industry is good for Take-Two because it keeps people engaged with the properties that we bring to market, and we have the best collection of owned intellectual property in the business, bar none. And we are the number two player in the space, so \u2013 and we would like to go from here. So, I see it as a net positive for the business, and we will see how they do with it. But I am certainly not betting against them.\nBrian Fitzgerald: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question is from Omar Dessouky with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nOmar Dessouky: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Back in May, on your fourth quarter call, you gave a $1 billion operating cash flow guide. And since you have updated us on the fiscal \u201825 top line outlook, I was wondering if you could also update us on the fiscal \u201825 operating cash flow outlook and any puts and takes around that? And then I have a quick follow-up.\nStrauss Zelnick: Great. That\u2019s Lainie.\nLainie Goldstein: So, Omar, we haven\u2019t updated that number. We are still working on our budget right now. We would expect that number to change along with the release schedule changes, and it will depend on when the titles are released during the year of when the \u2013 a UFCF will be collected.\nOmar Dessouky: Okay. So, maybe riffing off of Brian\u2019s question about kind of Epic and Disney, thinking about Grand Theft Auto online, do you see any potential for Grand Theft Auto to be a trans-media property, which maybe involves brands and IP from franchises outside of Take-Two? Yes, that\u2019s the question.\nStrauss Zelnick: Yes. Look, we really do prefer that our labels talk about what\u2019s going to go on in the title creatively. And I could riff endlessly and share my opinions, but I prefer to hear from Rockstar. And they will talk about what\u2019s coming in due time.\nOmar Dessouky: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Chris Shaw with UBS. Please proceed.\nChris Shaw: Great. Thank you for taking the questions. Just going back to the Zynga deal, at the time, you had talked about revenue synergies that would come through in time. Can you just remind us where those initiatives stand today and how your thoughts might have evolved since you closed the deal? And then second question, just any early learnings you can give us on the iOS fee changes in Europe and how this might inform your mobile strategy going forward? Thanks.\nStrauss Zelnick: Yes. I mean we have made great progress across the-board, including on the revenue side. The biggest area of synergy so far has been our direct-to-consumer initiative, which is a collective initiative to offer the consumer the ability to purchase in-app currency for mobile games directly. And that\u2019s been exceedingly successful, rolled out very quickly and quite profitable, and there is a lot more upside to come. There are numerous other areas on which we are making progress. We are kind of ticking the box with that one by itself. And in terms of game store changes, this will \u2013 there is a lot of moving parts here. And some of the decisions you mentioned in Europe and some of the decisions in the U.S. are contradictory. So there is a lot of dust left to shake out. But on balance, I remain of the view that I have stated years ago that distribution costs will come down meaningfully. They already are.\nChris Shaw: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Clay Griffin with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed.\nClay Griffin: Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. Curious if you guys have a reaction to speculation. I suppose that Microsoft maybe looking to take some of the titles that were formerly exclusive to the Xbox platform and making those more widely available. It seems at least part of that rationale, if it\u2019s true, maybe around just the cost to develop big titles. And Strauss, love to get your thoughts on particular areas of development that are particularly sticky as it relates to cost? Thanks.\nStrauss Zelnick: Well, the big console titles are expensive and time-considering to create. And if you want to make the very, very best, it takes a long time and it costs a lot of money. I really don\u2019t want to speak for Microsoft and their strategy. There has been a lot of noise around that lately. I have no doubt that they will express where they\u2019re heading. I would just say that if you take a look at their market cap now compared to a few years ago, you don\u2019t want to bet against that management team.\nClay Griffin: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Strauss for closing remarks.\nStrauss Zelnick: First, as always, I want to thank our teams for delivering such great work, with such extraordinary commitment. Everything that goes on here is a team effort and we are all aligned, all in this together and all working to do our level best to create the best entertainment for our consumers and to do it within the four walls of superb company with a great culture. I also want to thank our shareholders for their continued support. We are really excited about what is to come. Thanks for joining us today.\nOperator: Thank you. That will conclude today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Thanks, Strauss. I'd like to thank our teams for delivering another solid quarter and adding to the continued positive momentum of our business. I'll now turn to our upcoming launches for the balance of fiscal 2024 and beyond. This quarter, Private Division and Evening Star will launch Penny's Big Breakaway, a 3D platforming game. Private Division will share more news about this exciting release shortly. On March 8, 2K and Visual Concepts will launch WWE 2K24. The title will feature several franchise advancements, including the 2K Showcase...of the Immortals, celebrating 40 years of WrestleMania, four new match types, two new MyRISE experiences and much more. We're thrilled to build upon our long-standing partnership with WWE and to continue to set new creative benchmarks for this franchise. At The Game Awards in December, Private Division announced No Rest for the Wicked, an action role-playing game from Moon Studios, creators of the critically acclaimed Ori and Blind Forest and Ori and the Will of the Wisps. The title will launch Early Access on PC in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 with a full release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S and PC thereafter. We will reveal more information about the game on March 1 during the label's Wicked Inside digital showcase. After 13 years, we are pleased that 2K will return to tennis and broaden its sports offerings with the upcoming release of Top Spin 2K25. Developed by Hangar 13, the title was poised to provide an incredibly realistic and engaging tennis simulation featuring the world's top players and courts. 2K will share more details in the coming weeks, including an expected launch date. Zynga continues to deliver on their outstanding pipeline with their much anticipated titles, Star Wars Hunters and Game of Thrones: Legends, each slated for global release in calendar 2024. We are encouraged by both games' performances and soft launch and are confident that they will resonate with broad audiences when they debut worldwide. At the same time, Zynga's hypercasual studios plan to release a steady cadence of mobile titles for games that has the potential for enhanced retention rates and a mix of in-app purchases and advertising to drive higher monetization and profitability. And as always, our labels will continue to provide new content and experiences that drive engagement and recurrent consumer spending across many of our key offerings. Looking ahead, we remain highly optimistic about what we believe to be the strongest and most exciting development pipeline in our company's history. I'll now turn the call over to Lainie. So \u2013 I'm sorry. Sorry, Strauss. The NBA has \u2013 the game has been incredible for NBA 2K24, and that continues to be the case. We still have very strong momentum around RCS, also driven specifically by our Season Pass. The Gen 9 SKU is performing incredibly well. We've got double-digit growth over 2K23 at this point. Yet, the real story here is that Gen 8 is actually underperforming our expectations. And I think as people transition more towards Gen 9 and experience all that NBA, the franchise, has to offer in the Gen 9 SKU, then you're going to see continued growth in that franchise. So we feel really great about where the engagement is. Engagement in the title is fantastic. It really is \u2013 any sort of softness that we're seeing is really a story about the Gen 8 product at this point."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Lainie Goldstein",
            "content": "Thanks Karl and good afternoon everyone. We delivered solid holiday results, including net bookings of $1.34 billion, which was within our guidance range. I'd like to thank our talented teams for their commitment to creativity, innovation, quality and value, which allows us to provide outstanding entertainment experiences for our players across the world. Grand Theft Auto V, Grand Theft Auto Online, the Red Dead Redemption series and Zynga's in-app purchases, led by Toon Blast, exceeded our expectations. This was partially offset by softness in mobile advertising in NBA 2K. Recurrent consumer spending declined 7% for the period and accounted for 75% of net bookings. This was slightly less than our outlook, driven by weakness in mobile advertising and NBA 2K, which was largely due to the effect of lower unit sales on its in-game monetization. Recurrent consumer spending for Grand Theft Auto Online, virtual currency and GTA+ membership was up notably. During the quarter, we launched several mobile titles, including Top Troops, Match Factory! and NBA 2K24 Arcade Edition for Apple Arcade as well as Borderlands 3 Ultimate Edition for Switch. GAAP net revenue decreased 3% to $1.37 billion, and cost of revenue declined 1% to $688 million, which included an impairment charge of $53 million and $177 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Operating expenses decreased by 10% to $808 million. On a management basis, operating expenses rose 4% year-over-year and was favorable to our guidance due to lower marketing and personnel expenses. Turning to our guidance, I'll begin with our full fiscal year expectations. As Strauss mentioned, we are lowering our outlook to reflect the softness we are currently experiencing in mobile advertising and NBA 2K24, a planned release will be out of the fourth quarter and increased marketing for Zynga's new hit mobile title Match Factory!, which we believe will enable us to scale it more meaningfully to reach its full long-term potential. Our revised net bookings forecast is $5.25 billion to $5.3 billion. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 51% Zynga, 30% 2K and 19% Rockstar Games. And we forecast a geographic net booking split to be about 60% United States and 40% international. We are projecting recurrent consumer spending of 1% compared to fiscal 2023, which includes a full year of Zynga, partially offset by a slight decline in NBA 2K. Grand Theft Auto Online is expected to deliver modest growth for virtual currency and GTA+ membership. RCS is expected to represent 79% of net bookings. We plan to generate approximately $100 million in non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow and to deploy approximately $150 million for capital expenditures, primarily to support our office build-outs and larger footprint. We now forecast GAAP net revenue to range from $5.27 billion to $5.32 billion. Our total operating expenses are now planned to range from $3.55 billion to $3.56 billion as compared to $3.45 billion last year. On a management basis, we continue to expect operating expense growth of approximately 14% year-over-year due to a full year of Zynga and increase in personnel marketing expenses and higher depreciation, which are being partially offset by the realization of synergies from our combination with Zynga and savings from our prior cost reduction program announced last year. Now moving on to our guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter. We project net bookings to range from $1.27 billion to $1.32 billion compared to $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter last year. Our release slate for the quarter includes WWE 2K24 as well as Penny's Big Breakaway from Private Division. The largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Toon Blast, our hypercasual mobile portfolio, Empire & Puzzles, WWE 2K24, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Words with Friends and Match Factory!. We project recurrent consumer spending to decrease by approximately 5%, which assumes flat results for Zynga and a decline for NBA 2K with Grand Theft Auto Online, virtual currency and GTA+ membership are expected to be up. We project GAAP net revenue to range from $1.32 billion to $1.37 billion. Operating expenses are planned to range from $896 million to $906 million. On a management basis, operating expenses are expected to grow by approximately 17% year-over-year, driven by the additional marketing expense for Match Factory! that I mentioned previously, higher personnel costs and an increase in depreciation, which are being partially offset by the realization of synergies from our combination with Zynga and savings from our prior cost reduction program that we announced last year. Looking ahead, our teams remain committed to efficiency. We've begun a rigorous analysis to identify additional areas for cost optimization. The expected savings are incremental to our previously announced cost reduction program, and we expect that it will be more expansive. We believe that these measures will enhance our margin profile and position our business for greater operating leverage in the future. In closing, while we are disappointed to have lowered our outlook for the year, we are exceedingly confident in our growth prospects. With our industry-leading portfolio and passionate teams, we believe that we are poised to deliver the best content in our industry, reach new record levels of operating performance and deliver long-term value for our shareholders. Thank you for your continued support. I'll now turn the call back to Strauss. Sure. So for the synergies with Zynga, we realized over $100 million in savings and the original cost-cutting program that we announced previously was over $50 million. So we do expect this plan to enhance our margins, both by reducing costs from our existing cost base and avoiding future costs and they will be incremental to these other cost-cutting programs that we had and even more robust than the prior cost reduction program. And next quarter, we will be in a position to give a little more details on the plan. Currently, it's the middle of our budgeting process. At this time, the number is tracking a little above $7 billion for net bookings for the year and given the typical shifts and tweaks that occur in our forecasting process. And this amount is still huge growth over this year. And our pipeline is groundbreaking for next year and beyond, and our teams are making excellent progress on game development. And nothing material has changed with regard to the lifetime value of our portfolio. And both will provide our initial outlook for fiscal year \u201825 when we report our Q4 and full year fiscal year \u201824 results in May. So for the full year, when you look at the changes that we made to the fourth quarter forecast, the biggest drivers were towards the user acquisition spend and marketing for Match Factory!, then the lower mobile advertising that we were seeing, updating expectations for NBA 2K24 and the shift of an unnamed title out of the year. So those are the top four primary reasons for the change. Yes, that was the order of magnitude. Hi Mike. So, for fiscal year \u201825, as I mentioned, it's really driven by changes in the release schedule. And obviously, that will move some of the titles out into years going forward because the lifetime value of our portfolio hasn't changed. So, we should \u2013 we do expect to see growth in fiscal year \u201826 over \u201825, so that hasn't changed. So, it's just a regular process of re-forecasting and updating the business. And this time, we are working on our budget. So, that's where the numbers are falling out. So, Omar, we haven't updated that number. We are still working on our budget right now. We would expect that number to change along with the release schedule changes, and it will depend on when the titles are released during the year of when the \u2013 a UFCF will be collected."

            "name": "Strauss Zelnick",
            "content": "Thanks, Nicole. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we achieved solid results, including net bookings of $1.3 billion. Our performance reflects our unwavering commitment to quality, the ongoing contributions from our outstanding portfolio, which is one of the strongest and most diverse in the entertainment industry, and our immensely talented creative teams. During the period, Grand Theft Auto V, Grand Theft Auto Online, the Red Dead Redemption series and Zynga's in-app purchases, led by Toon Blast, exceeded our plans, driven by engaging new content, partnerships and activations. This was partially offset by some softness in mobile advertising and sales for NBA 2K24. 2K is implementing measures to enhance performance for the title, such as offering new events and promotions and delivering an exciting and engaging content lineup. We expect lifetime net bookings for the title to be in line with NBA 2K23. Due to these factors, a planned release moving out of the fourth quarter and increased marketing for Zynga's new hit mobile title Match Factory!, we're lowering our full year outlook. While the timing of Match Factory!'s user acquisition expense will reduce our profitability in the current fiscal year, we believe that this investment will allow us to grow our audience meaningfully and increase the lifetime value of the Match Factory! franchise. We have always managed Take-Two for the long-term and we have great confidence in our groundbreaking pipeline for fiscal 2025 and beyond, which we believe will enable us to grow our net bookings, increase our scale and enhance our profitability. At the same time, our teams are always looking for ways in which we can operate at the highest level of efficiency, which is one of our core tenets. We're currently working on a significant cost reduction program across our entire business to maximize our margins while still investing for growth. These measures are incremental to and even more robust than our prior cost reduction program, and we aim to achieve greater operating leverage as we roll out our eagerly anticipated release schedule. Turning to the performance of our titles during the quarter. Momentum for Grand Theft Auto remains phenomenal. Sales of Grand Theft Auto V exceeded our expectations during the holiday season, and to date, the title is sold in more than 195 million units worldwide. During the quarter, Rockstar Games released its holiday update for Grand Theft Auto Online: The Chop Shop, which captured the highest number of active users in several years, including the largest ever increase in new Grand Theft Auto Online accounts, driven by the variety and depth of new vehicles in robberies, positive community sentiment and the game's inclusion in various subscription services. The Grand Theft Auto series is also benefiting meaningfully from excitement surrounding Rockstar's announcement of Grand Theft Auto VI and the release of its first trailer, which, at 93 million views in 24 hours, broke YouTube's records for a non-music video launch and, along with partner channels, became the biggest video debut ever. Rockstar's recent partnership with Netflix to launch the GTA Trilogy is also a resounding success, quickly yielding the highest rate of installs and engagement on the subscription services game platform. In addition, Rockstar's membership program, GTA+, continues to grow rapidly, powered by enhanced benefits for members, including a rotating assortment of classic Rockstar titles. Red Dead Redemption 2 also surpassed our plans, as our exciting holiday promotions and events resonated deeply with players. To-date, the title is sold in more than 61 million units worldwide. During the quarter, Rockstar Games supported Red Dead Online with free updates, including the new All Hallows' Call to Arms locations, a trio of new Dead of Night maps and a Hardcore Telegram Mission alongside the return of the Halloween Pass 2. NBA 2K24 remains the number one basketball simulation experience in our industry and, to date, is sold in over 7 million units. Unit sales for the Gen 9 version of the game are growing at a double-digit percentage increase over last year due to an enhanced gameplay experience and wider console availability. As players migrate to Gen 9 platforms, we are seeing significant declines in demand for our Gen 8 offering. Players have been highly engaged with many of NBA 2K24's new features, including a Season Pass that helped average revenue per user grow 30% year-over-year. On October 6, 2K and Gearbox Software launched the Borderlands 3 Ultimate Edition for Nintendo Switch. We're pleased to expand further our beloved franchise by enabling players to make some mayhem at home or on the go with this thrilling high stakes adventure. Now turning to Zynga. We're very pleased with the team's ability to create successful new mobile games, including Peak's Match Factory!, which launched on iOS in November and Android in late December. The title is a top 30 grossing game on the Apple App Store in key target markets, such as the U.K. and the U.S., and has shown stellar retention and monetization metrics on par with previous category-leading Peak titles such as Toon Blast. Based on these excellent metrics, we see strong long-term potential for the title, and we're planning to invest in new features and a robust marketing campaign to capitalize on its popularity with consumers and to scale it further. Zynga's other recent release, Top Troops, increased its engagement by more than 10% over last quarter, propelled by the launch of new features and semi-monthly battles. Looking ahead, the team is focusing on new brand collaborations, player competitions and social and community engagements. Overall, Zynga's in-app purchases exceeded our expectations with significant sequential improvement compared to last quarter. This was led by Toon Blast, which materially outperformed, delivering its highest ever average revenue per daily average user and over 50% growth in its daily in-app purchase revenue compared to last quarter. While we're encouraged by the trajectory of Zynga's in-app purchases, its ad revenues were below our expectations due to some changes that we're implementing in the hypercasual business, including a heightened focus on our profitability and the launch of new features that deliver blended monetization. Our direct-to-consumer business continues to grow and enjoyed a record holiday season. Our teams are working actively to add more titles each quarter to this highly accretive owned distribution channel. Looking ahead, Zynga has numerous titles in development and soft launch that we're eager to release worldwide in fiscal 2025 and beyond. It bears noting that launching hit mobile titles is both highly complex and challenging, and we're gratified by Zynga's unique ability to release new properties to capture mind share and market share. In closing, although we're lowering our outlook for the year, we believe that our company's potential is vast and unique, driven by our creative talent, our owned and controlled intellectual property and our groundbreaking new pipeline for fiscal 2025 and beyond. As we execute on our strategic priorities, we believe that we'll deliver an array of unparalleled entertainment experiences that can captivate, engage and redefine our industry for audiences around the globe. I'll now turn the call over to Karl. Thanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for enabling us to achieve our goals and deliver another solid quarter. And to our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued support. We will now take your questions. Operator? Lainie will take that. This is Strauss. So it's basically the hypercasual business, and we're really optimizing the business from profitability. So there's always a balance. We're also seeing that we can actually have in-app payments in our hypercasual business. So it's really moving to a hybrid model, and we're very excited about that. There's great opportunity in that business. Lainie is going to take that. I think so. I mean, I've said repeatedly in the past few years that the hardest thing that anyone in the industry can do is create a new mobile hit. It's super hard. And so much so that one of our big competitors just decided they weren't going to try it anymore. It was off the table. We stuck with it and so did some of our competitors. So clearly, the market's becoming more receptive and more reactive. There's a big title from one of our competitors, Monopoly GO!, which is a huge hit. And we're gratified obviously here to see so much traction already in Top Troops and Match Factory!. And Match Factory!'s already a top 30 title in the U.S. and UK Apple App Stores with lots of continued traction in the rest of the world, and it's really just beginning. We are supporting the title in the quarter, and that's not money that we could possibly recoup in the quarter. So to put some color around the guidance change, that's really good news, not bad news. That's going to be a very profitable expenditure that will come back to us in the next fiscal year. Because of the way we structure UA, we structure for relatively quick paybacks compared to the industry because we're conservative. So I do think \u2013 look, I think the team in Zynga is doing a phenomenal job delivering great properties. It starts there. It always starts there. And yes, I also believe the market's becoming more reactive. Remember, the market was down for the first time in its history in 2022, and it was flattish after that. And there were no new hits for years from us or anyone else. That's clearly changing. I think it puts further evidence on the table that being exposed to mobile through the Zynga acquisition was a really, really good thing for this company, and we're highly optimistic going forward. Lainie? Look, we have to balance all the different elements that go into choosing how, where and when to distribute our titles. And as our titles enter the catalog, we can be flexible about how to distribute. We tend to support all emerging platforms as long as they serve consumers and as long as the terms under which we support the platforms make sense to us. All about quality. I think Rollic has been really focused on making more and more robust titles. Remember, hypercasual came about as a business where you'd actually look at hundreds of games a month and put them out into the market and see what would stick and then a game would stick for 3 months and then roll off. And what's happening now is Rollic has title. Rollic, we believe, is a leader in the space, has titles that are much more durable and long-lasting and turning into games that could be games that last for years. We hope that, that will happen. And as those games are more durable and offer more playing value to consumers, there's an opportunity in certain of those games to have in-app purchases, so really, moving from hypercasual to hybrid casual. But it's all about quality and meeting the consumer where they are. And the story of the entertainment business is always a move to quality. And remember, we're still, in many ways, in the nascent business. Interactive entertainment is roughly 30 years old, mobile's roughly 12 years old, and these are early-stage businesses. And they started off as glorified toy businesses and then they turned into entertainment businesses and now they're year-round entertainment businesses. All of that's great news for a company like ours. We are the number two pure-play interactive entertainment company on earth, and it's still early innings. And we're seeing a lot of movement in mobile. Our 3-part strategy includes the word innovation. And innovation means that even if you start as hypercasual, if consumers want you to go upmarket and give them something that's deeper and more compelling and more long lasting, you have to be there to do it. I would say our hypercasual team, led by Barak Verdal in Istanbul, is first class. We \u2013 I'm not sure this is a model for mobile distribution, because ultimately, it all depends on how you define mobile. We think of mobile as a game that you typically play on your phone, and we have a big portfolio of games like that. And we'd love to do more with Netflix, who wouldn't, as long as the consumers are happy to be there and as long as the economics of those arrangements make good sense. Look, we're really gratified that the announcement of the trailer was a huge event online, and then the trailer debut between YouTube and other marketing partners set a record for a video to view. So we couldn't be happier or more excited by the initial trailer. And I do think that excitement around GTA VI has had a halo effect on the entire franchise. We've now sold in 195 million units of GTA V, and GTA Online continues to perform above our expectations. So I do think all things GTA lead to more excitement. As far as the marketing programs, I think Rockstar is particularly expert in marketing their titles and, I think, is considering all the appropriate angles. Marketing is really driven by our labels and our studios, and we don't have a fixed march to a release from particular marketing needs. It is possible to do research around that. And our sense is that the anticipation is much higher, much, much higher. On the other hand, 195 million units to date is nothing to sneeze at. So we stopped well short of making predictions about how the title will do, but clearly, anticipation is running very, very high. We're seeking perfection. And when we feel we've optimized creatively, that's the time to release. So \u2013 and we're all in this together. In terms of motivations and incentives, the financial incentives of everyone who works at this company are aligned with those of the shareholders. So we essentially have \u2013 call it what you will, we have profit sharing plans throughout the company at the operating level. And at the senior level, compensation is driven largely by TSR. So our goal is to align the interest of everyone who works there with the interest of the shareholders. That keeps us all pointing in the same direction. So you are right, there is inherent tension potentially between getting something to market and creating perfection, but this company errs on the side of perfection. Lainie? And Mike, in terms of cost reduction, as I have said and as you know, we have a three-part strategy that's supported us well through thick and thin. And that is, first and foremost, to be the most creative company, also to be the most innovative and, finally, always to be the most efficient company in the entertainment business. And that's a big challenge. And we mean it, and everyone here means it. And I think that it's time to take another look at efficiency and make sure that everyone is focused on the things that really matter and only the things that really matter and put ourselves in a position where we have the opportunity for great operating leverage as these titles come to market and as the revenues flow through the system. It's a good question. I only know what I read in the release and what you also read. What I read was that they are making an investment in a leading company, Epic, which is \u2013 obviously has a spectacular franchise in Fortnite. And then there was some talk around sort of creating a Fortnite/Disney ecosystem. And I don't know exactly what that means, but I am not betting against my friends at Epic or Disney. And I wish them well. So, I guess it remains to be seen, but they are two fine companies. I think anything that's good for consumers and it creates excitement in our industry is good for Take-Two because it keeps people engaged with the properties that we bring to market, and we have the best collection of owned intellectual property in the business, bar none. And we are the number two player in the space, so \u2013 and we would like to go from here. So, I see it as a net positive for the business, and we will see how they do with it. But I am certainly not betting against them. Great. That's Lainie. Yes. Look, we really do prefer that our labels talk about what's going to go on in the title creatively. And I could riff endlessly and share my opinions, but I prefer to hear from Rockstar. And they will talk about what's coming in due time. Yes. I mean we have made great progress across the-board, including on the revenue side. The biggest area of synergy so far has been our direct-to-consumer initiative, which is a collective initiative to offer the consumer the ability to purchase in-app currency for mobile games directly. And that's been exceedingly successful, rolled out very quickly and quite profitable, and there is a lot more upside to come. There are numerous other areas on which we are making progress. We are kind of ticking the box with that one by itself. And in terms of game store changes, this will \u2013 there is a lot of moving parts here. And some of the decisions you mentioned in Europe and some of the decisions in the U.S. are contradictory. So there is a lot of dust left to shake out. But on balance, I remain of the view that I have stated years ago that distribution costs will come down meaningfully. They already are. Well, the big console titles are expensive and time-considering to create. And if you want to make the very, very best, it takes a long time and it costs a lot of money. I really don't want to speak for Microsoft and their strategy. There has been a lot of noise around that lately. I have no doubt that they will express where they're heading. I would just say that if you take a look at their market cap now compared to a few years ago, you don't want to bet against that management team. First, as always, I want to thank our teams for delivering such great work, with such extraordinary commitment. Everything that goes on here is a team effort and we are all aligned, all in this together and all working to do our level best to create the best entertainment for our consumers and to do it within the four walls of superb company with a great culture. I also want to thank our shareholders for their continued support. We are really excited about what is to come. Thanks for joining us today."

Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. We delivered another consecutive quarter of excellent results highlighted by net bookings of $1.44 billion, which was at the high end of our guidance and management results that exceeded our plans. While we expect continued macroeconomic uncertainty, we believe that we're well positioned for the holiday season and are reiterating our fiscal 2024 net bookings guidance of $5.45 billion to $5.55 billion. Looking ahead, I'm exceedingly optimistic about our company's multiyear growth trajectory and our ability to deliver long-term value to our shareholders. Our development pipeline is robust and diverse and we're getting closer to delivering the groundbreaking titles that our audiences throughout the world have been anticipating eagerly. Our unwavering commitment to being the most creative, the most innovative, and the most efficient entertainment company gives us great confidence that our offerings will surpass our players' expectations and set new standards of creative excellence in our industry. Now turning to the performance of our titles during the quarter. Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online continue to surpass our expectations, an outstanding achievement for two titles celebrating their tenth anniversaries. To-date, Grand Theft Auto V is sold in approximately 190 million units. Grand Theft Auto Online experienced continued momentum due to the rollout of new gameplay and items from the San Andreas Mercenaries update with new seasonal events, vehicles, modes, clothes and weapons driving sustained engagement and net bookings. Our GTA+ membership program continued to grow and we're deepening our relationships with our player communities through new offerings, which now include access to a rotating assortment of classic Rockstar Games titles. During the quarter, Rockstar Games announced that CitizenFX, the team behind the FiveM and RedM role-playing communities for Grand Theft Auto V and Red Dead Redemption 2, officially joined the label. With their immense passion and creativity, CitizenFX has been pivotal in expanding the possibilities of user-generated content around Rockstar's leading titles. We're excited to see them continue to build these creative communities and help them thrive into the future. We're also thrilled by today's announcement from Rockstar Games founder Sam Houser that the eagerly anticipated first trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto will be revealed this coming December. As the label approaches its 25th anniversary next month we congratulate Rockstar Games on their constant innovation in the pursuit of the highest quality interactive entertainment. Red Dead Redemption 2 surpassed our plans and has sold in more than 57 million units to date. Rockstar Games continues to support Red Dead Online with new content including bonuses for the naturalist and bounty hunters, and new free roam missions and events. In addition, Rockstar Games expanded the audience for the franchise with the launch of Red Dead Redemption and Undead Nightmare for PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch. On September 8th, 2K and Visual Concepts once again redefined the number one NBA simulation experience in our industry with the successful worldwide launch of NBA 2K24. With exciting new features and next generation enhancements, the title is off to a great start and to date has sold in over 4.5 million units. NBA 2K24 features new season pass options that provide players with the opportunity to earn even more rewards as well as a new seasonal progression that tracks and combines my career and my team into one linear reward system. Engagement has been phenomenal with season pass and virtual currency bookings exceeding our plans and driving double growth in ARPU compared to NBA 2K23. Our franchise extensions continue to perform extremely well including NBA 2K Mobile, NBA 2K Online in China, and the recently launched NBA 2K24 Arcade Edition on Apple Arcade. I'd like to thank 2K and Visual Concepts for continuing to bring innovation and creativity consistently to our beloved franchise. 2K continues to support LEGO 2K Drive with its second drive pass season and the Creators Hub and PGA Tour 2K23 with additional pros and gear. In addition, the label harness the power of our industry leading catalog with the launch of the Borderlands Collection Pandora's Box, which bundles together all six acclaimed Borderlands Games and their previously released add-on content into a single offering at an amazing value. We have great respect for the team at Gearbox, and we value deeply our long-term relationship. Zynga once again delivered solid results during the quarter and we remain pleased with its ongoing performance. We continue to benefit from Zynga's ability to create engaging new games, which is a distinguishing capability of our mobile business. For example, Rollic successfully launched PowerSlap, based on the world's first regulated and sanctioned slap fighting promotion. The title is highly entertaining and to date has experienced more than 1 billion slaps across training and matches. With the launch of this new mobile game, Rollic has now had 22 titles reach the number one or two spot in the US Apple app store. We'd like to thank the entire team over at TKO including Ari Emanuel and Dana White for their strong partnership as well as our colleagues at Rollic created this title from inception to release in just eight weeks. Zynga also recently launched Top Troops and Match Factory, both of which delivered excellent KPIs and soft launch and appear to have strong long-term potential for our portfolio. And Star Wars Hunters continues to hit important milestones as we approach its planned release date in calendar 2024. Karl will discuss these titles in greater detail. Other highlights from our mobile business this quarter include our advertising bookings grew year-over-year driven by the addition of Popcore, contributions from strategic partnerships and our efforts to increase adamant inventory in many live games. We continue to make excellent progress in our profitability initiatives, including expanding the number of mobile games to leverage our direct-to-consumer platform. As we convert additional players, we're gaining new insights that we believe will better serve our players' preferences. We remain optimistic that over the next few years, most of our mobile games will leverage this highly accretive owned distribution channel. In addition, we continue to enhance the profitability and performance of our hypercasual business with multiple new games scaling rapidly and several games generating revenue from in-app purchases in addition to ads. Our live games portfolio also continued to deliver. Social Casino maintained steady performance coming off a great first quarter driven by new bold beat features which drove strong results, particularly in Zynga Poker. Additionally, we implemented new updates and events across many games, including Top Eleven and Dragon City, which drove audience growth as well as increased engagement in core systems, leading to better retention and monetization. We stand at an exciting time in our company's history with numerous growth opportunities ahead of us. As we deliver on our strategic priorities, we have the potential to create unparalleled entertainment experiences, engage broader audiences throughout the world and ultimately enhance our scale and margin profile. I'd like to thank all of you for your continued support, and we look forward to delivering our next phase of growth. I'll now turn the call over to Karl.\nKarl Slatoff: Thanks, Strauss. I'd like to thank our teams for delivering another strong quarter and adding to the ongoing positive momentum of our business. I'll now turn to our recent and upcoming launches for fiscal 2024 and beyond. On October 3rd, Zynga Socialpoint Studio successfully launched Top Troops, a new mobile game that blends strategy, RPG and merge mechanics to create a thrilling medieval fantasy adventure of combat and conquest. This marked the studio's first worldwide launch under Zynga following our combination last year. The game has seen positive player reception with an average rating of 4.38 on Google Play and 4.5 on the Apple App Store. Engagement has also been fantastic with over 2 million hours played in over 70 million battles fought since its worldwide launch date. 2K and Gearbox Software expanded the audience of our beloved Borderland franchise with the October 6th release of Borderlands 3 Ultimate Edition for Nintendo Switch. The game now allows players to make the mayhem at home or on-the-go in a thrilling high-stakes adventure filed with genre-defining shooter-looter action. On October 20, 2K and Visual Concepts launched the WWE 2K23 Bad Bunny Edition across all platforms. Global phenomenon Bad Bunny is featured on the cover of the edition, which also includes a new playable version of this in-game character wearing the peril that he wore WWE Backlash 2023 live event. Zynga's Peak Games studio, the makers of Tune Blast and Toy Blast released Match Factory, a new puzzle game for mobile where players connect identical items, sort tiles and clear the board in a mesmerizing 3D environment. In soft launch, we observed strong engagement and modernization metrics as well as very positive player response as indicated by App Store review scores, which gives us optimism about the long-term potential for this new mobile title. Private Division has several exciting release as planned for this fiscal year. On November 28th, Roll7 will release their critically acclaimed and wildly imagined a third-person shooter skater, Rollerdrome for Xbox Series X and S and PC as well as Xbox Game Pass for both platforms. Also during the fourth quarter, Evening Star, founded by the industry veterans behind Sonic Mania will launch Penny's Big Breakaway, a kinetic Yo-Yo 3D-platformer for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, Nintendo Switch and PC. 2K and Visual Concepts are hard at work on WWE 2K24, the next installment of our popular Wrestling series, which will launch during the fourth quarter. Looking ahead, we continue to see great engagement and feedback from audiences enjoying Star Wars Hunters in soft launch across multiple territories. There are several exciting new elements that we are working hard to get into the game causing us to move the title's worldwide launch window to calendar 2024. Private Division is working with Weta Workshop on Tales of the Shire, a game set in the Middle Earth universe and inspired by the books of JRR Tolkien. The team recently released a teaser trailer showing fans a glimpse of the project, which is planned for release in calendar 2024 during our fiscal year 2025. Also, Zynga plans to globally launch Game of Thrones Legends, an all-new RPG puzzle oriented mobile title. In addition to our full game releases, our labels will continue to provide new content and experiences that drive engagement and recurrent consumer spending across many of our key offerings. Our hyper-casual studio plan to release a steady cadence of mobile titles for games that have the potential for enhanced retention rates and a mix of in-app purchases and advertising to drive higher monetization and profitability. Looking at the balance of this fiscal year and beyond, we are highly optimistic about what we believe to be the strongest and most exciting development pipeline in our company's history. I'll now turn the call over to Lainie.\nLainie Goldstein: Thanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll discuss the key highlights of our second quarter before reviewing our financial outlook for the full year and third quarter of fiscal 2024. Additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release. We delivered another great quarter, which demonstrates the enduring strength of our catalog, our ability to deliver deeply engaging post-launch content and our commitment to disciplined execution. At the same time, our teams continue to make excellent progress advancing our development pipeline, which gives us confidence in our multiyear growth trajectory. I'd like to thank our incredible teams worldwide for their hard work and passion for our business. Now moving onto our results. We achieved net bookings of $1.44 billion, which was at the high end of our guidance range. Our performance reflects better-than-expected results from Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online and Red Dead Redemption. During the quarter, we released NBA 2K24, Red Dead Redemption and Undead Nightmare for Switch and PlayStation 4. Borderlands Collection, Pandora's Box and PowerSlap. Recurrent consumer spending declined 7% for the period, which was in line with our outlook and accounted for 78% of net bookings. GAAP net revenue decreased 7% to $1.3 billion, while cost of revenue increased 24% to $884 million, driven by an impairment charge of $220 million and $190 million amortization of acquired intangibles. Operating expenses increased by 3% to $959 million and included $165 million of loan impairment, representing a partial impairment of one of our reporting units. On a management basis, operating expenses were flat year-over-year, which is favorable to our guidance. This was driven by lower marketing expenditures, some of which shifted to later this year. Turning to our guidance. I'll begin with our full fiscal year expectations. As Strauss mentioned, we are reiterating our net bookings outlook range of $5.45 billion to $5.55 billion. The largest contributors to net bookings are planned to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, our hyper-casual mobile portfolio, Empires & Puzzles, Toon Blast, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Words with Friends, Merge Dragon and Zynga Poker. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 49% Zynga, 31% 2K, 18% Rockstar Games and 2% other. And we forecast our geographic net booking split to be about 65% United States and 35% international. We are projecting the current consumer spending growth of 4% compared to fiscal 2023, which assumes an increase for NBA 2K as well as Zynga since we will own the business for a full 12 months this year. For Grand Theft Auto Online, Virtual Currency and GTA+ membership is expected to be flat. RCS is expected to represent 78% of net bookings. We plan to generate approximately $100 million in non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow and to deploy approximately $150 million for capital expenditures, primarily to support our office build-outs and larger footprint. We continue to forecast GAAP net revenue to range from $5.37 billion to $5.47 billion. Our total operating expenses are now planned to range from $3.53 billion to $3.55 billion as compared to $3.45 billion last year. On a management basis, we continue to expect operating expense growth of approximately 14% year-over-year due to a full year of Zynga, an increase in personnel and marketing expenses and higher depreciation of office build-outs and capitalized IT expenses, which are being partially offset by the realization of synergies from our combination with Zynga and savings from our cost reduction program. We remain vigilant in our efforts to optimize our cost structure and reduce discretionary costs where possible, while still investing for growth. Now moving on to our guidance for the fiscal third quarter. We project net bookings to range from $1.3 billion to $1.35 billion compared to $1.4 billion in the third quarter last year. Our release date for the quarter includes two mobile titles Top Troops and Match Factory as well as Borderlands 3 Ultimate Edition, all of which have been released. The largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, our hyper-casual mobile portfolio, Empires & Puzzles, Toon blast, Red Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Words with Friends, Merge Dragons and Zynga Poker. We project the current consumer spending to decrease by approximately 5%, which assumes a modest decline in our mobile business, which is being partially offset by expected growth in NBA 2K. The Grand Theft Auto Online, virtual currency and GTA+ membership is expected to be up. We project GAAP net revenue to range from $1.29 billion to $1.34 billion. Operating expenses are planned to range from $826 million to $836 million. On a management basis, operating expenses are expected to grow by approximately 7% year-over-year driven by higher personnel and depreciation expenses, which are being partially offset by the Zynga synergies and our cost savings initiatives. In closing, there are many exciting upcoming catalysts that we believe will enable our company to achieve new record levels of financial performance. Powered by our incredible talent, we believe that our projects in development will set new standards for creativity and engagement in our industry while also significantly enhancing our financial profile. We'd like to thank all our stakeholders for being on this journey with us, and we can't wait to share more details with you. Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Strauss.\nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for enabling us to achieve our goals and to deliver another strong quarter. To our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued support. We'll now take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Andrew Uerkwitz with Jefferies. Please proceed.\nAndrew Uerkwitz: Great. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one -- and I just have one follow-up. The first one, in last quarter, you reiterated your fiscal '25 and '26 guidance. I think you announced Sam Houser mentioned, we'll get a trailer for Grand Theft Auto, I think, in December. How are you feeling about those two years? And any reason why you mentioned those two years in the reiteration of guidance?\nLainie Goldstein: Due to shifts in our pipeline, our expectations are that net bookings will now be below $8 billion, but not necessarily. So it really isn't a big change, and we expect growth in 2016 as well.\nAndrew Uerkwitz: Got it. Thank you. And then kind of just turning to high-level question. The acquisition of FiveM seems super interesting. In that it could allow you guys to maybe learn more about user-generated content and find ways to monetize that and expand your audience. What's the broader thought of making an acquisition like that and how it fits in, not just with Grand Theft Auto, but maybe the company as a whole?\nStrauss Zelnick: We're really excited about it. I mean, to be clear, this is a small economic opportunity right now and a small cost to us. We want to be where the consumer is and what's going on in role playing and really in two ways. Number one, the people are actually playing in old playing servers and number two, the people are watching what they're doing on Twitch. Both are really interesting. The actual people playing is a relatively modest audience. It's in the hundreds of thousands. But the people watching, that's a huge audience. And we're interested in first of all making sure that our intellectual property is protected. We're also really interested in meeting the consumer where the consumer is. And for certain consumers bonding is a really important activity. And finally, people are consuming our intellectual property, we would like to monetize it if we can. We think this gives us an opportunity to do all of the above.\nAndrew Uerkwitz: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Eric Handler with ROTH MKM. Please proceed.\nEric Handler: Good afternoon. Thanks for the question. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing with players who engage with GTA+? Are there different how they interact with the game versus someone who's not a subscriber.\nStrauss Zelnick: We don't see materially different behavior. We think it's a great addition. We're thrilled to engage with our consumers in this way. And it's a learning experience, but it's also gratifying that GTA+ continues to grow and be more and more relevant to more and more consumers.\nEric Handler: Then, Lainie, maybe you can just a quick clarification. At least on a GAAP basis, advertising was down. Is there a difference between GAAP revenue for advertising and advertising bookings?\nLainie Goldstein: Yes. There is -- in the gap there is some deferral of some of the advertising. So that's the difference between us being up in the quarter versus the gap showing flat.\nEric Handler: Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Creutz with TD Cowen. Please proceed.\nDoug Creutz: Hey, thanks. Just wondering if you could give any more color on the write-down you took in the quarter. I'm guessing that had to do with some of your mobile assets, but whatever other color you can give, that would be helpful.\nLainie Goldstein: So we recorded an impairment charge of $220 million related to intangible assets and $165 million of goodwill representing a partial impairment of one of our reporting units. And this is as a result of an updated long-term projection for that reporting unit, but we're not giving any more details other than that.\nDoug Creutz: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Marok with Raymond James. Please proceed.\nAndrew Marok: Thanks for taking my questions. So over the last couple of weeks and months of trying out some different additions of content for GTA+ subs, thinking about the Trilogy in particular. I guess kind of what learnings have you had from the different types of content included in the subscription and how it drives uptake?\nStrauss Zelnick: That's the kind of detail that we typically leave to our labels. So we probably don't have much more to add today except what I said earlier which is we are thrilled that Rockstar is offering a subscription to avid consumers, and we think it bodes really well for the future.\nAndrew Marok: Right. Appreciate that. And then one more, if I could. I heard a lot about some of the coming titles in mobile, kind of a greater prominence of licensed IP with things like Star Wars, Game of Thrones, Lord of the Rings. Just any difference in thinking as to the value of licensed IP on mobile versus console and PC. Thank you.\nKarl Slatoff: So this is Karl. The fact is we do value both, both can be very, very valuable. Obviously, owning the IP in any context and also in mobile, the margin potential is much higher because you own it full and outright. Obviously, with licensed IP you have to pay royalty. But the mobile market is tough to break new IP. It's tough to get attention. And it comes out -- you can't argue with the fact that having a known brand out there is a way for you to get attention. So it's a give and take. I would say our perspective hasn't changed. In a perfect world, we would focus exclusively on owned IP. But the truth is when we see a good license that we think would have -- we have a great idea for a game for and if Zynga folks want to take it to market, then that's something that we're going to continue to pursue.\nAndrew Marok: Right. Much appreciated. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nEric Sheridan: Thank you so much for taking the question. Maybe one bigger picture, one first for Strauss. You've seen a lot of media inflation and increases in subscription prices, broadly in the media landscape. How do you think about striking the balance between pricing and attracting a wider array of audience when you think about the content pipeline you're going to bring to market over the next couple of years to capture the right mix between those two dynamics? And then second question would be, are there any guardrails we should be keeping in mind in terms of the evolution of the DTC platform? And what piece or cadence that might continue to evolve as a percentage of the mix?\nStrauss Zelnick: Yes. I mean you don't want to generalize to our business too much from what's going on in linear entertainment because the increase in subscription pricing and linear entertainment is really a reflection of the fact that too many streaming services were underpricing to acquire customers and then they realize those customers were not durable and the LTVs were upside down. So they were basically adjusting their pricing to make sure that the LTVs are potentially positive. And I think there's still more pain to come for some of those services, and I can wax eloquent if you want, although it has nothing to do with our business. In terms of pricing for any entertainment property, basically the algorithm is the value of the expected entertainment usage, which is to say that the per hour value times the number of expected hours plus the terminal value that's perceived by the customer in ownership if the title is actually owned, not say, rented or subscribed to. And you'll see that, that bears out in every kind of entertainment vehicle. By that standard, our frontline prices are still very, very low because we offer many hours of engagement. The value of the engagement is very high. So I think the industry, as a whole, offers a terrific price-to-value opportunity for consumers. That doesn't necessarily mean that the industry has pricing power or wants to have pricing power. However, there is a great deal of value offered. And look, it's our strategy here to deliver much more value than what we charge consumers. It's always been our strategy here. We want to make sure the experience is first class, and the nature of the experience is not just the quality of what we offer, it's also what you pay for it, everyone knows that anecdotally. So that's how we look at it. There have been precious few price increases in the business. The price increase, for example, the $70 for certain frontline products was the first price increase in many years after many generations. So again, I think we offer a terrific value to consumers. On the second question?\nKarl Slatoff: DTC.\nStrauss Zelnick: Regarding the direct-to-consumer platform, we think there continues to be a great deal of upside there, again, for consumers and also for our margins. It's still a relatively small part of our business. There's a great opportunity for growth. To be clear, we will always work with third-party retailers. We want to be where the consumer is. We value our third-party retailer relationships, they do provide marketing support. That's important to us. There are times when consumers want to have a direct relationship. We can do both. We can do all of the above. It is not our strategy to bring everything in-house.\nEric Sheridan: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel. Please proceed.\nDrew Crum: Okay. Thanks, guys. Good afternoon. So Strauss, you mentioned that the business is well positioned for the holiday season. What's driving that confidence? And how would you assess the health of your consumer? And then separately, I know it's just a subtle change to RCS, but what's behind the adjustment to that figure for the second half, given your fiscal 2Q is in line? It looks like just based on the commentary around the net bookings mix of Zynga, but just want to confirm that. Thanks.\nKarl Slatoff: So speaking to the confidence of our holiday season. Look, simply, I think it's the strength of our catalog and the strength of our products and a lot of our releases are must-have releases. And any time you're heading into a holiday season, and I think everyone around the table and on the phone is hopeful that we're going to have a very strong hardware season this year. We do have a lot of titles that we think are sort of go-to titles for people to engage with. Besides -- and also, you're obviously -- we're also working off of the results that we've had to date, which are very strong. So the momentum feels positive. We've got a great lineup in place. And it looks like it's going to be a pretty good holiday season from a consumer perspective, particularly in the gaming space.\nLainie Goldstein: And for the RCS, the main driver is the reduction in Zynga's business for the remainder of the year. So we forecasted some of our titles including a more muted expectation for the holiday based on the current trends. And we're also continuing to focus on profitability in hyper-casual, which is reducing our top line but enhancing our margins. And then there's also some shifts in the pipeline, including Star Wars: Hunters.\nDrew Crum: Helpful. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Omar Dessouky with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nOmar Dessouky: Hi. Thanks so much for taking the question. I just wanted to get a little bit of clarification on what you said about shifts in your pipeline causing your fiscal '25 guide to be not materially below $8 billion. Is that because of shifts in your very largest AAA games in the pipeline, your smaller AAA games in the pipeline or your mobile games? If you could provide some clarity on that, I'd appreciate it. Then I have a follow-up. Thanks.\nStrauss Zelnick: Yes. We haven't even issued initial guidance for the year. We do that in the spring of the New Year, and that's when we'll give a lot more specificity around the release schedule. However, I want to reiterate, we are going to be shy of $8 billion in fiscal '25, but not materially so.\nOmar Dessouky: Okay. Right. No problem. So then the other question is, obviously, super happy to see Sam Houser's message about Grand Theft Auto VI -- next Grand Theft Auto trailer coming soon. On September 26th, the SAG-AFTRA voted to approve strike authorization for video game performers covered under the Union's Interactive Media Agreement. Now they haven't actually strike yet, but there are negotiations. And I wanted to know whether if voice actors and motion capture actors were to go on strike, would it slow down the production of the next Grand Theft Auto at Rockstar. Does Rockstar have the type of employment contracts that would allow the workers, the actors to work through a strike?\nStrauss Zelnick: Negotiations are expected to resume next week. We're optimistic and value all of our talent greatly, and we value excellent labor relations and we're looking forward to reaching an agreement that serves everyone well. That's always been my approach. I've been involved with labor negotiations in every entertainment industry there is in my career. They've always worked out just fine. In the event that they don't work out just fine, now we are completely protected.\nOmar Dessouky: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Hickey with Benchmark. Please proceed.\nMike Hickey: Hey, Strauss, Karl, Lainie and Nicole. Great quarter guys. Thanks for taking my questions Two questions. The first one, Strauss, I'd be curious sort of your updated thoughts on AI here. It seems like the technology is -- at least the unlock here is accelerating in some of the use cases that we're seeing in terms of product and productivity seems very remarkable. So just curious what you're thinking there, if that's different or not? And then the second question, on the trailer in early December, curious what sort of impact you could think -- you think that might have on other Rockstar product catalog product. Obviously, it's already been strong. And I'm curious if that would be a catalyst boost for your catalog. And I'm curious on Grand Theft Auto Online, the sort of the strategic value of that live service given the vitality it has into the release of GTA next. Obviously, that's the set up you haven't experienced before. Thanks, guys\nStrauss Zelnick: Mike, look, we've been in the AI business since the dawn of this industry. Our entertainment properties are created largely in and by computers, and we value tools and we create those tools internally, and we license external tools as well, and the new developments in AI are really exciting. And I've said publicly and repeatedly that I believe that they'll help create efficiency and in certain instances, allow us to do things that we haven't been able to do before. But it's going to allow that for our competitors as well. So I think the tool sets that come out of these recent developments will be commoditized quickly. And the efficiencies that we see, others will see. Do I think that generative AI is going to make hit games? No. Do I think that the need for creative people will go away? Absolutely not. I think, if anything, better tool sets just raise the bar. They give us the opportunity to do more and do better. So the changes will be menial work probably is reduced or eliminated, high-level work is enhanced in importance. So I think you'll see shifts in what we can do with our games. So you mentioned product. I think you'll see some shifts in product, positive ones, I hope. And you mentioned productivity, and I think you will, for sure, see shifts in productivity, but I'm not sure those shifts will drop to the bottom line because typically, when we've generated productivity with tool sets, we've just set our sights higher. And that's our story. Our strategy is to be the most creative, the most innovative and the most efficient company in the business and AI, I think, probably ticks all three boxes. But don't expect the price tags to go down, just expect everything to get better and competition probably to become more intense for people who are not able to avail themselves of the resources that we can afford. With regard to the expected trailer that Sam Houser posted about today, we're as excited as anyone else. And do I think there will be an impact on our catalog revenue? Potentially. Things are already going really well in that space. And with regard to GTA Online, I mean, it's one amazing story that here we are 10 years later after the initial release and GTA Online is going strong. Why is it going strong? Because it's phenomenal and because Rockstar continues to supply content and updates and engage consumers and entertain them more effectively than, frankly, anyone else in the business. As long as we keep doing that, we'll be very well positioned, indeed.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Clay Griffin with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed.\nClay Griffin: Yes, thanks. Good morning. I couldn't help but notice that Nintendo announced a live action film, Zelda film. I know -- for Strauss, I know this question comes up all the time. I guess maybe we'll close it this way. What's your relative willingness and perhaps even Rockstar's willingness to partner and find ways to extend Red Dead Redemption IP, Grand Theft Auto IP, just because it has been so successful from a marriage perspective. Just wanted to get your updated thoughts on that.\nStrauss Zelnick: We've spoken about this many times. If we're willing to use the company's balance sheet to make a movie or a television show, then in the event of great success, we would benefit from it. But we're not prepared to use the company's balance sheet that way because the risk/reward profile is unappealing to us. They're very difficult businesses. I've been in them successfully. They're super challenging. They're not what we do. We'd much prefer the risk/reward profile of the business we're in. So that means that the only way we can be in that business is through a license arrangement with a third party. And let's put it in context. Mattel announced, they said that their profits -- expected profits from licensing the Barbie IP for a movie would be about $125 million. Now Barbie is a massive, massive hit and it's extraordinary hit. So you don't want to posit a massive hit and look at the numbers that way. Even in a really good news scenario, the license fees would be a fraction thereof for many of our properties, not really enough to be meaningful here. And we have to weigh that too against the risk of failure. And the hit ratios in the motion picture business are vastly lower than they are in the interactive entertainment business. Our hit ratios for console properties are in the 80% or 90%. The hit ratio for a well-run movie studio is around 30%, which is to say there's a 70% chance that the movie that we license could fail. And so in success, the number, in terms of the benefit to our bottom line, is it's not de minimis, it's not 0, but it's not really material to what we do around here. And in failure, we run the risk of compromising the underlying intellectual property. So it's a high bar. We have licensed 2 properties. We've licensed Borderlands to Lionsgate's picture coming. We've licensed BioShock. We're looking forward to that as well. And we have other titles in discussions, not anything ready to announce, but we're going to be very, very selective and very careful.\nClay Griffin: Makes sense. Thanks.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald with Wells Fargo.\nBrian Fitzgerald: We've been seeing more discussion of intrinsic in-game advertising, things like in-game billboards. And it seems like brand advertisers are getting more and more comfortable with in-game advertising. What are your thoughts on the broader opportunity there beyond mobile, beyond games within games, and maybe as well as your outlook for take this owned ad business and how that evolves? Thanks and Congrats on the quarter.\nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks. I mean you understand what we're already doing in mobile. So I don't think you want me to cover that. You alluded to that. With regard to console titles, we have advertising when it makes sense creatively and feels organic to the title. So for example, in NBA, if you go to a basketball game, you're going to see advertising in the arena. So it's perfectly reasonable to see the same kind of advertising in our game. But we're not going to do product placement where it's inappropriate, so that we can create a small amount of revenue. First of all, the numbers aren't huge. But secondly, anything that we do that takes a consumer out of the experience is problematic. So years ago, and I don't mean to take a potshot, but I'll do it anyhow. Years ago, there was a Bond movie, and James Bond, everyone knows he only drives an Aston Martin. He's only ever driven an Aston Martin. I don't know which iteration it was, but there was one iteration where they clearly made a deal with BMW and all the cars in the movie were BMW. And look, it ruined the movie for me. Because I -- to me, every time I saw BMW, I was like, wow, look, a little bit of product placement right there, a little bit of an advertisement. That's a disaster. So it's perfectly fine in basketball. It's perfectly fine in WWE. It's not perfectly fine in that title where advertising doesn't fit. As a result, I don't think you should expect that the numbers will be really material, although again, we do have an advertising business when it makes sense. That's completely separate, again, at the risk of being repetitive, from the mobile advertising business. That's a growth category for us. Our mobile advertising was up year-over-year. We feel really good about that.\nBrian Fitzgerald: Thanks, Strauss.\nStrauss Zelnick: I think those are all the questions we have. I just want to say thank you again for everyone joining us today. We're thrilled with the results, and the results are driven by the creativity and passion and commitment of our colleagues, all 12,500 of them all around the world. They work really hard every day, and we get to talk about it here. But the work is done at the studio level, at the label level, at the corporate level. This is a company of great commitment to our strategy of creativity, innovation and efficiency, and we have a culture of ambition, hard work, excellence, seeking and kindness. And I'm really proud of that. This is a really unusual place. If we pursue our strategy and we do it in a way that's consistent with our culture, we've seen over and over again to do well. We're proud of that, and we feel very optimistic about the future. Thanks so much for joining us today.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Karl Slatoff",
            "content": "Thanks, Strauss. I'd like to thank our teams for delivering another strong quarter and adding to the ongoing positive momentum of our business. I'll now turn to our recent and upcoming launches for fiscal 2024 and beyond. On October 3rd, Zynga Socialpoint Studio successfully launched Top Troops, a new mobile game that blends strategy, RPG and merge mechanics to create a thrilling medieval fantasy adventure of combat and conquest. This marked the studio's first worldwide launch under Zynga following our combination last year. The game has seen positive player reception with an average rating of 4.38 on Google Play and 4.5 on the Apple App Store. Engagement has also been fantastic with over 2 million hours played in over 70 million battles fought since its worldwide launch date. 2K and Gearbox Software expanded the audience of our beloved Borderland franchise with the October 6th release of Borderlands 3 Ultimate Edition for Nintendo Switch. The game now allows players to make the mayhem at home or on-the-go in a thrilling high-stakes adventure filed with genre-defining shooter-looter action. On October 20, 2K and Visual Concepts launched the WWE 2K23 Bad Bunny Edition across all platforms. Global phenomenon Bad Bunny is featured on the cover of the edition, which also includes a new playable version of this in-game character wearing the peril that he wore WWE Backlash 2023 live event. Zynga's Peak Games studio, the makers of Tune Blast and Toy Blast released Match Factory, a new puzzle game for mobile where players connect identical items, sort tiles and clear the board in a mesmerizing 3D environment. In soft launch, we observed strong engagement and modernization metrics as well as very positive player response as indicated by App Store review scores, which gives us optimism about the long-term potential for this new mobile title. Private Division has several exciting release as planned for this fiscal year. On November 28th, Roll7 will release their critically acclaimed and wildly imagined a third-person shooter skater, Rollerdrome for Xbox Series X and S and PC as well as Xbox Game Pass for both platforms. Also during the fourth quarter, Evening Star, founded by the industry veterans behind Sonic Mania will launch Penny's Big Breakaway, a kinetic Yo-Yo 3D-platformer for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, Nintendo Switch and PC. 2K and Visual Concepts are hard at work on WWE 2K24, the next installment of our popular Wrestling series, which will launch during the fourth quarter. Looking ahead, we continue to see great engagement and feedback from audiences enjoying Star Wars Hunters in soft launch across multiple territories. There are several exciting new elements that we are working hard to get into the game causing us to move the title's worldwide launch window to calendar 2024. Private Division is working with Weta Workshop on Tales of the Shire, a game set in the Middle Earth universe and inspired by the books of JRR Tolkien. The team recently released a teaser trailer showing fans a glimpse of the project, which is planned for release in calendar 2024 during our fiscal year 2025. Also, Zynga plans to globally launch Game of Thrones Legends, an all-new RPG puzzle oriented mobile title. In addition to our full game releases, our labels will continue to provide new content and experiences that drive engagement and recurrent consumer spending across many of our key offerings. Our hyper-casual studio plan to release a steady cadence of mobile titles for games that have the potential for enhanced retention rates and a mix of in-app purchases and advertising to drive higher monetization and profitability. Looking at the balance of this fiscal year and beyond, we are highly optimistic about what we believe to be the strongest and most exciting development pipeline in our company's history. I'll now turn the call over to Lainie. So this is Karl. The fact is we do value both, both can be very, very valuable. Obviously, owning the IP in any context and also in mobile, the margin potential is much higher because you own it full and outright. Obviously, with licensed IP you have to pay royalty. But the mobile market is tough to break new IP. It's tough to get attention. And it comes out -- you can't argue with the fact that having a known brand out there is a way for you to get attention. So it's a give and take. I would say our perspective hasn't changed. In a perfect world, we would focus exclusively on owned IP. But the truth is when we see a good license that we think would have -- we have a great idea for a game for and if Zynga folks want to take it to market, then that's something that we're going to continue to pursue. DTC. So speaking to the confidence of our holiday season. Look, simply, I think it's the strength of our catalog and the strength of our products and a lot of our releases are must-have releases. And any time you're heading into a holiday season, and I think everyone around the table and on the phone is hopeful that we're going to have a very strong hardware season this year. We do have a lot of titles that we think are sort of go-to titles for people to engage with. Besides -- and also, you're obviously -- we're also working off of the results that we've had to date, which are very strong. So the momentum feels positive. We've got a great lineup in place. And it looks like it's going to be a pretty good holiday season from a consumer perspective, particularly in the gaming space."

            "content": "Thanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll discuss the key highlights of our second quarter before reviewing our financial outlook for the full year and third quarter of fiscal 2024. Additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release. We delivered another great quarter, which demonstrates the enduring strength of our catalog, our ability to deliver deeply engaging post-launch content and our commitment to disciplined execution. At the same time, our teams continue to make excellent progress advancing our development pipeline, which gives us confidence in our multiyear growth trajectory. I'd like to thank our incredible teams worldwide for their hard work and passion for our business. Now moving onto our results. We achieved net bookings of $1.44 billion, which was at the high end of our guidance range. Our performance reflects better-than-expected results from Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online and Red Dead Redemption. During the quarter, we released NBA 2K24, Red Dead Redemption and Undead Nightmare for Switch and PlayStation 4. Borderlands Collection, Pandora's Box and PowerSlap. Recurrent consumer spending declined 7% for the period, which was in line with our outlook and accounted for 78% of net bookings. GAAP net revenue decreased 7% to $1.3 billion, while cost of revenue increased 24% to $884 million, driven by an impairment charge of $220 million and $190 million amortization of acquired intangibles. Operating expenses increased by 3% to $959 million and included $165 million of loan impairment, representing a partial impairment of one of our reporting units. On a management basis, operating expenses were flat year-over-year, which is favorable to our guidance. This was driven by lower marketing expenditures, some of which shifted to later this year. Turning to our guidance. I'll begin with our full fiscal year expectations. As Strauss mentioned, we are reiterating our net bookings outlook range of $5.45 billion to $5.55 billion. The largest contributors to net bookings are planned to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, our hyper-casual mobile portfolio, Empires & Puzzles, Toon Blast, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Words with Friends, Merge Dragon and Zynga Poker. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 49% Zynga, 31% 2K, 18% Rockstar Games and 2% other. And we forecast our geographic net booking split to be about 65% United States and 35% international. We are projecting the current consumer spending growth of 4% compared to fiscal 2023, which assumes an increase for NBA 2K as well as Zynga since we will own the business for a full 12 months this year. For Grand Theft Auto Online, Virtual Currency and GTA+ membership is expected to be flat. RCS is expected to represent 78% of net bookings. We plan to generate approximately $100 million in non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow and to deploy approximately $150 million for capital expenditures, primarily to support our office build-outs and larger footprint. We continue to forecast GAAP net revenue to range from $5.37 billion to $5.47 billion. Our total operating expenses are now planned to range from $3.53 billion to $3.55 billion as compared to $3.45 billion last year. On a management basis, we continue to expect operating expense growth of approximately 14% year-over-year due to a full year of Zynga, an increase in personnel and marketing expenses and higher depreciation of office build-outs and capitalized IT expenses, which are being partially offset by the realization of synergies from our combination with Zynga and savings from our cost reduction program. We remain vigilant in our efforts to optimize our cost structure and reduce discretionary costs where possible, while still investing for growth. Now moving on to our guidance for the fiscal third quarter. We project net bookings to range from $1.3 billion to $1.35 billion compared to $1.4 billion in the third quarter last year. Our release date for the quarter includes two mobile titles Top Troops and Match Factory as well as Borderlands 3 Ultimate Edition, all of which have been released. The largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, our hyper-casual mobile portfolio, Empires & Puzzles, Toon blast, Red Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Words with Friends, Merge Dragons and Zynga Poker. We project the current consumer spending to decrease by approximately 5%, which assumes a modest decline in our mobile business, which is being partially offset by expected growth in NBA 2K. The Grand Theft Auto Online, virtual currency and GTA+ membership is expected to be up. We project GAAP net revenue to range from $1.29 billion to $1.34 billion. Operating expenses are planned to range from $826 million to $836 million. On a management basis, operating expenses are expected to grow by approximately 7% year-over-year driven by higher personnel and depreciation expenses, which are being partially offset by the Zynga synergies and our cost savings initiatives. In closing, there are many exciting upcoming catalysts that we believe will enable our company to achieve new record levels of financial performance. Powered by our incredible talent, we believe that our projects in development will set new standards for creativity and engagement in our industry while also significantly enhancing our financial profile. We'd like to thank all our stakeholders for being on this journey with us, and we can't wait to share more details with you. Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Strauss. Due to shifts in our pipeline, our expectations are that net bookings will now be below $8 billion, but not necessarily. So it really isn't a big change, and we expect growth in 2016 as well. Yes. There is -- in the gap there is some deferral of some of the advertising. So that's the difference between us being up in the quarter versus the gap showing flat. So we recorded an impairment charge of $220 million related to intangible assets and $165 million of goodwill representing a partial impairment of one of our reporting units. And this is as a result of an updated long-term projection for that reporting unit, but we're not giving any more details other than that. And for the RCS, the main driver is the reduction in Zynga's business for the remainder of the year. So we forecasted some of our titles including a more muted expectation for the holiday based on the current trends. And we're also continuing to focus on profitability in hyper-casual, which is reducing our top line but enhancing our margins. And then there's also some shifts in the pipeline, including Star Wars: Hunters."

            "name": "Strauss Zelnick",
            "content": "Thanks, Nicole. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. We delivered another consecutive quarter of excellent results highlighted by net bookings of $1.44 billion, which was at the high end of our guidance and management results that exceeded our plans. While we expect continued macroeconomic uncertainty, we believe that we're well positioned for the holiday season and are reiterating our fiscal 2024 net bookings guidance of $5.45 billion to $5.55 billion. Looking ahead, I'm exceedingly optimistic about our company's multiyear growth trajectory and our ability to deliver long-term value to our shareholders. Our development pipeline is robust and diverse and we're getting closer to delivering the groundbreaking titles that our audiences throughout the world have been anticipating eagerly. Our unwavering commitment to being the most creative, the most innovative, and the most efficient entertainment company gives us great confidence that our offerings will surpass our players' expectations and set new standards of creative excellence in our industry. Now turning to the performance of our titles during the quarter. Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online continue to surpass our expectations, an outstanding achievement for two titles celebrating their tenth anniversaries. To-date, Grand Theft Auto V is sold in approximately 190 million units. Grand Theft Auto Online experienced continued momentum due to the rollout of new gameplay and items from the San Andreas Mercenaries update with new seasonal events, vehicles, modes, clothes and weapons driving sustained engagement and net bookings. Our GTA+ membership program continued to grow and we're deepening our relationships with our player communities through new offerings, which now include access to a rotating assortment of classic Rockstar Games titles. During the quarter, Rockstar Games announced that CitizenFX, the team behind the FiveM and RedM role-playing communities for Grand Theft Auto V and Red Dead Redemption 2, officially joined the label. With their immense passion and creativity, CitizenFX has been pivotal in expanding the possibilities of user-generated content around Rockstar's leading titles. We're excited to see them continue to build these creative communities and help them thrive into the future. We're also thrilled by today's announcement from Rockstar Games founder Sam Houser that the eagerly anticipated first trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto will be revealed this coming December. As the label approaches its 25th anniversary next month we congratulate Rockstar Games on their constant innovation in the pursuit of the highest quality interactive entertainment. Red Dead Redemption 2 surpassed our plans and has sold in more than 57 million units to date. Rockstar Games continues to support Red Dead Online with new content including bonuses for the naturalist and bounty hunters, and new free roam missions and events. In addition, Rockstar Games expanded the audience for the franchise with the launch of Red Dead Redemption and Undead Nightmare for PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch. On September 8th, 2K and Visual Concepts once again redefined the number one NBA simulation experience in our industry with the successful worldwide launch of NBA 2K24. With exciting new features and next generation enhancements, the title is off to a great start and to date has sold in over 4.5 million units. NBA 2K24 features new season pass options that provide players with the opportunity to earn even more rewards as well as a new seasonal progression that tracks and combines my career and my team into one linear reward system. Engagement has been phenomenal with season pass and virtual currency bookings exceeding our plans and driving double growth in ARPU compared to NBA 2K23. Our franchise extensions continue to perform extremely well including NBA 2K Mobile, NBA 2K Online in China, and the recently launched NBA 2K24 Arcade Edition on Apple Arcade. I'd like to thank 2K and Visual Concepts for continuing to bring innovation and creativity consistently to our beloved franchise. 2K continues to support LEGO 2K Drive with its second drive pass season and the Creators Hub and PGA Tour 2K23 with additional pros and gear. In addition, the label harness the power of our industry leading catalog with the launch of the Borderlands Collection Pandora's Box, which bundles together all six acclaimed Borderlands Games and their previously released add-on content into a single offering at an amazing value. We have great respect for the team at Gearbox, and we value deeply our long-term relationship. Zynga once again delivered solid results during the quarter and we remain pleased with its ongoing performance. We continue to benefit from Zynga's ability to create engaging new games, which is a distinguishing capability of our mobile business. For example, Rollic successfully launched PowerSlap, based on the world's first regulated and sanctioned slap fighting promotion. The title is highly entertaining and to date has experienced more than 1 billion slaps across training and matches. With the launch of this new mobile game, Rollic has now had 22 titles reach the number one or two spot in the US Apple app store. We'd like to thank the entire team over at TKO including Ari Emanuel and Dana White for their strong partnership as well as our colleagues at Rollic created this title from inception to release in just eight weeks. Zynga also recently launched Top Troops and Match Factory, both of which delivered excellent KPIs and soft launch and appear to have strong long-term potential for our portfolio. And Star Wars Hunters continues to hit important milestones as we approach its planned release date in calendar 2024. Karl will discuss these titles in greater detail. Other highlights from our mobile business this quarter include our advertising bookings grew year-over-year driven by the addition of Popcore, contributions from strategic partnerships and our efforts to increase adamant inventory in many live games. We continue to make excellent progress in our profitability initiatives, including expanding the number of mobile games to leverage our direct-to-consumer platform. As we convert additional players, we're gaining new insights that we believe will better serve our players' preferences. We remain optimistic that over the next few years, most of our mobile games will leverage this highly accretive owned distribution channel. In addition, we continue to enhance the profitability and performance of our hypercasual business with multiple new games scaling rapidly and several games generating revenue from in-app purchases in addition to ads. Our live games portfolio also continued to deliver. Social Casino maintained steady performance coming off a great first quarter driven by new bold beat features which drove strong results, particularly in Zynga Poker. Additionally, we implemented new updates and events across many games, including Top Eleven and Dragon City, which drove audience growth as well as increased engagement in core systems, leading to better retention and monetization. We stand at an exciting time in our company's history with numerous growth opportunities ahead of us. As we deliver on our strategic priorities, we have the potential to create unparalleled entertainment experiences, engage broader audiences throughout the world and ultimately enhance our scale and margin profile. I'd like to thank all of you for your continued support, and we look forward to delivering our next phase of growth. I'll now turn the call over to Karl. Thanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for enabling us to achieve our goals and to deliver another strong quarter. To our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued support. We'll now take your questions. Operator? We're really excited about it. I mean, to be clear, this is a small economic opportunity right now and a small cost to us. We want to be where the consumer is and what's going on in role playing and really in two ways. Number one, the people are actually playing in old playing servers and number two, the people are watching what they're doing on Twitch. Both are really interesting. The actual people playing is a relatively modest audience. It's in the hundreds of thousands. But the people watching, that's a huge audience. And we're interested in first of all making sure that our intellectual property is protected. We're also really interested in meeting the consumer where the consumer is. And for certain consumers bonding is a really important activity. And finally, people are consuming our intellectual property, we would like to monetize it if we can. We think this gives us an opportunity to do all of the above. We don't see materially different behavior. We think it's a great addition. We're thrilled to engage with our consumers in this way. And it's a learning experience, but it's also gratifying that GTA+ continues to grow and be more and more relevant to more and more consumers. That's the kind of detail that we typically leave to our labels. So we probably don't have much more to add today except what I said earlier which is we are thrilled that Rockstar is offering a subscription to avid consumers, and we think it bodes really well for the future. Yes. I mean you don't want to generalize to our business too much from what's going on in linear entertainment because the increase in subscription pricing and linear entertainment is really a reflection of the fact that too many streaming services were underpricing to acquire customers and then they realize those customers were not durable and the LTVs were upside down. So they were basically adjusting their pricing to make sure that the LTVs are potentially positive. And I think there's still more pain to come for some of those services, and I can wax eloquent if you want, although it has nothing to do with our business. In terms of pricing for any entertainment property, basically the algorithm is the value of the expected entertainment usage, which is to say that the per hour value times the number of expected hours plus the terminal value that's perceived by the customer in ownership if the title is actually owned, not say, rented or subscribed to. And you'll see that, that bears out in every kind of entertainment vehicle. By that standard, our frontline prices are still very, very low because we offer many hours of engagement. The value of the engagement is very high. So I think the industry, as a whole, offers a terrific price-to-value opportunity for consumers. That doesn't necessarily mean that the industry has pricing power or wants to have pricing power. However, there is a great deal of value offered. And look, it's our strategy here to deliver much more value than what we charge consumers. It's always been our strategy here. We want to make sure the experience is first class, and the nature of the experience is not just the quality of what we offer, it's also what you pay for it, everyone knows that anecdotally. So that's how we look at it. There have been precious few price increases in the business. The price increase, for example, the $70 for certain frontline products was the first price increase in many years after many generations. So again, I think we offer a terrific value to consumers. On the second question? Regarding the direct-to-consumer platform, we think there continues to be a great deal of upside there, again, for consumers and also for our margins. It's still a relatively small part of our business. There's a great opportunity for growth. To be clear, we will always work with third-party retailers. We want to be where the consumer is. We value our third-party retailer relationships, they do provide marketing support. That's important to us. There are times when consumers want to have a direct relationship. We can do both. We can do all of the above. It is not our strategy to bring everything in-house. Yes. We haven't even issued initial guidance for the year. We do that in the spring of the New Year, and that's when we'll give a lot more specificity around the release schedule. However, I want to reiterate, we are going to be shy of $8 billion in fiscal '25, but not materially so. Negotiations are expected to resume next week. We're optimistic and value all of our talent greatly, and we value excellent labor relations and we're looking forward to reaching an agreement that serves everyone well. That's always been my approach. I've been involved with labor negotiations in every entertainment industry there is in my career. They've always worked out just fine. In the event that they don't work out just fine, now we are completely protected. Mike, look, we've been in the AI business since the dawn of this industry. Our entertainment properties are created largely in and by computers, and we value tools and we create those tools internally, and we license external tools as well, and the new developments in AI are really exciting. And I've said publicly and repeatedly that I believe that they'll help create efficiency and in certain instances, allow us to do things that we haven't been able to do before. But it's going to allow that for our competitors as well. So I think the tool sets that come out of these recent developments will be commoditized quickly. And the efficiencies that we see, others will see. Do I think that generative AI is going to make hit games? No. Do I think that the need for creative people will go away? Absolutely not. I think, if anything, better tool sets just raise the bar. They give us the opportunity to do more and do better. So the changes will be menial work probably is reduced or eliminated, high-level work is enhanced in importance. So I think you'll see shifts in what we can do with our games. So you mentioned product. I think you'll see some shifts in product, positive ones, I hope. And you mentioned productivity, and I think you will, for sure, see shifts in productivity, but I'm not sure those shifts will drop to the bottom line because typically, when we've generated productivity with tool sets, we've just set our sights higher. And that's our story. Our strategy is to be the most creative, the most innovative and the most efficient company in the business and AI, I think, probably ticks all three boxes. But don't expect the price tags to go down, just expect everything to get better and competition probably to become more intense for people who are not able to avail themselves of the resources that we can afford. With regard to the expected trailer that Sam Houser posted about today, we're as excited as anyone else. And do I think there will be an impact on our catalog revenue? Potentially. Things are already going really well in that space. And with regard to GTA Online, I mean, it's one amazing story that here we are 10 years later after the initial release and GTA Online is going strong. Why is it going strong? Because it's phenomenal and because Rockstar continues to supply content and updates and engage consumers and entertain them more effectively than, frankly, anyone else in the business. As long as we keep doing that, we'll be very well positioned, indeed. We've spoken about this many times. If we're willing to use the company's balance sheet to make a movie or a television show, then in the event of great success, we would benefit from it. But we're not prepared to use the company's balance sheet that way because the risk/reward profile is unappealing to us. They're very difficult businesses. I've been in them successfully. They're super challenging. They're not what we do. We'd much prefer the risk/reward profile of the business we're in. So that means that the only way we can be in that business is through a license arrangement with a third party. And let's put it in context. Mattel announced, they said that their profits -- expected profits from licensing the Barbie IP for a movie would be about $125 million. Now Barbie is a massive, massive hit and it's extraordinary hit. So you don't want to posit a massive hit and look at the numbers that way. Even in a really good news scenario, the license fees would be a fraction thereof for many of our properties, not really enough to be meaningful here. And we have to weigh that too against the risk of failure. And the hit ratios in the motion picture business are vastly lower than they are in the interactive entertainment business. Our hit ratios for console properties are in the 80% or 90%. The hit ratio for a well-run movie studio is around 30%, which is to say there's a 70% chance that the movie that we license could fail. And so in success, the number, in terms of the benefit to our bottom line, is it's not de minimis, it's not 0, but it's not really material to what we do around here. And in failure, we run the risk of compromising the underlying intellectual property. So it's a high bar. We have licensed 2 properties. We've licensed Borderlands to Lionsgate's picture coming. We've licensed BioShock. We're looking forward to that as well. And we have other titles in discussions, not anything ready to announce, but we're going to be very, very selective and very careful. Thanks. I mean you understand what we're already doing in mobile. So I don't think you want me to cover that. You alluded to that. With regard to console titles, we have advertising when it makes sense creatively and feels organic to the title. So for example, in NBA, if you go to a basketball game, you're going to see advertising in the arena. So it's perfectly reasonable to see the same kind of advertising in our game. But we're not going to do product placement where it's inappropriate, so that we can create a small amount of revenue. First of all, the numbers aren't huge. But secondly, anything that we do that takes a consumer out of the experience is problematic. So years ago, and I don't mean to take a potshot, but I'll do it anyhow. Years ago, there was a Bond movie, and James Bond, everyone knows he only drives an Aston Martin. He's only ever driven an Aston Martin. I don't know which iteration it was, but there was one iteration where they clearly made a deal with BMW and all the cars in the movie were BMW. And look, it ruined the movie for me. Because I -- to me, every time I saw BMW, I was like, wow, look, a little bit of product placement right there, a little bit of an advertisement. That's a disaster. So it's perfectly fine in basketball. It's perfectly fine in WWE. It's not perfectly fine in that title where advertising doesn't fit. As a result, I don't think you should expect that the numbers will be really material, although again, we do have an advertising business when it makes sense. That's completely separate, again, at the risk of being repetitive, from the mobile advertising business. That's a growth category for us. Our mobile advertising was up year-over-year. We feel really good about that. I think those are all the questions we have. I just want to say thank you again for everyone joining us today. We're thrilled with the results, and the results are driven by the creativity and passion and commitment of our colleagues, all 12,500 of them all around the world. They work really hard every day, and we get to talk about it here. But the work is done at the studio level, at the label level, at the corporate level. This is a company of great commitment to our strategy of creativity, innovation and efficiency, and we have a culture of ambition, hard work, excellence, seeking and kindness. And I'm really proud of that. This is a really unusual place. If we pursue our strategy and we do it in a way that's consistent with our culture, we've seen over and over again to do well. We're proud of that, and we feel very optimistic about the future. Thanks so much for joining us today."

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that fiscal 2024 is off to a strong start, highlighted by first quarter net bookings of $1.2 billion, which was at the high end of our expectations, and management results were in line with our plans. Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, and NBA 2K23 exceeded our projections, which illustrates the long-lasting benefits of producing the highest quality offerings and amassing one of the strongest and most diverse portfolios in entertainment. In keeping with our core values of creativity, innovation, and efficiency, this quarter, we introduced new intellectual properties, advanced the development of our eagerly anticipated pipeline, and maintained our vigilance with cost management initiatives across our organization. Turning to the results from our titles for the period. Grand Theft Auto V continued to outperform and to date, the title has sold-in more than 185 million units. On June 13, Rockstar Games launched San Andreas Mercenaries for Grand Theft Auto Online, which offers six new major story-based missions, as well as new Los Santos operations, Hangar upgrades, Smuggler Source and Sell Missions, seven new vehicles, and more. The update also includes a range of fan-requested experience improvements, as well as the Career Progress feature, offering players a new way to track their progression across criminal careers and claim rewards. San Andreas Mercenaries continues to deliver high value content post-launch using a phased approach that is driving sustained engagement and Recurrent Consumer Spending. This June, Grand Theft Auto Online recorded more players than any other June in its history outside of the height of the pandemic. GTA+, Rockstar\u2019s premium membership service for GTA Online on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S, offered exclusive options for members to test drive and purchase an array of vehicles, and we are continuing to see strong growth in GTA+ adoption with each passing quarter. We were pleased with the performance of Red Dead Redemption 2, which has sold-in more than 55 million units to-date. Rockstar Games continues to support Red Dead Online with new bonuses and rewards, including free apparel inspired by the RedDeadFashion subreddit, and seasonal content such as April\u2019s Condor Egg Freemode Event. NBA 2K23 exceeded our plans and the title has now sold-in over 13 million units, representing a 11% year-over-year growth, driven by higher demand, especially on Gen-9 consoles, as well as a more tailored promotional cadence. This incredible performance marks the title\u2019s second-highest sell-through ever -- with only NBA 2K20 achieving higher unit sales. Engagement with NBA 2K23 remains strong, with approximately 2.6 million Daily Active Users delivering Recurrent Consumer Spending that exceeded our expectations. Our franchise extensions with the NBA continue to perform extremely well and NBA 2K23 Arcade Edition remains one of the top games on Apple Arcade. WWE 2K23, which is the highest-rated game in our wrestling franchise\u2019s history and the second highest-rated sports simulation title of the year, experienced strong engagement throughout the quarter, with players logging nearly 22 million hours of gameplay and facing off in 170 million matches. 2K and Visual Concepts continue to support the title with a series of 5 DLC packs that can be purchased individually or as part of a Season Pass. 2K also continues to support PGA TOUR 2K23 with additional pros, courses, and Clubhouse Passes. In May, 2K and Visual Concepts launched LEGO 2K Drive, the first game in a multi-title partnership between 2K and the LEGO Group. Following the launch, our teams released the first of four Drive Pass Seasons for the title, which features 100 levels and new content inspired by the Fast and the Furious Saga. Also in May, Private Division and Piccolo Studio launched After Us on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, and PC, which has been praised by critics for its striking visuals and game world. Zynga had a solid start to the year, performing in-line with our plans, and we are pleased with the ongoing progress of our mobile business. Ad revenue grew approximately 11% year-over-year, driven by the addition of Popcore and our ability to open new inventory supplies in our portfolio. Toon Blast has been introducing strong feature releases such as the Toon Race event, which drove outperformance versus our forecasts and helped the game recently surpass $2 billion in lifetime gross bookings. We made excellent progress on our profitability initiatives in mobile. We expanded our offerings on our direct-to-consumer platforms and continue to believe that, over the next few years, the majority of our mobile games will leverage our highly-profitable, proprietary distribution channel. We continue to enhance the performance and profitability of our hyper-casual business, with multiple new games scaling quickly and several titles generating bookings from in-app purchases in addition to ads. A few key highlights of Zynga\u2019s live services during the period include: Empires & Puzzles grew quarter-over-quarter, driven by the new Path of Giants battle pass featuring daily and weekly challenges to unlock rewards. Rollic\u2019s Twisted Tangle reached the number one Free Game spot on the U.S. Google Play store. Social Casino again delivered strong results, driven by Hit It Rich's best quarter in two years, and Game of Thrones Casino\u2019s second best quarter in its history. Casual games continued to improve participation and engagement, with Words With Friends launching the new Club Daily Puzzle and Harry Potter: Puzzles & Spells adding Bonus Levels and Special Delivery prize events. With numerous games in development and soft launch across Zynga\u2019s studios, we are excited to start delivering several new offerings in the coming months. Turning to our outlook, we are reiterating our prior guidance of $5.45 to $5.55 billion in net bookings for fiscal 2024. We remain highly optimistic about our future and our ability to deliver record results in the coming years. Lainie will provide more details on our outlook shortly. In closing, as we continue to execute our strategy, we believe that we can increase significantly our scale and prominence within the industry, grow margins, and pursue the vast opportunities to engage even larger audiences around the world. Led by the passion, creativity, and innovation of our world-class development teams, Take-Two is in a powerful position to set new benchmarks for our player communities, which we believe will drive long-term returns for our shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Karl.\nKarl Slatoff: Thanks, Strauss. I\u2019d like to thank our teams for a strong start to the year. Turning to our announced launches for fiscal 2024. Yesterday, Rockstar Games announced that the beloved Western experiences, Red Dead Redemption and Undead Nightmare would be coming to the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 for the first time in a new single package, arriving August 17. In a new conversion by Double Eleven Studios, the Switch and PS4 versions bring the two classic experiences together again for new players and original fans to enjoy across modern consoles, including backwards compatibility with the PlayStation 5. On September 8, 2K and Visual Concepts will celebrate the 25th anniversary of our industry defining NBA 2K series and once again redefine basketball simulations with the launch of NBA 2K24, featuring the iconic Kobe Bryant as the game\u2019s cover athlete for the second time in the history of the franchise. Players will be able to celebrate Bryant\u2019s legacy and replicate his skills in the brand-new Mamba Moments mode. Players in the U.S. and Canada can also purchase the WNBA Edition of the game exclusively at GameStop, featuring WNBA All-Star Sabrina Ionescu, as this year\u2019s cover star. NBA 2K24 will introduce cross-play, a community requested feature for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S. Available in every multiplayer mode, players will be able to compete with or against others from around the world in dynamic co-op matches, thrilling online tournaments, or casual pick-up games between new generation consoles. The title will also introduce ProPLAY, a groundbreaking new technology that directly translates actual NBA footage into gameplay. 2K will have more to share on NBA 2K24 in the coming weeks. In addition, 2K and Visual Concepts remain hard at work on WWE 2K24, the next installment of our popular wrestling series, which set new creative and critical benchmarks with last year\u2019s highly successful release. In June, Private Division and Evening Star announced Penny\u2019s Big Breakaway, a new 3D action platformer from the team behind Sonic Mania. This kinetic yo-yo adventure is expected to launch in early 2024. Zynga\u2019s Star Wars: Hunters, which offers players the opportunity to join the greatest hunters from across the Star Wars galaxy is expected to launch later this fiscal year. Players will engage in thrilling third-person combat in a range of competitive game modes across battlegrounds from the iconic worlds of Star Wars. Also in mobile, Social point\u2019s latest game, Top Troops, a medieval fantasy-themed title in the PvP merge genre is progressing well in soft launch and is expected to launch worldwide this fiscal year. In addition, our hyper-casual studios will release a steady cadence of mobile titles throughout the year, focusing on games that have the potential for enhanced retention rates and a mix of in-app purchases and advertising to drive higher monetization and profitability. Our labels will also continue to provide new content and experiences that drive engagement and recurrent consumer spending across many of our offerings, including Grand Theft Auto Online, Red Dead Online, WWE 2K, LEGO 2K Drive, PGA TOUR 2K, Kerbal Space Program 2, and Zynga\u2019s mobile portfolio. Throughout fiscal year 2024, we look forward to launching additional releases from what we believe to be the strongest and most exciting development pipeline in our company\u2019s history. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Lainie.\nLainie Goldstein: Thanks Karl and good afternoon everyone. Today, I\u2019ll discuss the key highlights from our first quarter before reviewing our financial outlook for the full year and second quarter of fiscal 2024. Our combination with Zynga closed on May 23, 2022, which affects the comparability of our results relative to last year. Additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release. We had a strong start to the fiscal year, powered by our portfolio of iconic, industry-leading intellectual properties. As we approach our next phase of growth, our teams continue to make excellent progress advancing our development pipeline and capitalizing on our revenue-driven opportunities and synergies. We also partnered together to maintain our focus on efficiency amidst the challenging macroeconomic backdrop and cautious consumer spending trends. I\u2019d like to thank our incredible teams worldwide for their determination and passion for our business. Now, moving onto our results. We achieved net bookings of $1.2 billion, which was at the high end of our guidance range. In the current backdrop, many consumers are purchasing established franchises and those that offer great value, and our catalog stands at the intersection of these two trends. Accordingly, our performance reflects better-than-expected results from Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, and NBA 2K23. During the quarter, we launched Marvel\u2019s Midnight Suns for Gen 8 consoles, Lego 2K Drive, and After Us. Recurrent consumer spending rose 38% for the period, which was above our outlook of 35% growth, and accounted for 84% of net bookings. The outperformance was primarily driven by Grand Theft Auto Online and NBA 2K23. GAAP net revenue increased 17% to $1.28 billion and cost of revenue increased 39% to $606 million, driven by $187 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. We also recorded an impairment charge of $18 million, related primarily to capitalized software and development costs for an unreleased title, which affected our management results compared to our guidance. Operating expenses increased by 25% to $883 million. On a management basis, operating expenses grew by 46%, which primarily reflected a full quarter of Zynga, higher personnel costs, and depreciation related to office buildouts and capitalized IT expenses. Turning to our guidance, I\u2019ll begin with our full fiscal year expectations. As Strauss mentioned, our business is performing well, and we are reiterating our net bookings outlook range of $5.45 billion to $5.55 billion. Largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, our hyper-casual mobile portfolio, Empires & Puzzles, Toon Blast, Merge Dragons, Words With Friends, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, and Zynga Poker. We expect the Net Bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 51% Zynga, 30% 2K, 17% Rockstar Games, and 2% Other. And, we forecast our geographic net bookings split to be about 65% United States and 35% International. We continue to forecast recurrent consumer spending growth of 5% compared to fiscal 2023, representing 78% of net bookings. Mobile trends are projected to remain stable, with Zynga\u2019s ad business continuing to deliver growth. We expect to generate approximately $100 million in non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow, and deploy approximately $180 million for capital expenditures, primarily to support our office buildouts and larger footprint. We continue to expect GAAP net revenue to range from $5.37 billion to $5.47 billion. Our total operating expenses are expected to range from $3.38 billion to $3.4 billion as compared to $3.45 billion last year. On a management basis, our operating expenses are expected to grow by approximately 15% year-over-year, due primarily to a full year of Zynga, an increase in personnel and marketing expenses, and higher depreciation of office buildouts and capitalized IT expenses, which are being partially offset by the realization of synergies from our combination with Zynga and savings from our cost reduction program. As we announced previously, our teams are taking extensive measures to review our cost structure and reduce discretionary costs whenever possible to offset the current consumer backdrop and inflationary environment, while still investing for growth. Now moving onto our guidance for the fiscal second quarter. We project Net Bookings to range from $1.4 billion to $1.45 billion, compared to $1.5 billion in the second quarter last year. Our release slate for the quarter includes Red Dead Redemption and Undead Nightmare for Switch and PlayStation 4, and NBA 2K24. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, our hyper-casual mobile portfolio, Empires & Puzzles, Toon Blast, Words With Friends, Merge Dragons, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, and Zynga Poker. We project recurrent consumer spending to decline by approximately 7%, which assumes modest declines in our mobile business; NBA 2K, driven by changes to its summer promotional cadence; and Grand Theft Auto Online; as well as a reduction in DLC revenue from several titles that were released in prior years. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $1.26 billion to $1.31 billion. Operating expenses are expected to range from $811 million to $821 million. On a management basis, operating expenses are expected to grow by approximately 5% year-over-year, driven by last year\u2019s acquisition of Popcore and higher personnel costs, which are being partly offset by the Zynga synergies and our cost savings initiatives. In closing, we are confident that the actions our teams are taking this year are preparing us for a strong trajectory of growth. Through our collective efforts, we continue to believe that we are positioning our business for a significant inflection point in fiscal 2025 that will culminate in us delivering new record levels of operating performance next year and beyond. We thank all of our stakeholders for their continued support, and we look forward to delivering on this exciting next chapter. Thank you. I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Strauss.\nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for delivering a strong start to the fiscal year. And to our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued support. We'll now take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Andrew Uerkwitz with Jefferies. Please proceed.\nAndrew Uerkwitz: Yeah. I just have -- I just had one question. Lainie called out consumer weakness kind of continuing. Could you just give an update on where you think the consumer is at. Is there a particular segment that's weaker than others? Just kind of an update on where you think the consumers are today. Thank you.\nStrauss Zelnick: Yeah. I mean I love that people are debating whether we're going to be in a recession from the point of view of a digital entertainment company, we've been in a recession for the better part of 18 months. The market for interactive entertainment was down meaningfully in 2022, down for the first time in the history of the mobile business over 10%, pretty much across the board. Things are looking a lot better. The year-over-year comps have stabilized. We're seeing growth in the console market. It's early, but we are seeing some growth. Mobile sort of flat, slightly down. We hope that will improve. I do feel like we're all seeing some green shoots across the economy. But it definitely is a mixed picture depending on the U.S. So in the context of the entertainment business, live entertainment is doing great. But in the context of entertainment that people consumed at home during the pandemic, it's been challenging for a while. And again, I think it's beginning to normalize, but it's early days yet. When asked a couple of calls ago what I thought would happen in the economy, I said that I thought it would bottom out in June, July. And that by the end of calendar '23, we begin to see some good news and then we'd be in reasonably good position from an economic point of view in early '24, and I continue to believe that that's what will happen.\nAndrew Uerkwitz: Got it. And then just one quick follow-up on that with -- around media, I guess, if Hollywood stays in a recession, is that a positive, negative or does it not matter for video games?\nStrauss Zelnick: Look, we live within the entertainment ecosystem. So we would never wish for any other industry to have a problem. But if the strike means that new content can't be delivered, then I suppose it could be some small positive benefit for our business. But we aren't counting on that. We're certainly not hoping for it.\nAndrew Uerkwitz: Got it. Thank you so much guys. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question is from Eric Handler with ROTH MKM. Please proceed.\nEric Handler: Good afternoon and thank you for the question. Strauss, I wonder if you could just talk about with mobile advertising how much -- how many of your games beyond the hyper casual business have integrated advertising now?\nStrauss Zelnick: Some, and we are moving in that direction selectively. Look, historically, for games where you could make in app purchases, less than 10% of the audience actually spent. So we are fielding a game for 100% of the audience and monetizing 10% or so, perhaps a bit more often a bit less. And it's our view that we ought to be monetizing 100% of the audience. So if someone's going to spend, that's great. And if they're not going to spend, then we ought to be able to monetize through advertising. The question is how do you do that and create a high-quality experience. And I think the answer is we can do that. We can distinguish among those audiences. We're not there yet, but I think we're moving in that direction.\nEric Handler: Thanks. And just as a follow-up, I wondered if you could -- willing to give any specifics about how much of the mobile revenue at this point is on the DTC platform and how that's progressing?\nStrauss Zelnick: So we don\u2019t actually give out that percentage. Some of our competitors do. And so one of our biggest competitors, I think, has gone on the record to say it\u2019s about 25% and I think that\u2019s a good number. We\u2019re not remotely in that vicinity. There\u2019s plenty of room for growth. I would note that Zynga\u2019s advertising net bookings were up 11% year-over-year. So it\u2019s really good news. And we\u2019re really happy about the growth of our direct-to-consumer platform and what that can mean for consumers and also for us.\nEric Handler: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Matthew Thornton with Truist Securities. Please proceed.\nMatthew Thornton: Hey. Good afternoon, Strauss, Karl, Lainie. Two quick ones for me. Last quarter, we talked about obviously achieving north of $8 billion in bookings next year and north of $1 billion in operating cash flow. I'm just kind of curious if those are still the right boggies for next year. And then just secondly -- and I apologize if I missed this. Any changes to this year? Is it slate? I saw we've got the $18 million impairment charge here. But I guess relative to where we were three months ago, is there any change to this year's release slate. Thanks so much.\nStrauss Zelnick: So the answer to question one is, yes, and Lainie will answer question two.\nLainie Goldstein: Sure. So for question two, there has been some movements within the back part of the year within the slate, but we\u2019re still able to achieve the same guidance for the year, so reiterating our guidance. So just some small changes within the slate, but it has nothing to do with the impairment charge. So the year is still the same.\nMatthew Thornton: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Matthew Cost with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nMatthew Cost: Hi, everybody. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe I'll start just by asking about mobile M&A. I mean that was historically a very big part of Zynga's business. It seems like the market may be starting to fall out there in terms of deal activity after the three for the past year or two. I guess do you see an opportunity to lean back into M&A at the Zynga business number one. And then number two is just, Lainie, you mentioned in the prepared remarks that some changes to the promotional cadence for NBA 2K. I was wondering if you could just give a little more detail about what those changes are and the size of the financial impact? Thank you.\nStrauss Zelnick: So on the deal side, it's hard to know. In terms of our strategy, we think we're in a position to grow organically. We have a lot of new releases coming from Zynga. We're really excited about them. As you know, hit ratios are very low in the mobile business. So we're not claiming success until it occurs. But we do feel really good about some new launches. And in terms of the promotional cadences.\nLainie Goldstein: So on NBA 2K 24, we expect to be up from 2K23 -- but 2K23 versus 2K22, there is some less promotional timing in this quarter versus what we did with 22 last year. So that's why we expect the title to be a little bit down versus last year.\nMatthew Cost: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Doug Creutz with TD Cowen. Please proceed.\nDouglas Creutz: Hey. Thanks. You alluded to this a little bit earlier, you and others have talked about how difficult it is to launch a new mobile title these days. We did see, however, a few months ago, competitive of yours launched scope we launched MONOPOLY GO, which is shot to number one in the App Store charts rapidly, has had a lot of success. As you have observed that, is there anything that you would sort of any lessons you would draw from their success that you think could -- you could apply to your own games that you have coming out soon?\nStrauss Zelnick: Look, I think it's an established intellectual property that's been known and beloved for a very long time. And if you combine that with a high-quality expression, I think you can do very well. We don't -- we obviously don't know what they're spending to be in the position that they're in. I do know that we're very focused on profitability. So we're being careful to make sure that our user acquisition spending reflects a high lifetime value for our customer.\nDouglas Creutz: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much. Maybe just one bigger picture question. As you continue to sort of integrate Zynga moved further away from the acquisition. Curious your updated thoughts on how you're thinking about elements of AAA titles having sort of cross-promotion, cross-play across elements of console and mobile and how that might inform some of your development cycles in the next couple of years or some of the pipeline dynamics that fed back into some of the bookings longer-term framework from last quarter. Thanks so much.\nStrauss Zelnick: We continue to believe there's an opportunity there. We do have titles coming that will offer an opportunity to engage on console and also in mobile. We don't think it's something that you have to offer, each title will stand alone. And a question you didn't ask, but we've also discussed the possibility of creating new mobile titles based on core Take-Two intellectual property. And that's something that we're also potentially excited about. In all instances, the consumer experience, the quality of the title is what governs, not the business model. So we have to create something great that consumers want. If we do, they'll show up and if we don't, they won't.\nEric Sheridan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mario Lu with Barclays. Please proceed.\nMario Lu: Hey. Thanks for taking the question. The first one is on NBA 2K. You guys mentioned the upcoming cross-play feature was largely asked on by the community. So that being said, curious if there's any data points you could share in terms of how impactful this speech will be in terms of user engagement or recurrent consumer spending? And then is there any reason why it was not included on PC in the last June?\nKarl Slatoff: So this is Karl, Mario. So look, we're very excited about cross play. It's something that our customers have been asking for and something that's natural for NBA. So obviously, we don't do anything in -- we don't put any new boats into a game unless we think that's going to have a significant impact on the experience for the consumer. That's something the consumer is going to love. And as end up leading to increased engagement. And obviously, as we say, when you get increased engagement, you get increased monetization and then everyone's happy in that regard. So all of these decisions are economic decisions, but it starts off first with the experience itself. And at this point, we're very confident that 2K is tracked and not on cross play experiences, and we're looking forward to that. And as it relates to PC and Ogan (ph) in terms of -- it's really just again allocation of resources, these decisions.\nMario Lu: Got it. That makes sense. And then just on a separate note, in terms of the topic of charging a higher price for users to get access to a game like early access during the launch, I noticed it wasn't included NBA 2K preorder pricing. Is this an opportunity in the future or is just something you guys opted out of? Thanks.\nKarl Slatoff: Yeah. We have \u2013 most of \u2013 it\u2019s funny you say a higher price because when we have some early access games in the market right now, we typically would offer them at a lower price because it would imply that there\u2019s more to come in the game, and it\u2019s not necessarily the final version. We have seen the early access models out there in terms of holding back access and making people pay more for earlier access \u2013 that\u2019s not something that we\u2019ve done to date. I would never say never. But honestly, that\u2019s a marketing decision. And our priority is really making sure that the game comes out, comes out in a timely fashion as the best experience possible. That\u2019s something that makes sense. So it\u2019s down the line, we could experiment with it. But to date, that has not been something that we\u2019ve looked at.\nMario Lu: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nDavid Karnovsky: Thank you. Just on the bookings by label, I wanted to follow up on the guidance for Zynga. I think that's down slightly on the maintained bookings figure. So I wanted to see if you could walk through the adjustment there. And then sticking with mobile, you talked about hyper casual focus on releasing games that retain better, have a higher mix of IP spend. Just wanted to see if you could unpack the thinking behind the strategy there, what the traction has been and maybe how that impacts the ad revenue potentially from Rollic and Bapcor. Thanks.\nLainie Goldstein: So for the bookings for Zynga for mobile, there are some game shifts within the year. So there was some reforecasting of some of the existing games, and that's what has changed within mobile.\nStrauss Zelnick: And then in terms of the hyper casual business, what we've seen is that there are some gains, particularly with the acquisition of Bapcor that are a bit stickier than the typical hyper casual business. And they have the opportunity to engage consumers for longer periods of time and also potentially lead to not just necessarily monetizing through advertising, but also monetizing through in-out purchasing. So we're starting to see that. We're starting to experiment with that. And we think that there's a market there for us. I think that people have been -- we've been calling is the hybrid casual market where you have the ability to not only monetize with advertising, but also in out purchases just because the experiences are a bit deeper and they last a little bit longer. So we think that's very exciting. I don't know that it's going to necessarily impact the advertising opportunity overall, but it certainly creates new opportunities within that purchases for us.\nDavid Karnovsky: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Omar Dessouky with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nOmar Dessouky: Hi. Thank you for taking question. So you didn't change your full year guidance. And I wanted to know, I think David Karnovsky asked the question and you talked about Zynga a little bit. I wanted to know what -- whether your implied like-for-like guidance on mobile has changed at all since the last time you guided. And then within that, do you expect advertising to grow on an organic basis, that is excluding Bapcor. And I have one more question.\nLainie Goldstein: So we just mentioned that Zynga has changed a little bit because there was movement in the release schedule and some updates to the forecast. So we did have some changes in the rest of the year. So there were some changes in the release schedule. So there were some ups and downs within the year. But overall, we've kept the entire year the same. So we were at the higher end in the first quarter, but we kept -- we reiterated the full year -- and then in terms of expecting advertising to grow, yes, we do expect it to grow in the full year.\nOmar Dessouky: Organically?\nLainie Goldstein: Organically, yes.\nOmar Dessouky: Okay. Great. And then the other part of the question I wanted to ask was in terms of your direct-to-consumer channel, I think Strauss said that the majority of mobile games in a few years will leverage that channel. So you have a lot of games. We've counted well over 100. Not all of them are your big winners. I think there's a long tail of games. So I guess I wanted to ask, is it that the biggest games -- the biggest games are going to be on your DTC platform or is it just the sheer number of games? Because I'm trying to get a sense of how much revenue could potentially flow through that channel, if you understand what I mean?\nStrauss Zelnick: Yes, I do understand what you mean. It really varies game by game. So if the game is not suited to direct-to-consumer and it may not be because of its style, it's the interaction that consumers have with the title, then there may not be an opportunity even though it's a big title and then there are other titles where it's a terrific opportunity. Again, we haven't established a number that we're shooting for, but I did quote the number that a competitor has outlined. And I think that number is kind of the high end of the possibility.\nOmar Dessouky: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Hickey with Benchmark Company. Please proceed.\nMichael Hickey: Thanks, Strauss, Karl, Lainie, Nice quarter, guys. Thanks for taking our questions. Curious Strauss, sort of big picture -- pardon upon, Curious what you're thinking on film opportunity. I know you're not Trim bandwagon guy, so -- but maybe this isn't that hard not to notice the results here from Super Mario Brothers and The Last Of Us. And this is an area where historically, it's been a challenge for Game IP to have success in new mediums. It looks like the formulas kind of involved the creative piece to the original game and have great story lines. And when you look at your portfolio of IP, you've got a ton of opportunities. It would seem like you certainly have a creative talent, you definitely have a great storyline. So two questions on that Strauss. Curious if your creative teams are motivated to expand their IP into new entertainment mediums like film or streaming episodic content. And then curious if you think IP expansion into new beam-like film can sort of complement your growth strategy over the long term. Thanks, guys.,\nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks, Mike. We think it's probably a relatively small opportunity economically. We're not going to use our balance sheet to invest in film and television projects. Those are typically very challenged asset classes with which I'm quite familiar. And to point out two success as notable as they may be, lies the fact that there are many, many failures where money was lost. So far, we've taken a very selective approach to licensing and we do have a Boelens (ph) movie coming from Lionsgate, and we have BioShock movie coming as well. We're excited about both. And selectively, we could see licensing in the future when there's a creative imperative and an economic opportunity. I think you're right. The reason there's been success lately was because you had great IP and then there was a great project that was made from it. And the reason you've had failure in the past is that the expression of the IP just wasn't very good despite people's best efforts. It's a really hard business. And we're not going to bet this company's future or the value of our intellectual property based on someone else's execution in another area of the entertainment business. So we'll continue to be very selective indeed. Even if we did take a broad-based approach -- in the absence of investing ourselves, the economic opportunity in the context of the much greater economic opportunity for our core business is limited.\nMichael Hickey: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brian Fitzgerald with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.\nBrian Fitzgerald: Thanks. Two quick ones. Strauss -- not to get wrapped around the axle with semantics, but you said, hey, we had a phased approach when you were talking about GTA Online. Anything to call out there is a difference or an evolution how you're marketing and delivering incremental content or now it's just more of the normal MO? And then second question is on NBA 2K23 added to PlayStation Plus game of the months, that kind -- that definitely contributes to strong engagement, but we're curious whether or not you also see a meaningful uptick in RCS there among those PlayStation plus players, point being, if they are waiting to engage with it once it's in subscription service. Is there a lower propensity to spend in the game or no, actually, we see an uptick in RCS there as well.\nStrauss Zelnick: So on the first question, by phased approach, I was referring to delivering somewhat smaller chunks of really high-quality content as opposed to waiting for a longer period of time to deliver something that's much larger. And both approaches can work and of late, the phased approach has been working really well. However, there's not one right approach. It varies with what the team has in mind creatively at any given time.\nKarl Slatoff: And then in terms of the things like subscription services or game in a month, where the consumer is necessarily buying the individual game. Obviously, we don't do these things unless we think there's a significant economic opportunity for us to do so. So you can -- if you see it going in some of those services, you can assume that, that math has been done. And yes, we do see an uptick in recurrent consumer spending generally because we bring a lot of new players. And those players are valuable players. And as long as they\u2019re engaged with the game itself, the engagement is strong and the conversion to RCS is very strong. It\u2019s all about \u2013 and again, it varies cohort to cohort and varies game to game. But if we do drive significant engagement from folks who are coming into the game, we are seeing very favorable reserves as it relates to monetization.\nBrian Fitzgerald: Awesome. Thanks, Karl. Thanks, Strauss.\nOperator: Our next question is from Benjamin Soff with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\nBenjamin Soff: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Just wanted to dig back into the revenue breakdown by studio. It looks like the percentage for Rockstar and other went up. And I'm just wondering if that's a function of sheer shift from the things you talked about with mobile or if your expectations for those segments that actually improved? And if so, could you talk a little bit more about that? Thanks.\nLainie Goldstein: So the update for Rockstar is based on the momentum in their current business. So there's some GTA 5 unit sales, some the Red Dead updates and some virtual currency with the GT Online updating. So it's just overall reforecasting of the business.\nBenjamin Soff: Okay. Got it. And then just can you talk broadly about the competitive environment in the industry and whether you think it will be sort of at this level more competitive, less competitive, six months or 12 months from now?\nStrauss Zelnick: I think it will be about the same. It's always hard to know. It's a very competitive business at any given time. But ultimately, we're really competing with ourselves because if there's a lot in the market that consumers want, generally speaking, they'll go consume it. And if there's nothing that they want, it's not like they consume the next best. They just stay away. So we have to deliver the highest quality properties. And if we do that, they'll show up in good times and in bad. I mean you're seeing that even in a mixed economy. The best titles still full big audiences.\nOperator: We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for closing comments.\nStrauss Zelnick: I just want to take a minute to thank our teams again for delivering a superb quarter, and we're really thrilled with the way this year is unfolding. Our titles continue to be a phenomenal quality. We're really excited about our upcoming releases. And obviously, very excited about the future beyond this fiscal year. And we also want to thank all of you for attending the call for your great questions. And naturally, we're grateful to our shareholders for their continued support. So thanks so much, and have a great evening.\nOperator: Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you again for your participation.",

            "name": "Karl Slatoff",
            "content": "Thanks, Strauss. I'd like to thank our teams for a strong start to the year. Turning to our announced launches for fiscal 2024. Yesterday, Rockstar Games announced that the beloved Western experiences, Red Dead Redemption and Undead Nightmare would be coming to the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 for the first time in a new single package, arriving August 17. In a new conversion by Double Eleven Studios, the Switch and PS4 versions bring the two classic experiences together again for new players and original fans to enjoy across modern consoles, including backwards compatibility with the PlayStation 5. On September 8, 2K and Visual Concepts will celebrate the 25th anniversary of our industry defining NBA 2K series and once again redefine basketball simulations with the launch of NBA 2K24, featuring the iconic Kobe Bryant as the game's cover athlete for the second time in the history of the franchise. Players will be able to celebrate Bryant's legacy and replicate his skills in the brand-new Mamba Moments mode. Players in the U.S. and Canada can also purchase the WNBA Edition of the game exclusively at GameStop, featuring WNBA All-Star Sabrina Ionescu, as this year's cover star. NBA 2K24 will introduce cross-play, a community requested feature for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S. Available in every multiplayer mode, players will be able to compete with or against others from around the world in dynamic co-op matches, thrilling online tournaments, or casual pick-up games between new generation consoles. The title will also introduce ProPLAY, a groundbreaking new technology that directly translates actual NBA footage into gameplay. 2K will have more to share on NBA 2K24 in the coming weeks. In addition, 2K and Visual Concepts remain hard at work on WWE 2K24, the next installment of our popular wrestling series, which set new creative and critical benchmarks with last year's highly successful release. In June, Private Division and Evening Star announced Penny's Big Breakaway, a new 3D action platformer from the team behind Sonic Mania. This kinetic yo-yo adventure is expected to launch in early 2024. Zynga's Star Wars: Hunters, which offers players the opportunity to join the greatest hunters from across the Star Wars galaxy is expected to launch later this fiscal year. Players will engage in thrilling third-person combat in a range of competitive game modes across battlegrounds from the iconic worlds of Star Wars. Also in mobile, Social point's latest game, Top Troops, a medieval fantasy-themed title in the PvP merge genre is progressing well in soft launch and is expected to launch worldwide this fiscal year. In addition, our hyper-casual studios will release a steady cadence of mobile titles throughout the year, focusing on games that have the potential for enhanced retention rates and a mix of in-app purchases and advertising to drive higher monetization and profitability. Our labels will also continue to provide new content and experiences that drive engagement and recurrent consumer spending across many of our offerings, including Grand Theft Auto Online, Red Dead Online, WWE 2K, LEGO 2K Drive, PGA TOUR 2K, Kerbal Space Program 2, and Zynga's mobile portfolio. Throughout fiscal year 2024, we look forward to launching additional releases from what we believe to be the strongest and most exciting development pipeline in our company's history. I'll now turn the call over to Lainie. So this is Karl, Mario. So look, we're very excited about cross play. It's something that our customers have been asking for and something that's natural for NBA. So obviously, we don't do anything in -- we don't put any new boats into a game unless we think that's going to have a significant impact on the experience for the consumer. That's something the consumer is going to love. And as end up leading to increased engagement. And obviously, as we say, when you get increased engagement, you get increased monetization and then everyone's happy in that regard. So all of these decisions are economic decisions, but it starts off first with the experience itself. And at this point, we're very confident that 2K is tracked and not on cross play experiences, and we're looking forward to that. And as it relates to PC and Ogan (ph) in terms of -- it's really just again allocation of resources, these decisions. Yeah. We have \u2013 most of \u2013 it's funny you say a higher price because when we have some early access games in the market right now, we typically would offer them at a lower price because it would imply that there's more to come in the game, and it's not necessarily the final version. We have seen the early access models out there in terms of holding back access and making people pay more for earlier access \u2013 that's not something that we've done to date. I would never say never. But honestly, that's a marketing decision. And our priority is really making sure that the game comes out, comes out in a timely fashion as the best experience possible. That's something that makes sense. So it's down the line, we could experiment with it. But to date, that has not been something that we've looked at. And then in terms of the things like subscription services or game in a month, where the consumer is necessarily buying the individual game. Obviously, we don't do these things unless we think there's a significant economic opportunity for us to do so. So you can -- if you see it going in some of those services, you can assume that, that math has been done. And yes, we do see an uptick in recurrent consumer spending generally because we bring a lot of new players. And those players are valuable players. And as long as they're engaged with the game itself, the engagement is strong and the conversion to RCS is very strong. It's all about \u2013 and again, it varies cohort to cohort and varies game to game. But if we do drive significant engagement from folks who are coming into the game, we are seeing very favorable reserves as it relates to monetization."

            "name": "Lainie Goldstein",
            "content": "Thanks Karl and good afternoon everyone. Today, I'll discuss the key highlights from our first quarter before reviewing our financial outlook for the full year and second quarter of fiscal 2024. Our combination with Zynga closed on May 23, 2022, which affects the comparability of our results relative to last year. Additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release. We had a strong start to the fiscal year, powered by our portfolio of iconic, industry-leading intellectual properties. As we approach our next phase of growth, our teams continue to make excellent progress advancing our development pipeline and capitalizing on our revenue-driven opportunities and synergies. We also partnered together to maintain our focus on efficiency amidst the challenging macroeconomic backdrop and cautious consumer spending trends. I'd like to thank our incredible teams worldwide for their determination and passion for our business. Now, moving onto our results. We achieved net bookings of $1.2 billion, which was at the high end of our guidance range. In the current backdrop, many consumers are purchasing established franchises and those that offer great value, and our catalog stands at the intersection of these two trends. Accordingly, our performance reflects better-than-expected results from Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, and NBA 2K23. During the quarter, we launched Marvel's Midnight Suns for Gen 8 consoles, Lego 2K Drive, and After Us. Recurrent consumer spending rose 38% for the period, which was above our outlook of 35% growth, and accounted for 84% of net bookings. The outperformance was primarily driven by Grand Theft Auto Online and NBA 2K23. GAAP net revenue increased 17% to $1.28 billion and cost of revenue increased 39% to $606 million, driven by $187 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. We also recorded an impairment charge of $18 million, related primarily to capitalized software and development costs for an unreleased title, which affected our management results compared to our guidance. Operating expenses increased by 25% to $883 million. On a management basis, operating expenses grew by 46%, which primarily reflected a full quarter of Zynga, higher personnel costs, and depreciation related to office buildouts and capitalized IT expenses. Turning to our guidance, I'll begin with our full fiscal year expectations. As Strauss mentioned, our business is performing well, and we are reiterating our net bookings outlook range of $5.45 billion to $5.55 billion. Largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, our hyper-casual mobile portfolio, Empires & Puzzles, Toon Blast, Merge Dragons, Words With Friends, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, and Zynga Poker. We expect the Net Bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 51% Zynga, 30% 2K, 17% Rockstar Games, and 2% Other. And, we forecast our geographic net bookings split to be about 65% United States and 35% International. We continue to forecast recurrent consumer spending growth of 5% compared to fiscal 2023, representing 78% of net bookings. Mobile trends are projected to remain stable, with Zynga's ad business continuing to deliver growth. We expect to generate approximately $100 million in non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow, and deploy approximately $180 million for capital expenditures, primarily to support our office buildouts and larger footprint. We continue to expect GAAP net revenue to range from $5.37 billion to $5.47 billion. Our total operating expenses are expected to range from $3.38 billion to $3.4 billion as compared to $3.45 billion last year. On a management basis, our operating expenses are expected to grow by approximately 15% year-over-year, due primarily to a full year of Zynga, an increase in personnel and marketing expenses, and higher depreciation of office buildouts and capitalized IT expenses, which are being partially offset by the realization of synergies from our combination with Zynga and savings from our cost reduction program. As we announced previously, our teams are taking extensive measures to review our cost structure and reduce discretionary costs whenever possible to offset the current consumer backdrop and inflationary environment, while still investing for growth. Now moving onto our guidance for the fiscal second quarter. We project Net Bookings to range from $1.4 billion to $1.45 billion, compared to $1.5 billion in the second quarter last year. Our release slate for the quarter includes Red Dead Redemption and Undead Nightmare for Switch and PlayStation 4, and NBA 2K24. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, our hyper-casual mobile portfolio, Empires & Puzzles, Toon Blast, Words With Friends, Merge Dragons, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, and Zynga Poker. We project recurrent consumer spending to decline by approximately 7%, which assumes modest declines in our mobile business; NBA 2K, driven by changes to its summer promotional cadence; and Grand Theft Auto Online; as well as a reduction in DLC revenue from several titles that were released in prior years. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $1.26 billion to $1.31 billion. Operating expenses are expected to range from $811 million to $821 million. On a management basis, operating expenses are expected to grow by approximately 5% year-over-year, driven by last year's acquisition of Popcore and higher personnel costs, which are being partly offset by the Zynga synergies and our cost savings initiatives. In closing, we are confident that the actions our teams are taking this year are preparing us for a strong trajectory of growth. Through our collective efforts, we continue to believe that we are positioning our business for a significant inflection point in fiscal 2025 that will culminate in us delivering new record levels of operating performance next year and beyond. We thank all of our stakeholders for their continued support, and we look forward to delivering on this exciting next chapter. Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Strauss. Sure. So for question two, there has been some movements within the back part of the year within the slate, but we're still able to achieve the same guidance for the year, so reiterating our guidance. So just some small changes within the slate, but it has nothing to do with the impairment charge. So the year is still the same. So on NBA 2K 24, we expect to be up from 2K23 -- but 2K23 versus 2K22, there is some less promotional timing in this quarter versus what we did with 22 last year. So that's why we expect the title to be a little bit down versus last year. So for the bookings for Zynga for mobile, there are some game shifts within the year. So there was some reforecasting of some of the existing games, and that's what has changed within mobile. So we just mentioned that Zynga has changed a little bit because there was movement in the release schedule and some updates to the forecast. So we did have some changes in the rest of the year. So there were some changes in the release schedule. So there were some ups and downs within the year. But overall, we've kept the entire year the same. So we were at the higher end in the first quarter, but we kept -- we reiterated the full year -- and then in terms of expecting advertising to grow, yes, we do expect it to grow in the full year. Organically, yes. So the update for Rockstar is based on the momentum in their current business. So there's some GTA 5 unit sales, some the Red Dead updates and some virtual currency with the GT Online updating. So it's just overall reforecasting of the business."

            "name": "Strauss Zelnick",
            "content": "Thanks, Nicole. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that fiscal 2024 is off to a strong start, highlighted by first quarter net bookings of $1.2 billion, which was at the high end of our expectations, and management results were in line with our plans. Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, and NBA 2K23 exceeded our projections, which illustrates the long-lasting benefits of producing the highest quality offerings and amassing one of the strongest and most diverse portfolios in entertainment. In keeping with our core values of creativity, innovation, and efficiency, this quarter, we introduced new intellectual properties, advanced the development of our eagerly anticipated pipeline, and maintained our vigilance with cost management initiatives across our organization. Turning to the results from our titles for the period. Grand Theft Auto V continued to outperform and to date, the title has sold-in more than 185 million units. On June 13, Rockstar Games launched San Andreas Mercenaries for Grand Theft Auto Online, which offers six new major story-based missions, as well as new Los Santos operations, Hangar upgrades, Smuggler Source and Sell Missions, seven new vehicles, and more. The update also includes a range of fan-requested experience improvements, as well as the Career Progress feature, offering players a new way to track their progression across criminal careers and claim rewards. San Andreas Mercenaries continues to deliver high value content post-launch using a phased approach that is driving sustained engagement and Recurrent Consumer Spending. This June, Grand Theft Auto Online recorded more players than any other June in its history outside of the height of the pandemic. GTA+, Rockstar's premium membership service for GTA Online on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S, offered exclusive options for members to test drive and purchase an array of vehicles, and we are continuing to see strong growth in GTA+ adoption with each passing quarter. We were pleased with the performance of Red Dead Redemption 2, which has sold-in more than 55 million units to-date. Rockstar Games continues to support Red Dead Online with new bonuses and rewards, including free apparel inspired by the RedDeadFashion subreddit, and seasonal content such as April's Condor Egg Freemode Event. NBA 2K23 exceeded our plans and the title has now sold-in over 13 million units, representing a 11% year-over-year growth, driven by higher demand, especially on Gen-9 consoles, as well as a more tailored promotional cadence. This incredible performance marks the title's second-highest sell-through ever -- with only NBA 2K20 achieving higher unit sales. Engagement with NBA 2K23 remains strong, with approximately 2.6 million Daily Active Users delivering Recurrent Consumer Spending that exceeded our expectations. Our franchise extensions with the NBA continue to perform extremely well and NBA 2K23 Arcade Edition remains one of the top games on Apple Arcade. WWE 2K23, which is the highest-rated game in our wrestling franchise's history and the second highest-rated sports simulation title of the year, experienced strong engagement throughout the quarter, with players logging nearly 22 million hours of gameplay and facing off in 170 million matches. 2K and Visual Concepts continue to support the title with a series of 5 DLC packs that can be purchased individually or as part of a Season Pass. 2K also continues to support PGA TOUR 2K23 with additional pros, courses, and Clubhouse Passes. In May, 2K and Visual Concepts launched LEGO 2K Drive, the first game in a multi-title partnership between 2K and the LEGO Group. Following the launch, our teams released the first of four Drive Pass Seasons for the title, which features 100 levels and new content inspired by the Fast and the Furious Saga. Also in May, Private Division and Piccolo Studio launched After Us on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, and PC, which has been praised by critics for its striking visuals and game world. Zynga had a solid start to the year, performing in-line with our plans, and we are pleased with the ongoing progress of our mobile business. Ad revenue grew approximately 11% year-over-year, driven by the addition of Popcore and our ability to open new inventory supplies in our portfolio. Toon Blast has been introducing strong feature releases such as the Toon Race event, which drove outperformance versus our forecasts and helped the game recently surpass $2 billion in lifetime gross bookings. We made excellent progress on our profitability initiatives in mobile. We expanded our offerings on our direct-to-consumer platforms and continue to believe that, over the next few years, the majority of our mobile games will leverage our highly-profitable, proprietary distribution channel. We continue to enhance the performance and profitability of our hyper-casual business, with multiple new games scaling quickly and several titles generating bookings from in-app purchases in addition to ads. A few key highlights of Zynga's live services during the period include: Empires & Puzzles grew quarter-over-quarter, driven by the new Path of Giants battle pass featuring daily and weekly challenges to unlock rewards. Rollic's Twisted Tangle reached the number one Free Game spot on the U.S. Google Play store. Social Casino again delivered strong results, driven by Hit It Rich's best quarter in two years, and Game of Thrones Casino's second best quarter in its history. Casual games continued to improve participation and engagement, with Words With Friends launching the new Club Daily Puzzle and Harry Potter: Puzzles & Spells adding Bonus Levels and Special Delivery prize events. With numerous games in development and soft launch across Zynga's studios, we are excited to start delivering several new offerings in the coming months. Turning to our outlook, we are reiterating our prior guidance of $5.45 to $5.55 billion in net bookings for fiscal 2024. We remain highly optimistic about our future and our ability to deliver record results in the coming years. Lainie will provide more details on our outlook shortly. In closing, as we continue to execute our strategy, we believe that we can increase significantly our scale and prominence within the industry, grow margins, and pursue the vast opportunities to engage even larger audiences around the world. Led by the passion, creativity, and innovation of our world-class development teams, Take-Two is in a powerful position to set new benchmarks for our player communities, which we believe will drive long-term returns for our shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Karl. Thanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for delivering a strong start to the fiscal year. And to our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued support. We'll now take your questions. Operator? Yeah. I mean I love that people are debating whether we're going to be in a recession from the point of view of a digital entertainment company, we've been in a recession for the better part of 18 months. The market for interactive entertainment was down meaningfully in 2022, down for the first time in the history of the mobile business over 10%, pretty much across the board. Things are looking a lot better. The year-over-year comps have stabilized. We're seeing growth in the console market. It's early, but we are seeing some growth. Mobile sort of flat, slightly down. We hope that will improve. I do feel like we're all seeing some green shoots across the economy. But it definitely is a mixed picture depending on the U.S. So in the context of the entertainment business, live entertainment is doing great. But in the context of entertainment that people consumed at home during the pandemic, it's been challenging for a while. And again, I think it's beginning to normalize, but it's early days yet. When asked a couple of calls ago what I thought would happen in the economy, I said that I thought it would bottom out in June, July. And that by the end of calendar '23, we begin to see some good news and then we'd be in reasonably good position from an economic point of view in early '24, and I continue to believe that that's what will happen. Look, we live within the entertainment ecosystem. So we would never wish for any other industry to have a problem. But if the strike means that new content can't be delivered, then I suppose it could be some small positive benefit for our business. But we aren't counting on that. We're certainly not hoping for it. Some, and we are moving in that direction selectively. Look, historically, for games where you could make in app purchases, less than 10% of the audience actually spent. So we are fielding a game for 100% of the audience and monetizing 10% or so, perhaps a bit more often a bit less. And it's our view that we ought to be monetizing 100% of the audience. So if someone's going to spend, that's great. And if they're not going to spend, then we ought to be able to monetize through advertising. The question is how do you do that and create a high-quality experience. And I think the answer is we can do that. We can distinguish among those audiences. We're not there yet, but I think we're moving in that direction. So we don't actually give out that percentage. Some of our competitors do. And so one of our biggest competitors, I think, has gone on the record to say it's about 25% and I think that's a good number. We're not remotely in that vicinity. There's plenty of room for growth. I would note that Zynga's advertising net bookings were up 11% year-over-year. So it's really good news. And we're really happy about the growth of our direct-to-consumer platform and what that can mean for consumers and also for us. So the answer to question one is, yes, and Lainie will answer question two. So on the deal side, it's hard to know. In terms of our strategy, we think we're in a position to grow organically. We have a lot of new releases coming from Zynga. We're really excited about them. As you know, hit ratios are very low in the mobile business. So we're not claiming success until it occurs. But we do feel really good about some new launches. And in terms of the promotional cadences. Look, I think it's an established intellectual property that's been known and beloved for a very long time. And if you combine that with a high-quality expression, I think you can do very well. We don't -- we obviously don't know what they're spending to be in the position that they're in. I do know that we're very focused on profitability. So we're being careful to make sure that our user acquisition spending reflects a high lifetime value for our customer. We continue to believe there's an opportunity there. We do have titles coming that will offer an opportunity to engage on console and also in mobile. We don't think it's something that you have to offer, each title will stand alone. And a question you didn't ask, but we've also discussed the possibility of creating new mobile titles based on core Take-Two intellectual property. And that's something that we're also potentially excited about. In all instances, the consumer experience, the quality of the title is what governs, not the business model. So we have to create something great that consumers want. If we do, they'll show up and if we don't, they won't. And then in terms of the hyper casual business, what we've seen is that there are some gains, particularly with the acquisition of Bapcor that are a bit stickier than the typical hyper casual business. And they have the opportunity to engage consumers for longer periods of time and also potentially lead to not just necessarily monetizing through advertising, but also monetizing through in-out purchasing. So we're starting to see that. We're starting to experiment with that. And we think that there's a market there for us. I think that people have been -- we've been calling is the hybrid casual market where you have the ability to not only monetize with advertising, but also in out purchases just because the experiences are a bit deeper and they last a little bit longer. So we think that's very exciting. I don't know that it's going to necessarily impact the advertising opportunity overall, but it certainly creates new opportunities within that purchases for us. Yes, I do understand what you mean. It really varies game by game. So if the game is not suited to direct-to-consumer and it may not be because of its style, it's the interaction that consumers have with the title, then there may not be an opportunity even though it's a big title and then there are other titles where it's a terrific opportunity. Again, we haven't established a number that we're shooting for, but I did quote the number that a competitor has outlined. And I think that number is kind of the high end of the possibility. Thanks, Mike. We think it's probably a relatively small opportunity economically. We're not going to use our balance sheet to invest in film and television projects. Those are typically very challenged asset classes with which I'm quite familiar. And to point out two success as notable as they may be, lies the fact that there are many, many failures where money was lost. So far, we've taken a very selective approach to licensing and we do have a Boelens (ph) movie coming from Lionsgate, and we have BioShock movie coming as well. We're excited about both. And selectively, we could see licensing in the future when there's a creative imperative and an economic opportunity. I think you're right. The reason there's been success lately was because you had great IP and then there was a great project that was made from it. And the reason you've had failure in the past is that the expression of the IP just wasn't very good despite people's best efforts. It's a really hard business. And we're not going to bet this company's future or the value of our intellectual property based on someone else's execution in another area of the entertainment business. So we'll continue to be very selective indeed. Even if we did take a broad-based approach -- in the absence of investing ourselves, the economic opportunity in the context of the much greater economic opportunity for our core business is limited. So on the first question, by phased approach, I was referring to delivering somewhat smaller chunks of really high-quality content as opposed to waiting for a longer period of time to deliver something that's much larger. And both approaches can work and of late, the phased approach has been working really well. However, there's not one right approach. It varies with what the team has in mind creatively at any given time. I think it will be about the same. It's always hard to know. It's a very competitive business at any given time. But ultimately, we're really competing with ourselves because if there's a lot in the market that consumers want, generally speaking, they'll go consume it. And if there's nothing that they want, it's not like they consume the next best. They just stay away. So we have to deliver the highest quality properties. And if we do that, they'll show up in good times and in bad. I mean you're seeing that even in a mixed economy. The best titles still full big audiences. I just want to take a minute to thank our teams again for delivering a superb quarter, and we're really thrilled with the way this year is unfolding. Our titles continue to be a phenomenal quality. We're really excited about our upcoming releases. And obviously, very excited about the future beyond this fiscal year. And we also want to thank all of you for attending the call for your great questions. And naturally, we're grateful to our shareholders for their continued support. So thanks so much, and have a great evening."
