At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce host of this conference call, Mr. Tom Heath, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nTom Heath: Thank you, Angie. Good morning and thank you so much for joining us. It is my pleasure to introduce our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Frank Holding, as well as our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Nix, who will provide an overview of our results, after which we will be happy to take any questions you may have. We are also pleased to have several other members of the team with us as well, including our Chief Risk Officer, Lorie Rupp; our Chief Credit Officer, Jim Bryan; our Treasurer, Tom Eklund; our Chief Accounting Officer, Robert Hawley; our Head of Analysis and in M&A, Elliot Howard; and lastly, Brian Paull of Risk and Data Analytics. Our remarks today will reference an earnings presentation that is available at firstcitizens.com/earningspresentation. I should note that statements made during the call and statements included in the presentation materials may be forward-looking statements and the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those statements are listed in the earnings press release, the presentation materials and the company\u2019s SEC filings. And if any non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on the call or included in the presentation materials, that reconciliations of those measures to the comparable GAAP measures are available in the presentation materials, which are posted on the website. And with that, I\u2019m going to hand it over to Frank.\nFrank Holding: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everybody. We appreciate you joining us. As you\u2019ve seen, despite the challenging environment, we\u2019ve had a very good fourth quarter and a full year 2020. This all translated into record earnings for First Citizens. Performance was broad-based and I\u2019m exceptionally proud of our team for their hard work and the efforts they have made to see our clients and communities through this challenging period. I\u2019ll let Craig Nix, our CFO walk you through our financial performance in more detail. But before I do, I wanted to make a couple of high-level comments. First, it\u2019s very clear to me that the investments we made in recent years in both people and technology have paid off handsomely. Testament to that fact is that in this tough environment, we\u2019ve not skipped a beat. And I believe our significant activity in PPP demonstrates just one example of the power of our people and the underlying franchise. The team is hard at work on round two of PPP now as we plan to continue to help our clients to navigate in these tough times. Second, as you know, we announced a transformational partnership with CIT in this past October, while we spent many months on the front end carefully understanding the opportunity. Since that time we\u2019ve been \u2013 we\u2019ve had even more time with the CIT team. As of today, I can tell you that we\u2019re even more excited about this opportunity given the quality of the combined team and our underlying capabilities as a combined entity. On Page 3 of the investment deck, we provide an update of our activities surrounding our plan to merger with CIT. Drawing from both organizations, we\u2019ve established core merger and integration planning teams to promote a coordinated approach to enterprise issues, drive executions and aid key decisions. We\u2019ve filed key regulatory applications in December 2020. We have scheduled a shareholder meeting to approve the merger in February. Subject to regulatory and shareholder approval, we are targeting legal close at the beginning of the second quarter. We formed an integration management office to provide governance structure and facilitate reporting. As we move forward, we will be finalizing organizational and personnel decisions as well as completion of our business unit integration plans. We continue to plan operational conversion in 2022. Both First Citizens and CIT have been active in M&A. And our experience in this process, understand its importance. Consequently, we\u2019re going to great lengths to do it carefully and to do it right. We remain confident that we will accomplish just that. I\u2019d like to close by thanking our employees for their steadfast commitment to their customers through a very challenging year. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Craig for a closer look at our results. And then we will take your questions. Craig?\nCraig Nix: Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. As I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware, we released our fourth quarter earnings yesterday, along with a press release and investor deck. I will touch on our significant fourth quarter and full year financial highlights in my comments today. As Frank mentioned in his comments, we are very pleased to report a strong fourth quarter as well as full year results. Pages 4 and 5 of the investor deck provided our earnings highlights for the fourth quarter and for the year ended 2020. During the fourth quarter, we earned $133.4 million, an increase of 31% over the fourth quarter of 2019. Earnings translated into a return on average assets of 1.11% and a return on average equity of 14.02%. EPS was up 42.3% reflecting the positive impact of higher earnings in our earlier share repurchases. I will touch on some of the drivers behind our fourth quarter results on the ensuing pages, but the increase in quarter-over-quarter earnings was primarily driven by a 29.3% increase in pre-provision net revenue. Credit quality remained strong with comparable quarter net charge-offs declining from 14 basis points to 7 basis points. For the full year 2020, we are in $477.7 billion. This translated into a return on average assets of 1.07% and a return on average equity of 12.96%. Earnings for the full year were up 4.4%, while EPS was up 15.7%, again, reflecting the positive impact of higher earnings and of share repurchases. Similar to the quarterly results, pre-provision net revenue growth was the primary driver behind improved year-over-year earnings, but the impact was partially blunted by $36.1 million reserve build related to uncertainty around COVID-19. On Page 6, we take a look at net interest income and net interest margin. As we stated at the end of the third quarter, while the expected net interest margin continue to decline, we expected it to decline at a much more modest pace. This is what happened as net interest margin declined by 4 basis points on a linked quarter basis compared to a 41 basis points dropped between the first and second quarter. While the margin did decline during the quarter, net interest income was up by just over $5 million, driven primarily by acceleration of SBA-PPP interest income as loan forgiveness has picked up. I won\u2019t cover Page 7 in detail, but the page rolls forward, the drivers behind our margin change for the linked quarters and for the comparable quarters. Before I leave margin, a few points that I\u2019d like to make. We have ample liquidity on the balance sheet and see that potentially going up due to strong core deposit growth. And while our liquidity is strong, this does present margin pressure as we keep increased levels of cash at the fed and the reinvestment opportunity is challenging given the low interest rate environment. We were prudently opportunistic throughout the quarter reinvesting cash flows and selling securities for gains to offset some of the margin pressure, but for the most part have retained a conservative posture with this liquidity. Our thinking here is that we see opportunities when we combine our balance sheet with CIT, hopefully during the second quarter. So at this point we believe there\u2019s value in being conservative with our liquidity. And for the margin looking forward, we expect deposit cost to continue to decline but they will not fall much further, so most of the benefit of lower deposit costs has already been realized. We expect that SBA-PPP interest income will continue to be a positive contributor to net interest margin and net interest income, but its impact will largely be offset by excess liquidity and lower earning asset yields. If you turn to Page 8, we will take a look at noninterest income. In general each of our fee income producing businesses did well and they remain very important to our customer relationship offering. Wealth management, card, merchant and mortgage all had good quarters and while deposit fees have not yet rebounded to the pre-COVID levels, they continued to rebound during the quarter. If you turn to Page 9, we\u2019ll take a look at our noninterest expense. We did see a slight uptick relative to the third quarter. So I want to give you a bit of color on some of the more significant factors that threw us off of our run rate. First, revenue producing lines of business finished out the year strong, resulting in higher incentive expense. Second building repairs and maintenance that were delayed in the second and third quarters due to COVID were incurred and paid during the fourth quarter. And finally foreclosure expense was up related to losses on the sale of two OREO properties during the quarter. Given the lumpy nature of these expenses, we do now expect fourth quarter to be reflective of our noninterest expense run rate moving forward. All-in our efficiency ratio in the fourth quarter was 64.28% well within an acceptable range for us giving both our operating strategy in the low interest rate environment. Page 10 provides a snapshot of the balance sheet. I will discuss loans and deposits in the next couple of pages, but I would like to point out a few things here. First, total assets grew by over 25% during the year, finishing the year at just under $50 billion. Asset growth was funded by strong organic core deposit growth and our loan-to-deposit ratio ex-PPP ended the year at 71.5%. Second thing I\u2019d point out is that tangible book value per share a measure that we pay a close attention to ended the year at over $357 per share up 18.9% on a year-over-year basis. Page 11 provides a snapshot of our loan composition and growth. So the year loans were up 13.5%, stripping out both PPP and the impact of acquisitions growth was 4.9%, which we were pleased with particularly given the current operating backdrop. During the fourth quarter, loans were slightly down by 0.6%, but if you look ex-PPP pay downs, loans grew at an annualized rate of 7.9% indicative of loan activity picking up. Most of the loan growth for both the linked quarter and the year-over-year period was driven by owner-occupied commercial real estate lines. Going to Page 12, we wanted to give you a few comments on PPP. We are pleased that we helped our clients secure a meaningful amount of PPP loans, a vast majority of the loans went to small businesses. As of year-end we had received applications for forgiveness totaling to over 43% of the original loan amount and to almost 34% of the number of loans. We have received approximately 23% of the original loan amount from the SBA. We are actively managing the forgiveness process and expect that activity to continue to be meaningful during the first quarter. In addition, we will see more funding coming in the form of PPP round two. Overall the program has been very impactful to the business community and has been one more way for us to affirm our clients the true value of our focus on relationship banking. Pages 13 through 15 summarize our credit quality and allowance for credit losses trends. Good credit quality trends continued for both the fourth quarter and for the full year. Net charge offs were 7 basis points for the quarter and 8 basis points for the year. NPAs have been relatively stable throughout the year, they did spike during the first quarter of the year, but this was a function of both CECL accounting for PCI loan pools as well as a bucket of acquired loans re-classified as PCD. We did not take any further COVID related reserves in the fourth quarter that had taken 36.1 million in total during the first and second quarters of the year. Overall, the allowance for credit losses is 0.74% of loans ex-PPP representing 9.25 times annual net charge offs on a loan book with an average life of approximately four years. Turning to Page 16, I want to briefly touch on deposits. Total deposits grew at an annualized rate of 11.1% during the fourth quarter and by 26.1% on a year-over-year basis. Adjusting for acquisitions and estimated PPP deposits, deposits grew by almost 23% organically on a year-over-year basis. Our deposit base continues to be generated from our core relationship oriented clientele. Noninterest bearing deposits grew by over 5 billion during the year or about over 39% and stood at 41.5% of total deposits as of year-end. We continue to attribute our strong core deposit growth to many factors, including day-to-day focus on relationship banking, a flight to quality and challenging economic times, lower-consumer spending and consequently higher deposit balances, and commercial and business customers holding more cash in their deposit accounts due to economic uncertainty. Page 17 shows that deposits continue to make up the bulk of our funding. The only real change of note in our funding profile since 2019 is that we did opportunistically add some subordinated debt during the first quarter to round out our capital stack and to support earning asset growth. Of note is that our cost of interest bearing deposits decreased by 5 basis points during the quarter and by 27 basis points since the first quarter. Our overall cost of deposits declined by 18 points at the first quarter and by 3 basis points on a linked quarter basis and stood at 10 basis points at year-end. We expect this may fall to mid-to-upper single digits next year, so not much more room to fall from here. On Page 18, we will give you a quick snapshot of the capital ratios and their evolution since the end of 2019. All of our capital ratios are healthy and well within both regulatory and internal guidelines. I would call out that our Tier 1 leverage ratio has been most impacted by the asset growth we have experienced this year, particularly as a result of the SBA-PPP loans program. The actual Tier 1 leverage ratio was 7.86% at year end, but ex-PPP would have been 8.45%. We are comfortable in operating at our current capital levels. Finally, on Page 19, we wanted to give you a general outlook on the first quarter, while we expect net interest margin to decline, we think the worst of it is behind us. We expect that net interest income will decrease slightly on a linked quarter basis due to the impact of lower earning asset yields, more than offsetting the acceleration of PPP interest income, loan growth and lower deposit costs. Fee income generating businesses continue to do well and should hold their top trend, but it remains dependent on the continuous of the economic recovery. We were expecting a slight uptick in net charge offs primarily because they are currently at such historically low levels and the temporary impacts of economic stimulus could subside. But overall, we do not expect credit quality trends to change significantly. They should remain relatively consistent and continue to be a source of strength. Non-interest expense should return to normalized levels as the benefits of converting acquired banks are realized. We expect loan growth SPP to be low to mid single digits, and we expect to see continued deposit growth in the same range. To close, our focus in the first quarter will be; one, integration of First Citizens and CIT; two, continued organic growth and profitability; three, maintaining discipline on credit quality, customer selection and retention; and four, maintaining prudent expense control. Thank you all for joining us today. I will now open it up for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous.\nBrian Foran: Hi, good morning. Maybe one to start, when you announced the CIT deal, you put up an illustrative $70 per share in 2022. I know it\u2019s only been three months or so since then, but I wonder if you could just kind of talk anything that\u2019s going better or worse than you expected relative to those original assumptions, and especially maybe in the context of the deposit growth and the credit quality performance? Is there anything that\u2019s kind of maybe trending a little better than that $70 originally assumed?\nCraig Nix: Okay, Craig Nix\u2019s here. We have not updated those pro formas and we\u2019re going to \u2013 and we will be doing that here soon. We do acknowledge that the economic outlook in general has improved since we established our original marks and established those pro formas. We are also encouraged with CIT\u2019s fourth quarter results. We did create our marks and assumptions based on the best information we had at the time in the fall of last year. And again, we plan to establish final marks as transaction close, and we\u2019ll consider the facts and circumstances at that time, but right now we\u2019re not ready to provide additional guidance. But we are \u2013 I can tell you, we are encouraged our eyes on the ball in integrating CIT. And we don\u2019t think things have gotten any worse.\nBrian Foran: And maybe one follow-up or maybe a separate question, really. Probably the most common question I get on your stock is that you have a little bit of an unusual setup. And I hesitate to call it, things that could be shareholder friendly because ultimately stock that goes up and outperforms over time is the ultimate shareholder friendly setup and you guys have certainly delivered on that. So the existing setup has served you well over time. But maybe if I call it like shareholder broadening and things like the Class A, Class B, the level of the dividend, index inclusion, all the things that would go in that bucket, I wonder if you could just share your outlook, what things are under consideration and anything that\u2019s not on the table or not subject to change over time? Just \u2013 if you think about the next two or three years, where could that shareholder broadening transition look like then?\nFrank Holding: Brian, this is Frank Holding. I think in terms of shareholder broadening, we look forward to having a much broader shareholder base with our friends. We\u2019re combining with our friends at CIT. If you\u2019re asking a question about, are we planning something that would change our share class structure A to B, we have no plans for that. But thank you for your compliment on our total shareholder returns. I believe we have done a reasonable job there and thank you for that recognition. You asked \u2013 part of your question also was about dividend. And I would say we have a long history of having a very modest dividend. And while we demonstrate that we move it nominally occasionally, I think we have no intention of changing our path from having a modest dividend.\nBrian Foran: Great. Thank you for taking the questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We do have a follow-up question from Brian Foran with Autonomous.\nBrian Foran: I figured we\u2019d just make it a fireside chat. I guess one other question I get a lot is on your owner-occupied CRE. I mean, certainly your ability to grow core loans right now is a pretty nice differentiator. I think maybe it\u2019s not always as clear to people, the differences in the owner-occupied CRE both you have and even sometimes I kind of scratch my head on some of the opportunities you might be finding now. I wonder if you could just talk about, as you look at the recent owner-occupied CRE growth over the past three, six, nine months, and help us understand a little bit where that opportunity is coming from and what makes it different than the typical retail or hotel or whatever that might be a little bit COVID concerning right now.\nCraig Nix: I\u2019m going to ask Jim Bryan, our Chief Credit Officer to address that question.\nJim Bryan: Thank you, Craig. We have had nice growth this past year in that category. And our focus is on small business medical professional activities. And owner occupied as compared to non-owner occupied obviously is that credit that the business cash flow repays the credit. So it\u2019s supporting the housing of the business that business needs to operate. We continue to see opportunity in that area across all sectors of including our medical and professional activity, small business primarily outside of that restaurant COVID impacted category and a lot of that has to do with consolidation within the industry merger and acquisition that creates opportunity for us. If you want to rephrase the question, where \u2013 if I haven\u2019t answered properly, if you want to ask an additional question, I\u2019d be glad to help.\nBrian Foran: No, I think that\u2019s helpful. And I guess maybe the follow on, I mean, is it \u2013 if I think about that kind of stereotypical medical property, that is the owner-occupied CRE or a piece of it, is it about growth in the market right now? Or is it about gaining market share or new geographies, I mean, where are you finding the incremental growth in that portfolio?\nFrank Holding: I think it\u2019s a little bit of both, because we are seeing that growth both in our, what we would consider our legacy footprint of North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and also in our other markets as well. So it\u2019s a combination of gaining new clients along with growth within our existing client base where they continue to expand and grow. And so those opportunities are on both sides of the ledger.\nBrian Foran: And I don\u2019t know if this is for Craig or Frank, but maybe on capital. I think you put out a 9.5% CET1 at deal close if I remember and I think that might\u2019ve even fully loaded merger costs. So it might even been a little conservative. I guess on the one hand, earnings for both you and CIT are coming in pretty good, maybe that CET1 ratio the marks might improve, so maybe that CET1 ratio comes higher. But you did referenced the Tier 1 leverage being a little depressed right now by PPP, by cash on the balance sheet. As we think about post-deal close, which one do you think will be the limiting factor, number one? And then number two, when you do re-emerge into an excess capital position, how do you think about the relative attractiveness of maybe a buyback versus maybe another deal or other uses of capital? So I guess what\u2019s the limiting factor posts the deal close and then, whenever you get back into an excess position what\u2019s kind of the waterfall of priorities?\nCraig Nix: Sure. Very good question. With respect to both CET1 and leverage, we really don\u2019t see either as a limiting factor. We are comfortable operating within those ranges or within that level. It falls in our ranges. So we\u2019re comfortable in operating there. And we do see both rebounding nicely as we start the earning streams as the combined company starts to kick in. So we have no concerns in operating those levels. With respect to acquisitions and repurchases, our first priority in 2021 will be to integrate CIT. So you wouldn\u2019t see certainly anything in that activity, in that right away. But we certainly see our long-term strategy is to be opportunistic with M&A opportunities. And that would include buying back our own stock.\nBrian Foran: If I could sneak one last one in, your noninterest bearing deposit, your demand deposit growth this year was pretty phenomenal on the order of 50% year-over-year. And I\u2019m assuming PPP played a part in that, maybe some companies getting cash and not fully using it yet. I wonder if you kind of have any thoughts on the stickiness of those noninterest bearing deposits going forward and once you get fully past PPP, any kind of insights you have into how much of that might stick around or could you actually continue to grow from these levels?\nFrank Holding: Yes. Tom Eklund on our treasurer will address that question.\nTom Eklund: Yes. I think you mentioned PPP growth. When we looked at the PPP program, we initially had basically one-for-one, we had $3 billion in checking growth resulting from the PPP program. However, when looking at by the end of the year, using sort of a watermark approach on that those balances were down to about $1 billion, up to $9 billion we grew for the year, about $1 billion came from that PPP program. When looking at it another way, of that $9 billion total deposit growth we did see $2.5 billion of that coming from new clients that was not clients going into 2020. So I think it\u2019s a little bit of both, we\u2019re seeing both existing clients, going back to Craig\u2019s point earlier holding more cash on their balance sheet, which resulted in about $6.5 billion for the growth and then $2.5 billion, which was a very strong year for us, where we were able to capitalize on some opportunities to add new clients as well on top of that.\nBrian Foran: That\u2019s great. Thank you for taking all my questions.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great, thanks. And maybe you could just expand a little on one of the points that you raised about the liquidity and how do you see it actually working in terms of the deploying your excess liquidity into CIT\u2019s book. Like what\u2019s the process, how long will it take? I assume that you\u2019ll have to at some point get rid of some of the funding that they\u2019ve got on the assets and can you just talk through like, what that will look like I guess from the second quarter on?\nTom Eklund: Yes, sure. This is Tom Eklund again. I think the way we\u2019re thinking about it is I think we\u2019ve been very clear on sort of from a business perspective. We\u2019re not looking to make any changes there. We\u2019re excited about the opportunities from the direct banks and some of the broader client footprint that CIT brings to the table. However, obviously when looking at the balance sheet, I\u2019m assuming we can accomplish the deal structure as proposed. The waterfall for us really starts with looking at some of those senior debt opportunities. Some of the non-core sort of funding pieces and see what we can do there to replay with, ideally with the low cost deposits. I mean, you mentioned where it\u2019s 10 basis points total deposit cost for the year. So obviously that provides potential synergistic opportunities for us in the future as we\u2019re able to reposition that. The maturity schedule of those mean that, not all that comes in early, it\u2019s something that we\u2019ll be facing over time as we start looking at those that instruments come up for maturity.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Thank you.\nOperator: I would now like to turn the conference to Mr. Tom Heath for any additional or closing remarks.\nTom Heath: Angie, that\u2019s all. We\u2019re good and thank you very much. Thank you all for joining us.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.",

However, obviously when looking at the balance sheet, I'm assuming we can accomplish the deal structure as proposed. The waterfall for us really starts with looking at some of those senior debt opportunities. Some of the non-core sort of funding pieces and see what we can do there to replay with, ideally with the low cost deposits. I mean, you mentioned where it's 10 basis points total deposit cost for the year. So obviously that provides potential synergistic opportunities for us in the future as we're able to reposition that. The maturity schedule of those mean that, not all that comes in early, it's something that we'll be facing over time as we start looking at those that instruments come up for maturity."

            "name": "Craig Nix",
            "content": "Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. As I'm sure you're aware, we released our fourth quarter earnings yesterday, along with a press release and investor deck. I will touch on our significant fourth quarter and full year financial highlights in my comments today. As Frank mentioned in his comments, we are very pleased to report a strong fourth quarter as well as full year results. Pages 4 and 5 of the investor deck provided our earnings highlights for the fourth quarter and for the year ended 2020. During the fourth quarter, we earned $133.4 million, an increase of 31% over the fourth quarter of 2019. Earnings translated into a return on average assets of 1.11% and a return on average equity of 14.02%. EPS was up 42.3% reflecting the positive impact of higher earnings in our earlier share repurchases. I will touch on some of the drivers behind our fourth quarter results on the ensuing pages, but the increase in quarter-over-quarter earnings was primarily driven by a 29.3% increase in pre-provision net revenue. Credit quality remained strong with comparable quarter net charge-offs declining from 14 basis points to 7 basis points. For the full year 2020, we are in $477.7 billion. This translated into a return on average assets of 1.07% and a return on average equity of 12.96%. Earnings for the full year were up 4.4%, while EPS was up 15.7%, again, reflecting the positive impact of higher earnings and of share repurchases. Similar to the quarterly results, pre-provision net revenue growth was the primary driver behind improved year-over-year earnings, but the impact was partially blunted by $36.1 million reserve build related to uncertainty around COVID-19. On Page 6, we take a look at net interest income and net interest margin. As we stated at the end of the third quarter, while the expected net interest margin continue to decline, we expected it to decline at a much more modest pace. This is what happened as net interest margin declined by 4 basis points on a linked quarter basis compared to a 41 basis points dropped between the first and second quarter. While the margin did decline during the quarter, net interest income was up by just over $5 million, driven primarily by acceleration of SBA-PPP interest income as loan forgiveness has picked up. I won't cover Page 7 in detail, but the page rolls forward, the drivers behind our margin change for the linked quarters and for the comparable quarters. Before I leave margin, a few points that I'd like to make. We have ample liquidity on the balance sheet and see that potentially going up due to strong core deposit growth. And while our liquidity is strong, this does present margin pressure as we keep increased levels of cash at the fed and the reinvestment opportunity is challenging given the low interest rate environment. We were prudently opportunistic throughout the quarter reinvesting cash flows and selling securities for gains to offset some of the margin pressure, but for the most part have retained a conservative posture with this liquidity. Our thinking here is that we see opportunities when we combine our balance sheet with CIT, hopefully during the second quarter. So at this point we believe there's value in being conservative with our liquidity. And for the margin looking forward, we expect deposit cost to continue to decline but they will not fall much further, so most of the benefit of lower deposit costs has already been realized. We expect that SBA-PPP interest income will continue to be a positive contributor to net interest margin and net interest income, but its impact will largely be offset by excess liquidity and lower earning asset yields. If you turn to Page 8, we will take a look at noninterest income. In general each of our fee income producing businesses did well and they remain very important to our customer relationship offering. Wealth management, card, merchant and mortgage all had good quarters and while deposit fees have not yet rebounded to the pre-COVID levels, they continued to rebound during the quarter. If you turn to Page 9, we'll take a look at our noninterest expense. We did see a slight uptick relative to the third quarter. So I want to give you a bit of color on some of the more significant factors that threw us off of our run rate. First, revenue producing lines of business finished out the year strong, resulting in higher incentive expense. Second building repairs and maintenance that were delayed in the second and third quarters due to COVID were incurred and paid during the fourth quarter. And finally foreclosure expense was up related to losses on the sale of two OREO properties during the quarter. Given the lumpy nature of these expenses, we do now expect fourth quarter to be reflective of our noninterest expense run rate moving forward. All-in our efficiency ratio in the fourth quarter was 64.28% well within an acceptable range for us giving both our operating strategy in the low interest rate environment. Page 10 provides a snapshot of the balance sheet. I will discuss loans and deposits in the next couple of pages, but I would like to point out a few things here. First, total assets grew by over 25% during the year, finishing the year at just under $50 billion. Asset growth was funded by strong organic core deposit growth and our loan-to-deposit ratio ex-PPP ended the year at 71.5%. Second thing I'd point out is that tangible book value per share a measure that we pay a close attention to ended the year at over $357 per share up 18.9% on a year-over-year basis. Page 11 provides a snapshot of our loan composition and growth. So the year loans were up 13.5%, stripping out both PPP and the impact of acquisitions growth was 4.9%, which we were pleased with particularly given the current operating backdrop. During the fourth quarter, loans were slightly down by 0.6%, but if you look ex-PPP pay downs, loans grew at an annualized rate of 7.9% indicative of loan activity picking up. Most of the loan growth for both the linked quarter and the year-over-year period was driven by owner-occupied commercial real estate lines. Going to Page 12, we wanted to give you a few comments on PPP. We are pleased that we helped our clients secure a meaningful amount of PPP loans, a vast majority of the loans went to small businesses. As of year-end we had received applications for forgiveness totaling to over 43% of the original loan amount and to almost 34% of the number of loans. We have received approximately 23% of the original loan amount from the SBA. We are actively managing the forgiveness process and expect that activity to continue to be meaningful during the first quarter. In addition, we will see more funding coming in the form of PPP round two. Overall the program has been very impactful to the business community and has been one more way for us to affirm our clients the true value of our focus on relationship banking. Pages 13 through 15 summarize our credit quality and allowance for credit losses trends. Good credit quality trends continued for both the fourth quarter and for the full year. Net charge offs were 7 basis points for the quarter and 8 basis points for the year. NPAs have been relatively stable throughout the year, they did spike during the first quarter of the year, but this was a function of both CECL accounting for PCI loan pools as well as a bucket of acquired loans re-classified as PCD. We did not take any further COVID related reserves in the fourth quarter that had taken 36.1 million in total during the first and second quarters of the year. Overall, the allowance for credit losses is 0.74% of loans ex-PPP representing 9.25 times annual net charge offs on a loan book with an average life of approximately four years. Turning to Page 16, I want to briefly touch on deposits. Total deposits grew at an annualized rate of 11.1% during the fourth quarter and by 26.1% on a year-over-year basis. Adjusting for acquisitions and estimated PPP deposits, deposits grew by almost 23% organically on a year-over-year basis. Our deposit base continues to be generated from our core relationship oriented clientele. Noninterest bearing deposits grew by over 5 billion during the year or about over 39% and stood at 41.5% of total deposits as of year-end. We continue to attribute our strong core deposit growth to many factors, including day-to-day focus on relationship banking, a flight to quality and challenging economic times, lower-consumer spending and consequently higher deposit balances, and commercial and business customers holding more cash in their deposit accounts due to economic uncertainty. Page 17 shows that deposits continue to make up the bulk of our funding. The only real change of note in our funding profile since 2019 is that we did opportunistically add some subordinated debt during the first quarter to round out our capital stack and to support earning asset growth. Of note is that our cost of interest bearing deposits decreased by 5 basis points during the quarter and by 27 basis points since the first quarter. Our overall cost of deposits declined by 18 points at the first quarter and by 3 basis points on a linked quarter basis and stood at 10 basis points at year-end. We expect this may fall to mid-to-upper single digits next year, so not much more room to fall from here. On Page 18, we will give you a quick snapshot of the capital ratios and their evolution since the end of 2019. All of our capital ratios are healthy and well within both regulatory and internal guidelines. I would call out that our Tier 1 leverage ratio has been most impacted by the asset growth we have experienced this year, particularly as a result of the SBA-PPP loans program. The actual Tier 1 leverage ratio was 7.86% at year end, but ex-PPP would have been 8.45%. We are comfortable in operating at our current capital levels. Finally, on Page 19, we wanted to give you a general outlook on the first quarter, while we expect net interest margin to decline, we think the worst of it is behind us. We expect that net interest income will decrease slightly on a linked quarter basis due to the impact of lower earning asset yields, more than offsetting the acceleration of PPP interest income, loan growth and lower deposit costs. Fee income generating businesses continue to do well and should hold their top trend, but it remains dependent on the continuous of the economic recovery. We were expecting a slight uptick in net charge offs primarily because they are currently at such historically low levels and the temporary impacts of economic stimulus could subside. But overall, we do not expect credit quality trends to change significantly. They should remain relatively consistent and continue to be a source of strength. Non-interest expense should return to normalized levels as the benefits of converting acquired banks are realized. We expect loan growth SPP to be low to mid single digits, and we expect to see continued deposit growth in the same range. To close, our focus in the first quarter will be; one, integration of First Citizens and CIT; two, continued organic growth and profitability; three, maintaining discipline on credit quality, customer selection and retention; and four, maintaining prudent expense control. Thank you all for joining us today. I will now open it up for Q&A. Okay, Craig Nix's here. We have not updated those pro formas and we're going to \u2013 and we will be doing that here soon. We do acknowledge that the economic outlook in general has improved since we established our original marks and established those pro formas. We are also encouraged with CIT's fourth quarter results. We did create our marks and assumptions based on the best information we had at the time in the fall of last year. And again, we plan to establish final marks as transaction close, and we'll consider the facts and circumstances at that time, but right now we're not ready to provide additional guidance. But we are \u2013 I can tell you, we are encouraged our eyes on the ball in integrating CIT. And we don't think things have gotten any worse. I'm going to ask Jim Bryan, our Chief Credit Officer to address that question. Sure. Very good question. With respect to both CET1 and leverage, we really don't see either as a limiting factor. We are comfortable operating within those ranges or within that level. It falls in our ranges. So we're comfortable in operating there. And we do see both rebounding nicely as we start the earning streams as the combined company starts to kick in. So we have no concerns in operating those levels. With respect to acquisitions and repurchases, our first priority in 2021 will be to integrate CIT. So you wouldn't see certainly anything in that activity, in that right away. But we certainly see our long-term strategy is to be opportunistic with M&A opportunities. And that would include buying back our own stock."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. There will be a question-and-answer session later in the call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Barbara Callahan, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed, ma\u2019am.\nBarbara Callahan: Thank you, Rocco. Good morning and welcome to CIT\u2019s second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Our call today will be hosted by Ellen Alemany, Chairwoman and CEO; and John Fawcett, our CFO. Also joining us for the Q&A discussion is our Chief Credit Officer, Marisa Harney. During this call, we\u2019ll be referencing a presentation that is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at cit.com. Our forward-looking statements disclosure and non-GAAP reconciliations are included in today\u2019s earnings materials and within our SEC filings. These cover our presentation materials, prepared comments and the questions-and-answers segment of today\u2019s call. With that, I\u2019ll now turn it over to Ellen Alemany.\nEllen Alemany: Thanks, Barbara. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. The COVID-19 pandemic has continued to affect the broader economy. And that has carried over to our financial results in the second quarter, although to a lesser degree than we experienced in the first quarter. As a result, we posted a net loss this period of $98 million or $0.99 per diluted common share. CIT began this year in position of strength with the multi-year strategic transformation reinforcing our foundation and the completion of the recent acquisition adding to our franchise capability. That strength along with the agility of our team will help us to continue to navigate through this unprecedented time. John will go into a detailed account of the drivers in the quarter, but some key factors in the performance were lower net finance revenue, primarily due to lower interest rates and holding elevated levels of liquidity during this turbulent period; lower factoring commissions due to retail store closures; and the $73 million net charge-off related to a single factoring bankruptcy exposure. We also continued to build our allowance for credit losses, but with the substantial reserve bills in the first quarter, the impact on our provision was much slower. Despite these factors, there were also pockets of strength in the quarter. Our average deposit costs declined by 27 basis points. And we were able to use some excess liquidity to repurchase 235 million of unsecured bank notes at a discount. Our average loans and leases were up 2% from last quarter, which included defensive draws on results in March, as well as new originations in stronger segments of the commercial market. Our capital and liquidity positions remained strong. Our integration plan from the recent acquisition is on track and we are unlocking greater operating efficiencies than originally anticipated. Our operations continued uninterrupted with all our branches remaining open and our customer operations running smoothly, many in a remote model. And we are proactively managing our credit risk through this dynamic period. I want to spend some time on what we're seeing in the business and how we're leveraging our strengths in the current environment. First and foremost, CIT's business model is very diverse. We operate across a variety of commercial segments that have deep industry and asset class expertise to support those segments. That is a tremendous advantage across market cycles, enables us to pivot quickly, take advantage of attractive opportunities and manage our exposure in areas that are more directly impacted by the current environment. And that's exactly what we've done for this pandemic. Let me focus on a few of the opportunities first. The power and renewables business has continued to be very active with virtually no disruption through the pandemic. And CIT is a leader in this space, ranking third in the league tables. We closed five deals where we were the leader of [indiscernible] since March, we have another 10 lead deals in the pipeline for the second half. Most recently we announced $118 million deal for 112 megawatt solar facility in North Carolina, which demonstrates the continued demand for renewable power. In addition, we are seeing strong transaction activity in the technology media and telecom division, a stay-at-home guidelines have supported continued investment in telecom infrastructure, cloud based data centers, as well as additional streaming media content production and distribution. Our capital equipment finance division had a record quarter as borrowers were looking to leverage their fixed assets. We were able to finance several investment grade and near investment grade borrowers given our deep asset class expertise. There are good yields in this asset class, and we were also able to opportunistically purchase small portfolios from larger banks looking to manage obligor limits. CIT has a long history in the asset based lending business, and this is an area where we are expanding as we see some solid opportunities in the pipeline for the second half that align with our capabilities. And on the business capital front, we began to see an uptake in applications and volume toward the end of the quarter as certain businesses started to return to their operations. As a result, our volumes in June were consistent with where they were a year ago. In short, we are seeing opportunities open-up and our agility, expertise and balance sheet strengths have allowed us to capture those opportunities. Credit, of course, does remained a challenge in this environment, but many of the qualities I mentioned that help us originate business also help us manage our risk. Our size, industry knowledge and asset class expertise allow us to adapt quickly and proactively manage issues when they arise. As soon as the pandemic began, we implemented heightened monitoring and portfolio management practices. That included a loan by loan review, daily portfolio and industry reporting and redeployment of resources to help manage portfolios that are most affected by the economic disruption. We have granted relief across more than 10,000 smaller ticket business capital loans and leases, and about 200 commercial finance and real estate contracts totaling about $2 billion in net investment combined. And we are underwriting each larger ticket loan modification to ensure there was a path to recovery. We participated in the PPP program with the majority of customers accessing the program, being community based small businesses in our branch footprint. We also recently launched the main street lending program for our mid-sized clients. We are staying disciplined to find new opportunities and assist our current customers through this period when possible. Before I pass it to John, I want to touch on some of our strategic initiatives. The integration of our recent acquisition of the former Mutual of Omaha Bank is progressing nicely and remains on track for this year and ahead of schedule on operating efficiencies. Despite all the complexity the pandemic has brought, the team is making great progress and bringing together the teams, technology, products and footprint. The home owner association deposit team is hitting their goals with average HOA deposits of 8% to $5.3 billion. This was great progress and was a key driver of the acquisition. Continuing to build out this channel will give us even greater funding flexibility and at lower costs. Likewise, the newly integrated treasury and payment services team is bringing an additional commercial deposits for new and existing clients also at lower costs. These average deposits are up 18% in the quarter to $3.9 billion with costs down to 43 basis points. Build out of these deposit channels compliment our consumer deposits in the direct and branch channels and provide greater funding flexibility and diversity. As part of our integration efforts, we also recently signed an agreement to sell the wealth management business that was part of the former Mutual of Omaha Bank product offering. As we conducted a strategic review of the business, we determined it was not the right fit for our model. It's a very small transaction and it's more about CIT focusing on areas of strength and divesting of activities that are not aligned to our strategy. We expect the deal to close in the coming months and we will provide additional detail at that time. As I mentioned, we are unlocking synergies through the acquisition faster than anticipated. And as a result, we'll be realizing about $25 million of our 2021 costs saves ahead of schedule this year. In recent years, CIT has proven time and time again that we have a culture of performance and the fortitude to deliver on our commitments and continuously improve. That spirit remains through this pandemic. We understand the economic disruption is not behind us yet. However, we took prudent actions in the first half of the year to anticipate the impact of this downturn based on the best available information. While the environment remains dynamic based on what we know today, we are cautiously optimistic for the second half of the year and in our ability to restore a modest level of profitability, assuming the macroeconomic environment does not deteriorate further. With that, I'll turn it to John.\nJohn Fawcett: Thank you, Ellen, and good morning, everyone. As mentioned, we reported a GAAP net loss of $98 million or $0.99 cents per diluted common share, and a loss of $61 million or $0.62 per share, excluding noteworthy items. Our results this quarter continued to reflect the ongoing global pandemic and low interest rates as we manage through the current environment. Overall business activity slowed in the earlier part of the quarter, but in June, we began to see activity pickup in many sectors where we have strong capabilities. Assuming there is no significant change in the current or forecasted macro environment or any expected credit performance of our portfolio, we expect to return to profitability and generate modest positive earnings in both the third and fourth quarters of 2020. Last quarter, we were proactive in our implementation of CECL and appropriately added substantial reserves, reflecting the COVID-19 environment. While this quarters credit provision was considerably lower than in the prior quarter, it remained elevated as we continued to bolster reserves and incurred a $73 million charge related to the bankruptcy of a single factoring customer in the retail industry. The factoring loss was a result of unique circumstances directly related to the precipitous economic shutdown and store closures. While we have reserved for additional charges in the retail industry, we do not anticipate another single customer loss of that magnitude in our factoring business. Overall, based on our forecasted view of the macro environment, we expect the provision to continue to moderate next quarter, obviously subject to conditions which remain fluid. Our net finance revenue and margin were significantly impacted this quarter by lower market rates, primarily LIBOR, which reduced our floating rate loan yields. In addition, we have higher levels of excess cash, primarily due to strong deposit growth, which we estimate reduced our margin by 30 basis points as it earned only about 10 basis points at the Fed. We took actions to offset some of this margin pressure by lowering our deposit costs throughout the quarter, particularly in our online channel, where we lowered our Savings Builder rate by 80 basis points to below 1% at quarter end. We utilized some of our excess cash to tender for our unsecured bank notes, repurchasing $235 million at a discount recognizing a $15 million gain and reducing interest expense by approximately $7 million annually. Assuming LIBOR rates remain relatively constant, we believe the margin has bottom and we will see a 10 to 20 basis point improvement over the course of the third and fourth quarters as the benefits of lower deposit costs continue to be realized and we reduced our excess liquidity. Other noninterest income was impacted this quarter by lower factoring commissions, as volumes declined considerably due to retail store closures. We also had lower gains on asset sales. As we suspended. Some of our portfolio management activities. Factoring volumes improved in the first half of July and we have been running at approximately 98% of 2019 levels as retailers replenish inventory. While we expect factoring volumes and commissions to improve from the second quarter levels, uncertainty around the back-to-school season may temper that improvement. We are also seeing renewed opportunities to resume selling pools of loans in our legacy consumer mortgage portfolio, and would expect to complete a transaction if existing conditions continue to prevail. We continue to look for opportunities to improve our operating efficiency. This quarter, we took a restructuring charge of $37 million primarily related to employee costs and contract terminations. $15 million was already planned as part of the Mutual of Omaha Bank merger and integration costs, while the other $22 million related to cost reduction initiatives that we expect to realize over the next 12 to 18 months. We are lowering our full year 2020 operating expense target, excluding noteworthy items and intangible asset amortization by $25 million to approximately $1.185 billion, as we are realizing some of our 2021 cost savings ahead of schedule. This reduction includes the acceleration of cost synergies related to the integration of Mutual of Omaha bank as we bring our two businesses together. In addition, we are responding quickly to the current environment, which has allowed us to accelerate our plans to rationalize our footprint, including the optimization of former of Mutual of Omaha Bank branches and the streamlining of office locations. We plan to reduce our occupancy by 500,000 square feet, representing 30% of our total footprint. These actions are expected to result in an impairment charge of approximately $15 million in the fourth quarter with an estimated payback period of 18 months or less. We remain focused on continuous improvement and we'll provide an update to our 2020 operating expense target as we gain more clarity on the operating environment. I will now provide some additional color on our operating trends and refer to our earnings presentation, starting with net finance revenue and margin on Slide 7 and 8. As I mentioned, the sharp decline in both net finance revenue and margin were primarily driven by lower market rates and a higher mix of cash. Average LIBOR rapidly declined by around a 100 basis points this quarter, impacting margin by approximately 40 basis points as our floating rate loan yields declined. About 60% of our floating rate loans have interest rates floors. And since the downturn, we have been getting LIBOR floors of 75 to 100 basis points on most new commercial loan originations in commercial finance and seeing improvement in spreads in many of our industry verticals. As I mentioned, the higher mix of cash coupled with lower rates also negatively impacted our margin by 30 basis points. We expect some of this to reverse as we deploy our excess liquidity and higher cost term CDs runoff. Lower rail utilization and renewal rates, as well as increased storage costs for cars off-lease reduced margin by 10 basis points in the quarter. The North American industry rail car fleet continues to be oversupplied with 32% of the fleet now in storage driven by the general slowdown in economic activity. While our fleet is diverse and representative of the broader economy, many car types saw a reduction in utilization and pricing on new leases. Our rail utilization declined approximately 300 basis points to 88% and lease renewables repriced down 30% this quarter, reflecting current market conditions and the mix of cars that came up for renewal. In particular, sand cars used in the E&P space weighed heavily on repricing activity this quarter, while grain cars, plastic pellet covered hoppers and certain box bars continued to renew at above average rates. Macro indicators in recent weeks are starting to show some real recovery from COVID-19 as many factories have resumed at least partial production late in the quarter. And although still well below 2019 levels, rail loadings have improved over the past few weeks from the COVID-19 trough levels. As the economy starts to recover and commodity prices drift higher, we expect rail utilization and pricing to improve. Although with a bit of a lag as excess capacity from cars and storage, but still on lease will be brought online first. With that background, assuming the forecasted macro environment, we anticipate a modest reduction in net rail yields over the next two quarters as leases continue to reprice down. We expect utilization to push back up into the low 90% area over the next few quarters and improve to the mid 90% area by the end of 2021. We believe our young diverse fleet with more high load capacity cars are competitive advantages, resulting in higher demand for our rail cars, while sand cars used in E&P space, particularly fracking, are expected to continue to weigh on the recovery. On the liability side to offset the impact of low rates on our assets, we have been aggressively lowering deposit costs. We improved our margin by 21 basis points in the quarter as CDs repriced lower and we lowered our non-maturity deposit rates across all deposit channels. The biggest rate decline in the quarter was in our online channel, where we lowered our Savings Builder rate by 80 basis points ending the quarter below 1%. We also grew average lower cost HOA and commercial deposits by about $1 billion, further contributing to lower deposit costs. The HOA deposit channel reached its highest level ever at $5.3 billion and growth in commercial deposits was driven by both new and existing commercial clients, while cost declined by about 20 basis points. As Ellen indicated, we are pleased with the progress we are making expanding these channels and remain on pace to realize growth projections in the HOA channel. As I indicated earlier, we expect the margin will improve over the course of the third and fourth quarters by 10 to 20 basis points as the full impact of the recent rate reductions are realized along with continued downward repricing, a reduction in maturing CDs and growth of lower cost HOA commercial deposit channels. In addition, we continue to look for opportunities to reduce non maturity deposit rates while balancing our liquidity needs. Slide 12 provides more detail on average loans and leases by division. Average loans leases grew by 2% this quarter, which includes the impact of increased defensive revolver draws in commercial finance at the end of March, new business volume in key sectors where we are seeing opportunities in the current environment and a lower level of prepayments. End of period balances declined as repayment of factoring invoices outpaced new factoring volume and the defensive revolver draws will end -- of last quarter were repaid. While origination volumes were down reflecting the current environment, we continue to close deals for our clients and are seeing opportunities in certain industry verticals and equipment leasing, lending where we have strong workplace -- strong leadership, as well as industry and asset class expertise. New business activity in commercial finance was driven by key verticals, such as power and renewables and technology, media and telecom, which included opportunities for capital markets and derivative fees. As Ellen indicated, we are also seeing good opportunities in the current environment within capital equipment finance. Overall pipelines in commercial finance are lower than last year, reflecting the business slow down, but we continue to see increased activity in the areas I just mentioned, along with healthcare and assets based lending. We are also seeing wider spreads and structural improvements, including LIBOR floors on new originations. In business capital, equipment finance is taking market share as other small ticket equipment lenders have paused or exited the market. We are also seeing increased demand in programs where we partner with technology manufacturers to provide financing to their customers. In small business solutions, we are taking a more focused approach in providing lending in industries less impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, while pulling back from certain higher risk industries. Overall, business capital applications, which had slowed considerably earlier this quarter have seen a pickup in the past several weeks as June origination volume increased to June 2019 levels. We remain cautiously optimistic for increase in origination activity in the third quarter in select areas. As Ellen mentioned, we continue to work with our customers to provide payment deferrals for qualifying customers impacted by the economic events brought upon by COVID-19. As of the end of the quarter, we had granted relief requests to about 1,700 consumer customers with a carrying value of approximately $630 million. We also granted about $1.4 billion in relief requests for over 200 commercial transactions across commercial finance and real estate finance, as well as $550 million representing approximately 10,000 smaller ticket equipment contracts in business capital, and another $180 million over 100 contracts in our small business administration business. It is still early days as some of the first deferrals are just expiring, but so far the trends are relatively consistent with our expectations and we have been staying close with our customers. As an example, we conducted a comprehensive calling campaign making about 9,000 outbound calls to our small business solutions customer over the quarter, and continue to be in touch with them as the deferral period ends. In our middle market loan book, we have not experienced a large second wave of deferrals yet, but expect deferral requests in the third quarter, as borrowers begin refining their 12 to 18 months financial forecasts. We are closely monitoring this activity and have provided some additional information on Slide 3 of the presentation. Overall, we think average loans and leases will be relatively flat next quarter, reflecting the lower end of period second quarter balances, and as we continue to support our customers and focus on our originations activity on strong risk adjusted opportunities that play to our strengths. Slide 15 and 16 highlights our credit trends and provision. Net charge-offs increased significantly this quarter to $170 million. Apart from the one factoring customer bankruptcy of $73 million that I previously mentioned, net charge-offs were $97 million or 1.02% of loans about three quarters of which were already reserved for, and therefore did not have a specific impact on our provision. The retail sector had been facing headwinds prior to this current crisis, and we had been actively reducing exposure to trouble retailers prior to the onset of COVID-19. The $73 million charge related to a single factoring bankruptcy was unanticipated and a direct result of the retail shutdown, which precipitated a voluntary bankruptcy. While there were a number of retail bankruptcies this quarter with the exception of the one I just mentioned, we did not have exposure to those names or we had previously exited or reduced our exposures to low levels prior to the bankruptcy. We expect continued pressure in this industry and we are monitoring the developments in the sector closely and remain in constant contact with our customers and clients. Our current factoring exposure in the retail sector is approximately $1.7 billion, down considerably from $2.9 billion at the end of last quarter, as collections have outpaced new factoring volume, driven by store closures brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, only $250 million of receivables had extended terms at the end of June, down from $900 million in April. Our top 25 exposures include traditional retailers as well as well-known online big box and discount retailers. The top five customers, which are rated single A to AA comprise a little over 40% of total factored retail exposure. The next 10 largest exposures are between $25 million to just under $50 million of which five are investment grade with the largest being non-investment grade. After that, the remaining customer base comprising approximately $600 million exposure is very diversified across approximately 28,000 accounts. As I mentioned, so far July activity has been surprisingly strong as retailers look to restock depleted inventory levels. We are also seeing strength in the furniture sector and increased factoring volume with discount retailers. That said, a second wave of COVID-19, which could result in reduced traffic and/or store closures remains a concern. We\u2019ve a robust approval and monitoring framework in place to review customer exposures on a weekly and monthly basis and where appropriate we continue to implement risk mitigation actions and price enhancements. With respect to our credit reserves, this quarter we established reserves of $58 million on individually evaluated accounts and increased our collectively evaluated reserves by $107 million for on balance sheet exposures. This quarter, we utilized the June baseline scenario from a provider well-known in the industry that assumed a more V-shaped recession and longer recovery than the March baseline scenarios that we had used to determine our credit provision in the first quarter. We also apply to qualitative overlay for other factors that include macro uncertainty, model uncertainty and sensitivity to changes in assumptions as well as additional risk to specific industries or portfolio segments, such as oil and gas factoring at small ticket commercial loans. As a result, our coverage ratio increased approximately 40 basis points to 3.5% on commercial banking loans and 30 basis points to 3.2% for total loans. Assuming no significant change in the outlook, we expect the provision to continue to moderate next quarter. Nonaccrual loans increased significantly in the quarter, primarily driven by loans in commercial finance and real estate finance. As Ellen indicated, we have put in place heightened monitoring to carefully watch specific industry trends and indicators of delinquencies. In commercial finance, real estate finance and rail, we have conducted a loan by loan review, identified higher risk exposures, performed stress analyses and prioritized our most vulnerable accounts. We are monitoring revolver advances and borrower relief requests for vulnerable borrowers on a daily basis. We have also adjusted our underwriting to reflect the current environment. We are individually underwriting, each transaction request for modification in commercial finance and real estate finance and rail to ensure the borrower has a path to recovery. We have restricted our underwriting in the most distressed industries and suspended auto decisioning in acute areas of risk. We are staying disciplined in our pricing and structures, while continuing to evaluate opportunities that utilize our capital most efficiently. We have updated our slides in the appendix for additional information on portions of our portfolio expected to be more impacted by the current environment. Slide 17 highlights our liquidity position at quarter end. Our liquidity remains robust at both the bank and the bank holding company. During the quarter, we issued $500 million of unsecured debt at just 3.929% at the bank holding company, and our next maturity is not until March of 2021 and it's for the same amount with a coupon of 4.08 [ph]. At the bank, we increased our available borrowing capacity at the federal home loan bank with the assets acquired for Mutual of Omaha Bank, substantially increasing our sources of contingent liquidity. Turning to Slide 18, our common equity Tier 1 ratio advanced 30 basis points in the quarter and remain strong at 10%, well in excess of the federal reserves minimum levels, including the capital conservation buffer. The growth in the ratio this quarter was driven by the decline in the end of period loans and a mix shift to lower risk weighted assets, including cash and PPP loans, which have risk weightings of zero. As the economy starts to recover and business activity improves, we expect risk weighted assets to increase from the deployment of excess liquidity and a lower level of PPP loans. We also expect positive earnings will offset the deployment of capital. Over the next two quarters, assuming the current forecasted macro environment, we expect our common equity levels to remain at 9 -- in the 9.8% to 10% range, depending on the mix of lower risk weighted assets. And with that, I will turn it back over to Ellen.\nEllen Alemany: Thanks, John. As I've mentioned before, the work we have done to transform CIT over the last few years has strengthened us, tested us and best positioned us to navigate this period. The business is diverse and adaptable. The company is as strong as it's ever been and our deposit costs are declining. The management team is seasoned, agile and resilient. We established a considerable appropriate reserve in the first path to increase our allowance for credit losses and actively manage risks. And we are heading into the second half cautiously optimistic, but also mindful that this is a rapidly changing environment. With that, we're happy to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. Thanks. John, you had talked about the 10 to 20 basis points recovery in the margin. I guess, given the cuts you made in deposit costs, I'm surprised that it isn't bigger. Could you just talk a little bit about what we might see in Q3 in terms of trends in the margin and in net interest income in dollars or net finance revenue in dollars? Thanks.\nJohn Fawcett: Yes. So, Moshe, it's important to -- I think have a perspective on when the cutting began. And so I think very early in the second quarter, we put our toe in the water a little bit, and we had some very minor cuts across April because we were concerned about would be significant amount of attrition. As we've gone further and further, we've realized that, a lot of the strategies that we built out in the non maturity portfolio in the online bank is actually taking a whole. And across 13 weeks in the quarter, we actually reduced rates 80 basis points across 10 cuts and actually had consistent growth across all 13 weeks, which is kind of interesting. So to answer your question, we expect that a lot of the benefits that we'll go through that we -- in terms of the cuts that we did in second quarter, we'll continue to play through, into the third quarter and beyond. Separately, what I would say is, is that we think that there is continued opportunity to kind of drag pricing down even further, especially in the non-maturity deposit space. But I think across the board, we've done actually a pretty good job in terms of all of the deposit channels. In terms of the broader question around net interest income, the second quarter was pretty challenging. I think it was, clearly the bottom for us. And just in terms of business volumes I think in my script, we talked about business capital kind of coming back online. We're starting to see some shoots -- green shoots come out of the factoring business through the first, I want to say, 17 days of July, factoring volumes were at 97% of what they were last year. Business capital, which was down 30% in the first quarter actually hit what it had done in June of 2019. Our business capital guys are now thinking that notwithstanding the impact of the second quarter we expect to get 90% of origination volumes. And so the business feels like its transitioning. And these are essentially used equipment in business capital. And it's our fastest growing business in terms of imaging technology and phone systems. As I said, more runway on deposits, we think that we know that there are some deposit cliffs in CDs that will be repriced down substantially and also lead to some runoffs. And I think the lower rates may push some of the excess liquidity out at the same time as business starts to reinflate, hopefully it will consume with some of the excess liquidity. In terms of -- I'm not going to give you dollar amounts in terms of what expectations are in the third and fourth quarter, it's obviously incredibly fluid. And as we've said, these are modest levels of returns of profitability. I think the last driver in the net finance margin and net interest income is obviously going to be around rail. And so we've again, started to see some green shoots in rail and it got whacked pretty good in the second quarter. But coming into June and in July, what we've seen in terms of rail loadings that's actually started to go up. And so we expect that utilization will continue to crawl up. We've seen hopefully the worst in terms of storage freight and switching costs. And renewal rates, notwithstanding the fact that utilization will increase renewal rates, well, I think we're still forecasting to be down around 20% until we see some of the larger North American excess capacity utilized.\nMoshe Orenbuch: So maybe if I could just take this from a slightly different angle. You had PPNR, that was about $200 million in the fourth quarter down to $180 million in the first quarter, maybe $110 million or so this quarter, that would benefit from some of the things you talked about on the fee income side and expenses. I mean, I guess, are you confident that number will be higher in the third quarter?\nJohn Fawcett: Yes, I am confident. I mean, based on what we're seeing now, look, these are very fluid times. And so at this nanosecond, I feel pretty confident that the third quarter is going to be better. As you start to look at non-interest income, as I said, we're seeing factoring volumes kind of ramp back up. Rail sales in the second quarter were slightly diminished and a little bit off of what our forecast was of '20. We expect we'll be on '20 as some of the dislocation in that market normalizes. We completely suspended legacy consumer mortgage portfolio sales in the second quarter. The pricing had just completely collapsed and we're not distressed sellers. And so we just took a pause. We'd expect that the activity that we didn't see in the second quarter, will transition into the third quarter, and we will probably see a double sized sale. What comes with that is not only the gain on the disposition of the LCM portfolio, but also provision and release related to the gross to purchase account accretion. Securities gains should hold in, and capital markets fees, I think will continue to kind of trend as the market starts to advance. And then I think on expenses, we're all over expenses. Reducing our footprint by 30% and taking out another body of heads we're very focused. And so we are \u2026\nEllen Alemany: And we accelerated another $25 million in expenses this year from Mutual of Omaha Bank that\u2019s supposed to come out next year. I would say business overall is significantly up in June. I would say in commercial, April and May were very slow, but we really started to see increased activity in June in certain industry verticals. And in business capital, we had the same volumes in June as we had June of last year. And it's technology related, mostly it's lender finance and business capital. So we think we're really well positioned in some of these industry niches right now. And as John mentioned, in rail, we think we've seen the trial in rail. Basically with the U.S.-China Phase 1 trade agreement, we're seeing renewed activity in rail. We had really large order. We've seen the largest corn order from rail -- from China recently. And we also think that the trade one agreement is going to impact other markets like crude oil, refined products. And housing activity bounce is driving some demand for lumber products. So we're seeing some activity there.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Arren Cyganovich with Citi. Please go ahead.\nArren Cyganovich: Thanks. The net finance margin, I think you mentioned was depressed from excess cash, I think you said around 30 basis points. How much of that will -- is incorporated in the improvement of 10 to 20 basis points? And, I guess, how do you expect to deploy that cash over the coming quarters?\nJohn Fawcett: Well, hopefully, Arren, these two things that are the principle dynamics, one is that as we continue to reduce pricing on the deposit product you would expect to see some deposits attrite. And I think that's okay. I think the other thing is, is that we've got some fairly high deposit cliffs that are actually coming in terms of CDs across the third quarter. And so some of that will attrite. What would be best is if we could actually put the deposits to work in growth that we're seeing on the balance sheet as we kind of re re-inflate. I think the interesting thing about the whole deposit phenomenon is the last time this happened, it happened during the financial crisis of '08, '09 and '10. And if you looked at search deposits, which is, I guess, what they call it now the hoarding of cash, like the quality, exit of equities and money market funds, delayed investments, all that kind of activity that actually ran its course over four or five years. And so, hypothetically, this could be something that we're living with for a long time, not just us, but all banks as cash continues to be trapped on the balance sheet. I think what's different about this financial crisis is this one's bacterial. The last one was a real financial crisis. And so as vaccines and we start to live with this, maybe it will be a little bit different. But right now we're sitting with $2 billion to $3 billion of excess liquidity and cash on the balance sheet. And the expectation is it will start to moderate, but it's anyone's guess as to how long it will take. We will be aggressive in terms of lowering our rates, and I think that will take care of some of the problem. But it might be a multi-quarter issue for sure.\nArren Cyganovich: Okay. And then in the -- on the payment deferral side, frankly, I'm a little bit surprised that some of the deferral numbers are low, just, I guess, for example, real estate finance, I think there's only 5% of the total compared to some of the other statistics I've seen from other banks. And then, I guess, in concurrent with that as the NPA is rising, what are the situations where you have stuff that is moving to NPA versus getting a deferral? And what are those situations where it just is so dire that you can't seem to be able to even come up with a plan from a deferral strategy?\nEllen Alemany: Marisa, you want to comment on that?\nMarisa Harney: Yes. I think there were three questions in there. Let me see if I can get them. The low level of deferral, I would say we took an early approach to and I don't know how different we are from others. I've had some anecdotal feedback, but we were pretty cautious with granting deferrals. For example, you can have a deferral for up to 180 days. We chose to do a 90-day deferral with a subsequent 90 days upon further information. We also have a commercial book that has a lot of private equity structures in it. And in many cases, although the operation of a company might be stressed due to the pandemic. The sponsor continues to have liquidity to support -- and this is particularly true in real estate finance to support those borrowers. And so we chose not to automatically grant the deferral or to push a deferral in those situations, but rather to press investors to try to solve that with some liquidity. And that in particular is true in real estate finance, which tends to be a more institutional book and therefore has more well-healed sponsorship behind it. With respect to NPAs, we took the approach that if a business, an operation was in -- it was shut down or had significant disruption due to the pandemic. However, we felt that the recovery period where -- whenever and wherever that might be was going to be particularly extended and would result in that particular business not being restored to its - for lack of a better term, normal, whatever that is, say that we would handle that as you would normally handle a credit that was distressed. So, for example, if a hospitality property is closed, we feel that the hospitality industry has a long recovery ahead of it. That's also true for passenger airlines, for example. And in those cases and those -- those are two areas that drove our NPAs this quarter, the increase in NPAs.\nArren Cyganovich: Okay. Thank you.\nMarisa Harney: Sure.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Today's next question comes from Vincent Caintic with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nVincent Caintic: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Two questions. First one, a quick one on just how you're thinking about the dividend. So your capital levels have remained strong, but I'm wondering if there are any changes to your thinking about the dividend level, just given that EPS coverage has been low with the past two quarters.\nJohn Fawcett: I think it's a quarter-to-quarter exercise. I think it's obviously a conversation we have at our Board. I think it's obviously a conversation that we have with our regulatory partners. My view is that we're in a good place. I think we've been very good stewards of capital. When you think about the Mutual of Omaha Bank transaction, well ahead of that transaction we suspended share repurchases. We've always maintained a fairly modest dividend payout ratio. To the extent that we believe that we're returning to modest level of profitability, it feels like the horses are out of the barn. We've kind of done this significant amount of reserving in the first quarter and took for our lumps in the first quarter and augmented that in the second quarter. The impact on common equity Tier 1 ratio is about 7 basis points. We have ample liquidity at the holding company, ample liquidity at the bank. And the principal driver of the first half financial performance has been provisioning, which essentially is a transfer of loss absorbency from capital to ACL. And if you actually want to get wonky about '09, '04, which is actually governs our ability to pay dividends and the conversation we talk to the Fed about, it was written in 2009 when GAAP relied on incurred losses and less on the notion of the crystal ball embedded in CECL. So there's a kind of very fundamental misalignment between supervision and regulation guidance established in 2009 GAAP, which accelerated loss recognition in an almost spontaneous way. And so that's a challenge. And I guess the last couple of points and you said it is, our capital ratios are strong and above capital conservation buffers and we've maintained a very robust capital planning process. So notwithstanding the fact that we're not a CCAR bank, we're no longer SIFI. I'm not sure why we ever were. But we've maintained all of those protocols. And I think our regulators understand that and appreciate the fact that we've been throughout the babies in the bathwater. We\u2019ve continued to operate with very heightened standards around capital and capital planning. It's a long winded way of saying I'm pretty relaxed with it.\nVincent Caintic: Okay, great. It's very helpful. Second question. So you had commentary -- your commentary on June is very positive and your baseline assumptions for V-shaped recovery. Just wondering if you've had maybe any updates from July so far, if there's been any letup just from what we're kind of seeing in the news about maybe a second wave or some state shutting down? Just any updates from what you're seeing here? Thank you.\nEllen Alemany: Yes. The business volume we do monthly reviews with the businesses and most of that activity was June reported activity and it's very, very current. And Marissa, can you just comment on the credit side, if you\u2019ve seen anything in terms of pockets?\nMarisa Harney: Yes. No. I mean, obviously, we\u2019re watching the situation very closely. Clearly at the end of March, the economy was shocked by a complete shutdown. In my opinion, I don't think we're going to see a wholesale nationwide shutdown. Again, I just don\u2019t think it's politically expedient. However, local markets are clearly experiencing a variety of different stresses. Probably, the single on the pulse of that is in our factoring business where clients who are typically wholesalers or manufacturers, are seeing orders pick up as retailing has opened. And we\u2019re still seeing factoring volume pretty strong in the month -- at the beginning in month of July. But it's obviously kind of too soon to tell whether we\u2019re going to see significant shutdowns ordered or involuntary, meaning people just don\u2019t show up in some of the bigger markets. No, I don\u2019t see anything particular that\u2019s changed in credit between June and July.\nVincent Caintic: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to the management team for any final \u2026\nEllen Alemany: Great. Thank you, Rocco, and thank you, everyone, for joining this morning.

            "name": "Ellen Alemany",
            "content": "Thanks, Barbara. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. The COVID-19 pandemic has continued to affect the broader economy. And that has carried over to our financial results in the second quarter, although to a lesser degree than we experienced in the first quarter. As a result, we posted a net loss this period of $98 million or $0.99 per diluted common share. CIT began this year in position of strength with the multi-year strategic transformation reinforcing our foundation and the completion of the recent acquisition adding to our franchise capability. That strength along with the agility of our team will help us to continue to navigate through this unprecedented time. John will go into a detailed account of the drivers in the quarter, but some key factors in the performance were lower net finance revenue, primarily due to lower interest rates and holding elevated levels of liquidity during this turbulent period; lower factoring commissions due to retail store closures; and the $73 million net charge-off related to a single factoring bankruptcy exposure. We also continued to build our allowance for credit losses, but with the substantial reserve bills in the first quarter, the impact on our provision was much slower. Despite these factors, there were also pockets of strength in the quarter. Our average deposit costs declined by 27 basis points. And we were able to use some excess liquidity to repurchase 235 million of unsecured bank notes at a discount. Our average loans and leases were up 2% from last quarter, which included defensive draws on results in March, as well as new originations in stronger segments of the commercial market. Our capital and liquidity positions remained strong. Our integration plan from the recent acquisition is on track and we are unlocking greater operating efficiencies than originally anticipated. Our operations continued uninterrupted with all our branches remaining open and our customer operations running smoothly, many in a remote model. And we are proactively managing our credit risk through this dynamic period. I want to spend some time on what we're seeing in the business and how we're leveraging our strengths in the current environment. First and foremost, CIT's business model is very diverse. We operate across a variety of commercial segments that have deep industry and asset class expertise to support those segments. That is a tremendous advantage across market cycles, enables us to pivot quickly, take advantage of attractive opportunities and manage our exposure in areas that are more directly impacted by the current environment. And that's exactly what we've done for this pandemic. Let me focus on a few of the opportunities first. The power and renewables business has continued to be very active with virtually no disruption through the pandemic. And CIT is a leader in this space, ranking third in the league tables. We closed five deals where we were the leader of [indiscernible] since March, we have another 10 lead deals in the pipeline for the second half. Most recently we announced $118 million deal for 112 megawatt solar facility in North Carolina, which demonstrates the continued demand for renewable power. In addition, we are seeing strong transaction activity in the technology media and telecom division, a stay-at-home guidelines have supported continued investment in telecom infrastructure, cloud based data centers, as well as additional streaming media content production and distribution. Our capital equipment finance division had a record quarter as borrowers were looking to leverage their fixed assets. We were able to finance several investment grade and near investment grade borrowers given our deep asset class expertise. There are good yields in this asset class, and we were also able to opportunistically purchase small portfolios from larger banks looking to manage obligor limits. CIT has a long history in the asset based lending business, and this is an area where we are expanding as we see some solid opportunities in the pipeline for the second half that align with our capabilities. And on the business capital front, we began to see an uptake in applications and volume toward the end of the quarter as certain businesses started to return to their operations. As a result, our volumes in June were consistent with where they were a year ago. In short, we are seeing opportunities open-up and our agility, expertise and balance sheet strengths have allowed us to capture those opportunities. Credit, of course, does remained a challenge in this environment, but many of the qualities I mentioned that help us originate business also help us manage our risk. Our size, industry knowledge and asset class expertise allow us to adapt quickly and proactively manage issues when they arise. As soon as the pandemic began, we implemented heightened monitoring and portfolio management practices. That included a loan by loan review, daily portfolio and industry reporting and redeployment of resources to help manage portfolios that are most affected by the economic disruption. We have granted relief across more than 10,000 smaller ticket business capital loans and leases, and about 200 commercial finance and real estate contracts totaling about $2 billion in net investment combined. And we are underwriting each larger ticket loan modification to ensure there was a path to recovery. We participated in the PPP program with the majority of customers accessing the program, being community based small businesses in our branch footprint. We also recently launched the main street lending program for our mid-sized clients. We are staying disciplined to find new opportunities and assist our current customers through this period when possible. Before I pass it to John, I want to touch on some of our strategic initiatives. The integration of our recent acquisition of the former Mutual of Omaha Bank is progressing nicely and remains on track for this year and ahead of schedule on operating efficiencies. Despite all the complexity the pandemic has brought, the team is making great progress and bringing together the teams, technology, products and footprint. The home owner association deposit team is hitting their goals with average HOA deposits of 8% to $5.3 billion. This was great progress and was a key driver of the acquisition. Continuing to build out this channel will give us even greater funding flexibility and at lower costs. Likewise, the newly integrated treasury and payment services team is bringing an additional commercial deposits for new and existing clients also at lower costs. These average deposits are up 18% in the quarter to $3.9 billion with costs down to 43 basis points. Build out of these deposit channels compliment our consumer deposits in the direct and branch channels and provide greater funding flexibility and diversity. As part of our integration efforts, we also recently signed an agreement to sell the wealth management business that was part of the former Mutual of Omaha Bank product offering. As we conducted a strategic review of the business, we determined it was not the right fit for our model. It's a very small transaction and it's more about CIT focusing on areas of strength and divesting of activities that are not aligned to our strategy. We expect the deal to close in the coming months and we will provide additional detail at that time. As I mentioned, we are unlocking synergies through the acquisition faster than anticipated. And as a result, we'll be realizing about $25 million of our 2021 costs saves ahead of schedule this year. In recent years, CIT has proven time and time again that we have a culture of performance and the fortitude to deliver on our commitments and continuously improve. That spirit remains through this pandemic. We understand the economic disruption is not behind us yet. However, we took prudent actions in the first half of the year to anticipate the impact of this downturn based on the best available information. While the environment remains dynamic based on what we know today, we are cautiously optimistic for the second half of the year and in our ability to restore a modest level of profitability, assuming the macroeconomic environment does not deteriorate further. With that, I'll turn it to John. Thanks, John. As I've mentioned before, the work we have done to transform CIT over the last few years has strengthened us, tested us and best positioned us to navigate this period. The business is diverse and adaptable. The company is as strong as it's ever been and our deposit costs are declining. The management team is seasoned, agile and resilient. We established a considerable appropriate reserve in the first path to increase our allowance for credit losses and actively manage risks. And we are heading into the second half cautiously optimistic, but also mindful that this is a rapidly changing environment. With that, we're happy to take your questions. And we accelerated another $25 million in expenses this year from Mutual of Omaha Bank that's supposed to come out next year. I would say business overall is significantly up in June. I would say in commercial, April and May were very slow, but we really started to see increased activity in June in certain industry verticals. And in business capital, we had the same volumes in June as we had June of last year. And it's technology related, mostly it's lender finance and business capital. So we think we're really well positioned in some of these industry niches right now. And as John mentioned, in rail, we think we've seen the trial in rail. Basically with the U.S.-China Phase 1 trade agreement, we're seeing renewed activity in rail. We had really large order. We've seen the largest corn order from rail -- from China recently. And we also think that the trade one agreement is going to impact other markets like crude oil, refined products. And housing activity bounce is driving some demand for lumber products. So we're seeing some activity there. Marisa, you want to comment on that? Yes. The business volume we do monthly reviews with the businesses and most of that activity was June reported activity and it's very, very current. And Marissa, can you just comment on the credit side, if you've seen anything in terms of pockets? Great. Thank you, Rocco, and thank you, everyone, for joining this morning.

            "content": "Yes. I think there were three questions in there. Let me see if I can get them.

Probably, the single on the pulse of that is in our factoring business where clients who are typically wholesalers or manufacturers, are seeing orders pick up as retailing has opened. And we're still seeing factoring volume pretty strong in the month -- at the beginning in month of July. But it's obviously kind of too soon to tell whether we're going to see significant shutdowns ordered or involuntary, meaning people just don't show up in some of the bigger markets. No, I don't see anything particular that's changed in credit between June and July."

            "name": "John Fawcett",
            "content": "Thank you, Ellen, and good morning, everyone. As mentioned, we reported a GAAP net loss of $98 million or $0.99 cents per diluted common share, and a loss of $61 million or $0.62 per share, excluding noteworthy items. Our results this quarter continued to reflect the ongoing global pandemic and low interest rates as we manage through the current environment. Overall business activity slowed in the earlier part of the quarter, but in June, we began to see activity pickup in many sectors where we have strong capabilities. Assuming there is no significant change in the current or forecasted macro environment or any expected credit performance of our portfolio, we expect to return to profitability and generate modest positive earnings in both the third and fourth quarters of 2020. Last quarter, we were proactive in our implementation of CECL and appropriately added substantial reserves, reflecting the COVID-19 environment. While this quarters credit provision was considerably lower than in the prior quarter, it remained elevated as we continued to bolster reserves and incurred a $73 million charge related to the bankruptcy of a single factoring customer in the retail industry. The factoring loss was a result of unique circumstances directly related to the precipitous economic shutdown and store closures. While we have reserved for additional charges in the retail industry, we do not anticipate another single customer loss of that magnitude in our factoring business. Overall, based on our forecasted view of the macro environment, we expect the provision to continue to moderate next quarter, obviously subject to conditions which remain fluid. Our net finance revenue and margin were significantly impacted this quarter by lower market rates, primarily LIBOR, which reduced our floating rate loan yields. In addition, we have higher levels of excess cash, primarily due to strong deposit growth, which we estimate reduced our margin by 30 basis points as it earned only about 10 basis points at the Fed. We took actions to offset some of this margin pressure by lowering our deposit costs throughout the quarter, particularly in our online channel, where we lowered our Savings Builder rate by 80 basis points to below 1% at quarter end. We utilized some of our excess cash to tender for our unsecured bank notes, repurchasing $235 million at a discount recognizing a $15 million gain and reducing interest expense by approximately $7 million annually. Assuming LIBOR rates remain relatively constant, we believe the margin has bottom and we will see a 10 to 20 basis point improvement over the course of the third and fourth quarters as the benefits of lower deposit costs continue to be realized and we reduced our excess liquidity. Other noninterest income was impacted this quarter by lower factoring commissions, as volumes declined considerably due to retail store closures. We also had lower gains on asset sales. As we suspended. Some of our portfolio management activities. Factoring volumes improved in the first half of July and we have been running at approximately 98% of 2019 levels as retailers replenish inventory. While we expect factoring volumes and commissions to improve from the second quarter levels, uncertainty around the back-to-school season may temper that improvement. We are also seeing renewed opportunities to resume selling pools of loans in our legacy consumer mortgage portfolio, and would expect to complete a transaction if existing conditions continue to prevail. We continue to look for opportunities to improve our operating efficiency. This quarter, we took a restructuring charge of $37 million primarily related to employee costs and contract terminations. $15 million was already planned as part of the Mutual of Omaha Bank merger and integration costs, while the other $22 million related to cost reduction initiatives that we expect to realize over the next 12 to 18 months. We are lowering our full year 2020 operating expense target, excluding noteworthy items and intangible asset amortization by $25 million to approximately $1.185 billion, as we are realizing some of our 2021 cost savings ahead of schedule. This reduction includes the acceleration of cost synergies related to the integration of Mutual of Omaha bank as we bring our two businesses together. In addition, we are responding quickly to the current environment, which has allowed us to accelerate our plans to rationalize our footprint, including the optimization of former of Mutual of Omaha Bank branches and the streamlining of office locations. We plan to reduce our occupancy by 500,000 square feet, representing 30% of our total footprint. These actions are expected to result in an impairment charge of approximately $15 million in the fourth quarter with an estimated payback period of 18 months or less. We remain focused on continuous improvement and we'll provide an update to our 2020 operating expense target as we gain more clarity on the operating environment. I will now provide some additional color on our operating trends and refer to our earnings presentation, starting with net finance revenue and margin on Slide 7 and 8. As I mentioned, the sharp decline in both net finance revenue and margin were primarily driven by lower market rates and a higher mix of cash. Average LIBOR rapidly declined by around a 100 basis points this quarter, impacting margin by approximately 40 basis points as our floating rate loan yields declined. About 60% of our floating rate loans have interest rates floors. And since the downturn, we have been getting LIBOR floors of 75 to 100 basis points on most new commercial loan originations in commercial finance and seeing improvement in spreads in many of our industry verticals. As I mentioned, the higher mix of cash coupled with lower rates also negatively impacted our margin by 30 basis points. We expect some of this to reverse as we deploy our excess liquidity and higher cost term CDs runoff. Lower rail utilization and renewal rates, as well as increased storage costs for cars off-lease reduced margin by 10 basis points in the quarter. The North American industry rail car fleet continues to be oversupplied with 32% of the fleet now in storage driven by the general slowdown in economic activity. While our fleet is diverse and representative of the broader economy, many car types saw a reduction in utilization and pricing on new leases. Our rail utilization declined approximately 300 basis points to 88% and lease renewables repriced down 30% this quarter, reflecting current market conditions and the mix of cars that came up for renewal. In particular, sand cars used in the E&P space weighed heavily on repricing activity this quarter, while grain cars, plastic pellet covered hoppers and certain box bars continued to renew at above average rates. Macro indicators in recent weeks are starting to show some real recovery from COVID-19 as many factories have resumed at least partial production late in the quarter. And although still well below 2019 levels, rail loadings have improved over the past few weeks from the COVID-19 trough levels. As the economy starts to recover and commodity prices drift higher, we expect rail utilization and pricing to improve. Although with a bit of a lag as excess capacity from cars and storage, but still on lease will be brought online first. With that background, assuming the forecasted macro environment, we anticipate a modest reduction in net rail yields over the next two quarters as leases continue to reprice down. We expect utilization to push back up into the low 90% area over the next few quarters and improve to the mid 90% area by the end of 2021. We believe our young diverse fleet with more high load capacity cars are competitive advantages, resulting in higher demand for our rail cars, while sand cars used in E&P space, particularly fracking, are expected to continue to weigh on the recovery. On the liability side to offset the impact of low rates on our assets, we have been aggressively lowering deposit costs. We improved our margin by 21 basis points in the quarter as CDs repriced lower and we lowered our non-maturity deposit rates across all deposit channels. The biggest rate decline in the quarter was in our online channel, where we lowered our Savings Builder rate by 80 basis points ending the quarter below 1%. We also grew average lower cost HOA and commercial deposits by about $1 billion, further contributing to lower deposit costs. The HOA deposit channel reached its highest level ever at $5.3 billion and growth in commercial deposits was driven by both new and existing commercial clients, while cost declined by about 20 basis points. As Ellen indicated, we are pleased with the progress we are making expanding these channels and remain on pace to realize growth projections in the HOA channel. As I indicated earlier, we expect the margin will improve over the course of the third and fourth quarters by 10 to 20 basis points as the full impact of the recent rate reductions are realized along with continued downward repricing, a reduction in maturing CDs and growth of lower cost HOA commercial deposit channels. In addition, we continue to look for opportunities to reduce non maturity deposit rates while balancing our liquidity needs. Slide 12 provides more detail on average loans and leases by division. Average loans leases grew by 2% this quarter, which includes the impact of increased defensive revolver draws in commercial finance at the end of March, new business volume in key sectors where we are seeing opportunities in the current environment and a lower level of prepayments. End of period balances declined as repayment of factoring invoices outpaced new factoring volume and the defensive revolver draws will end -- of last quarter were repaid. While origination volumes were down reflecting the current environment, we continue to close deals for our clients and are seeing opportunities in certain industry verticals and equipment leasing, lending where we have strong workplace -- strong leadership, as well as industry and asset class expertise. New business activity in commercial finance was driven by key verticals, such as power and renewables and technology, media and telecom, which included opportunities for capital markets and derivative fees. As Ellen indicated, we are also seeing good opportunities in the current environment within capital equipment finance. Overall pipelines in commercial finance are lower than last year, reflecting the business slow down, but we continue to see increased activity in the areas I just mentioned, along with healthcare and assets based lending. We are also seeing wider spreads and structural improvements, including LIBOR floors on new originations. In business capital, equipment finance is taking market share as other small ticket equipment lenders have paused or exited the market. We are also seeing increased demand in programs where we partner with technology manufacturers to provide financing to their customers. In small business solutions, we are taking a more focused approach in providing lending in industries less impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, while pulling back from certain higher risk industries. Overall, business capital applications, which had slowed considerably earlier this quarter have seen a pickup in the past several weeks as June origination volume increased to June 2019 levels. We remain cautiously optimistic for increase in origination activity in the third quarter in select areas. As Ellen mentioned, we continue to work with our customers to provide payment deferrals for qualifying customers impacted by the economic events brought upon by COVID-19. As of the end of the quarter, we had granted relief requests to about 1,700 consumer customers with a carrying value of approximately $630 million. We also granted about $1.4 billion in relief requests for over 200 commercial transactions across commercial finance and real estate finance, as well as $550 million representing approximately 10,000 smaller ticket equipment contracts in business capital, and another $180 million over 100 contracts in our small business administration business. It is still early days as some of the first deferrals are just expiring, but so far the trends are relatively consistent with our expectations and we have been staying close with our customers. As an example, we conducted a comprehensive calling campaign making about 9,000 outbound calls to our small business solutions customer over the quarter, and continue to be in touch with them as the deferral period ends. In our middle market loan book, we have not experienced a large second wave of deferrals yet, but expect deferral requests in the third quarter, as borrowers begin refining their 12 to 18 months financial forecasts. We are closely monitoring this activity and have provided some additional information on Slide 3 of the presentation. Overall, we think average loans and leases will be relatively flat next quarter, reflecting the lower end of period second quarter balances, and as we continue to support our customers and focus on our originations activity on strong risk adjusted opportunities that play to our strengths. Slide 15 and 16 highlights our credit trends and provision. Net charge-offs increased significantly this quarter to $170 million. Apart from the one factoring customer bankruptcy of $73 million that I previously mentioned, net charge-offs were $97 million or 1.02% of loans about three quarters of which were already reserved for, and therefore did not have a specific impact on our provision. The retail sector had been facing headwinds prior to this current crisis, and we had been actively reducing exposure to trouble retailers prior to the onset of COVID-19. The $73 million charge related to a single factoring bankruptcy was unanticipated and a direct result of the retail shutdown, which precipitated a voluntary bankruptcy. While there were a number of retail bankruptcies this quarter with the exception of the one I just mentioned, we did not have exposure to those names or we had previously exited or reduced our exposures to low levels prior to the bankruptcy. We expect continued pressure in this industry and we are monitoring the developments in the sector closely and remain in constant contact with our customers and clients. Our current factoring exposure in the retail sector is approximately $1.7 billion, down considerably from $2.9 billion at the end of last quarter, as collections have outpaced new factoring volume, driven by store closures brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, only $250 million of receivables had extended terms at the end of June, down from $900 million in April. Our top 25 exposures include traditional retailers as well as well-known online big box and discount retailers. The top five customers, which are rated single A to AA comprise a little over 40% of total factored retail exposure. The next 10 largest exposures are between $25 million to just under $50 million of which five are investment grade with the largest being non-investment grade. After that, the remaining customer base comprising approximately $600 million exposure is very diversified across approximately 28,000 accounts. As I mentioned, so far July activity has been surprisingly strong as retailers look to restock depleted inventory levels. We are also seeing strength in the furniture sector and increased factoring volume with discount retailers. That said, a second wave of COVID-19, which could result in reduced traffic and/or store closures remains a concern. We've a robust approval and monitoring framework in place to review customer exposures on a weekly and monthly basis and where appropriate we continue to implement risk mitigation actions and price enhancements. With respect to our credit reserves, this quarter we established reserves of $58 million on individually evaluated accounts and increased our collectively evaluated reserves by $107 million for on balance sheet exposures. This quarter, we utilized the June baseline scenario from a provider well-known in the industry that assumed a more V-shaped recession and longer recovery than the March baseline scenarios that we had used to determine our credit provision in the first quarter. We also apply to qualitative overlay for other factors that include macro uncertainty, model uncertainty and sensitivity to changes in assumptions as well as additional risk to specific industries or portfolio segments, such as oil and gas factoring at small ticket commercial loans. As a result, our coverage ratio increased approximately 40 basis points to 3.5% on commercial banking loans and 30 basis points to 3.2% for total loans. Assuming no significant change in the outlook, we expect the provision to continue to moderate next quarter. Nonaccrual loans increased significantly in the quarter, primarily driven by loans in commercial finance and real estate finance. As Ellen indicated, we have put in place heightened monitoring to carefully watch specific industry trends and indicators of delinquencies. In commercial finance, real estate finance and rail, we have conducted a loan by loan review, identified higher risk exposures, performed stress analyses and prioritized our most vulnerable accounts. We are monitoring revolver advances and borrower relief requests for vulnerable borrowers on a daily basis. We have also adjusted our underwriting to reflect the current environment. We are individually underwriting, each transaction request for modification in commercial finance and real estate finance and rail to ensure the borrower has a path to recovery. We have restricted our underwriting in the most distressed industries and suspended auto decisioning in acute areas of risk. We are staying disciplined in our pricing and structures, while continuing to evaluate opportunities that utilize our capital most efficiently. We have updated our slides in the appendix for additional information on portions of our portfolio expected to be more impacted by the current environment. Slide 17 highlights our liquidity position at quarter end. Our liquidity remains robust at both the bank and the bank holding company. During the quarter, we issued $500 million of unsecured debt at just 3.929% at the bank holding company, and our next maturity is not until March of 2021 and it's for the same amount with a coupon of 4.08 [ph]. At the bank, we increased our available borrowing capacity at the federal home loan bank with the assets acquired for Mutual of Omaha Bank, substantially increasing our sources of contingent liquidity. Turning to Slide 18, our common equity Tier 1 ratio advanced 30 basis points in the quarter and remain strong at 10%, well in excess of the federal reserves minimum levels, including the capital conservation buffer. The growth in the ratio this quarter was driven by the decline in the end of period loans and a mix shift to lower risk weighted assets, including cash and PPP loans, which have risk weightings of zero. As the economy starts to recover and business activity improves, we expect risk weighted assets to increase from the deployment of excess liquidity and a lower level of PPP loans. We also expect positive earnings will offset the deployment of capital. Over the next two quarters, assuming the current forecasted macro environment, we expect our common equity levels to remain at 9 -- in the 9.8% to 10% range, depending on the mix of lower risk weighted assets. And with that, I will turn it back over to Ellen. Yes. So, Moshe, it's important to -- I think have a perspective on when the cutting began. And so I think very early in the second quarter, we put our toe in the water a little bit, and we had some very minor cuts across April because we were concerned about would be significant amount of attrition. As we've gone further and further, we've realized that, a lot of the strategies that we built out in the non maturity portfolio in the online bank is actually taking a whole. And across 13 weeks in the quarter, we actually reduced rates 80 basis points across 10 cuts and actually had consistent growth across all 13 weeks, which is kind of interesting. So to answer your question, we expect that a lot of the benefits that we'll go through that we -- in terms of the cuts that we did in second quarter, we'll continue to play through, into the third quarter and beyond. Separately, what I would say is, is that we think that there is continued opportunity to kind of drag pricing down even further, especially in the non-maturity deposit space. But I think across the board, we've done actually a pretty good job in terms of all of the deposit channels. In terms of the broader question around net interest income, the second quarter was pretty challenging. I think it was, clearly the bottom for us. And just in terms of business volumes I think in my script, we talked about business capital kind of coming back online. We're starting to see some shoots -- green shoots come out of the factoring business through the first, I want to say, 17 days of July, factoring volumes were at 97% of what they were last year. Business capital, which was down 30% in the first quarter actually hit what it had done in June of 2019. Our business capital guys are now thinking that notwithstanding the impact of the second quarter we expect to get 90% of origination volumes. And so the business feels like its transitioning. And these are essentially used equipment in business capital. And it's our fastest growing business in terms of imaging technology and phone systems. As I said, more runway on deposits, we think that we know that there are some deposit cliffs in CDs that will be repriced down substantially and also lead to some runoffs. And I think the lower rates may push some of the excess liquidity out at the same time as business starts to reinflate, hopefully it will consume with some of the excess liquidity. In terms of -- I'm not going to give you dollar amounts in terms of what expectations are in the third and fourth quarter, it's obviously incredibly fluid. And as we've said, these are modest levels of returns of profitability. I think the last driver in the net finance margin and net interest income is obviously going to be around rail. And so we've again, started to see some green shoots in rail and it got whacked pretty good in the second quarter. But coming into June and in July, what we've seen in terms of rail loadings that's actually started to go up. And so we expect that utilization will continue to crawl up. We've seen hopefully the worst in terms of storage freight and switching costs. And renewal rates, notwithstanding the fact that utilization will increase renewal rates, well, I think we're still forecasting to be down around 20% until we see some of the larger North American excess capacity utilized. Yes, I am confident. I mean, based on what we're seeing now, look, these are very fluid times. And so at this nanosecond, I feel pretty confident that the third quarter is going to be better. As you start to look at non-interest income, as I said, we're seeing factoring volumes kind of ramp back up. Rail sales in the second quarter were slightly diminished and a little bit off of what our forecast was of '20. We expect we'll be on '20 as some of the dislocation in that market normalizes. We completely suspended legacy consumer mortgage portfolio sales in the second quarter. The pricing had just completely collapsed and we're not distressed sellers. And so we just took a pause. We'd expect that the activity that we didn't see in the second quarter, will transition into the third quarter, and we will probably see a double sized sale. What comes with that is not only the gain on the disposition of the LCM portfolio, but also provision and release related to the gross to purchase account accretion. Securities gains should hold in, and capital markets fees, I think will continue to kind of trend as the market starts to advance. And then I think on expenses, we're all over expenses. Reducing our footprint by 30% and taking out another body of heads we're very focused. And so we are ... Well, hopefully, Arren, these two things that are the principle dynamics, one is that as we continue to reduce pricing on the deposit product you would expect to see some deposits attrite. And I think that's okay. I think the other thing is, is that we've got some fairly high deposit cliffs that are actually coming in terms of CDs across the third quarter. And so some of that will attrite. What would be best is if we could actually put the deposits to work in growth that we're seeing on the balance sheet as we kind of re re-inflate. I think the interesting thing about the whole deposit phenomenon is the last time this happened, it happened during the financial crisis of '08, '09 and '10. And if you looked at search deposits, which is, I guess, what they call it now the hoarding of cash, like the quality, exit of equities and money market funds, delayed investments, all that kind of activity that actually ran its course over four or five years. And so, hypothetically, this could be something that we're living with for a long time, not just us, but all banks as cash continues to be trapped on the balance sheet. I think what's different about this financial crisis is this one's bacterial. The last one was a real financial crisis. And so as vaccines and we start to live with this, maybe it will be a little bit different. But right now we're sitting with $2 billion to $3 billion of excess liquidity and cash on the balance sheet. And the expectation is it will start to moderate, but it's anyone's guess as to how long it will take. We will be aggressive in terms of lowering our rates, and I think that will take care of some of the problem. But it might be a multi-quarter issue for sure. I think it's a quarter-to-quarter exercise. I think it's obviously a conversation we have at our Board. I think it's obviously a conversation that we have with our regulatory partners. My view is that we're in a good place. I think we've been very good stewards of capital. When you think about the Mutual of Omaha Bank transaction, well ahead of that transaction we suspended share repurchases. We've always maintained a fairly modest dividend payout ratio. To the extent that we believe that we're returning to modest level of profitability, it feels like the horses are out of the barn. We've kind of done this significant amount of reserving in the first quarter and took for our lumps in the first quarter and augmented that in the second quarter. The impact on common equity Tier 1 ratio is about 7 basis points. We have ample liquidity at the holding company, ample liquidity at the bank. And the principal driver of the first half financial performance has been provisioning, which essentially is a transfer of loss absorbency from capital to ACL. And if you actually want to get wonky about '09, '04, which is actually governs our ability to pay dividends and the conversation we talk to the Fed about, it was written in 2009 when GAAP relied on incurred losses and less on the notion of the crystal ball embedded in CECL. So there's a kind of very fundamental misalignment between supervision and regulation guidance established in 2009 GAAP, which accelerated loss recognition in an almost spontaneous way. And so that's a challenge. And I guess the last couple of points and you said it is, our capital ratios are strong and above capital conservation buffers and we've maintained a very robust capital planning process. So notwithstanding the fact that we're not a CCAR bank, we're no longer SIFI. I'm not sure why we ever were. But we've maintained all of those protocols. And I think our regulators understand that and appreciate the fact that we've been throughout the babies in the bathwater. We've continued to operate with very heightened standards around capital and capital planning. It's a long winded way of saying I'm pretty relaxed with it."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. There will be a question-and-answer session later in the call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Barbara Callahan, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed, ma\u2019am.\nBarbara Callahan: Thank you, Elisa. Good morning and welcome to CIT\u2019s first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Our call today will be hosted by Ellen Alemany, Chairwoman and CEO; and John Fawcett, our CFO. Also joining us for the Q&A discussion is our Chief Credit Officer, Marisa Harney. During this call, we\u2019ll be referencing the earnings presentation as well as a supplemental presentation that describes our preparedness in response to COVID-19. Both are available on the Investor Relations section of our website at cit.com. Our forward-looking statements disclosure and non-GAAP reconciliations are included in today\u2019s earnings materials and within our SEC filings. These cover our presentation materials, prepared comments and the questions-and-answers segment of today\u2019s call. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Ellen Alemany.\nEllen Alemany: Thank you, Barbara. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Wherever you\u2019re tuning in from, I hope you\u2019re safe and well. The first quarter has clearly presented a new paradigm for all of us. And the personal and economic challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic have been unprecedented. Oftentimes, periods of great challenge provide an opportunity to also test the company\u2019s strength, agility and values. And these past few months have tested us and demonstrated that we have the fortitude to navigate the issues before us. CIT today is the result of a multiyear enterprise transformation that has led to an organization with ample liquidity, sufficient capital, substantially less risk in the portfolio, nimble operational capacity, leading franchises with deep expertise supporting them for diversified and stable core deposit channels, and a seasoned management team that knows how to navigate in a dynamic environment. We entered 2020 with a much stronger foundation which has enabled us to actively respond to the challenges presented by this pandemic as well as advance some of our key strategic initiatives in the quarter. Let me touch on our COVID response first and then I\u2019ll share other highlights from the quarter. In a matter of weeks, we have effectively transformed the way we operate while also prioritizing the health, safety and financial needs of our employees, customers and communities. First and foremost, we work to ensure our employees were safe and we took a number of steps early in the process to enact the best available guidance on healthy workplace protocols in social distancing. We were one of the first banks to fully shift to remote working model in key urban centers like New York City and Chicago as the outbreak started to progress in mid-March. Currently, 93% of our employees are effectively working remotely as a result of our investments in technology and the digital transformation we put in place over recent years. This is a best-in-class standard in our industry and a vital part of our business continuity. We also continue to evolve our workplace protocols as more information is available on reducing the spread of this virus and understanding the best ways to ultimately emerge from the current isolation measures. We are offering enhanced health benefits for COVID testing and care, as well as ongoing wellness programming to help employees through the stress and isolation of these new lifestyle requirements. We implemented an enhanced pay plan for employees that are not able to work remotely and are providing vital services in support of our business. And I\u2019m proud to say that all of our branches remain open and able to serve customers. We modified ours and enhanced safety protocols, but we remain open for business. We\u2019re also focused on working with our customers who have been affected by the pandemic and providing relief when we can. We are working with more than 8,600 small businesses, primarily in our business capital position to provide them deferrals on their existing loans and leases. We quickly stood up an entirely new operational process in order to participate in the government\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program. We\u2019re providing mortgage forbearance to borrowers. We\u2019re waiving fees so customers could access deposits without penalty. And we continue to have ongoing dialogue with our commercial clients, and offer them our banking and structuring expertise and assistance in navigating during this period. We know it is a challenging time for many and we\u2019re committed to working with our customers. Commitment to our communities remains very important as well and CIT has committed $1 million to support non-profit partners with COVID-19 relief efforts in our key markets. While this is still an evolving landscape, I\u2019m proud of the way we\u2019ve been able to adapt to the situation, and demonstrate our resilience and commitment to do what\u2019s right for our team, our customers, our communities, and ultimately, our shareholders. Turning to the quarter, our results were primarily affected by the impact of the pandemic on the macroeconomic environment, which led to an increased credit reserves and goodwill impairment; the adoption of CECL, which dramatically changed the credit reserve model amid a volatile period; and the completion of the Mutual of Omaha Bank acquisition, which added about $8 billion of assets and $7 billion of deposits, and impacted the comparability of our results versus prior periods. We posted a net loss of $628 million or $6.40 per diluted common share due to the increased credit reserves and goodwill impairment. John will go into more detail on the underlying drivers of performance. But I first wanted to touch on a few key highlights. We completed the acquisition on January 1 and immediately kicked off our integration efforts, which remain on track and are expected to be completed by yearend. We improved our deposit costs by 34 basis points in the quarter through the addition and growth of the Homeowners Association deposit channel and also through our efforts to further optimize funding in the consumer channel. The community association banking business, which is the division that drives the HOA deposits, has been off to a strong start and had one of their best growth quarters ever. Between the existing portfolio and the growth in the quarter, that business added another $5 billion of lower cost deposits, CIT\u2019s funding profile and further bolstered our deposit base. We have already made investments in this business and launched the new reserve deposit product suite, as well as expanded our sales team. And we expect to remain on track in doubling the size of this business in 5 years. Our balance sheet remains strong, ending the quarter with more than $42 billion in deposits and $9.5 billion in liquid assets. Our core average loans and leases were up 1% from the prior quarter, excluding the acquisition. Our loan and lease to deposit ratio at the bank increased slightly to 95% and we remain on target with our expense initiatives. Managing our risk remain critically important as it has been for some time. We have maintained prudent underwriting standards and are thoughtfully originating business in areas where we believe there are opportunities. We continue to proactively manage our portfolio and over recent years, we have sold or significantly reduced our high risk portfolios and shifted to more collateral based lending. We know there are still some portfolios that we will feel the stress of the economic disruption more than others, and we have shared more disclosure in the COVID response deck that was posted today. I will touch on 2 key areas which are energy and retail. As you know, we are a leader in the power and renewables space, and have continued to grow that part of our power and energy business. We do still have loan exposure to oil and gas though. And it is comprised of about $1 billion in funded exposure, most of which is secured and represents about 3% of our total loans. Our exposure to the retail sector is primarily in our factoring business and half of that factoring exposure is made up of our top-10 customers, which are investment-grade or near investment-grade companies. Our client base is fairly diversified across consumer segments and we continue to have frequent dialogue with our clients and work closely with them through this period. Some clients have also shifted their business to produce or procure masks, gowns and other much needed items for the fight against the coronavirus, and we\u2019re pleased to help support them in those efforts. We are closely monitoring these and other portfolios that may be further impacted as a result of the current economic environment. As mentioned this quarter, we adopted CECL, and we leverage the capital stress testing capabilities we built when we were a CCAR bank. We conducted a robust process as we set our reserves that reflected what our best view of the economic environment was at that point in time and its potential impact on the portfolio going forward. Don will walk you through the details of that process shortly. And as we mentioned we also have our Chief Credit Officer, Marisa Harney available for Q&A later in the call. To summarize, we have ample liquidity and a robust stress testing process to ensure we can meet our funding needs even in a stressed environment. We continue to run severely adverse stress scenarios even though we have no longer subject to the CCAR process, which informs our capital levels. Our reserves are strong, covering 2.9% of loans and we have an additional $120 million of allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposures. We are confident and our ability to respond to the challenges before us and weather this economic downturn. The work we have done in recent years has best positioned us for this period. We are actively managing every facet of the company and the continuity of our business. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to John.\nJohn Fawcett: Thank you, Ellen, and good morning, everyone. Our results this quarter reflect 3 key events during the quarter: first, the acquisition of Mutual of Omaha Bank on January 1, which impacts the comparability of our financial results to prior quarters; second, we adopted CECL on January 1. Given that the CECL standard introduced this economic forecasting into the allowance for credit loss process, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic significantly increased our first quarter provision for credit losses; and third, the deterioration of the macroeconomic environment triggered an interim goodwill assessment at quarter end that resulted in a goodwill impairment. As Ellen indicated, well ahead of this crisis, we completed a significant transformation of our business that strengthened our risk profile and focused our priorities. We strengthened our balance sheet as deposits now constitute 84% of our total funding and we eliminated less stable sources of wholesale funding, and we strengthened our risk management practices, sold higher risk portfolios, shifted our portfolio to more collateral-based loans and significantly decreased our criticized assets, which were down 10% from a year-ago. As a result of our transformation, we entered this challenging environment with a stronger balance sheet to support our customers, clients, communities and employees as we navigate through this period. We have provided a supplemental presentation on our website to describe our preparedness in response to COVID-19, including descriptions of our transformation, corporate and operational response, and our liquidity, funding and capital position. Before I get into the results for the quarter, I want to point out that our funding and liquidity levels remain strong and we believe sufficient to endure the current cycle. Our liquidity position is based on a robust stress testing process to ensure we are able to meet expected and contingent funding needs under combined idiosyncratic and market stresses. And we are well positioned to endure the stressed environment. At the end of the quarter, we maintain $9.5 billion of liquid assets comprised of available cash and unencumbered HQLA securities making up approximately 16% of total assets. We also had $3.5 billion of availability under our contingent liquidity sources through secured facilities in our corporate revolver. In addition, our funding mix is substantially deposit based and diversified across multiple channels including our new stable, lower cost HOA deposit channel added from the Mutual of Omaha Bank acquisition, which have a record quarter of deposits growth. As Ellen indicated, we are off to a good start and remain committed to doubling this deposit channels over the next 5 years. Our loan and lease to deposit ratio stands at 95% at the bank and 109% on a consolidated basis. We also have access to unsecured debt markets at both the bank and the bank holding company. Over the years, we have flattened and staggered our debt maturity schedule, as a result our next unsecured debt maturity is only $500 million and not due until March of 2021. Our capital position is sufficient to withstand a severely adverse stress scenario that includes both market and idiosyncratic stresses. While we are no longer CCAR bank, we continue to run our own models using the severely adverse stress scenario provided with Federal Reserve. We ended the quarter with common equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.7% reflecting the Mutual of Omaha Bank acquisition on January 1, which reduced the common equity Tier 1 ratio to approximately 10%. And the adoption of CECL, which is a result of the current macroeconomic forecast, added $405 million to our credit provision. Throughout the month of March, we continue to assess changes in macroeconomic scenarios as the impact of the pandemic accelerated globally. We analyzed and modeled various scenarios from the third-party that is widely used in the industry. Quantify the sensitivity of the allowance for credit loss or ACL, to changes in the underlying macroeconomic forecast. We ultimately utilized an updated baseline scenario with reflected expectations for economic impacts from COVID-19 as of March 20, and added an additional downside adjustment that took into consideration, developments heading into quarter-end. The baseline scenario assumed return to economic growth in late 2020, while the downside adjustment incorporated more stressful scenarios. These additional scenarios assumed a more V-shaped recession with the reduction and annualized real GDP growth of close to 20% in the second quarter of this year as well as the less volatile, but more prolonged U-shaped recession that assumed in elevated unemployment rate through early 2022. We also took into consideration scenario probabilities, potential impact of government support, prior capital stress testing results, and the limitation of models when a high degree of volatilities introduced to the macro forecast. We estimate that the impact of the additional reserve reduced capital by about 60 basis points after adjusting for the new 5-year transition for the Interagency Interim Final Rule. We provided a common equity Tier 1 walk in the appendix of the earnings presentation that highlights the impact of the transition rule. We maintain our commitment to our regulators to raise our common equity Tier 1 ratio to our target level of 10.5%, although our timing to achieve that goal may now be longer than initially expected. Based on our current capital on RWA levels, we have a capital buffer of $1.2 billion when compared to the Federal Reserve minimums, including the capital conservation buffer levels. To provide some additional context around the sufficiency of our capital levels with respect to ongoing uncertainty in the economic environment and CECL reserves for loan losses. We conducted a sensitivity analysis leveraging our 9-quarter cumulative loss rate from our 2019 severely adverse stress scenario to our current levels of loans. This scenario reflected a deep and prolonged recession with declines in GDP for 7 consecutive quarter and an unemployment rate in excess of 8% for all period except for the first 3 quarters, peaking at 10%. Based on this sensitivity, our current reserve level of $1.1 billion would be about 60% of the implied stressed losses over a 9-quarter period implying an increase in the CECL reserve of approximately $800 million compared to the March 31 reported amount. We will update our capital stress test later this year as markets normalize and intend also to run the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2020 severely adverse stress scenario of CCAR banks. Before we get into the details, I want to let you know that given the uncertainties created by the COVID-19 pandemic on the current macroeconomic environment. We are withdrawing our outlook for the full year 2020 and our medium term return on tangible common equity target. Turning to the financial results on Slide 3 of the presentation, I will refer to the first quarter 2020 earnings slide deck. We reported a GAAP net loss of $628 million or $6.40 per diluted share driven by goodwill impairment and a higher credit provision, both a result of the market environment driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. Noteworthy items are listed on Slide 5, and included in after-tax goodwill impairment charge of $339 million. The deterioration of the macroeconomic environment, the low rate environment and, in particular, the decrease in CIT and peer bank stock prices triggered an interim goodwill impairment assessment that resulted in an impairment charge. The charge did not include the goodwill recognized from the acquisition of Mutual of Omaha Bank, and is non-cash \u2013 is a non-cash charge, it did not have any impacts on regulatory capital. Other noteworthy items resulted from the Mutual of Omaha Bank acquisition and included the $37 million after-tax CECL reserve on acquired non-PCD loans that flowed through the P&L as a credit provision on the day of acquisition. The charge represents a double counting of credit risk in both the purchase price and the allowance build. In addition, we recognized $14 million in after-tax merger and integration costs. Excluding noteworthy items, we reported a net loss of $238 million or $2.43 per share, reflecting credit provision, of which $405 million or $332 million after-tax is driven by the forecasted macroeconomic environment. Slide 6 and 7 highlights our net finance revenue and margin. Net finance revenue grew from the prior quarter reflecting higher assets from the Mutual of Omaha Bank acquisition on January 1 and growth in our core loans and leases. However, net finance margin declined to 2.73% as the swift 150 basis point cut in the Fed rates \u2013 Fed funds rate this quarter and lower LIBOR levels resulted in a significant reduction in yields on our floating rate loans and securities. The reduction in yield \u2013 asset yields also reflects the addition of the Mutual of Omaha Bank loans and securities that are lower yielding. We also recognized $9 million of accelerated premium amortization in our MBS portfolio reducing margin by 6 basis points. And loan prepayment levels fell significantly as a result of the current environment reflecting resulting in lower prepayment related benefits. In our Rail business, net operating lease revenues declined further than expected as utilization declined to about 91% from 94% last quarter. Renewal rates were priced down 18% on average, and maintenance costs were higher, including increased storage cost from off-lease cars. Lower borrowing costs offset some of the impact on asset yields as the addition of lower cost HOA deposits from Mutual of Omaha Bank, lower market rates and pricing actions across all our deposit channels resulted in a reduction in deposit rates. Other non-interest income improved to $131 million and is illustrate on Slide 8. The increase reflects higher net gains on sales of assets. Improvements in fee income from last quarter included activity from our community association business acquired from the Mutual of Omaha Bank. Capital markets fees increased modestly as we continued to build momentum earlier in the quarter before the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. We had a minimum loan position at the end of the quarter and took a $4 million mark, which we believe is appropriate to clear these positions in the coming months. Given the historic level of interest rate volatility, our customer derivatives business had a record quarter. However, the increase was more than offset by a negative mark of $8 million on credit valuation adjustments given widening credit spreads. Factoring commissions were down reflecting lower factoring volume from seasonality and the slowdown later in the quarter resulting in the current macroeconomic environment. We generated about $14 million of gains on the sale of securities as we took advantage of opportunities in the fixed income market and sold some of our investment securities, including non-HQLA securities acquired from Mutual of Omaha Bank. As part of our ongoing portfolio risk management activities, we opportunistically sold PCD loans from the Legacy Consumer Mortgage portfolio. While higher yielding, we generated approximately $13 million in gains, further reduced our risk profile and released reserves. Looking into the second quarter, we see the following trends. The significant reduction in factoring volume reflecting a full quarter impact from the COVID-19 and the U.S. retail shutdown, which will impact commissions significantly. As part of our portfolio management activity of our rail fleet, gain on sale of railcars have been running between $15 million and $25 million per quarter. We expect lower gains next quarter, as we will likely delay some of that activity to later in the year given the dislocation in the market. We will continue to look for opportunities to selectively prune the LCM portfolio, although the current environment may make this challenging in the near-term. In terms of capital markets activity, we continue to see opportunities to lead transactions in our core industries less impacted by the current environment, although we are pursuing more arrangements in this environment. These deals are likely to have stronger structural protections and wider spreads. Our capital markets pipeline is reasonably strong in those industries, although predicting when deals will come together is still uncertain. Turning to Slide 9, we continue to be disciplined on the management of our expenses and remain focused on achieving the additional $50 million in net cost reductions in 2021, along with the additional $30 million in cost synergies we committed to from the Mutual of Omaha Bank acquisition. The increase in operating expenses this quarter primarily reflects the addition of Mutual of Omaha Bank and seasonality, and to a lesser extent from first quarter benefit restarts. For 2020, we still expect to achieve the $16 million in cost synergies related to the Mutual of Omaha Bank acquisition. Slide 11 provides more detail on average loans and leases by division. Excluding the $6.3 billion in loans acquired from the Mutual of Omaha Bank. Our average core loans and leases increased by 1%. In commercial banking, our pipelines were strong heading into the quarter, and while market sentiment shifted dramatically in March following the acceleration of the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to close deals for our clients. Origination volumes were up 30% from the year-ago quarter, and essentially flat compared to the fourth quarter. In March, prepayments slowed considerably in Commercial Finance and Real Estate Finance contributing to asset growth. Revolver utilization increased in the second and third week of March as clients drew on their lines given increased business uncertainty, although defensive draws started to moderate towards the end of March and had been modest since the beginning of April. Given our middle market focus, we generally don\u2019t participate in larger revolving loans, and therefore, we don\u2019t expect to see the same level of revolver draws as some of our regional bank peers. Through last week, we have funded $620 million of defensive draws for our clients across Commercial Banking. A little over 1/3 of those draws were in commercial services, our factoring business, with a little more than half across the rest of Commercial Finance and the rest of Real Estate Finance. Our increased focus in treasury and payment services helped us to retain a significant portion of these draws as commercial businesses. As Ellen indicated, we are working with small business customers to provide payment deferrals for up to 3 months for qualified customers impacted by the economic events brought upon by COVID-19. We expect these loan modifications to meet the requirements to suspend the TDR classification in any related impairment for accounting purposes. The macroeconomic environment has also added pressure to the North American rail industry. Railcar loadings have generally declined as the impact of COVID-19 has put more pressure on industrial sectors and low oil prices have reduced car demand in that sector. We are seeing more resiliency in demand for our cars carrying grains and plastics. Given the macroeconomic environment, we expect further deterioration and now think our lease rates will reprice down 20% in 2020, and utilization could decline to the mid- to high-80% area over the next 12 months depending on the duration of lower oil prices and the COVID-19 pandemic. We are staying in close communication with our rail customers and stand ready to support them through this crisis. We have a diversely with broad market coverage, servicing a wide range of industries. Our strategy is to remain vigilant on asset readiness and ensure that we have the cars that meet our customer demand requirements. The average age of our fleet is 14 years, the youngest in North America. We have more higher load capacity cars, which maximizes the shipping optimization for our customers. And our strong market position and management team as well as our customer service positions us well to navigate the current environment. Moving on to deposits on Page 13, we are off to a good start in our new lower-cost HOA channels as we focus on doubling these deposits over the next 5 years. First quarter growth tends to be seasonally high, and this year, the team had their highest growth rate ever. We ended the quarter with just over $5 billion in deposits and expect continued growth in line with expectations as we move further into the year. Average overall deposit cost declined 34 basis points to 150 basis points, reflecting the mix of lower cost deposits from the acquisition, as well as continued downward re-pricing in all other channels. In the direct bank, we continue to monitor the market. We remain competitive in products that align with our strategy, as we optimize costs and funding needs. Our direct bank deposits have grown a little over a $1 billion since the start of the quarter and we lowered our non-maturity deposit rates by 5 basis points in April 5 and another 15 basis points on April 20. Direct banks, including ourselves, have reduced their rates for CDs and savings products, but we have not seen a significant reduction in alignment with the sharp reduction in Fed funds rates. That said, we expect over time we will see larger rate reductions in non-maturity deposits from online banks, ourselves included. Slide 14 highlights our credit trends. Net charge offs increased this quarter and were primarily driven by oil and gas loans, most of which were acquired in Mutual of Omaha Bank acquisition and an increase in the business capital division, mostly related to transportation. For non-accrual loans, the increase in consumer banking relates to the accounting presentation for PCD loans, which upon the adoption of CECL are now subject to the same presentation as disclosure as non-PCD loans. The adoption of CECL and the Mutual of Omaha Bank acquisition increased our ACL on January 1 by $280 million, representing a coverage ratio of about 2%. Note that $141 million of this increase relates to PCD loans, and therefore, did not impact capital. In the first quarter, we significantly increased those reserves to $1.1 billion due to the impact of the COVID-19 environment, bringing our coverage ratio to 2.9% of total loans. We also added $65 million to our allowance for off-balance-sheet credit exposures, bringing total reserves for on and off balance-sheet exposures to over $1.2 billion. We have included a page in the appendix of the presentation to provide some more detail on the components of the reserve. Note that our ACL reserve is a point in time measure that will continue to be informed by ever-changing macroeconomic conditions and impacted variables. Before I turn it back to Ellen, I wanted to highlight that we also provided COVID-19 supplemental information, additional information on portions of our portfolio expected to be more impacted by the current environment, including retail exposure within our factoring business, which consists principally unsecured short-term discretionary lines and where our top-10 customers, who constitute about 50% of our exposure are investment-grade or near-investment-grade; oil and gas loans, which are geographically diversified across major producing basins and where only about half our loan exposure is to reserve based loans; borrowers with exposures to commodity prices are predominantly hedged into 2020 and 2021; retail and hotel exposure within our real estate finance division, which are backed by strong sponsors with whom we have long-term relationships; senior living exposure which is geographically diversified; gaming exposure, which is more regional \u2013 to more regional borrowers as opposed to tourist destinations; and finally, restaurants and franchised finance, with the majority is exposures to strong national brands in the quick-serve industry. We also added a number of pages in the appendix of the presentation to provide additional information on some of our portfolios including collateral-backed portfolios, cash flow loan portfolio and our rail fleet. Our collateral-backed loan portfolio includes loans based financial sponsors that are secured by strong collateral with LTV as of the end of the year in the 50% to 60% area. These include commercial airlines exposure, which is primarily the financial sponsors and backed by commercial aircraft leased to strong quality airlines; and our maritime exposure, which is to well-diversified mainstream oceangoing assets and primarily with long-term contracts. We have no exposure to cruise lines. We also added a page to describe our cash flow loans, which we reduced to about 10% of our loan and lease exposure in the transformation. And finally, we included some additional disclosure on our rail fleet, the highlight to diversification of our fleet by both car-count and net investment. We are watching all these sectors closely and applying sector-specific stresses on cash flows, analyzing collaterals and staying in close communication with our clients as we monitor the vulnerabilities within the portfolio. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Ellen.\nEllen Alemany: Thanks, John. As mentioned, these are unprecedented times, and I have confidence that we have the resources, expertise and rigor to continue to navigate this environment with diligence and care. CIT of today is completely different than the company that went through the last economic disruption. We are a national back with diverse and stable sources of funding. We have strong liquidity levels and robust risk management practices. We will continue to focus on ensuring we have ample capital and liquidity to whether this environment and believe the strength of our balance sheet gives us stabilizing force through this volatile period. We are also focused on pursuing opportunities where we see them in the HOA banking channel and other areas of the commercial segment that could align to our strengths. We remain steadfast in doing the right thing for our employees, customers, communities and shareholders. And with that, we\u2019re happy to take your questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Hi, great, thanks. I guess, I saw the disclosure there and the discussion about the performance and the reserve needs in this severely adverse scenario. I\u2019m wondering if you could talk about whether there are portfolios that you think would perform potentially less bad than in the severely adverse and ones that could perform worse than that, given what you know today about current effects and trends?\nEllen Alemany: You know what, Moshe, we have Marisa Harney, our Credit Officer on the line. I\u2019m going to turn that one over to Marisa.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. Thanks. Thanks.\nMarisa Harney: Sure, thanks, Ellen. Good morning. Less bad and more bad are relative terms, obviously, in the current environment. I think that less bad is going to be more dictated by duration, than necessarily a specific industry. We have a pretty broad-based middle-market business. We also have technology businesses and renewable energy, is that I think I would put on the greener side of being more positive in the current environment. And as Ellen identified, and John identified, I think that, obviously, with oil falling into negative territory, I think oil and gas, which we have about $550 million of E&P exposure, and that\u2019s disclosed in the additional material is clearly something we need to watch closely. And then, there is a very unpredictable environment going on in retail, which will be dictated by, again, the duration of the government \u2013 the U.S. government keeping us closed. I think that as Ellen also indicated, 50% of our portfolio in our factoring retail is in investment-grade companies and I expect those to be not as impacted.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Okay, thanks. Maybe as a follow-up, John, you talked a bit about the rail portfolio and talked about potential for higher costs as you kind of do repositioning and potentially \u2013 maybe is there a way to kind of think about the impact of that on net finance revenue as we go forward?\nJohn Fawcett: Yeah, well, look, as a starting point, I think, obviously, we withdrew guidance as I think most banks did. I think there is just not a lot of visibility. I think, Moshe, when I sat with you on stage back in the end of February at the Credit Suisse Conference, we talked about utilization maybe going down at 92% and then starting to bounce back a little bit around the rest of the year. You\u2019ve got 24% North American fleet is still parked in stores and that seems to be increasing. If you just look, and we don\u2019t usually do this, but weekly rail-loadings are reflecting the economy. Auto is down 67% week on week. And, obviously, we\u2019re light on that obviously, but we\u2019re light in auto tracks. Chemicals and petroleum are down 7% week on week, that\u2019s likely to continue with the global oil. And the bright spots were in agriculture and paper products. And so, it\u2019s tough. I think our guidance is, is that we expect that rail utilization could go into the mid 80s and mid to high 80%s from where we\u2019re at right now. And then, beyond that, you\u2019ve got the incremental cost as utilization declines of the storage of more cars going into storage. So it\u2019s just going to be challenging. I think like everything else, it\u2019s going to be tied largely to the pace of the recovery and what kind of recovery we start to see in terms of whether it\u2019s U-shaped or V-shaped. If it\u2019s a V-shaped recovery, you might expect these trends to reverse fairly quickly. If it\u2019s other than that, it could be [or factored] [ph] much longer. But it\u2019s still going to have an adverse impact on net finance margin going forward.\nEllen Alemany: Yeah, but I also want to add that there is a lot of things that we\u2019re doing about this. One is just rigorous portfolio management. We have received some requests for lease restructuring and rental relief. And we are addressing these on a case-by-case basis. We are looking for opportunities to repurpose sand cars. We\u2019re also working on continuing to drive down our maintenance costs and we have a lot of initiatives going there, including managing our repair process, increasing the use of mobile repair units. And so, this has allowed us to offset the pricing trend a little bit. And then, as John mentioned in his script before that other strategies that selling older cars as a gain, we\u2019ll probably expect lower gains over the next quarter. But I do want to leave everybody with the thought that we should remember that railcars or along with the assets and their performance should be reviewed over cycle, not just this point in time.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Got it. Ellen, John and Marisa, thanks. Good luck.\nJohn Fawcett: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question today comes from Eric Wasserstrom of UBS. Please go ahead.\nEric Wasserstrom: Right, thank you. Can you hear me all right?\nEllen Alemany: Yes, we can.\nEric Wasserstrom: All right, great, thanks. Moving \u2013 John, just to start, could you help us frame what economic outlook is your base-case scenario for whatever your horizon as of this point?\nJohn Fawcett: Yeah. So I think the easiest way to describe the way I think about it is, it\u2019s kind of a scenario cocktail. And we use 3 scenarios. We had an updated baseline pandemic scenario from Moody\u2019s on March 20, which was our baseline. We \u2013 and that\u2019s when we kind of snapped the line in terms of preparation for quarter end. We had the more volatile V-shaped scenario, which had a deeper cut into the second quarter and a more spontaneous recovery into the third quarter. And then, we leveraged another scenario, which we label as S3, which is a severely adverse scenario. So just to kind of give you some context in terms of the different scenarios, in terms of GDP, if you looked on our baseline, it had GDP down 5% and then moderating in the third quarter to down just 0.3%. If you look at the more volatile V-shaped scenario, you had GDP in the second quarter down almost 20%, but we\u2019re covering 11% in the third quarter. And in the severely adverse scenario that we also kind of applied as an overlay against the base case, you had GDP down 5% in the second quarter, and then down another almost 3% in the third quarter. And so \u2013 it\u2019s a little bit of out to me in terms of pulling all the numbers together. And I think if you look at a new baseline that I guess Moody\u2019s has provided on April 10, it portends that, again, it\u2019s another V-shaped recovery. But in the second quarter, you\u2019d have GDP decline by 30%, but in the third quarter, we bounced back 17%. So \u2013 I mean, that\u2019s kind of the thoughts around the way we kind of manage through the process. I think obviously, we\u2019re going to continue to monitor the scenarios, our own portfolios in terms of real experience the capacity of the government programs to provide some level of recovery going into the economy. And I think we\u2019ll have better sense of this and more refinement as we get into the second quarter, but it obviously very fluid.\nEric Wasserstrom: Great. Thank you for that. And so I guess that was really the preface to what is my real question, which is if we think about the vulnerabilities as being in 3 categories around revenue, around operating expense and around provision, if you were to move, let\u2019s say, from that central scenario to the S3 scenario, where would the vulnerability to be most acute relative to your financial position today, more on the revenue side or potentially more on the provision side?\nJohn Fawcett: Well, I think it\u2019s clearly more on the provision side. In the revenue side, I mean, we\u2019re at 0 rate. I mean, so we\u2019re already kind of feeling that challenge and has started to feed through in March. I mean, if you look at the first quarter, January and February are actually quite good months for us. And even halfway into March, we were fine. Part of this is \u2013 and part of the way we\u2019re thinking about forecasting in it\u2019s very difficult, because it remains very fluid is that you could almost run rate March into the second quarter. And absent, we wouldn\u2019t expect that we\u2019re going to take another $400 million charge, and obviously, the bill is behind us now. But run rating March and then having potentially some incremental element of provision, I think, it\u2019s really the larger challenge in terms of what we\u2019re going to face on a go forward basis is the provision.\nEllen Alemany: Yeah. I would just to add that on the expense side, we\u2019re on target for all of our cost reductions. We had the $50 million in that cost reductions for 2021 over and above the [$60 million] [ph] in the cost saves from Mutual of Omaha. So we feel we\u2019re on track, and we actually believe, there\u2019s some more opportunities there on the expense side of the business. And I think, we do see some potential opportunities on the revenue side of the business going into the pandemic, we had a really good quarter in capital markets with organic growth. Fees were up like 25%. We\u2019re having very good momentum on the deposit side of the business. In fact, when you look at the defensive drawdowns from the commercial business, we were able to keep 1/3 of those deposits. Now for company like CIT, which really had \u2013 I think that\u2019s been a really big accomplishment for CIT to do that, it really shows our strategy of trying to expand customer relationship and focus on deposits. And I think that our strengths in ABL and our industry expertise is going to position us well for a lot of the restructures going on in the market and restructuring activity. In business capital, one of the bright spots has been technology leasing, because of the trend of schooling at home and working at home, we\u2019ve had really good volumes in technology. And I think, one of the first places we\u2019re going to recover here is in construction, which will also bear well for the business. So we do see some bright spots here coming out of it.\nEric Wasserstrom: Okay. Thanks very much for taking my question.\nOperator: The next question today comes from Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer & Company. Please go ahead.\nChris Kotowski: Yeah. Good morning. I guess, my key question is the durability \u2013 overall the durability of your pre-provision net revenues. And I guess, looking at the rail and leasing business there, you mentioned the utilization rates coming down and increased maintenance cost and all that. But when we see \u2013 if you look at it linked quarter, the net lease revenues went from like $98 million to $78 million. I mean how of that impact have we seen, because I mean it just seems like we would have only had like a couple of weeks of the impact in 1Q. So should we expect another meaningful drop in that net lease revenue? Or can you size that for us in any way?\nJohn Fawcett: Yeah. Hey, Chris, it\u2019s John. I mean, it can probably be sized just because it\u2019s a function of, I guess, the recovery period. I guess, what I would say also, it really depends. So in any given quarter, you\u2019ll have between 4,000, 5,000, 6,000 cars that are renewing and it fundamentally depends on what kind of cars are renewing. That\u2019s going to impact, obviously, the renewal rates going forward. And so it\u2019s all tied back to the recovery or the pace to the kind of recovery we saw. Clearly, we weren\u2019t anticipating utilization going down to 91% or 90.7% in this quarter. If we see a V-shaped recovery that could bounce back pretty quickly, especially if the economy starts to come online, people start going back to work, the social distancing protocols all start to abate and the economy gets back online. But absent an economy, it\u2019s not clear what you\u2019re actually shipping. And so it\u2019s all interrelated. And I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t give you better answer, but there is no clear answer.\nChris Kotowski: Okay. All right. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question today comes from Arren Cyganovich of Citi. Please go ahead.\nArren Cyganovich: Thanks. Looking at the COVID deck that you put out, Slide 15, I found pretty useful the \u2013 I\u2019d say that the only area that I think I\u2019d be a little bit concerned about is when you look at the size of the various areas that you highlight here. You\u2019re looking at like $3.5 billion, excluding the factoring of kind of problem areas where you have $1.2 billion of capital above your buffer. How do you give us a little bit more comfort that you\u2019re not going to have 50% severity in your oil and gas, and hotel and gaming? There\u2019s all these different kind of subsectors where there\u2019s seemingly a large level of potential loss capability from those books.\nEllen Alemany: Marisa, you want to take that one?\nMarisa Harney: Sure. I think that the \u2013 again, so these are not equal in severity. As we mentioned in the factoring receivables, a considerable portion of that is investment grade. So we\u2019re not anticipating that\u2019s going to result in any material issues for us. When you look at the oil and gas number, I know you\u2019re running your finger down that left-hand column, only about half of that is actually exposed in the E&P sector and we believe that our customers are hedged 75% this year and 50% into next year at considerably higher levels of oil prices. I guess, anything is considerably higher than negative. But they\u2019re in many cases over $50 a barrel. The real estate is collateralized with good properties and with strong sponsors, and we \u2013 so we\u2019re negotiating those individually. We\u2019re really focused on strong partners on the construction side and on the management side. And again, for things like hotels and lodging, duration is going to be key. Our senior living exposure is pretty diversified, and obviously, collateralized as well. And gaming \u2013 again, duration on the gaming side, in the last downturn regional gaming actually was much more resilient than tourist-based gaming, although every cycle is different. And so, this is really about making sure that these companies have sufficient liquidity to weather through to an opening. And then, in our franchised finance business, which is relatively small, the quick serve industry, the fast food industry is actually a little bit more resilient than casual, certainly more than casual dining, because they have \u2013 it\u2019s lot easier for them to do take-out and drive-through. So again, the severity levels are very different and they\u2019re taken on a case-by-case basis. And I think, as I said before, duration is key.\nArren Cyganovich: Okay. I appreciate. That\u2019s helpful. Maybe we could just dig a little bit more on to the factoring side, because I think this is an area where people don\u2019t have a deep understanding of the risks associated with those and those are, obviously, had large numbers when you just look at the total receivables that you have in that business. And understanding that you have strong counterparties on half of the book and maybe just talk about the other part of the book, the smaller customers you have there, what the credit risk of this book is? Is it more of a credit issue or is it more of a fact that you actually just lose a significant amount of volume here from retailers that may be struggling?\nMarisa Harney: Well, I\u2019ll take the credit question. The remainder of the book is spread out over about 25,000 individual retail customers, that these are customers of our clients. And we\u2019ve been monitoring this portfolio very aggressively since \u2013 well, for a long time, but in particular since 2016, when it was clear that there was a secular issue in bricks-and-mortar retail. And so, we\u2019ve been taking considerable actions where we could and where it was available to us, to mitigate the risks that we had either through cash collateral, letters of credit and also other techniques that we have in terms of how we manage those receivables in the context of our client exposures. And so, we\u2019ve done a considerable amount of work to reduce lines, lines under which we purchased factored receivables, and as I said, engage in other risk mitigating techniques. Our exposures are short-term. They\u2019re trade receivables. Typically, unless someone is in liquidation, we would expect that they would want to protect their trade credit. And so \u2013 and we\u2019ve been monitoring retailers in terms of the ones that we thought had the survivability way before this. So we entered this crisis in good shape. But as I said, it\u2019s extremely unpredictable. It\u2019s going to be driven by duration. But 7 out of 10 of our top-10 clients issued in the capital markets in the last several months, so the markets are open to the industry.\nEllen Alemany: Great. And, I just want to add that, we\u2019re in daily contact with our factoring clients, providing them a lot of expertise and advice during this period. And one is that China factories are back open. They\u2019re running like at 80%. We have observed that certain of our customers are gathering liquidity in anticipation of reopening, which really could portend their intention to meet vendor obligations. We also have exposure to certain retailers who remain open, such as the discount and online stores. But it\u2019s an evolving situation and we\u2019re continuing to work closely with them, navigating with them during this time.\nJohn Fawcett: And the only thing I would add is just to be really clear is we do expect factoring commissions to be down in the second quarter. I mean, this is a supply challenge as well as demand challenge. Retailers have to start opening and shipments have to start coming in from not just China but around the world. So a lot has to happen for us to get back in standing.\nEllen Alemany: Yeah.\nArren Cyganovich: Yeah, thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.\nEllen Alemany: Great. Thank you, Elisa. And thank you, everyone, for joining this morning. If you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to contact the Investor Relations team. Our contact information is on the website. Thank you again for your time. Stay safe and healthy, and have a great day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Ellen Alemany",
            "content": "Thank you, Barbara. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Wherever you're tuning in from, I hope you're safe and well. The first quarter has clearly presented a new paradigm for all of us. And the personal and economic challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic have been unprecedented. Oftentimes, periods of great challenge provide an opportunity to also test the company's strength, agility and values. And these past few months have tested us and demonstrated that we have the fortitude to navigate the issues before us. CIT today is the result of a multiyear enterprise transformation that has led to an organization with ample liquidity, sufficient capital, substantially less risk in the portfolio, nimble operational capacity, leading franchises with deep expertise supporting them for diversified and stable core deposit channels, and a seasoned management team that knows how to navigate in a dynamic environment. We entered 2020 with a much stronger foundation which has enabled us to actively respond to the challenges presented by this pandemic as well as advance some of our key strategic initiatives in the quarter. Let me touch on our COVID response first and then I'll share other highlights from the quarter. In a matter of weeks, we have effectively transformed the way we operate while also prioritizing the health, safety and financial needs of our employees, customers and communities. First and foremost, we work to ensure our employees were safe and we took a number of steps early in the process to enact the best available guidance on healthy workplace protocols in social distancing. We were one of the first banks to fully shift to remote working model in key urban centers like New York City and Chicago as the outbreak started to progress in mid-March. Currently, 93% of our employees are effectively working remotely as a result of our investments in technology and the digital transformation we put in place over recent years. This is a best-in-class standard in our industry and a vital part of our business continuity. We also continue to evolve our workplace protocols as more information is available on reducing the spread of this virus and understanding the best ways to ultimately emerge from the current isolation measures. We are offering enhanced health benefits for COVID testing and care, as well as ongoing wellness programming to help employees through the stress and isolation of these new lifestyle requirements. We implemented an enhanced pay plan for employees that are not able to work remotely and are providing vital services in support of our business. And I'm proud to say that all of our branches remain open and able to serve customers. We modified ours and enhanced safety protocols, but we remain open for business. We're also focused on working with our customers who have been affected by the pandemic and providing relief when we can. We are working with more than 8,600 small businesses, primarily in our business capital position to provide them deferrals on their existing loans and leases. We quickly stood up an entirely new operational process in order to participate in the government's Paycheck Protection Program. We're providing mortgage forbearance to borrowers. We're waiving fees so customers could access deposits without penalty. And we continue to have ongoing dialogue with our commercial clients, and offer them our banking and structuring expertise and assistance in navigating during this period. We know it is a challenging time for many and we're committed to working with our customers. Commitment to our communities remains very important as well and CIT has committed $1 million to support non-profit partners with COVID-19 relief efforts in our key markets. While this is still an evolving landscape, I'm proud of the way we've been able to adapt to the situation, and demonstrate our resilience and commitment to do what's right for our team, our customers, our communities, and ultimately, our shareholders. Turning to the quarter, our results were primarily affected by the impact of the pandemic on the macroeconomic environment, which led to an increased credit reserves and goodwill impairment; the adoption of CECL, which dramatically changed the credit reserve model amid a volatile period; and the completion of the Mutual of Omaha Bank acquisition, which added about $8 billion of assets and $7 billion of deposits, and impacted the comparability of our results versus prior periods. We posted a net loss of $628 million or $6.40 per diluted common share due to the increased credit reserves and goodwill impairment. John will go into more detail on the underlying drivers of performance. But I first wanted to touch on a few key highlights. We completed the acquisition on January 1 and immediately kicked off our integration efforts, which remain on track and are expected to be completed by yearend. We improved our deposit costs by 34 basis points in the quarter through the addition and growth of the Homeowners Association deposit channel and also through our efforts to further optimize funding in the consumer channel. The community association banking business, which is the division that drives the HOA deposits, has been off to a strong start and had one of their best growth quarters ever. Between the existing portfolio and the growth in the quarter, that business added another $5 billion of lower cost deposits, CIT's funding profile and further bolstered our deposit base. We have already made investments in this business and launched the new reserve deposit product suite, as well as expanded our sales team. And we expect to remain on track in doubling the size of this business in 5 years. Our balance sheet remains strong, ending the quarter with more than $42 billion in deposits and $9.5 billion in liquid assets. Our core average loans and leases were up 1% from the prior quarter, excluding the acquisition. Our loan and lease to deposit ratio at the bank increased slightly to 95% and we remain on target with our expense initiatives. Managing our risk remain critically important as it has been for some time. We have maintained prudent underwriting standards and are thoughtfully originating business in areas where we believe there are opportunities. We continue to proactively manage our portfolio and over recent years, we have sold or significantly reduced our high risk portfolios and shifted to more collateral based lending. We know there are still some portfolios that we will feel the stress of the economic disruption more than others, and we have shared more disclosure in the COVID response deck that was posted today. I will touch on 2 key areas which are energy and retail. As you know, we are a leader in the power and renewables space, and have continued to grow that part of our power and energy business. We do still have loan exposure to oil and gas though. And it is comprised of about $1 billion in funded exposure, most of which is secured and represents about 3% of our total loans. Our exposure to the retail sector is primarily in our factoring business and half of that factoring exposure is made up of our top-10 customers, which are investment-grade or near investment-grade companies. Our client base is fairly diversified across consumer segments and we continue to have frequent dialogue with our clients and work closely with them through this period. Some clients have also shifted their business to produce or procure masks, gowns and other much needed items for the fight against the coronavirus, and we're pleased to help support them in those efforts. We are closely monitoring these and other portfolios that may be further impacted as a result of the current economic environment. As mentioned this quarter, we adopted CECL, and we leverage the capital stress testing capabilities we built when we were a CCAR bank. We conducted a robust process as we set our reserves that reflected what our best view of the economic environment was at that point in time and its potential impact on the portfolio going forward. Don will walk you through the details of that process shortly. And as we mentioned we also have our Chief Credit Officer, Marisa Harney available for Q&A later in the call. To summarize, we have ample liquidity and a robust stress testing process to ensure we can meet our funding needs even in a stressed environment. We continue to run severely adverse stress scenarios even though we have no longer subject to the CCAR process, which informs our capital levels. Our reserves are strong, covering 2.9% of loans and we have an additional $120 million of allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposures. We are confident and our ability to respond to the challenges before us and weather this economic downturn. The work we have done in recent years has best positioned us for this period. We are actively managing every facet of the company and the continuity of our business. And with that, I'll turn it over to John. Thanks, John. As mentioned, these are unprecedented times, and I have confidence that we have the resources, expertise and rigor to continue to navigate this environment with diligence and care. CIT of today is completely different than the company that went through the last economic disruption. We are a national back with diverse and stable sources of funding. We have strong liquidity levels and robust risk management practices. We will continue to focus on ensuring we have ample capital and liquidity to whether this environment and believe the strength of our balance sheet gives us stabilizing force through this volatile period. We are also focused on pursuing opportunities where we see them in the HOA banking channel and other areas of the commercial segment that could align to our strengths. We remain steadfast in doing the right thing for our employees, customers, communities and shareholders. And with that, we're happy to take your questions. You know what, Moshe, we have Marisa Harney, our Credit Officer on the line. I'm going to turn that one over to Marisa. Yeah, but I also want to add that there is a lot of things that we're doing about this. One is just rigorous portfolio management. We have received some requests for lease restructuring and rental relief. And we are addressing these on a case-by-case basis. We are looking for opportunities to repurpose sand cars. We're also working on continuing to drive down our maintenance costs and we have a lot of initiatives going there, including managing our repair process, increasing the use of mobile repair units. And so, this has allowed us to offset the pricing trend a little bit. And then, as John mentioned in his script before that other strategies that selling older cars as a gain, we'll probably expect lower gains over the next quarter. But I do want to leave everybody with the thought that we should remember that railcars or along with the assets and their performance should be reviewed over cycle, not just this point in time. Yes, we can. Yeah. I would just to add that on the expense side, we're on target for all of our cost reductions. We had the $50 million in that cost reductions for 2021 over and above the [$60 million] [ph] in the cost saves from Mutual of Omaha. So we feel we're on track, and we actually believe, there's some more opportunities there on the expense side of the business. And I think, we do see some potential opportunities on the revenue side of the business going into the pandemic, we had a really good quarter in capital markets with organic growth. Fees were up like 25%. We're having very good momentum on the deposit side of the business. In fact, when you look at the defensive drawdowns from the commercial business, we were able to keep 1/3 of those deposits. Now for company like CIT, which really had \u2013 I think that's been a really big accomplishment for CIT to do that, it really shows our strategy of trying to expand customer relationship and focus on deposits. And I think that our strengths in ABL and our industry expertise is going to position us well for a lot of the restructures going on in the market and restructuring activity. In business capital, one of the bright spots has been technology leasing, because of the trend of schooling at home and working at home, we've had really good volumes in technology. And I think, one of the first places we're going to recover here is in construction, which will also bear well for the business. So we do see some bright spots here coming out of it. Marisa, you want to take that one? Great. And, I just want to add that, we're in daily contact with our factoring clients, providing them a lot of expertise and advice during this period. And one is that China factories are back open. They're running like at 80%. We have observed that certain of our customers are gathering liquidity in anticipation of reopening, which really could portend their intention to meet vendor obligations. We also have exposure to certain retailers who remain open, such as the discount and online stores. But it's an evolving situation and we're continuing to work closely with them, navigating with them during this time. Yeah. Great. Thank you, Elisa. And thank you, everyone, for joining this morning.

            "content": "Sure, thanks, Ellen. Good morning. Less bad and more bad are relative terms, obviously, in the current environment. I think that less bad is going to be more dictated by duration, than necessarily a specific industry. We have a pretty broad-based middle-market business. We also have technology businesses and renewable energy, is that I think I would put on the greener side of being more positive in the current environment. And as Ellen identified, and John identified, I think that, obviously, with oil falling into negative territory, I think oil and gas, which we have about $550 million of E&P exposure, and that's disclosed in the additional material is clearly something we need to watch closely. And then, there is a very unpredictable environment going on in retail, which will be dictated by, again, the duration of the government \u2013 the U.S. government keeping us closed. I think that as Ellen also indicated, 50% of our portfolio in our factoring retail is in investment-grade companies and I expect those to be not as impacted. Sure. I think that the \u2013 again, so these are not equal in severity. As we mentioned in the factoring receivables, a considerable portion of that is investment grade. So we're not anticipating that's going to result in any material issues for us. When you look at the oil and gas number, I know you're running your finger down that left-hand column, only about half of that is actually exposed in the E&P sector and we believe that our customers are hedged 75% this year and 50% into next year at considerably higher levels of oil prices.

            "name": "John Fawcett",
            "content": "Thank you, Ellen, and good morning, everyone. Our results this quarter reflect 3 key events during the quarter: first, the acquisition of Mutual of Omaha Bank on January 1, which impacts the comparability of our financial results to prior quarters; second, we adopted CECL on January 1. Given that the CECL standard introduced this economic forecasting into the allowance for credit loss process, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic significantly increased our first quarter provision for credit losses; and third, the deterioration of the macroeconomic environment triggered an interim goodwill assessment at quarter end that resulted in a goodwill impairment. As Ellen indicated, well ahead of this crisis, we completed a significant transformation of our business that strengthened our risk profile and focused our priorities. We strengthened our balance sheet as deposits now constitute 84% of our total funding and we eliminated less stable sources of wholesale funding, and we strengthened our risk management practices, sold higher risk portfolios, shifted our portfolio to more collateral-based loans and significantly decreased our criticized assets, which were down 10% from a year-ago. As a result of our transformation, we entered this challenging environment with a stronger balance sheet to support our customers, clients, communities and employees as we navigate through this period. We have provided a supplemental presentation on our website to describe our preparedness in response to COVID-19, including descriptions of our transformation, corporate and operational response, and our liquidity, funding and capital position. Before I get into the results for the quarter, I want to point out that our funding and liquidity levels remain strong and we believe sufficient to endure the current cycle. Our liquidity position is based on a robust stress testing process to ensure we are able to meet expected and contingent funding needs under combined idiosyncratic and market stresses. And we are well positioned to endure the stressed environment. At the end of the quarter, we maintain $9.5 billion of liquid assets comprised of available cash and unencumbered HQLA securities making up approximately 16% of total assets. We also had $3.5 billion of availability under our contingent liquidity sources through secured facilities in our corporate revolver. In addition, our funding mix is substantially deposit based and diversified across multiple channels including our new stable, lower cost HOA deposit channel added from the Mutual of Omaha Bank acquisition, which have a record quarter of deposits growth. As Ellen indicated, we are off to a good start and remain committed to doubling this deposit channels over the next 5 years. Our loan and lease to deposit ratio stands at 95% at the bank and 109% on a consolidated basis. We also have access to unsecured debt markets at both the bank and the bank holding company. Over the years, we have flattened and staggered our debt maturity schedule, as a result our next unsecured debt maturity is only $500 million and not due until March of 2021. Our capital position is sufficient to withstand a severely adverse stress scenario that includes both market and idiosyncratic stresses. While we are no longer CCAR bank, we continue to run our own models using the severely adverse stress scenario provided with Federal Reserve. We ended the quarter with common equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.7% reflecting the Mutual of Omaha Bank acquisition on January 1, which reduced the common equity Tier 1 ratio to approximately 10%. And the adoption of CECL, which is a result of the current macroeconomic forecast, added $405 million to our credit provision. Throughout the month of March, we continue to assess changes in macroeconomic scenarios as the impact of the pandemic accelerated globally. We analyzed and modeled various scenarios from the third-party that is widely used in the industry. Quantify the sensitivity of the allowance for credit loss or ACL, to changes in the underlying macroeconomic forecast. We ultimately utilized an updated baseline scenario with reflected expectations for economic impacts from COVID-19 as of March 20, and added an additional downside adjustment that took into consideration, developments heading into quarter-end. The baseline scenario assumed return to economic growth in late 2020, while the downside adjustment incorporated more stressful scenarios. These additional scenarios assumed a more V-shaped recession with the reduction and annualized real GDP growth of close to 20% in the second quarter of this year as well as the less volatile, but more prolonged U-shaped recession that assumed in elevated unemployment rate through early 2022. We also took into consideration scenario probabilities, potential impact of government support, prior capital stress testing results, and the limitation of models when a high degree of volatilities introduced to the macro forecast. We estimate that the impact of the additional reserve reduced capital by about 60 basis points after adjusting for the new 5-year transition for the Interagency Interim Final Rule. We provided a common equity Tier 1 walk in the appendix of the earnings presentation that highlights the impact of the transition rule. We maintain our commitment to our regulators to raise our common equity Tier 1 ratio to our target level of 10.5%, although our timing to achieve that goal may now be longer than initially expected. Based on our current capital on RWA levels, we have a capital buffer of $1.2 billion when compared to the Federal Reserve minimums, including the capital conservation buffer levels. To provide some additional context around the sufficiency of our capital levels with respect to ongoing uncertainty in the economic environment and CECL reserves for loan losses. We conducted a sensitivity analysis leveraging our 9-quarter cumulative loss rate from our 2019 severely adverse stress scenario to our current levels of loans. This scenario reflected a deep and prolonged recession with declines in GDP for 7 consecutive quarter and an unemployment rate in excess of 8% for all period except for the first 3 quarters, peaking at 10%. Based on this sensitivity, our current reserve level of $1.1 billion would be about 60% of the implied stressed losses over a 9-quarter period implying an increase in the CECL reserve of approximately $800 million compared to the March 31 reported amount. We will update our capital stress test later this year as markets normalize and intend also to run the Federal Reserve's 2020 severely adverse stress scenario of CCAR banks. Before we get into the details, I want to let you know that given the uncertainties created by the COVID-19 pandemic on the current macroeconomic environment. We are withdrawing our outlook for the full year 2020 and our medium term return on tangible common equity target. Turning to the financial results on Slide 3 of the presentation, I will refer to the first quarter 2020 earnings slide deck. We reported a GAAP net loss of $628 million or $6.40 per diluted share driven by goodwill impairment and a higher credit provision, both a result of the market environment driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. Noteworthy items are listed on Slide 5, and included in after-tax goodwill impairment charge of $339 million. The deterioration of the macroeconomic environment, the low rate environment and, in particular, the decrease in CIT and peer bank stock prices triggered an interim goodwill impairment assessment that resulted in an impairment charge. The charge did not include the goodwill recognized from the acquisition of Mutual of Omaha Bank, and is non-cash \u2013 is a non-cash charge, it did not have any impacts on regulatory capital. Other noteworthy items resulted from the Mutual of Omaha Bank acquisition and included the $37 million after-tax CECL reserve on acquired non-PCD loans that flowed through the P&L as a credit provision on the day of acquisition. The charge represents a double counting of credit risk in both the purchase price and the allowance build. In addition, we recognized $14 million in after-tax merger and integration costs. Excluding noteworthy items, we reported a net loss of $238 million or $2.43 per share, reflecting credit provision, of which $405 million or $332 million after-tax is driven by the forecasted macroeconomic environment. Slide 6 and 7 highlights our net finance revenue and margin. Net finance revenue grew from the prior quarter reflecting higher assets from the Mutual of Omaha Bank acquisition on January 1 and growth in our core loans and leases. However, net finance margin declined to 2.73% as the swift 150 basis point cut in the Fed rates \u2013 Fed funds rate this quarter and lower LIBOR levels resulted in a significant reduction in yields on our floating rate loans and securities. The reduction in yield \u2013 asset yields also reflects the addition of the Mutual of Omaha Bank loans and securities that are lower yielding. We also recognized $9 million of accelerated premium amortization in our MBS portfolio reducing margin by 6 basis points. And loan prepayment levels fell significantly as a result of the current environment reflecting resulting in lower prepayment related benefits. In our Rail business, net operating lease revenues declined further than expected as utilization declined to about 91% from 94% last quarter. Renewal rates were priced down 18% on average, and maintenance costs were higher, including increased storage cost from off-lease cars. Lower borrowing costs offset some of the impact on asset yields as the addition of lower cost HOA deposits from Mutual of Omaha Bank, lower market rates and pricing actions across all our deposit channels resulted in a reduction in deposit rates. Other non-interest income improved to $131 million and is illustrate on Slide 8. The increase reflects higher net gains on sales of assets. Improvements in fee income from last quarter included activity from our community association business acquired from the Mutual of Omaha Bank. Capital markets fees increased modestly as we continued to build momentum earlier in the quarter before the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. We had a minimum loan position at the end of the quarter and took a $4 million mark, which we believe is appropriate to clear these positions in the coming months. Given the historic level of interest rate volatility, our customer derivatives business had a record quarter. However, the increase was more than offset by a negative mark of $8 million on credit valuation adjustments given widening credit spreads. Factoring commissions were down reflecting lower factoring volume from seasonality and the slowdown later in the quarter resulting in the current macroeconomic environment. We generated about $14 million of gains on the sale of securities as we took advantage of opportunities in the fixed income market and sold some of our investment securities, including non-HQLA securities acquired from Mutual of Omaha Bank. As part of our ongoing portfolio risk management activities, we opportunistically sold PCD loans from the Legacy Consumer Mortgage portfolio. While higher yielding, we generated approximately $13 million in gains, further reduced our risk profile and released reserves. Looking into the second quarter, we see the following trends. The significant reduction in factoring volume reflecting a full quarter impact from the COVID-19 and the U.S. retail shutdown, which will impact commissions significantly. As part of our portfolio management activity of our rail fleet, gain on sale of railcars have been running between $15 million and $25 million per quarter. We expect lower gains next quarter, as we will likely delay some of that activity to later in the year given the dislocation in the market. We will continue to look for opportunities to selectively prune the LCM portfolio, although the current environment may make this challenging in the near-term. In terms of capital markets activity, we continue to see opportunities to lead transactions in our core industries less impacted by the current environment, although we are pursuing more arrangements in this environment. These deals are likely to have stronger structural protections and wider spreads. Our capital markets pipeline is reasonably strong in those industries, although predicting when deals will come together is still uncertain. Turning to Slide 9, we continue to be disciplined on the management of our expenses and remain focused on achieving the additional $50 million in net cost reductions in 2021, along with the additional $30 million in cost synergies we committed to from the Mutual of Omaha Bank acquisition. The increase in operating expenses this quarter primarily reflects the addition of Mutual of Omaha Bank and seasonality, and to a lesser extent from first quarter benefit restarts. For 2020, we still expect to achieve the $16 million in cost synergies related to the Mutual of Omaha Bank acquisition. Slide 11 provides more detail on average loans and leases by division. Excluding the $6.3 billion in loans acquired from the Mutual of Omaha Bank. Our average core loans and leases increased by 1%. In commercial banking, our pipelines were strong heading into the quarter, and while market sentiment shifted dramatically in March following the acceleration of the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to close deals for our clients. Origination volumes were up 30% from the year-ago quarter, and essentially flat compared to the fourth quarter. In March, prepayments slowed considerably in Commercial Finance and Real Estate Finance contributing to asset growth. Revolver utilization increased in the second and third week of March as clients drew on their lines given increased business uncertainty, although defensive draws started to moderate towards the end of March and had been modest since the beginning of April. Given our middle market focus, we generally don't participate in larger revolving loans, and therefore, we don't expect to see the same level of revolver draws as some of our regional bank peers. Through last week, we have funded $620 million of defensive draws for our clients across Commercial Banking. A little over 1/3 of those draws were in commercial services, our factoring business, with a little more than half across the rest of Commercial Finance and the rest of Real Estate Finance. Our increased focus in treasury and payment services helped us to retain a significant portion of these draws as commercial businesses. As Ellen indicated, we are working with small business customers to provide payment deferrals for up to 3 months for qualified customers impacted by the economic events brought upon by COVID-19. We expect these loan modifications to meet the requirements to suspend the TDR classification in any related impairment for accounting purposes. The macroeconomic environment has also added pressure to the North American rail industry. Railcar loadings have generally declined as the impact of COVID-19 has put more pressure on industrial sectors and low oil prices have reduced car demand in that sector. We are seeing more resiliency in demand for our cars carrying grains and plastics. Given the macroeconomic environment, we expect further deterioration and now think our lease rates will reprice down 20% in 2020, and utilization could decline to the mid- to high-80% area over the next 12 months depending on the duration of lower oil prices and the COVID-19 pandemic. We are staying in close communication with our rail customers and stand ready to support them through this crisis. We have a diversely with broad market coverage, servicing a wide range of industries. Our strategy is to remain vigilant on asset readiness and ensure that we have the cars that meet our customer demand requirements. The average age of our fleet is 14 years, the youngest in North America. We have more higher load capacity cars, which maximizes the shipping optimization for our customers. And our strong market position and management team as well as our customer service positions us well to navigate the current environment. Moving on to deposits on Page 13, we are off to a good start in our new lower-cost HOA channels as we focus on doubling these deposits over the next 5 years. First quarter growth tends to be seasonally high, and this year, the team had their highest growth rate ever. We ended the quarter with just over $5 billion in deposits and expect continued growth in line with expectations as we move further into the year. Average overall deposit cost declined 34 basis points to 150 basis points, reflecting the mix of lower cost deposits from the acquisition, as well as continued downward re-pricing in all other channels. In the direct bank, we continue to monitor the market. We remain competitive in products that align with our strategy, as we optimize costs and funding needs. Our direct bank deposits have grown a little over a $1 billion since the start of the quarter and we lowered our non-maturity deposit rates by 5 basis points in April 5 and another 15 basis points on April 20. Direct banks, including ourselves, have reduced their rates for CDs and savings products, but we have not seen a significant reduction in alignment with the sharp reduction in Fed funds rates. That said, we expect over time we will see larger rate reductions in non-maturity deposits from online banks, ourselves included. Slide 14 highlights our credit trends. Net charge offs increased this quarter and were primarily driven by oil and gas loans, most of which were acquired in Mutual of Omaha Bank acquisition and an increase in the business capital division, mostly related to transportation. For non-accrual loans, the increase in consumer banking relates to the accounting presentation for PCD loans, which upon the adoption of CECL are now subject to the same presentation as disclosure as non-PCD loans. The adoption of CECL and the Mutual of Omaha Bank acquisition increased our ACL on January 1 by $280 million, representing a coverage ratio of about 2%. Note that $141 million of this increase relates to PCD loans, and therefore, did not impact capital. In the first quarter, we significantly increased those reserves to $1.1 billion due to the impact of the COVID-19 environment, bringing our coverage ratio to 2.9% of total loans. We also added $65 million to our allowance for off-balance-sheet credit exposures, bringing total reserves for on and off balance-sheet exposures to over $1.2 billion. We have included a page in the appendix of the presentation to provide some more detail on the components of the reserve. Note that our ACL reserve is a point in time measure that will continue to be informed by ever-changing macroeconomic conditions and impacted variables. Before I turn it back to Ellen, I wanted to highlight that we also provided COVID-19 supplemental information, additional information on portions of our portfolio expected to be more impacted by the current environment, including retail exposure within our factoring business, which consists principally unsecured short-term discretionary lines and where our top-10 customers, who constitute about 50% of our exposure are investment-grade or near-investment-grade; oil and gas loans, which are geographically diversified across major producing basins and where only about half our loan exposure is to reserve based loans; borrowers with exposures to commodity prices are predominantly hedged into 2020 and 2021; retail and hotel exposure within our real estate finance division, which are backed by strong sponsors with whom we have long-term relationships; senior living exposure which is geographically diversified; gaming exposure, which is more regional \u2013 to more regional borrowers as opposed to tourist destinations; and finally, restaurants and franchised finance, with the majority is exposures to strong national brands in the quick-serve industry. We also added a number of pages in the appendix of the presentation to provide additional information on some of our portfolios including collateral-backed portfolios, cash flow loan portfolio and our rail fleet. Our collateral-backed loan portfolio includes loans based financial sponsors that are secured by strong collateral with LTV as of the end of the year in the 50% to 60% area. These include commercial airlines exposure, which is primarily the financial sponsors and backed by commercial aircraft leased to strong quality airlines; and our maritime exposure, which is to well-diversified mainstream oceangoing assets and primarily with long-term contracts. We have no exposure to cruise lines. We also added a page to describe our cash flow loans, which we reduced to about 10% of our loan and lease exposure in the transformation. And finally, we included some additional disclosure on our rail fleet, the highlight to diversification of our fleet by both car-count and net investment. We are watching all these sectors closely and applying sector-specific stresses on cash flows, analyzing collaterals and staying in close communication with our clients as we monitor the vulnerabilities within the portfolio. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Ellen. Yeah, well, look, as a starting point, I think, obviously, we withdrew guidance as I think most banks did. I think there is just not a lot of visibility. I think, Moshe, when I sat with you on stage back in the end of February at the Credit Suisse Conference, we talked about utilization maybe going down at 92% and then starting to bounce back a little bit around the rest of the year. You've got 24% North American fleet is still parked in stores and that seems to be increasing. If you just look, and we don't usually do this, but weekly rail-loadings are reflecting the economy. Auto is down 67% week on week. And, obviously, we're light on that obviously, but we're light in auto tracks. Chemicals and petroleum are down 7% week on week, that's likely to continue with the global oil. And the bright spots were in agriculture and paper products. And so, it's tough. I think our guidance is, is that we expect that rail utilization could go into the mid 80s and mid to high 80%s from where we're at right now. And then, beyond that, you've got the incremental cost as utilization declines of the storage of more cars going into storage. So it's just going to be challenging. I think like everything else, it's going to be tied largely to the pace of the recovery and what kind of recovery we start to see in terms of whether it's U-shaped or V-shaped. If it's a V-shaped recovery, you might expect these trends to reverse fairly quickly. If it's other than that, it could be [or factored] [ph] much longer. But it's still going to have an adverse impact on net finance margin going forward. Thank you. Yeah. So I think the easiest way to describe the way I think about it is, it's kind of a scenario cocktail. And we use 3 scenarios. We had an updated baseline pandemic scenario from Moody's on March 20, which was our baseline. We \u2013 and that's when we kind of snapped the line in terms of preparation for quarter end. We had the more volatile V-shaped scenario, which had a deeper cut into the second quarter and a more spontaneous recovery into the third quarter. And then, we leveraged another scenario, which we label as S3, which is a severely adverse scenario. So just to kind of give you some context in terms of the different scenarios, in terms of GDP, if you looked on our baseline, it had GDP down 5% and then moderating in the third quarter to down just 0.3%. If you look at the more volatile V-shaped scenario, you had GDP in the second quarter down almost 20%, but we're covering 11% in the third quarter. And in the severely adverse scenario that we also kind of applied as an overlay against the base case, you had GDP down 5% in the second quarter, and then down another almost 3% in the third quarter. And so \u2013 it's a little bit of out to me in terms of pulling all the numbers together. And I think if you look at a new baseline that I guess Moody's has provided on April 10, it portends that, again, it's another V-shaped recovery. But in the second quarter, you'd have GDP decline by 30%, but in the third quarter, we bounced back 17%. So \u2013 I mean, that's kind of the thoughts around the way we kind of manage through the process. I think obviously, we're going to continue to monitor the scenarios, our own portfolios in terms of real experience the capacity of the government programs to provide some level of recovery going into the economy. And I think we'll have better sense of this and more refinement as we get into the second quarter, but it obviously very fluid. Well, I think it's clearly more on the provision side. In the revenue side, I mean, we're at 0 rate. I mean, so we're already kind of feeling that challenge and has started to feed through in March. I mean, if you look at the first quarter, January and February are actually quite good months for us. And even halfway into March, we were fine. Part of this is \u2013 and part of the way we're thinking about forecasting in it's very difficult, because it remains very fluid is that you could almost run rate March into the second quarter. And absent, we wouldn't expect that we're going to take another $400 million charge, and obviously, the bill is behind us now. But run rating March and then having potentially some incremental element of provision, I think, it's really the larger challenge in terms of what we're going to face on a go forward basis is the provision. Yeah. Hey, Chris, it's John. I mean, it can probably be sized just because it's a function of, I guess, the recovery period. I guess, what I would say also, it really depends. So in any given quarter, you'll have between 4,000, 5,000, 6,000 cars that are renewing and it fundamentally depends on what kind of cars are renewing. That's going to impact, obviously, the renewal rates going forward. And so it's all tied back to the recovery or the pace to the kind of recovery we saw. Clearly, we weren't anticipating utilization going down to 91% or 90.7% in this quarter. If we see a V-shaped recovery that could bounce back pretty quickly, especially if the economy starts to come online, people start going back to work, the social distancing protocols all start to abate and the economy gets back online. But absent an economy, it's not clear what you're actually shipping. And so it's all interrelated. And I'm sorry, I can't give you better answer, but there is no clear answer. And the only thing I would add is just to be really clear is we do expect factoring commissions to be down in the second quarter. I mean, this is a supply challenge as well as demand challenge. Retailers have to start opening and shipments have to start coming in from not just China but around the world. So a lot has to happen for us to get back in standing."

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. 0:41 I would now like to introduce the host of this conference call, Ms. Deanna Hart, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nDeanna Hart: 0:52 Thank you, Gallus (ph). Good morning and thank you for joining us today. It is my pleasure to introduce our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Frank Holding; as well as our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Nix who will provide an overview of our fourth quarter and year end results and will be referencing our investor presentation, which you can find on our Investor Relations website. We are also pleased to have several other members of our leadership team in attendance today, who are available to participate in the Q&A portion of our call if needed. Following the completion of our formal presentation material, we'll be happy to take any questions you may have. We will mostly be speaking today on First Citizens BancShares stand-alone financial results, but we will provide an update on our merger activities with CIT as well as some CIT standalone quarterly and year-to-date financial highlights which are included on pages 22 and 23 of the presentation. 1:48 Our comments during today\u2019s presentation will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. We assume no obligations to update such statements. These risks are outlined for your review on Page 2 of the presentation. We will also reference non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of these measures against the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available in the appendix. 2:17 Finally First Citizens does not responsible for and does not added nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcript, provided by third party. 2:25 With that, I'll hand it over to Frank.\nFrank Holding: 2:29 Thank you, Deanna. And good morning, everyone. We appreciate all of you joining us today. And as you can see, on page three of our investor presentation, we're the dawning of a new and exciting era, with the closing of our transformational merger with CIT, creating a top 20 US financial institution with over $110 billion in assets. We believe this merger brings opportunity to become an even better bank than we've been for the last 124 years. It marks big and important changes in our long and accomplished history, in terms of our structure, size, scope, and capabilities. 3:13 The goal and combining our two companies is to create long-term value for all our constituents, including shareholders, customers, associates and communities. And will do this through our emphasis on stable leadership enduring values, and a commitment to helping people and businesses prosper by focusing on their long-term success. 3:39 We also believe success is grounded in our forever first motto as outlined on page 4 of the presentation. The core of forever first is the notion that we're going to be here for the long-term, and that we will always put our customers first. While the way we do banking changes as we bring forward new products, new services, new conveniences, and new ways of engaging our customers. The key principles of financial stability, a focus on long-term growth, and customer experience are things that will never change. 4:17 On page 5 of the presentation, you will see our statement of purpose, better banking, better tomorrows. In recent months, we've looked at the statement with fresh eyes to update it, as we look forward to the merger with CIT. Wherefore forever First focuses on our customers. The Statement of purpose focuses on our associates, specifically how we work and the culture we want to promote. 4:47 Supporting the statement our \u201cthree pillars\u201d, and I'll put that in quotation marks, which helps express the ways we deliver better banking and better tomorrows. These are qualities that are essential to who we are and how we work. The first pillar is long-term thinking. We place a lot of emphasis on building relationships to create long-term value and opportunity for our customers. The second pillar is service excellence. We believe in providing better service to our customers than our competitors and are dedicated to doing it with integrity, transparency, and respect. The third pillar is powerful results. We want to help create better outcomes for our customers, associates and communities. 5:43 As we work to integrate CIT, this statement will guide our teams and ensure we remain focused, all while delivering value to our shareholders. Since the combination of our companies on January 3, we've been actively engaging with and ensuring our new associates are properly welcomed to the combined company with the goal of binding us all into a unified team. We're also actively engaging with our customers, reaffirming our commitment to helping them with their financial needs. 6:20 As far as other integration activities, we anticipate the OneWest Bank conversion will occur during the third quarter, followed by legacy Mutual of Omaha during the fourth quarter. We are working diligently to finalize our combined strategic priorities and integration timelines, which we will share over the coming months. 6:47 This morning, we reported fourth quarter net income of $123.3 million or $12.09 per share, delivering another quarter of strong results to our shareholders. When compared to the third quarter. We saw increased net income \u2013 increased net interest income despite continued growth and deposits and pressure from our excess liquidity. We were able to deploy some of this excess liquidity into our loan and investment portfolios, despite the decline in the loan portfolio from SBA-PPP loan forgiveness activity. Non-interest income from our core fee income producing lines of business continued to be a source of strength, our credit quality remains solid, resulting in another net provision benefit. 7:48 All in all, it was another great quarter for First Citizens, and I want to thank all of our associates for their commitment in 2021. As we look forward, I want to mention a change we're making around the middle of the year regarding NSF and OD fees and overdraft fees. We will be eliminating our NSF fees and significantly lowering our overdraft fee from $36 to $10 on consumer accounts, we believe these changes are necessary to remain competitive in the current marketplace. 8:25 I will turn it over to Craig for a closer look at our financial results and then we'll open the line for questions.\nCraig Nix: 8:32 Thank you, Frank. And good morning, everyone. Starting on page 6 of the investor presentation, I will cover our fourth quarter earnings highlights earnings for the fourth quarter totaled $123.3 million down $800,000 from the linked quarter and $14.8 million from the same quarter a year ago. But earnings were down compared to those periods, we are pleased with our core earnings performance \u2013 performance, which I will touch on in a moment. Earnings for the fourth quarter translated into a return on average assets of 0.84% and the return on average equity of 10.96%. 9:13 Net income per common share was $12.09 compared to $12.17 in the third quarter, and $13.59 in the comparable quarter a year ago. For the late quarter lower earnings were due to higher non-interest expense and a decline in gain on sale of securities partially offset by increased net interest income and an increase in net benefit for credit losses. lower earnings from the comparable quarter a year ago were due to lower fair value, market value adjustments on equity securities and decline and gain on sale of securities, higher non-interest expense and lower SBA-PPP income all partially offset by higher net-interest income ex-PPP, a decline in provision for credit losses and higher core non-interest income. 10:08 While earnings were down for the linked and comparable quarters, we were pleased with ex-PPP net-interest income growth as well as core non-interest income for our \u2013 from our fee income producing lines of business. We were also pleased with our comparable fourth quarter results from a pre-provision net revenue growth perspective after removing non-core income and expense items. We continue to experience strong credit quality and reported a net recovery for the quarter. In addition, macroeconomic factors continue to improve resulting in a further reservedly, providing a $5.1 million net benefit from provision for credit losses during the fourth quarter. 10:50 For the year as macroeconomic factors have improved and we have sustained good credit quality, we released $45.8 million in reserves compared to a reserve bill of $35.9 million last year related to the uncertainty surrounding COVID-19. 11:09 On page 7, we highlight our year-over-year results, net income total $547.5 million for the full year at $55.7 million or 11.3% increase over 2020 is translated into a return on average assets of 1% and a return on average equity of 12.84%. The most significant factor contributing to the increase in earnings was a $36.8 million net benefit from provision for credit losses in 2021, compared to provision expense of $58.4 million last year. 11:51 The net charge-off ratio for the year declined from 8 basis points to 3 basis points, while net interest margin declined by 51 basis points. Our efficiency ratio remained flat, primarily due to core net revenue growth offsetting core non-interest expense growth. 12:14 Turning to pages 8 through 10, I will cover trend and net-interest income and net-interest margin. Net-interest income increased by 3% versus the prior quarter, primarily driven by higher SBA-PPP income, higher loan and investment balances only partially offset by lower loan and investment yields. While an increase in SBA-PPP interest income accounted for most of the dollar increase in net interest income during the quarter, net interest income ex-PPP and PCB loans increased by $5.3 million. 12:55 This increase over the linked quarter was due to loan investment portfolio growth, offsetting impacts from the low-interest rate environment and excess liquidity. We are pleased that loans ex-PPT grew at an annualized rate of 5.7% over the third quarter. While the increase in the absolute level of net-interest income during the quarter with a bright spot, as expected net-interest margin declined from the linked quarter by 3 basis points. As discussed in prior quarters, we continued to operate with liquidity above normal operating ranges, which continued to put downward pressure on net-interest margin. 13:36 On prior calls, we stated that we were monitoring interest rates closely and looking for opportunities to redeploy excess liquidity to grow the absolute level of net interest income. So in addition to solid organic loan growth during the quarter, we invested $2 billion in short duration US Treasuries to increase interest income while adding minimal interest rate risk. We thought the time was right to implement the strategy given that the market had fully priced in six Fed interest rate hikes into the \u201822 and \u201823. yield curves, thereby allowing us to pick up a sufficient spread over the Fed funds rate as we await the Fed to raise rates. 14:20 Despite deploying this cash and some earlier in the year, leading to a $3.2 billion increase in our investment portfolio over the last year. Our overnight investment balance at the end of the fourth quarter was $9.1 billion, essentially unchanged from the prior quarter. As mentioned in prior quarters, we purposefully maintain a conservative posture with respect to liquidity. Given that we believe there were opportunities to optimize our balance sheet once our merger with CIT was complete. 14:53 To that end, we announced Monday, that we intend to regain $2.9 billion of senior unsecured debt assumed in connection with our merger with CIT. The debt will be redeemed on February 24, 2022, the $2.9 billion includes four unsecured notes with maturities ranging from 2022 to 2025, and a weighted average coupon rate of 5%. This redemption aligns with our strategy to optimize the balance sheet for the newly combined company as we work to reduce higher debt costs by utilizing excess cash from our deposit growth. 15:31 In 2022, net interest income ex-PPP is poised to grow through balance sheet growth. However, we expect net \u2013 headline net interest margin to decline, albeit more moderately than it did in 2021. Due to continued excess liquidity at SBA-PPP income becoming less of a contributor moving forward, we will continue to seek opportunities to grow absolute levels of net interest income to offset declines in margin through organic loan growth, opportunistic additions to our investment portfolio, and continuing to optimize the liability side of the balance sheet. 16:10 Turning to page 11, I will cover non-interest income, which totaled $114.3 million during the fourth quarter. Headline non-interest income was down $8.7 million compared to the linked quarter driven mostly by an expected decline in securities gains, core non-interest income was relatively stable for the link periods. Headline non-interest income declined by $12.5 million dollars when compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Primary drivers included a $21.2 million reduction in fair market value adjustments on equities and securities gains partially offset by an $8.6 million increase in income from fee producing lines of business. The most significant factor of the increase with higher wealth income, driven by stronger sales and market value impacts leading to growth and assets under management. We also saw increases in service charges and income from Credit from Card Services. The increases were partially offset by a decline in mortgage income. 17:17 Turning to 2022, we expect continued momentum and are well and payments related businesses, we expect to continue to see moderation in mortgage income due to the impact of higher mortgage rates and consequently the slowing and refinance activity. As Frank noted earlier, we are making changes to our NSF and overdraft practices, which will reduce service charges. Consumer NSF and overdraft fees constitute approximately 50% of our service charges Income Statement line item. And we expect this change to result in a 35 to 40% decline in service charge revenue once fully implemented. 17:58 In terms of the dollar impact, we estimate a 2022 impact in the $15 million to $20 million range, and the full impact going forward to be between $35 million to $40 million. Given all of these factors, we expect low-single digit percentage growth and core non-interest income in 2022 as well paint \u2013 wealth and payments businesses continue to grow, providing an offset to lower mortgage and service charges income. 18:30 Turning to page 12, I will cover non-interest expense, non-interest expense increased by $10.4 million over the linked quarter, most of the increase occurred and other non-interest expense of the largest increases in foreclosure and collection expense and consulting costs. The remainder of the increase was spread among other general and administrative accounts. The efficiency ratio increased slightly during the quarter from 66.09% to 66.31%. When considering the impact of the current quarter's expenses from merger related costs, the impact of merger pre-hires and other episodic expenses, expenses were in line with expectations. We expect that our run rate and I'm talking legacy FCB here will increase by approximately 3% to 5%, next year, reflecting wage pressures, Salesforce additions and well in our fastest growing markets, and continue \u2013 and continued investment in digital transformation. 19:36 Page 13 provides balance sheet highlight and key ratios, and I will cover the significant components of the balance sheet on subsequent pages. Turning to page 14, I will cover loan growth for the linked quarter and year-over-year periods. Loans decreased $144 million or about 1.8% on an annualized basis this quarter, primarily due to a $593 million net decrease in SBA-PPP loans. 20:03 As I mentioned earlier, excluding PPP loans, we experienced solid annualized organic growth of 5.7% over the third quarter, the largest growth components were commercial and industrial and under occupied commercial real estate loans. On a year-over-year basis, loans declined by $420 million or about 1.3% primarily due to a $1.9 billion decrease in SBA-PPP loans, excluding PPP loans, we saw organic growth of $1.5 billion or 4.9%. 20:39 Overall, we are pleased with organic loan growth this year and we expect that growth will continue in the mid-single digit percentage range moving forward. However, the ultimate level of loan growth will be dependent upon continued economic expansion and our markets. 20:56 Turning to pages 15 through 17, I will cover a credit quality trends and our allowance for credit losses. Credit quality continues to be a source of strength. We reported a total net recovery of 1 basis point for the quarter. The non-performing assets to total loans and other real estate ratio was 0.50% (ph) at quarter end, down from 0.65% in the prior quarter and the lowest level since the second quarter of 2019. 21:28 Given these trends and improvement in macroeconomic factors, we released $45.8 million in reserves year-to-date, compared to reserve build of $35.9 million last year related to uncertainty surrounding the pandemic. Our allowance ratio ex-PPP loans, the time mostly from the time modestly from 58 basis points in the third quarter to 56 basis points in the fourth or 0.56% compared to the 0.58% in the third quarter, while credit quality continues to be strong, and we have a little indication that it won't continue to be moving forward. We do not expect significant reserve releases in 2022 and anticipate building reserves to support loan growth at some point during the year. 22:19 Pages 18 and 19 are covered deposit trends and our funding mix. We continue to experience strong deposit growth during the fourth quarter, with deposits growing at an annualized rate of 10.6% since the end of the third quarter. On a year-over-year basis deposits grew by 18.4%. Our balance sheet continues to be funded predominantly by core deposits with deposits representing over 96% of our funding base at the end of the quarter. The total cost of deposits declined by 1 basis point during the quarter to 6 basis points to total cost of interest bearing last liabilities also declined by 1 basis point. 23:02 Deposits and deposit growth are obviously at record levels. As we move forward, we will continue to monitor our deposits in the pandemic flow, to try to project future deposit growth and customer behavior. While we acknowledge that the pandemic has contributed to our deposit growth, we are pleased that over two-thirds of our 2021 deposit growth occurred in core-checking account. While we expect that overall deposit growth will moderate in 2022. We expect overall deposit balances to remain elevated and that they will continue to be a source of strength for our balance sheet and margin even as interest rates rise. 23:39 Turning to page 20, our capital position remains strong with all ratios above are within target ranges. As of the end of the fourth quarter. Our CET1 ratio was 11.50% and our total risk based capital ratio was 14.35%. Most of the growth in our risk based capital ratios was attributable to strong earnings during the year partially offset by growth in total risk weighted asset. As we have noted in prior quarters, our leverage ratio has been impacted by significant deposit growth that remains within an acceptable target range. As earnings are mostly offsetting the impact of increasing average assets. We expect that our merger with CIT, we will return our leverage ratio to a more normal level. 24:32 As Deanna stated earlier, we have included CIT income statements and balance sheets on pages 22 and 23 of the presentation. First, I will provide year-to-date income statement highlights for the year CIT reported net income of $922.3 million compared to a loss of $615.3 million in 2020. For the year CIT recognized a benefit for provision, totaling $327.4 million, compared to provision of $803 million in the prior year. 25:10 The provision relief in 2021 reflected a combination of factors, including a continued low level of net charge-off, a reduction in loan balances, as well as modest improvements and various macroeconomic factors. Note that the net charge-off ratio declined from 1.14% in 2020 to 0.16% in 2021. Nonaccrual loans declined by $190 million or by 32% during 2021, and ended the year, at 1.21% of total loans, now for 1.63% at the end of 2020. 25:48 Despite reserve releases during the year, the allowance for credit losses at the end of the year was 2.2%. Above the pre-pandemic post CECL implementation level of 2.04%. Net interest income held up fairly well during the year despite lower loan balances declining by $11.4 million, as lower interest expense on deposits and borrowings mostly offset a decline in interest income. 26:18 Non-interest income increased by $84.8 million, or about 6.2% over the prior year, primarily due to higher gain on sale of investment securities and higher factoring commissions. Non-interest expense was down $731.4 million, the largest component of the decline was related to a goodwill write down in 2020, which did not recur in 2021 that our main  spread among other operating expense accounts. 26:49 Turning to the quarter net income \u2013 net income for the fourth quarter was $216.1 million, up from $175.5 in the linked quarter. Net-interest income increased by $5.9 million due to higher investment balances and higher yields on earning assets lower deposit balances and run off of higher costs CDs and broker deposits. These positive impacts more than offset lower loan balances, which declined by 2% from the end of the third quarter. The net \u2013 the benefit from credit provision increased by $3.6 million due to the same factor side for the year-to-date change. Net charge-offs were 11 basis points during the fourth quarter. 27:36 During the fourth quarter non-interest income increased by $40.9 million over the linked quarter. The prior quarter included a $13 million charge related to the release of the cumulative transition adjustment related to the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary. The remaining $27.9 million increase was related to higher rental income due to increase rail utilization and upward pricing of leases, higher factoring commissions on seasonally higher volume, higher capital market foods and higher equipment sale gains, all partially offset by lower gains on the sale of securities. 28:14 Non-interest expense declined by $18 million, primarily related to lower headcount during the quarter. Turning to the balance sheet, loans declined by $3.3 billions at the end of 2020. Most of the decline is attributable to elevated levels of prepayments on real estate finance loans, the sale of the aviation portfolio and continued sales with consumer mortgage loans. 28:40 During the fourth quarter, originations increased over the prior quarter, but they were outstripped by commercial loan prepayment and the sale of consumer mortgage loans. Deposits were down $3.7 billion dollars, mostly due to run-off of higher rate CDs and CIT continued to optimize its balance sheet. We are pleased with CIT's year-to-date and quarterly results and are excited about the combination of our companies. Just as we were when we announced the plan merger in October of 2020. We remain positive about our prospects as we one preserve and grow both banks core businesses, two optimize the funding on the combined balance sheet and three, enhance operational efficiency by gaining economies of scale. 29:28 Work is currently underway to produce a financial forecast and plan for the combined company. This involves reassessing our earnings expectations for 2022 and 2023. By gaining a better line of sight into CIT\u2019s business plans and financial forecasts, validating expected efficiencies and finalizing our purchase accounting mark. Given that this work is underway, we will not be sharing pro forma financial information on the combined company today. We estimate that this work will be complete by early March, and we plan to share the results with you as soon as practicable after its completion. 30:07 This concludes my comments. Thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your time. I will now hand the floor back over to the operator to open it up for Q&A.\nOperator: 30:21 Ladies and gentlemen, . Our first question comes from the line of Kevin Fitzsimmons with D.A. Davidson.\nKevin Fitzsimmons: 31:16 Good morning, everyone.\nFrank Holding: 31:19 Good morning, Kevin.\nKevin Fitzsimmons: 31:23 I just want \u2013 I appreciate the detail on, putting the excess liquidity to work and the step up with the short-term securities. And Craig, I'm just wondering beyond that move, what additional moves you might be, and I know, we're probably talking just on First Citizens standalone basis for what other moves in terms of increasing the securities portfolio, you would likely look to do in the coming months? Thanks.\nCraig Nix: 31:59 Well, I can\u2019t say, because you have the company's balance sheet that combined cash would be around $12 billion. The redemption that we just to take it to around $9 billion. Overall, that's still suboptimal from an overnight investments to earning assets ratio. So we will continue to look for opportunities to redeploy that cash into investments and loans. And we will also look for opportunities in the combined company for funding synergies and specifically targeting higher cost, deposits on the liability side to replace with the lower cost core deposits.\nKevin Fitzsimmons: 32:48 Okay. Thank you. One question on just, this is more looking further out on a combined basis, but not getting into the weeds on the numbers, but I'm just thinking more conceptually in timing, I always thought of that one of the opportunities was combined the company's integrated get performance up to a certain level and then get more comfortable stepping in and utilizing some of the excess capital and buying back to stock and I'm just, Frank, I'm curious, what your thought, given that, we've had the delay in closing the deal and now you've said when you expect to get the conversions done, just curious what your timing, expected timing might be when you would feel comfortable stepping in and doing that?\nFrank Holding: 33:38 Well, Kevin, obviously, the first work ahead for us is to integrate the companies and exhibit that we are falling through with our integration plans. So as soon as we can after that occurs, we would demonstrate that we're integrating as planned and that we, put some earnings together and continue to build capital as soon as, as we can after that, we would intend to resume stock repurchases. I don't really have a specific timeframe, but as soon as possible.\nKevin Fitzsimmons: 34:22 Okay. Okay. Thanks very much. Thank you.\nFrank Holding: 34:25 Okay. Thank you, Kevin.\nOperator: 34:28 Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous Research.\nBrian Foran: 34:36 Hey, good morning. Maybe just a follow-up on the March potential communication of financial forecast pro forma, just in terms of nuts and bolts, is there anything we should watch out between now and then, do you file a pro forma balance sheet at any point or is, if we're kind of waiting for more info on the pro forma company, March is the next milestone?\nFrank Holding: 35:02 We are required to file pro forma information 71 days or 75 days after the effective day of the acquisition, so we do intend to do that and shortly thereafter, we would plan to come back and share those results.\nBrian Foran: 35:21 Great. And then, recognizing that the quantitative work is underway, I wonder if just qualitatively you could share it's been 400 days or so. You've had a lot of time to watch CIT sometime to start, working on the integration, is there any items you would highlight for people as better or worse than initial expectations again on a qualitative basis, then you step back and look, what's going better, what's going to worse?\nFrank Holding: 35:54 I would say what's going better is definitely credit losses, credit quality. Actually in both companies has gotten better, obviously, we've continued over this period. We've gotten around the uncertainty \u2013 some of the uncertainty around the pandemic that was talking some conservatism in terms of some of the adjustments. Some of that uncertainty as anticipated. So I would say that would be the major thing I would point out in that, other items probably, I don't think there will be significant fluctuations.\nBrian Foran: 36:36 And then maybe lastly, it was on the NIM commentary, I mean first to clarify, when you talked about some residual pressure, is that including any change in interest rates from the Fed or is that where we are today not contemplating potential fed hikes?\nCraig Nix: 36:54 Are you talking about our forward look?\nBrian Foran: 36:57 Yes. I think if I got it, right, when you were talking about the NII guide, you talked about growth driven by earning assets, but with some the pressures still, so hopefully, I got that right and then just clarifying, is that NIM pressure include any rising rates or is that extra rates?\nCraig Nix: 37:17 It includes and if you look, if you really have to look at it, if you look at without PPP, we sort of bottom out in the first quarter and then when the Fed starts \u2013 when rates start rising and we do have some rate hikes built into the \u2013 to our pro forma. We started turnaround in the second, third and fourth quarters, and obviously, the more rate increases is, the higher \u2013 the turnaround \u2013 the better that turnaround would be. So, we do start to see margin improvement sort of Ex-PPP, sort of third, fourth quarters, as those rate hikes take effect.\nBrian Foran: 38:01 Great. Thank you.\nCraig Nix: 38:04 Thank you.\nOperator: 38:05 Your next question comes from the line of Brady Gailey with KBW.\nBrady Gailey: 38:11 Hey, thanks Good morning guys. I wanted to start this \u2013 I wanted to start on a follow-up on the share buyback. And if you look at legacy FCNCA, you guys have been pretty active in the buyback, like when I look at 2019 and 2020 combined, I think repurchased about 16% of the companies of a big figure. You mentioned reengaging in the buyback. Will FCNCA be sensitive to the price of the stock when they think about buybacks or the way that you view it, it's just kind of good practice to always invest internally and repurchase shares over time. I'm just wondering how this stock has been pretty volatile recently. But if stock goes up a lot, should we still expect share buybacks, or do you think that you're really going to be pretty price sensitive there?\nCraig Nix: 39:07 I would say, I will give  answer here, I would say our general philosophy is to remain active in buybacks, but obviously, price weighs into that. We do want to make sure, there's a tangible book value payback period, that's adequate, that we're actually giving the return on that investment, just slightly would into any other acquisition with a general philosophy would be to remain active.\nBrady Gailey: 39:38 Okay. And then I think I remember in the past, you guys guiding to a target common equity Tier 1 ratio of 9% to 11%, I know you're on top of that, today, but that year end, but that's without CIT. When you think about the buyback, what capital ratio are you focusing on the most and what is the target of that ratio longer-term?\nCraig Nix: 40:07 Well, first of all, and I'm not going to share the pro forma of capital ratio as a combined company, but I think someone asked about what has gotten better obviously with the earnings of both companies in the credit quality, both companies improving, our capital ratios are going to be fairly high coming into this transaction much higher than we projected back in October of 2020. So, I would say that our capital ratio, I'm not going to \u2013 I'm not going to provide a target that our capital ratios will be significantly, and we'll have significant excess capital to grow internally or repurchase shares. So we feel like I will have good capacity to do that. We do have target ranges that we operate in, and we'll be mindful of those as we engage in that activity.\nBrady Gailey: 41:00 And just remind us Craig, what are your target ranges kind of longer-term with capital, it is the target ratios still common equity Tier 1 and is it 9% to 11%?\nCraig Nix: 41:11 That's correct.\nBrady Gailey: 41:16 Okay. All right. And then finally, for me, just on loan growth, mid-single digit, I know as much you guys have been pointing too. That's what you did this quarter. So in line, as we think about \u201922 and \u201923, do you think the combined company will still be able to grow loans in the mid-single digit level with CIT involved, like should that change at all with the new pro forma company?\nCraig Nix: 41:45 We would probably aspire to that, but I will tell you based on where things are right now, that would be a challenge. And we're really right now I'm trying to get a better line of sight into CIT\u2019s business units to determine that. So I would not promise our project mid-single digits percentage described at this time for the combined company.\nBrady Gailey: 42:10 Okay. All right, great. Thanks for adding the color guys.\nCraig Nix: 42:13 Thank you.\nOperator: 42:18 That now ends our Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call back over to our host for any closing remarks.\nDeanna Hart: 42:27 Thank you, Gallus, and thank you everyone for joining this morning. As always, we are appreciative of your ongoing interest in our company and if you have any further questions or need additional information, please feel free to reach out. I hope everyone have a great day.\nOperator: 42:43 Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Frank Holding",
            "content": "2:29 Thank you, Deanna. And good morning, everyone. We appreciate all of you joining us today. And as you can see, on page three of our investor presentation, we're the dawning of a new and exciting era, with the closing of our transformational merger with CIT, creating a top 20 US financial institution with over $110 billion in assets. We believe this merger brings opportunity to become an even better bank than we've been for the last 124 years. It marks big and important changes in our long and accomplished history, in terms of our structure, size, scope, and capabilities. 3:13 The goal and combining our two companies is to create long-term value for all our constituents, including shareholders, customers, associates and communities. And will do this through our emphasis on stable leadership enduring values, and a commitment to helping people and businesses prosper by focusing on their long-term success. 3:39 We also believe success is grounded in our forever first motto as outlined on page 4 of the presentation. The core of forever first is the notion that we're going to be here for the long-term, and that we will always put our customers first. While the way we do banking changes as we bring forward new products, new services, new conveniences, and new ways of engaging our customers. The key principles of financial stability, a focus on long-term growth, and customer experience are things that will never change. 4:17 On page 5 of the presentation, you will see our statement of purpose, better banking, better tomorrows. In recent months, we've looked at the statement with fresh eyes to update it, as we look forward to the merger with CIT. Wherefore forever First focuses on our customers. The Statement of purpose focuses on our associates, specifically how we work and the culture we want to promote. 4:47 Supporting the statement our \u201cthree pillars\u201d, and I'll put that in quotation marks, which helps express the ways we deliver better banking and better tomorrows. These are qualities that are essential to who we are and how we work. The first pillar is long-term thinking. We place a lot of emphasis on building relationships to create long-term value and opportunity for our customers. The second pillar is service excellence. We believe in providing better service to our customers than our competitors and are dedicated to doing it with integrity, transparency, and respect. The third pillar is powerful results. We want to help create better outcomes for our customers, associates and communities. 5:43 As we work to integrate CIT, this statement will guide our teams and ensure we remain focused, all while delivering value to our shareholders. Since the combination of our companies on January 3, we've been actively engaging with and ensuring our new associates are properly welcomed to the combined company with the goal of binding us all into a unified team. We're also actively engaging with our customers, reaffirming our commitment to helping them with their financial needs. 6:20 As far as other integration activities, we anticipate the OneWest Bank conversion will occur during the third quarter, followed by legacy Mutual of Omaha during the fourth quarter. We are working diligently to finalize our combined strategic priorities and integration timelines, which we will share over the coming months. 6:47 This morning, we reported fourth quarter net income of $123.3 million or $12.09 per share, delivering another quarter of strong results to our shareholders. When compared to the third quarter. We saw increased net income \u2013 increased net interest income despite continued growth and deposits and pressure from our excess liquidity. We were able to deploy some of this excess liquidity into our loan and investment portfolios, despite the decline in the loan portfolio from SBA-PPP loan forgiveness activity. Non-interest income from our core fee income producing lines of business continued to be a source of strength, our credit quality remains solid, resulting in another net provision benefit. 7:48 All in all, it was another great quarter for First Citizens, and I want to thank all of our associates for their commitment in 2021. As we look forward, I want to mention a change we're making around the middle of the year regarding NSF and OD fees and overdraft fees. We will be eliminating our NSF fees and significantly lowering our overdraft fee from $36 to $10 on consumer accounts, we believe these changes are necessary to remain competitive in the current marketplace. 8:25 I will turn it over to Craig for a closer look at our financial results and then we'll open the line for questions. 31:19 Good morning, Kevin. 33:38 Well, Kevin, obviously, the first work ahead for us is to integrate the companies and exhibit that we are falling through with our integration plans. So as soon as we can after that occurs, we would demonstrate that we're integrating as planned and that we, put some earnings together and continue to build capital as soon as, as we can after that, we would intend to resume stock repurchases. I don't really have a specific timeframe, but as soon as possible. 34:25 Okay. Thank you, Kevin. 35:02 We are required to file pro forma information 71 days or 75 days after the effective day of the acquisition, so we do intend to do that and shortly thereafter, we would plan to come back and share those results. 35:54 I would say what's going better is definitely credit losses, credit quality. Actually in both companies has gotten better, obviously, we've continued over this period. We've gotten around the uncertainty \u2013 some of the uncertainty around the pandemic that was talking some conservatism in terms of some of the adjustments. Some of that uncertainty as anticipated.

            "name": "Craig Nix",
            "content": "8:32 Thank you, Frank. And good morning, everyone. Starting on page 6 of the investor presentation, I will cover our fourth quarter earnings highlights earnings for the fourth quarter totaled $123.3 million down $800,000 from the linked quarter and $14.8 million from the same quarter a year ago. But earnings were down compared to those periods, we are pleased with our core earnings performance \u2013 performance, which I will touch on in a moment. Earnings for the fourth quarter translated into a return on average assets of 0.84% and the return on average equity of 10.96%. 9:13 Net income per common share was $12.09 compared to $12.17 in the third quarter, and $13.59 in the comparable quarter a year ago. For the late quarter lower earnings were due to higher non-interest expense and a decline in gain on sale of securities partially offset by increased net interest income and an increase in net benefit for credit losses. lower earnings from the comparable quarter a year ago were due to lower fair value, market value adjustments on equity securities and decline and gain on sale of securities, higher non-interest expense and lower SBA-PPP income all partially offset by higher net-interest income ex-PPP, a decline in provision for credit losses and higher core non-interest income. 10:08 While earnings were down for the linked and comparable quarters, we were pleased with ex-PPP net-interest income growth as well as core non-interest income for our \u2013 from our fee income producing lines of business. We were also pleased with our comparable fourth quarter results from a pre-provision net revenue growth perspective after removing non-core income and expense items. We continue to experience strong credit quality and reported a net recovery for the quarter. In addition, macroeconomic factors continue to improve resulting in a further reservedly, providing a $5.1 million net benefit from provision for credit losses during the fourth quarter. 10:50 For the year as macroeconomic factors have improved and we have sustained good credit quality, we released $45.8 million in reserves compared to a reserve bill of $35.9 million last year related to the uncertainty surrounding COVID-19. 11:09 On page 7, we highlight our year-over-year results, net income total $547.5 million for the full year at $55.7 million or 11.3% increase over 2020 is translated into a return on average assets of 1% and a return on average equity of 12.84%. The most significant factor contributing to the increase in earnings was a $36.8 million net benefit from provision for credit losses in 2021, compared to provision expense of $58.4 million last year. 11:51 The net charge-off ratio for the year declined from 8 basis points to 3 basis points, while net interest margin declined by 51 basis points. Our efficiency ratio remained flat, primarily due to core net revenue growth offsetting core non-interest expense growth. 12:14 Turning to pages 8 through 10, I will cover trend and net-interest income and net-interest margin. Net-interest income increased by 3% versus the prior quarter, primarily driven by higher SBA-PPP income, higher loan and investment balances only partially offset by lower loan and investment yields. While an increase in SBA-PPP interest income accounted for most of the dollar increase in net interest income during the quarter, net interest income ex-PPP and PCB loans increased by $5.3 million. 12:55 This increase over the linked quarter was due to loan investment portfolio growth, offsetting impacts from the low-interest rate environment and excess liquidity. We are pleased that loans ex-PPT grew at an annualized rate of 5.7% over the third quarter. While the increase in the absolute level of net-interest income during the quarter with a bright spot, as expected net-interest margin declined from the linked quarter by 3 basis points. As discussed in prior quarters, we continued to operate with liquidity above normal operating ranges, which continued to put downward pressure on net-interest margin. 13:36 On prior calls, we stated that we were monitoring interest rates closely and looking for opportunities to redeploy excess liquidity to grow the absolute level of net interest income. So in addition to solid organic loan growth during the quarter, we invested $2 billion in short duration US Treasuries to increase interest income while adding minimal interest rate risk. We thought the time was right to implement the strategy given that the market had fully priced in six Fed interest rate hikes into the \u201822 and \u201823. yield curves, thereby allowing us to pick up a sufficient spread over the Fed funds rate as we await the Fed to raise rates. 14:20 Despite deploying this cash and some earlier in the year, leading to a $3.2 billion increase in our investment portfolio over the last year. Our overnight investment balance at the end of the fourth quarter was $9.1 billion, essentially unchanged from the prior quarter. As mentioned in prior quarters, we purposefully maintain a conservative posture with respect to liquidity. Given that we believe there were opportunities to optimize our balance sheet once our merger with CIT was complete. 14:53 To that end, we announced Monday, that we intend to regain $2.9 billion of senior unsecured debt assumed in connection with our merger with CIT. The debt will be redeemed on February 24, 2022, the $2.9 billion includes four unsecured notes with maturities ranging from 2022 to 2025, and a weighted average coupon rate of 5%. This redemption aligns with our strategy to optimize the balance sheet for the newly combined company as we work to reduce higher debt costs by utilizing excess cash from our deposit growth. 15:31 In 2022, net interest income ex-PPP is poised to grow through balance sheet growth. However, we expect net \u2013 headline net interest margin to decline, albeit more moderately than it did in 2021. Due to continued excess liquidity at SBA-PPP income becoming less of a contributor moving forward, we will continue to seek opportunities to grow absolute levels of net interest income to offset declines in margin through organic loan growth, opportunistic additions to our investment portfolio, and continuing to optimize the liability side of the balance sheet. 16:10 Turning to page 11, I will cover non-interest income, which totaled $114.3 million during the fourth quarter. Headline non-interest income was down $8.7 million compared to the linked quarter driven mostly by an expected decline in securities gains, core non-interest income was relatively stable for the link periods. Headline non-interest income declined by $12.5 million dollars when compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Primary drivers included a $21.2 million reduction in fair market value adjustments on equities and securities gains partially offset by an $8.6 million increase in income from fee producing lines of business. The most significant factor of the increase with higher wealth income, driven by stronger sales and market value impacts leading to growth and assets under management. We also saw increases in service charges and income from Credit from Card Services. The increases were partially offset by a decline in mortgage income. 17:17 Turning to 2022, we expect continued momentum and are well and payments related businesses, we expect to continue to see moderation in mortgage income due to the impact of higher mortgage rates and consequently the slowing and refinance activity. As Frank noted earlier, we are making changes to our NSF and overdraft practices, which will reduce service charges. Consumer NSF and overdraft fees constitute approximately 50% of our service charges Income Statement line item. And we expect this change to result in a 35 to 40% decline in service charge revenue once fully implemented. 17:58 In terms of the dollar impact, we estimate a 2022 impact in the $15 million to $20 million range, and the full impact going forward to be between $35 million to $40 million. Given all of these factors, we expect low-single digit percentage growth and core non-interest income in 2022 as well paint \u2013 wealth and payments businesses continue to grow, providing an offset to lower mortgage and service charges income. 18:30 Turning to page 12, I will cover non-interest expense, non-interest expense increased by $10.4 million over the linked quarter, most of the increase occurred and other non-interest expense of the largest increases in foreclosure and collection expense and consulting costs. The remainder of the increase was spread among other general and administrative accounts. The efficiency ratio increased slightly during the quarter from 66.09% to 66.31%. When considering the impact of the current quarter's expenses from merger related costs, the impact of merger pre-hires and other episodic expenses, expenses were in line with expectations. We expect that our run rate and I'm talking legacy FCB here will increase by approximately 3% to 5%, next year, reflecting wage pressures, Salesforce additions and well in our fastest growing markets, and continue \u2013 and continued investment in digital transformation. 19:36 Page 13 provides balance sheet highlight and key ratios, and I will cover the significant components of the balance sheet on subsequent pages. Turning to page 14, I will cover loan growth for the linked quarter and year-over-year periods. Loans decreased $144 million or about 1.8% on an annualized basis this quarter, primarily due to a $593 million net decrease in SBA-PPP loans. 20:03 As I mentioned earlier, excluding PPP loans, we experienced solid annualized organic growth of 5.7% over the third quarter, the largest growth components were commercial and industrial and under occupied commercial real estate loans. On a year-over-year basis, loans declined by $420 million or about 1.3% primarily due to a $1.9 billion decrease in SBA-PPP loans, excluding PPP loans, we saw organic growth of $1.5 billion or 4.9%. 20:39 Overall, we are pleased with organic loan growth this year and we expect that growth will continue in the mid-single digit percentage range moving forward. However, the ultimate level of loan growth will be dependent upon continued economic expansion and our markets. 20:56 Turning to pages 15 through 17, I will cover a credit quality trends and our allowance for credit losses. Credit quality continues to be a source of strength. We reported a total net recovery of 1 basis point for the quarter. The non-performing assets to total loans and other real estate ratio was 0.50% (ph) at quarter end, down from 0.65% in the prior quarter and the lowest level since the second quarter of 2019. 21:28 Given these trends and improvement in macroeconomic factors, we released $45.8 million in reserves year-to-date, compared to reserve build of $35.9 million last year related to uncertainty surrounding the pandemic. Our allowance ratio ex-PPP loans, the time mostly from the time modestly from 58 basis points in the third quarter to 56 basis points in the fourth or 0.56% compared to the 0.58% in the third quarter, while credit quality continues to be strong, and we have a little indication that it won't continue to be moving forward. We do not expect significant reserve releases in 2022 and anticipate building reserves to support loan growth at some point during the year. 22:19 Pages 18 and 19 are covered deposit trends and our funding mix. We continue to experience strong deposit growth during the fourth quarter, with deposits growing at an annualized rate of 10.6% since the end of the third quarter. On a year-over-year basis deposits grew by 18.4%. Our balance sheet continues to be funded predominantly by core deposits with deposits representing over 96% of our funding base at the end of the quarter. The total cost of deposits declined by 1 basis point during the quarter to 6 basis points to total cost of interest bearing last liabilities also declined by 1 basis point. 23:02 Deposits and deposit growth are obviously at record levels. As we move forward, we will continue to monitor our deposits in the pandemic flow, to try to project future deposit growth and customer behavior. While we acknowledge that the pandemic has contributed to our deposit growth, we are pleased that over two-thirds of our 2021 deposit growth occurred in core-checking account. While we expect that overall deposit growth will moderate in 2022. We expect overall deposit balances to remain elevated and that they will continue to be a source of strength for our balance sheet and margin even as interest rates rise. 23:39 Turning to page 20, our capital position remains strong with all ratios above are within target ranges. As of the end of the fourth quarter. Our CET1 ratio was 11.50% and our total risk based capital ratio was 14.35%. Most of the growth in our risk based capital ratios was attributable to strong earnings during the year partially offset by growth in total risk weighted asset. As we have noted in prior quarters, our leverage ratio has been impacted by significant deposit growth that remains within an acceptable target range. As earnings are mostly offsetting the impact of increasing average assets. We expect that our merger with CIT, we will return our leverage ratio to a more normal level. 24:32 As Deanna stated earlier, we have included CIT income statements and balance sheets on pages 22 and 23 of the presentation. First, I will provide year-to-date income statement highlights for the year CIT reported net income of $922.3 million compared to a loss of $615.3 million in 2020. For the year CIT recognized a benefit for provision, totaling $327.4 million, compared to provision of $803 million in the prior year. 25:10 The provision relief in 2021 reflected a combination of factors, including a continued low level of net charge-off, a reduction in loan balances, as well as modest improvements and various macroeconomic factors. Note that the net charge-off ratio declined from 1.14% in 2020 to 0.16% in 2021. Nonaccrual loans declined by $190 million or by 32% during 2021, and ended the year, at 1.21% of total loans, now for 1.63% at the end of 2020. 25:48 Despite reserve releases during the year, the allowance for credit losses at the end of the year was 2.2%. Above the pre-pandemic post CECL implementation level of 2.04%. Net interest income held up fairly well during the year despite lower loan balances declining by $11.4 million, as lower interest expense on deposits and borrowings mostly offset a decline in interest income. 26:18 Non-interest income increased by $84.8 million, or about 6.2% over the prior year, primarily due to higher gain on sale of investment securities and higher factoring commissions. Non-interest expense was down $731.4 million, the largest component of the decline was related to a goodwill write down in 2020, which did not recur in 2021 that our main  spread among other operating expense accounts. 26:49 Turning to the quarter net income \u2013 net income for the fourth quarter was $216.1 million, up from $175.5 in the linked quarter. Net-interest income increased by $5.9 million due to higher investment balances and higher yields on earning assets lower deposit balances and run off of higher costs CDs and broker deposits. These positive impacts more than offset lower loan balances, which declined by 2% from the end of the third quarter. The net \u2013 the benefit from credit provision increased by $3.6 million due to the same factor side for the year-to-date change. Net charge-offs were 11 basis points during the fourth quarter. 27:36 During the fourth quarter non-interest income increased by $40.9 million over the linked quarter. The prior quarter included a $13 million charge related to the release of the cumulative transition adjustment related to the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary. The remaining $27.9 million increase was related to higher rental income due to increase rail utilization and upward pricing of leases, higher factoring commissions on seasonally higher volume, higher capital market foods and higher equipment sale gains, all partially offset by lower gains on the sale of securities. 28:14 Non-interest expense declined by $18 million, primarily related to lower headcount during the quarter. Turning to the balance sheet, loans declined by $3.3 billions at the end of 2020. Most of the decline is attributable to elevated levels of prepayments on real estate finance loans, the sale of the aviation portfolio and continued sales with consumer mortgage loans. 28:40 During the fourth quarter, originations increased over the prior quarter, but they were outstripped by commercial loan prepayment and the sale of consumer mortgage loans. Deposits were down $3.7 billion dollars, mostly due to run-off of higher rate CDs and CIT continued to optimize its balance sheet. We are pleased with CIT's year-to-date and quarterly results and are excited about the combination of our companies. Just as we were when we announced the plan merger in October of 2020. We remain positive about our prospects as we one preserve and grow both banks core businesses, two optimize the funding on the combined balance sheet and three, enhance operational efficiency by gaining economies of scale. 29:28 Work is currently underway to produce a financial forecast and plan for the combined company. This involves reassessing our earnings expectations for 2022 and 2023. By gaining a better line of sight into CIT's business plans and financial forecasts, validating expected efficiencies and finalizing our purchase accounting mark. Given that this work is underway, we will not be sharing pro forma financial information on the combined company today. We estimate that this work will be complete by early March, and we plan to share the results with you as soon as practicable after its completion. 30:07 This concludes my comments. Thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your time. I will now hand the floor back over to the operator to open it up for Q&A. 31:59 Well, I can't say, because you have the company's balance sheet that combined cash would be around $12 billion. The redemption that we just to take it to around $9 billion. Overall, that's still suboptimal from an overnight investments to earning assets ratio. So we will continue to look for opportunities to redeploy that cash into investments and loans. And we will also look for opportunities in the combined company for funding synergies and specifically targeting higher cost, deposits on the liability side to replace with the lower cost core deposits. 36:54 Are you talking about our forward look? 37:17 It includes and if you look, if you really have to look at it, if you look at without PPP, we sort of bottom out in the first quarter and then when the Fed starts \u2013 when rates start rising and we do have some rate hikes built into the \u2013 to our pro forma. We started turnaround in the second, third and fourth quarters, and obviously, the more rate increases is, the higher \u2013 the turnaround \u2013 the better that turnaround would be. So, we do start to see margin improvement sort of Ex-PPP, sort of third, fourth quarters, as those rate hikes take effect. 38:04 Thank you. 39:07 I would say, I will give  answer here, I would say our general philosophy is to remain active in buybacks, but obviously, price weighs into that. We do want to make sure, there's a tangible book value payback period, that's adequate, that we're actually giving the return on that investment, just slightly would into any other acquisition with a general philosophy would be to remain active. 40:07 Well, first of all, and I'm not going to share the pro forma of capital ratio as a combined company, but I think someone asked about what has gotten better obviously with the earnings of both companies in the credit quality, both companies improving, our capital ratios are going to be fairly high coming into this transaction much higher than we projected back in October of 2020. So, I would say that our capital ratio, I'm not going to \u2013 I'm not going to provide a target that our capital ratios will be significantly, and we'll have significant excess capital to grow internally or repurchase shares. So we feel like I will have good capacity to do that. We do have target ranges that we operate in, and we'll be mindful of those as we engage in that activity. 41:11 That's correct. 41:45 We would probably aspire to that, but I will tell you based on where things are right now, that would be a challenge. And we're really right now I'm trying to get a better line of sight into CIT's business units to determine that. So I would not promise our project mid-single digits percentage described at this time for the combined company. 42:13 Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to First Citizens BancShares Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call.  As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce host of this conference call, Ms. Deanna Hart, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nDeanna Hart: Thank you, Julie. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. It is my pleasure to introduce our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Frank Holding; as well as our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Nix who will provide an overview of our third quarter 2021 results and will be referencing our investor presentation, which you can find on our Investor Relations website. We are pleased to have several other members of our leadership team here with us today, who will be available for questions if needed. After the presentation, we'll be happy to take any questions you may have. As we have not closed the transaction with CIT Group, we will be speaking today on First Citizens BancShares stand-alone performance only. And will provide an update of our planned merger with CIT. Our comments will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. These risks are outlined for your review on Page 2 of the presentation. We will also reference non-GAAP financial measures in the presentation. Reconciliations of these measures against most directly comparable GAAP measures are available in the appendix. With that, I'll hand it over to Frank.\nFrank Holding: Thank you, Deanna. And good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. This morning, we reported third quarter net income of $124.1 million, or $12.17 per share, delivering another quarter of strong financial results to our shareholders. We continue to see positive trends in net interest income despite continued pressure on margins from our growing level of excess liquidity and the sustained low rate environment. Noninterest income from our core fee income producing lines of business also remained robust during the quarter and was up over the prior quarter. Additionally, credit quality remained solid, resulting in another net provision benefit, albeit smaller than in previous quarter's benefit. We achieved another consecutive quarter of loan and deposit growth, both of which continue to be bright spots for our company as we remain focused on building long-term relationships with our customers. Total loans adjusted for SBA-PPP runoff grew $437 million during the third quarter, or by 5.6% on an annualized basis. We saw strong growth in both our consumer and commercial lines of business. Deposits were up $1.7 billion during the third quarter, representing an annualized growth rate of 13.6%. I'm sure many of you are looking for an update on our planned merger with CIT Group. On September 30, we announced that First Citizens and CIT agreed to amend our merger agreement to extend the original outside date. In the merger agreement from October 15, 2021 to March 1, 2022 as we wait for the remaining regulatory approval from the Federal Reserve Board, not much has changed since that time, and our understanding is that the application remained at the governor level. As we noted in the last announcement, we stay in regular touch with the Federal Reserve Board and we have responded to all their questions. We have not been provided a timeframe for their decision. We understand and share the frustration regarding the length of time that has been required to obtain the necessary approvals for this merger. But this process can require patience. As we noted last quarter, we have not been made aware of any regulatory problems with our application and we're confident in our ability to close this deal as soon as practicable following approval. Our goal has always been to build value for our shareholders. And we remained committed to this goal and our merger with CIT. When we announced this merger, we stated that it was financially compelling, and that it would create a premier nationwide commercial and consumer bank with enhanced scale to drive growth, improve profitability, and enhance shareholder value. We believe this remains the case. And our collective teams are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for the combined company. As we've said before, we continue to work on integration planning with our CIT counterparts and leaders from both organizations remained actively engaged in and committed to a successful combination of our companies. In addition to merger and integration planning, we continue to leverage our digital investments to drive revenue and accelerate our digital transformation. We're now in the final phase of transitioning business and treasury commercial clients to our new commercial platform, which has been well received by these clients -- these important clients. We've also been working to implement process improvements to support our back office, and recently completed an upgrade to our branch platform. This change to a state of the art digital system allows for more efficient transaction processing, and positions us to adapt quickly to changing customer needs. As you can see, by the growth in our wealth management income, we're focusing on deepening client relationships to grow this line of business. We continue to grow our wealth business by both expanding into new markets and by enhancing the products and services available to help our wealth clients meet their financial goals. Our people are top priority. We continue to focus on talent development and retention of our associates. Our objective here is to ensure we attract, retain and develop associates to create a high performing sustainable company that will meet the strategic financial and operational goals of the organization. As with many of our peers, our ability to attract and retain talent has been tested this year, as the number of people leaving the workforce. And the competition for top talent is putting pressure on teams to retain their talent. While the current environment for attracting talent is challenging, we believe that First Citizens is a desirable place to work. And we have a lot to offer recruits as well as existing associates. I'll now turn it over to Craig for a closer look at our financial results. And then we'll open the line for questions.\nCraig Nix: Thank you, Frank. And good morning, everyone. I'll start with page 4 of the investor presentation and I'll cover our third quarter earnings highlight. Earnings for the third quarter as Frank mentioned were $124.1 1 million, down $28.7 million from the linked quarter and down $18.6 million from the same quarter a year ago. While earnings were down compared to both periods, we are pleased with our core earnings performance. Earnings for the third quarter translated into a return on average assets of 0.88% and a return on average equity of 11.29%. Net income per common share was $12.17, down from $15.09 in the second quarter and $14.03 in the comparable quarter a year ago. For the linked quarter the most significant impacts leading to lower earnings or a decline in the benefit from provision for credit losses, lower positive fair market value adjustments on our equity portfolio, a declining gain on sales of securities and higher noninterest expense. Lower earnings from the comparable quarter a year ago were due to the same factors except for the provision benefit and the impact of fair market value adjustments. Compared to the second quarter, pre provision net revenue declined by $22 million driven by decreases in SBA-PPP income, securities gains, fair market value adjustments and higher noninterest expense. The first three factors contributed to a $23.2 million decline in pre provision net revenue from the second quarter. So they were mostly responsible for the decline in PP&R during the quarter. Net interest income was slightly up over the second quarter despite a $7.1 million decline and SBA-PPP income and continued interest rate headwinds. Another bright spot was a $4.8 million increase in core noninterest income. Higher noninterest expense during the quarter was driven by higher personnel costs, occupancy and equipment expense and merger costs. We continue to experience strong credit quality and low net charge-offs. In addition, macroeconomic factors continue to improve resulting in a further reservedly albeit a smaller one than in the second quarter, resulting in an $18.5 million decline in net benefit from the provision for credit losses. For the year as macroeconomic factors have improved, and we have sustained good credit quality, we have released $41.1 million in reserves compared to a reserve build of $36.1 million last year related to the uncertainty surrounding COVID-19.  Turning the Pages 5 and 6, I will cover trends and net interest income and net interest margin. Given another quarter of strong deposit growth, our cash balance with the Fed increased. Consistent with prior quarters, we continue to monitor rates closely and look for opportunities to redeploy excess liquidity into loans and investments to grow net interest income despite lower reinvestment yields. Despite a decline in SBA-PPP income and continued low interest rates, net interest income was up slightly over the linked quarter, higher investment yields and average balances, loan growth ex-PPP and slightly lower deposit costs more than offset rate pressure on loans and a decline in SBA-PPP income. While SBA-PPP loans continued to support overall net interest income, the contribution from these loans is declining as forgiveness activity continues. SBA-PPP loans contributed $20 million in interest and fee income during the third quarter, compared to $27.2 million in the second quarter. Net interest income declined by $6.8 million compared to the same quarter in 2020. This was primarily due to an $8.9 million decline in SBA-PPP income and lower earning asset yields partially offset by higher average loans and investments as well as lower rates paid on interest bearing deposits. While we were pleased with the increase in the absolute level of net interest income during the quarter, as expected net interest margin declined by seven basis points from the linked quarter. As discussed in prior quarters, we continue to operate with the liquidity above normal operating ranges, which puts downward pressure on net interest margin. We've been pleased by the level of loan growth in the second and third quarters, which has helped to somewhat protect net interest margin from the impacts of low interest rates. In addition, we have opportunistically deployed money out of cash into the investment portfolio since last year. Our investment portfolio grew by $985 million, or just over 10% since September 30, 2020. Consistent with the prior quarter, the decline in margin was mostly attributable to earning asset mix as our cash balance with the Fed continued to grow. One bright spot during the quarter was the investment portfolio yield was accretive to the margin by three basis points. We expect that net interest margin will continue to remain a headwind mostly due to continued excess liquidity for low rate environment and a reduction in SBA-PPP loan income. Quarter-over-quarter declines in net interest margin have moderated from declines we experienced in 2020 and earlier this year, and we will continue to seek opportunities to grow absolute levels of net interest income to offset declines in margins, or in margin through organic loan growth and opportunistic additions to our investment portfolio. Turning to Page 7, I will cover noninterest income which totaled $122.9 million for the third quarter, noninterest income decreased by $11.2 million compared to that linked quarter. The decline was mostly attributable to a decline in securities gains and fair market value adjustments totaling $16.1 million. Core noninterest income increased $4.8 million when compared to the linked quarter due primarily to higher net service charges on deposits. While linked quarterly income did not increase for wealth card and merchant taken collectively, we continue to see momentum in these businesses supporting our bottom line. Noninterest income increased $2.4 million when compared to the third quarter of 2020. Taken together securities gains and fair market value adjustments were down $7.3 million. So core noninterest income was up by $9.7 million. The most significant factor in the increase was in wealth income, as we continue to grow assets under management, driving higher advisory and brokerage fees, as well as additional trust income. We also saw increases in service charges and income from card and merchant services. These improvements were partially offset by a decline in mortgage income driven by lower production volume. For the remainder of 2021, we expect continued momentum in the wealth and payments related businesses. We expect mortgage income growth will be a challenge as refinance activity slows as mortgage rates have risen. But we do expect core noninterest income to be in the $109 million to $110 million range in the fourth quarter. Tuning to Page 8, I'll cover noninterest expense. Noninterest expense increased by $11.2 million over the linked quarter. The largest increase was in personnel expense, which was up $4.2 million over the second quarter. The increase was driven by increases in temporary personnel costs, revenue driven incentives as net staff additions partially offset by lower health insurance costs. Outside of merger related expenses, other increases in expense were spread among various categories, and were mostly due to our continued investment and supporting revenue generating businesses and improving internal processes. We expect core noninterest expense at merger related costs to remain in line with the recent run rate of approximately $300 million to $305 million per quarter. Turning to Page 9, we provide balance sheet highlights and key ratios. I will cover the significant components of the balance sheet on subsequent pages. On Page 10, I'll cover loan growth for the linked quarter and year-over-year periods. Loans decreased by $174 million or by 2.1% on an annualized basis this quarter, primarily due to a $611 million net decrease in SBA-PPP loans. Excluding PPP loans, we experienced solid annualized organic growth of 5.6% over the second quarter. The largest components were commercial and industrial under occupied commercial real estate and consumer loans. On a year-over-year basis, loans are relatively stable as PPP forgiveness almost completely offset a 5.7% increase in organic loans. Overall, we are pleased with organic loan growth this year. And we believe that it will be mid single digit percentage growth range moving forward. The ultimate level of loan growth will be dependent upon continued economic expansion in our market. Turning the Pages 11 and 12; I'll cover our credit quality trends and allowance for credit losses. Credit quality continues to be a source of strength, and net charge-off ratio was six basis points during the quarter. One charge-off was primarily responsible for the increase from three basis points in the prior quarter. The nonperforming assets to total loans and other real estate ratio were 0.65 at quarter end, the lowest level since the second quarter of 2019. Given these trends and improvement and macroeconomic factors we released $41.4 million in reserves today compared to a $36.1 million reserve build last year as I mentioned earlier. Our allowance ratio ex-PPP loans declined modestly from 0.61% in the second quarter to 0.58% in the third, covering net charge-offs during the current quarter, almost 10x compared to a loan book with an average life of approximately four years. We are now operating with an allowance ratio just below where it was when we adopted CECL on January 1, 2020 while looking at it another way near the pre-pandemic level. We remain comfortable with our allowance level and while we do not expect that net charge-offs will remain at these historically low levels perpetually, we have seen little indication that charge-offs going forward will have a significant impact on the level of our allowance. Moving to pages 13 and 14, I will cover deposit trends and our funding mix. We continue to experience strong deposit growth during the third quarter with money market accounts and demand deposits leading the way. Deposits grew at an annualized rate of 13.6% since the end of the second quarter, and by 18.5% on a year-over-year basis. Our balance sheet continues to be funded predominantly by core deposits, the deposits representing over 96% of our funding base at the end of the quarter. We are pleased that most of our deposit growth occurred in core checking accounts. And at the end of the third quarter noninterest bearing deposits accounted for approximately 43% on total deposits. Consistent with the second quarter the total deposit costs was seven basis points, which was down six basis points from the same quarter a year ago. Looking forward, we expect the deposits will remain elevated and low deposit costs will continue to be a source of strength with respect to our net interest margin. And turning to Page 15, our capital position remained strong with all ratios above or within our target ranges. As of the end of the third quarter, Our CET1 ratio was 11.34%. And our total risk based capital ratio was 14.3%. Most of the growth that our risk based capital ratios is attributable to strong earnings during the year partially offset by growth in total risk weighted assets. As we noted in prior quarters, our Tier 1 leverage ratio continues to be impacted by significant deposit growth. But it remains above internal threshold as earnings are mostly mitigating the impact of increased average assets. We are comfortable operating at the level. This concludes my comments. Thank you for joining us today and I will now open it up for Q&A.\nOperator:  Our first question comes from Brady Gailey with KBW.\nBradyGailey: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. So I wanted to start on the expense base compensation was up about $7 million linked quarter, I think it was a little more than we had expected. I know in the slides, you call out some kind of temporary increase in personnel costs. I wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about that and how we should think about that comp line going forward legacy FCNCA?\nCraigNix: Okay. Thank you for the question. I would say that the third quarter was a little lumpy, with some episodic expenses in there. And I hope the expectation would be for quarterly expenses to be between $300 and 305 million at merger related costs. But the third quarter was a little lumpy, we were up $11.2 million, approximately 40% of that increase was related to personnel costs. And if you break those components down, we had an increase in temporary personnel cost primarily related to our business online banking platform replacement that Frank mentioned in his comments. And they were -- that was followed very closely by revenue driven incentives and primarily that is in the wealth area -- that wealth income is up approximately 28% on a year-over-year basis. So they're really tied into revenue or temporary given a technology related project. Also, processing fees for third parties increased and they're pretty much volume related primarily in wealth as well. That really tracks with the increase in assets under management. And then also those expenses were up with our digital account opening efforts. Consulting and advertising costs were up a bit to support our digital banking efforts. Those are -- those in line with our budget expectations, some of those just hit in the third quarter. And then we also replaced some branch equipment tele stations.  And those were below our capitalization limit in the third quarter. So we wouldn't expect a lot of those expenses to repeat every quarter. Hopefully, the revenue driven expenses do repeat because that means we're doing well and well in our other income producing lines of business. But we do expect expenses to be in that $300 million to $305 million range. And in future quarters ex merge related costs. Also, we had an increase in merge related costs in the quarter as I already mentioned a net increase.\nBradyGailey: All right, that's helpful. And then my second question is on accretable yield. Year-to-date, you guys have kind of been in that, $11 million to $13 million per quarter legacy FCHEA yield accretion, how much is left in that bucket going forward, excluding anything that is going to be realized from CIT.\nCraigNix: I do not have the actual remaining deferred or accretable yield number in front of me. But we do expect that line item will continue to decrease in line with what you say in linked quarters. I don't know if anybody has that number here available. I don't know why we have that number available. But we would expect that line item to continue to decrease as that portfolio runs off. \nBradyGailey: Great. And Craig, actually one more just on that same -- more on that same topic. I mean I know when you announced CIT; you kind of call it out about $63 million of kind of net purchase accounting accretion. I know the marks have changed a lot over the last year, but it feels like that 63 numbers could come down pretty notably, any idea how much purchase account and accretion we should expect from CIT next year?\nCraigNix: We will be updating that when we close. We're in the process of doing evaluations now. We don't have that information at this time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fitzsimmons with D.A. Davidson.\nKevinFitzsimmons: Hey, good morning, everyone. I just had a question about the excess liquidity is obviously a drag for all banks, and it seems like there was an increased drag this quarter for you all. And some banks are kind of reaching the point where, they had been hesitating from being more aggressive and putting that money to work in the bond portfolio, but we've heard some banks this quarter really, kind of change their tune on that and indicate that they're going to be stepping up more aggressively. So can you, I know, there's a lot of different variables here between maybe what your outlook for legacy loan growth is, what your outlook for rates are that if we're closer to rising rates, and then obviously, the opportunities from the merger in terms of what you can do to the balance sheet. Can you kind of stack rank those or maybe there's other variables I'm not thinking of in terms of why you might not -- why you're opting maybe not to be more aggressive on that front. Thanks.\nCraigNix: Thank you, Kevin, I would tell you that we are trying to be opportunistic, and redeploying this excess liquidity. As I mentioned in our comments, we have increased our investment portfolio year-over-year by approximately a $1 billion, which is about a 10% increase, I can tell you that we are closely monitoring rates. And just to give you some idea of the challenge, at the beginning of the third quarter, in July, the five, seven and 10 year treasury fell by 17, 24 and 26 basis points respectively. And it took the entire quarter for those to reverse versus the end of the second quarter. So during the third quarter, while we added during the second quarter, we didn't think it was prudent to add during the third quarter given where rates were. Now we think we have -- we may have some opportunities going into the fourth quarter as those rates have rebounded. So we'll continue to try to invest opportunistically there but we don't think it was very prudent to invest into a lower rate environment when implied yield appear to be up as we move towards the end of the year.  We would prefer to operate with cash somewhere around the 4% of earning assets level. And as you can look at our balance sheet and see we're operating at around 19%. So and that's really due to the fact that deposits remain elevated. And we don't really see that changing in the short term. And I'm glad you pointed out this is not unique to First Citizens, I think it's an industry wide issue. So it is a priority for us to grow organically running growth, or invest to protect our net interest margin as much as possible. But I also think that having some excess liquidity and this is intentional to some degree will help us optimize our balance sheet when we do ultimately merge with CIT. So we may be a little more elevated due to that than we would have been otherwise had we not contemplated a merger of this transaction. Hope that makes sense. But I think the punch line is we're trying to be opportunistic, but we all want to make short term decisions that will closes the interest rate risk as we move forward.\nKevinFitzsimmons: No, thanks Craig. This was very helpful. One other question on the -- and I completely understand the sensitivity to it that you can't really comment with the merger application at the board level, but maybe you can help us in terms of how to look at this, there was a recent media report that disclosed a few complaint letters that were issued, which listen, I guesstimate that those kind of letters come with every deal. And not -- I don't know how much weight a regulator would put on an unsigned letter. But is there any way to help us -- help us gauge how to view those? Because on the one hand, I think everyone is scratching their head thinking I'm trying to come up with a reason why it's taking this long. On the other hand, I wonder if you know these letters, I would suspect you would know it's an issue if it was a real issue, and you've made it clear that you're not getting questions from them. And secondly, the FDIC has approved the merger already; I would suspect that they see these letters as well. So given just a few of those factors, is there any way to help us how we should view those kind of storylines when they come out?\nCraigNix: Well, Kevin, the first thing I'd say about the letter is that it was dated in February, mid February, and that was during the normal public commenting period. Since then and before then we've been in constant communication with our regulators, two of which have approved the transaction while this letter was out there. In terms of the Fed, I'm not going to speculate on how they do it. But we have addressed any issues they've had, in general, not necessarily specific to that letter. Since that time, and we're unaware of any problems out there issues with our application. So that's the best answer I can provide about that letter. And that's the approval process.\nKevinFitzsimmons: Yes, that's great. I really appreciate that. And one last one, for me, just some loan growth when you say mid single digit, I know pay-offs are an issue for the industry. But with your footprint and economies reopening and rebounding, could we be more on the way the march toward high single digit, but maybe it's just pay-offs that are keeping you conservative right now?\nCraigNix: I would say it probably would not be prudent for us to project high single digit loan growth. I think we just based on our pipeline, which we feel like are pretty strong right now. We expect mid single digit loan growth going forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brian Foran with Autonomous.\nBrianForan: Maybe on interest rates, as we think about, maybe the Fed raising rates in '22, '23 whatever year it ends up being, I mean, it seems like there should be pretty decent upside for both you and CIT side. But there's a lot of moving parts about due to some deposits screen out, you deploy excess cash, or the rate sensitivities, we get kind of match reality. I was hoping you could just give us, whether you want to do qualitatively or quantitatively, like when you think of rates going up 100 bps as a standard scenario, how do you -- clearly there is earning upside, but how do you think about how much or how big that earnings upside could be, either for First Citizens or ideally the pro forma. \nCraigNix: I, this is a rule of thumb, and I think this is good, this comment will be directional. But every 10 basis points parallel shift in the yield curve up or down for us is equal to about a 1% annualized increase in net interest income. So think $15 million of pretax income for every 10 basis points parallel shift in the curve. So obviously, 100 basis points would add around 10% growth to net interest income. So they are assets sensitive. So we definitely would benefit from rising rates.\nBrianForan: And maybe sticking with the same topic on prior calls, you've given some good front book versus back book pricing color. Can you just kind of give us the mark-to-market on what that looks like now? And is there still a little bit of a gap there? Are they starting to converge?\nCraigNix: If you look at the second quarter, new rates were about 47 basis points lower than run off. So new rates are around 328. Runoff was around 375. So 47 basis points gap there, that narrow the 43 basis points in the third quarter, new rates came on, while at lower rates, loans ran off at lower rates as well. So that gap stayed fairly stable 45 down to 47, down to 45. And that's all commercial loans. And that's where the bulk of the -- sort of bulk of the production is. So we're still facing that interest rate headwind on loan from the perspective of loan yield. Fortunately, during the quarter, though, investment yields increased enough to overcome that drag on margin.\nBrianForan: And then if I could sneak in the last one, and the deposit growth has obviously been kind of lights out, I mean, you've gone from $35 billion pre-pandemic to $50 billion now, I wonder if you can speak to kind of two issues, one on the negative side? Do you still think there's surge deposits and client excess liquidity that you kind of mentally have to haircut? Or do you think $50 billion is kind of a full base you can work off of going forward? And then on the positive side, kind of just remind us or update us on the kind of key strategies and opportunities to continue to grow?\nCraigNix: Well, I think our go-to-market strategy is relationship focused. So that's sort of inherent in what we do. And that's, I attribute a lot of that growth to that. But we do believe some of the growth and deposits are transitory in nature, for instance, since the end of last year, we try to trace what's coming in from government stimulus and what remains. Since the last year, we had about proximately $1.2 billion in government stimulus deposits in the base. And we think that's somewhere around $400 million now. So despite that decline, deposits grew from in first quarter 36.4% annual second quarter, 9.1% annualized, and this quarter, 13.6%, annualized. So we do think some of its transitory but we also think given that we've established relationships with customers that these -- some of these deposits are going to stick, we really can't quantify what that will be. But we're pleased with the deposit growing somewhat and all of it, it just keeps growing. These double digit annualized rates quarter, on linked quarterly basis, most of it's coming from our commercial customers. And I think looking at earnings releases for other banks we're not alone in that. But we do believe some of this will stick some of its transitory is exhibited by the fact we had $1.2 billion increase this year or earlier this year, and those deposits around $400 million now. So that's it, core growth is sort of overcoming that transitory deposits. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Christopher Mayernick.\nUnidentifiedAnalyst: Yes. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask Frank or you about the idea of impacting new hires within your markets, whether it's in your home state, North Carolina, or in other parts of the footprint. Do you see new commercial lenders and others staff coming on in this timeframe, even before the merger is closed?\nFrankHolding: Christopher, this is Frank Holding. We continue to hire new associates and we're doing all we can to do that. And we've been reasonably successful in that space, where the orientation process for new associates continues; we have a strong robust process there that helps people -- that helps our associates become productive in a reasonable timeframe. So while the competition for talent is very strong, we're holding our own in that space in our story. Whether it's pay and benefits and working environment, we think we have a strong story in that space. So there's no major element as being more challenging, we are getting the job done.\nUnidentifiedAnalyst: Great. Thank you for that. I appreciate it. And just a follow up, I guess, on the impact of the tech spending that you outlined earlier in the call. Does that drop overall per transaction costs in the future? And do you see a material kind of change in efficiency? And again, I am just taking for first as a standalone prior to the merger savings to date?\nCraigNix: That certainly is the goal. I mentioned, process improvement related technology investment. And the reason to make that investment is to get a payback in terms of transaction costs over time.\nOperator: I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd like to turn call back over to our host for any closing remarks.\nDeanna Hart: Great, thank you. And thank you everyone for joining this morning. As always, we're appreciative of your ongoing interest in our company. If you have any further questions or need additional information, please feel free to reach out. I hope everyone has a great day. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Thank you, Deanna. And good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. This morning, we reported third quarter net income of $124.1 million, or $12.17 per share, delivering another quarter of strong financial results to our shareholders. We continue to see positive trends in net interest income despite continued pressure on margins from our growing level of excess liquidity and the sustained low rate environment. Noninterest income from our core fee income producing lines of business also remained robust during the quarter and was up over the prior quarter. Additionally, credit quality remained solid, resulting in another net provision benefit, albeit smaller than in previous quarter's benefit. We achieved another consecutive quarter of loan and deposit growth, both of which continue to be bright spots for our company as we remain focused on building long-term relationships with our customers. Total loans adjusted for SBA-PPP runoff grew $437 million during the third quarter, or by 5.6% on an annualized basis. We saw strong growth in both our consumer and commercial lines of business. Deposits were up $1.7 billion during the third quarter, representing an annualized growth rate of 13.6%. I'm sure many of you are looking for an update on our planned merger with CIT Group. On September 30, we announced that First Citizens and CIT agreed to amend our merger agreement to extend the original outside date. In the merger agreement from October 15, 2021 to March 1, 2022 as we wait for the remaining regulatory approval from the Federal Reserve Board, not much has changed since that time, and our understanding is that the application remained at the governor level. As we noted in the last announcement, we stay in regular touch with the Federal Reserve Board and we have responded to all their questions. We have not been provided a timeframe for their decision. We understand and share the frustration regarding the length of time that has been required to obtain the necessary approvals for this merger. But this process can require patience. As we noted last quarter, we have not been made aware of any regulatory problems with our application and we're confident in our ability to close this deal as soon as practicable following approval. Our goal has always been to build value for our shareholders. And we remained committed to this goal and our merger with CIT. When we announced this merger, we stated that it was financially compelling, and that it would create a premier nationwide commercial and consumer bank with enhanced scale to drive growth, improve profitability, and enhance shareholder value. We believe this remains the case. And our collective teams are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for the combined company. As we've said before, we continue to work on integration planning with our CIT counterparts and leaders from both organizations remained actively engaged in and committed to a successful combination of our companies. In addition to merger and integration planning, we continue to leverage our digital investments to drive revenue and accelerate our digital transformation. We're now in the final phase of transitioning business and treasury commercial clients to our new commercial platform, which has been well received by these clients -- these important clients. We've also been working to implement process improvements to support our back office, and recently completed an upgrade to our branch platform. This change to a state of the art digital system allows for more efficient transaction processing, and positions us to adapt quickly to changing customer needs. As you can see, by the growth in our wealth management income, we're focusing on deepening client relationships to grow this line of business. We continue to grow our wealth business by both expanding into new markets and by enhancing the products and services available to help our wealth clients meet their financial goals. Our people are top priority. We continue to focus on talent development and retention of our associates. Our objective here is to ensure we attract, retain and develop associates to create a high performing sustainable company that will meet the strategic financial and operational goals of the organization. As with many of our peers, our ability to attract and retain talent has been tested this year, as the number of people leaving the workforce. And the competition for top talent is putting pressure on teams to retain their talent. While the current environment for attracting talent is challenging, we believe that First Citizens is a desirable place to work. And we have a lot to offer recruits as well as existing associates. I'll now turn it over to Craig for a closer look at our financial results. And then we'll open the line for questions. Christopher, this is Frank Holding. We continue to hire new associates and we're doing all we can to do that. And we've been reasonably successful in that space, where the orientation process for new associates continues; we have a strong robust process there that helps people -- that helps our associates become productive in a reasonable timeframe. So while the competition for talent is very strong, we're holding our own in that space in our story. Whether it's pay and benefits and working environment, we think we have a strong story in that space. So there's no major element as being more challenging, we are getting the job done."

            "name": "Craig Nix",
            "content": "Thank you, Frank. And good morning, everyone. I'll start with page 4 of the investor presentation and I'll cover our third quarter earnings highlight. Earnings for the third quarter as Frank mentioned were $124.1 1 million, down $28.7 million from the linked quarter and down $18.6 million from the same quarter a year ago. While earnings were down compared to both periods, we are pleased with our core earnings performance. Earnings for the third quarter translated into a return on average assets of 0.88% and a return on average equity of 11.29%. Net income per common share was $12.17, down from $15.09 in the second quarter and $14.03 in the comparable quarter a year ago. For the linked quarter the most significant impacts leading to lower earnings or a decline in the benefit from provision for credit losses, lower positive fair market value adjustments on our equity portfolio, a declining gain on sales of securities and higher noninterest expense. Lower earnings from the comparable quarter a year ago were due to the same factors except for the provision benefit and the impact of fair market value adjustments. Compared to the second quarter, pre provision net revenue declined by $22 million driven by decreases in SBA-PPP income, securities gains, fair market value adjustments and higher noninterest expense. The first three factors contributed to a $23.2 million decline in pre provision net revenue from the second quarter. So they were mostly responsible for the decline in PP&R during the quarter. Net interest income was slightly up over the second quarter despite a $7.1 million decline and SBA-PPP income and continued interest rate headwinds. Another bright spot was a $4.8 million increase in core noninterest income. Higher noninterest expense during the quarter was driven by higher personnel costs, occupancy and equipment expense and merger costs. We continue to experience strong credit quality and low net charge-offs. In addition, macroeconomic factors continue to improve resulting in a further reservedly albeit a smaller one than in the second quarter, resulting in an $18.5 million decline in net benefit from the provision for credit losses. For the year as macroeconomic factors have improved, and we have sustained good credit quality, we have released $41.1 million in reserves compared to a reserve build of $36.1 million last year related to the uncertainty surrounding COVID-19.  Turning the Pages 5 and 6, I will cover trends and net interest income and net interest margin. Given another quarter of strong deposit growth, our cash balance with the Fed increased. Consistent with prior quarters, we continue to monitor rates closely and look for opportunities to redeploy excess liquidity into loans and investments to grow net interest income despite lower reinvestment yields. Despite a decline in SBA-PPP income and continued low interest rates, net interest income was up slightly over the linked quarter, higher investment yields and average balances, loan growth ex-PPP and slightly lower deposit costs more than offset rate pressure on loans and a decline in SBA-PPP income. While SBA-PPP loans continued to support overall net interest income, the contribution from these loans is declining as forgiveness activity continues. SBA-PPP loans contributed $20 million in interest and fee income during the third quarter, compared to $27.2 million in the second quarter. Net interest income declined by $6.8 million compared to the same quarter in 2020. This was primarily due to an $8.9 million decline in SBA-PPP income and lower earning asset yields partially offset by higher average loans and investments as well as lower rates paid on interest bearing deposits. While we were pleased with the increase in the absolute level of net interest income during the quarter, as expected net interest margin declined by seven basis points from the linked quarter. As discussed in prior quarters, we continue to operate with the liquidity above normal operating ranges, which puts downward pressure on net interest margin. We've been pleased by the level of loan growth in the second and third quarters, which has helped to somewhat protect net interest margin from the impacts of low interest rates. In addition, we have opportunistically deployed money out of cash into the investment portfolio since last year. Our investment portfolio grew by $985 million, or just over 10% since September 30, 2020. Consistent with the prior quarter, the decline in margin was mostly attributable to earning asset mix as our cash balance with the Fed continued to grow. One bright spot during the quarter was the investment portfolio yield was accretive to the margin by three basis points. We expect that net interest margin will continue to remain a headwind mostly due to continued excess liquidity for low rate environment and a reduction in SBA-PPP loan income. Quarter-over-quarter declines in net interest margin have moderated from declines we experienced in 2020 and earlier this year, and we will continue to seek opportunities to grow absolute levels of net interest income to offset declines in margins, or in margin through organic loan growth and opportunistic additions to our investment portfolio. Turning to Page 7, I will cover noninterest income which totaled $122.9 million for the third quarter, noninterest income decreased by $11.2 million compared to that linked quarter. The decline was mostly attributable to a decline in securities gains and fair market value adjustments totaling $16.1 million. Core noninterest income increased $4.8 million when compared to the linked quarter due primarily to higher net service charges on deposits. While linked quarterly income did not increase for wealth card and merchant taken collectively, we continue to see momentum in these businesses supporting our bottom line. Noninterest income increased $2.4 million when compared to the third quarter of 2020. Taken together securities gains and fair market value adjustments were down $7.3 million. So core noninterest income was up by $9.7 million. The most significant factor in the increase was in wealth income, as we continue to grow assets under management, driving higher advisory and brokerage fees, as well as additional trust income. We also saw increases in service charges and income from card and merchant services. These improvements were partially offset by a decline in mortgage income driven by lower production volume. For the remainder of 2021, we expect continued momentum in the wealth and payments related businesses. We expect mortgage income growth will be a challenge as refinance activity slows as mortgage rates have risen. But we do expect core noninterest income to be in the $109 million to $110 million range in the fourth quarter. Tuning to Page 8, I'll cover noninterest expense. Noninterest expense increased by $11.2 million over the linked quarter. The largest increase was in personnel expense, which was up $4.2 million over the second quarter. The increase was driven by increases in temporary personnel costs, revenue driven incentives as net staff additions partially offset by lower health insurance costs. Outside of merger related expenses, other increases in expense were spread among various categories, and were mostly due to our continued investment and supporting revenue generating businesses and improving internal processes. We expect core noninterest expense at merger related costs to remain in line with the recent run rate of approximately $300 million to $305 million per quarter. Turning to Page 9, we provide balance sheet highlights and key ratios. I will cover the significant components of the balance sheet on subsequent pages. On Page 10, I'll cover loan growth for the linked quarter and year-over-year periods. Loans decreased by $174 million or by 2.1% on an annualized basis this quarter, primarily due to a $611 million net decrease in SBA-PPP loans. Excluding PPP loans, we experienced solid annualized organic growth of 5.6% over the second quarter. The largest components were commercial and industrial under occupied commercial real estate and consumer loans. On a year-over-year basis, loans are relatively stable as PPP forgiveness almost completely offset a 5.7% increase in organic loans. Overall, we are pleased with organic loan growth this year. And we believe that it will be mid single digit percentage growth range moving forward. The ultimate level of loan growth will be dependent upon continued economic expansion in our market. Turning the Pages 11 and 12; I'll cover our credit quality trends and allowance for credit losses. Credit quality continues to be a source of strength, and net charge-off ratio was six basis points during the quarter. One charge-off was primarily responsible for the increase from three basis points in the prior quarter. The nonperforming assets to total loans and other real estate ratio were 0.65 at quarter end, the lowest level since the second quarter of 2019. Given these trends and improvement and macroeconomic factors we released $41.4 million in reserves today compared to a $36.1 million reserve build last year as I mentioned earlier. Our allowance ratio ex-PPP loans declined modestly from 0.61% in the second quarter to 0.58% in the third, covering net charge-offs during the current quarter, almost 10x compared to a loan book with an average life of approximately four years. We are now operating with an allowance ratio just below where it was when we adopted CECL on January 1, 2020 while looking at it another way near the pre-pandemic level. We remain comfortable with our allowance level and while we do not expect that net charge-offs will remain at these historically low levels perpetually, we have seen little indication that charge-offs going forward will have a significant impact on the level of our allowance. Moving to pages 13 and 14, I will cover deposit trends and our funding mix. We continue to experience strong deposit growth during the third quarter with money market accounts and demand deposits leading the way. Deposits grew at an annualized rate of 13.6% since the end of the second quarter, and by 18.5% on a year-over-year basis. Our balance sheet continues to be funded predominantly by core deposits, the deposits representing over 96% of our funding base at the end of the quarter. We are pleased that most of our deposit growth occurred in core checking accounts. And at the end of the third quarter noninterest bearing deposits accounted for approximately 43% on total deposits. Consistent with the second quarter the total deposit costs was seven basis points, which was down six basis points from the same quarter a year ago. Looking forward, we expect the deposits will remain elevated and low deposit costs will continue to be a source of strength with respect to our net interest margin. And turning to Page 15, our capital position remained strong with all ratios above or within our target ranges. As of the end of the third quarter, Our CET1 ratio was 11.34%. And our total risk based capital ratio was 14.3%. Most of the growth that our risk based capital ratios is attributable to strong earnings during the year partially offset by growth in total risk weighted assets. As we noted in prior quarters, our Tier 1 leverage ratio continues to be impacted by significant deposit growth. But it remains above internal threshold as earnings are mostly mitigating the impact of increased average assets. We are comfortable operating at the level. This concludes my comments. Thank you for joining us today and I will now open it up for Q&A. Okay. Thank you for the question. I would say that the third quarter was a little lumpy, with some episodic expenses in there. And I hope the expectation would be for quarterly expenses to be between $300 and 305 million at merger related costs. But the third quarter was a little lumpy, we were up $11.2 million, approximately 40% of that increase was related to personnel costs. And if you break those components down, we had an increase in temporary personnel cost primarily related to our business online banking platform replacement that Frank mentioned in his comments. And they were -- that was followed very closely by revenue driven incentives and primarily that is in the wealth area -- that wealth income is up approximately 28% on a year-over-year basis. So they're really tied into revenue or temporary given a technology related project. Also, processing fees for third parties increased and they're pretty much volume related primarily in wealth as well. That really tracks with the increase in assets under management. And then also those expenses were up with our digital account opening efforts. Consulting and advertising costs were up a bit to support our digital banking efforts. Those are -- those in line with our budget expectations, some of those just hit in the third quarter. And then we also replaced some branch equipment tele stations.  And those were below our capitalization limit in the third quarter. So we wouldn't expect a lot of those expenses to repeat every quarter. Hopefully, the revenue driven expenses do repeat because that means we're doing well and well in our other income producing lines of business. But we do expect expenses to be in that $300 million to $305 million range. And in future quarters ex merge related costs. Also, we had an increase in merge related costs in the quarter as I already mentioned a net increase. I do not have the actual remaining deferred or accretable yield number in front of me. But we do expect that line item will continue to decrease in line with what you say in linked quarters. I don't know if anybody has that number here available. I don't know why we have that number available. But we would expect that line item to continue to decrease as that portfolio runs off. We will be updating that when we close. We're in the process of doing evaluations now. We don't have that information at this time. Thank you, Kevin, I would tell you that we are trying to be opportunistic, and redeploying this excess liquidity. As I mentioned in our comments, we have increased our investment portfolio year-over-year by approximately a $1 billion, which is about a 10% increase, I can tell you that we are closely monitoring rates. And just to give you some idea of the challenge, at the beginning of the third quarter, in July, the five, seven and 10 year treasury fell by 17, 24 and 26 basis points respectively. And it took the entire quarter for those to reverse versus the end of the second quarter. So during the third quarter, while we added during the second quarter, we didn't think it was prudent to add during the third quarter given where rates were. Now we think we have -- we may have some opportunities going into the fourth quarter as those rates have rebounded. So we'll continue to try to invest opportunistically there but we don't think it was very prudent to invest into a lower rate environment when implied yield appear to be up as we move towards the end of the year.  We would prefer to operate with cash somewhere around the 4% of earning assets level. And as you can look at our balance sheet and see we're operating at around 19%. So and that's really due to the fact that deposits remain elevated. And we don't really see that changing in the short term. And I'm glad you pointed out this is not unique to First Citizens, I think it's an industry wide issue. So it is a priority for us to grow organically running growth, or invest to protect our net interest margin as much as possible. But I also think that having some excess liquidity and this is intentional to some degree will help us optimize our balance sheet when we do ultimately merge with CIT. So we may be a little more elevated due to that than we would have been otherwise had we not contemplated a merger of this transaction. Hope that makes sense. But I think the punch line is we're trying to be opportunistic, but we all want to make short term decisions that will closes the interest rate risk as we move forward. Well, Kevin, the first thing I'd say about the letter is that it was dated in February, mid February, and that was during the normal public commenting period. Since then and before then we've been in constant communication with our regulators, two of which have approved the transaction while this letter was out there. In terms of the Fed, I'm not going to speculate on how they do it. But we have addressed any issues they've had, in general, not necessarily specific to that letter. Since that time, and we're unaware of any problems out there issues with our application. So that's the best answer I can provide about that letter. And that's the approval process. I would say it probably would not be prudent for us to project high single digit loan growth. I think we just based on our pipeline, which we feel like are pretty strong right now. We expect mid single digit loan growth going forward. I, this is a rule of thumb, and I think this is good, this comment will be directional. But every 10 basis points parallel shift in the yield curve up or down for us is equal to about a 1% annualized increase in net interest income. So think $15 million of pretax income for every 10 basis points parallel shift in the curve. So obviously, 100 basis points would add around 10% growth to net interest income. So they are assets sensitive. So we definitely would benefit from rising rates. If you look at the second quarter, new rates were about 47 basis points lower than run off. So new rates are around 328. Runoff was around 375. So 47 basis points gap there, that narrow the 43 basis points in the third quarter, new rates came on, while at lower rates, loans ran off at lower rates as well. So that gap stayed fairly stable 45 down to 47, down to 45. And that's all commercial loans. And that's where the bulk of the -- sort of bulk of the production is. So we're still facing that interest rate headwind on loan from the perspective of loan yield. Fortunately, during the quarter, though, investment yields increased enough to overcome that drag on margin. Well, I think our go-to-market strategy is relationship focused. So that's sort of inherent in what we do. And that's, I attribute a lot of that growth to that. But we do believe some of the growth and deposits are transitory in nature, for instance, since the end of last year, we try to trace what's coming in from government stimulus and what remains. Since the last year, we had about proximately $1.2 billion in government stimulus deposits in the base. And we think that's somewhere around $400 million now. So despite that decline, deposits grew from in first quarter 36.4% annual second quarter, 9.1% annualized, and this quarter, 13.6%, annualized. So we do think some of its transitory but we also think given that we've established relationships with customers that these -- some of these deposits are going to stick, we really can't quantify what that will be. But we're pleased with the deposit growing somewhat and all of it, it just keeps growing. These double digit annualized rates quarter, on linked quarterly basis, most of it's coming from our commercial customers. And I think looking at earnings releases for other banks we're not alone in that. But we do believe some of this will stick some of its transitory is exhibited by the fact we had $1.2 billion increase this year or earlier this year, and those deposits around $400 million now. So that's it, core growth is sort of overcoming that transitory deposits. That certainly is the goal. I mentioned, process improvement related technology investment. And the reason to make that investment is to get a payback in terms of transaction costs over time."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce the host of today's conference, Ms. Deanna Hart, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nDeanna Hart: Thank you, Myra. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. It is my pleasure to introduce our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Frank Holding; as well as our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Nix. Frank and Craig will provide an overview of our second quarter 2021 results and will be referencing our investor presentation, which you can find on our Investor Relations website. We are pleased to have several other members of our leadership team here with us today, who will be available for questions if needed. After the presentation, we'll be happy to take questions you may have. As we have not closed the transaction with CIT Group, we will be speaking today on First Citizens BancShares standalone performance only. We will also provide an update on our planned merger with CIT. Our comments will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. These risks are outlined for your review on Page 2 of the presentation. We will also reference non-GAAP financial measures within the presentation. Reconciliations of these measures against comparable GAAP measures are available in the appendix. With that, I'll hand it over to Frank.\nFrank Holding: Thank you, Deanna, and good morning to everyone. We appreciate all of you joining us today and your interest in our company. As you could imagine, we've spent the first half of 2021 focused on our upcoming merger with CIT. I'm pleased with the progress of both teams to prepare us for legal close and integration of our companies. We remain excited about our merger with CIT and look forward to capitalizing on the expertise of our companies to deliver value to our shareholders and stakeholders. Subject to Fed approval and customary closing conditions, we expect to close the merger during the third quarter. In addition to merger and integration planning, our team has executed on a number of financial and strategic objectives that we laid out in our 2021 strategic plan. One key area of focus is expanding our customer relationship model to improve our customers' experience. We've made good progress leveraging data to provide our bankers a comprehensive view of our customers allowing us to better serve their financial needs. In the digital space, we recently expanded the functionality of our consumer banking platform and are in the process of upgrading our commercial online platform. While serving customers has been a big focus, we're also focused on talent development and retention of our associates. The objective here is to ensure that we attract, retain and develop associates to create a high performing, sustainable company that will meet the strategic, financial and operational goals of the combined organization. We have continued to focus on organic loan and deposit growth both of which have been positive contributors to our success in 2021. Excluding the impact of SBA-PPP, we grew loans by four percent on an annualized basis since December and achieved an annualized growth rate during the second quarter of seven percent. Additionally, deposit growth has remained strong at an annualized rate of 23% since the year-end. Our focus on operational efficiency has continued as we expand and enhance our revenue-generating lines of business while continuing to maintain prudent expense control. We are pleased with our progress to date and optimistic that we can meet our strategic and financial goals for 2021, while remaining focused on the merger with CIT. With that, I'll turn it over to Craig for a closer look at our financial results, and then we'll open the line for questions.\nCraig Nix: Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Page 3 of the investor presentation, I will cover our second quarter earnings highlights. We achieved another quarter of strong earnings. Net income totaled $152.8 million, an increase of $5.5 million over the linked quarter and a slight decline from the second quarter of 2020. We are pleased to announce that earnings translated into a return on average assets of 1.13% and a return on average equity of 14.64%. Net income per common share was $15.09, up from $14.53 in the first quarter and $14.74 in the comparable quarter a year ago. Pre-provision net revenue narrowly declined compared to the first quarter. The most significant factor causing the decline was related to higher personnel costs associated with merit increases, which took effect at the beginning of the quarter. Mortgage servicing rights impairments negatively affected noninterest income. Otherwise, our revenue-producing lines of businesses posted another good quarter. Net interest income was a bright spot during the quarter, increasing by $6.7 million over the linked quarter, which was mostly attributable to opportunistically putting some of our excess liquidity to work in the investment portfolio, increasing the portfolio balance and improving the yield. We continued to experience strong credit quality and low net charge-offs during the second quarter. In addition, macroeconomic factors continued to improve, resulting in a further reserve release. As a result, the benefit from provision for credit losses increased from $11 million during the first quarter to $19.6 million during the second quarter. To date, as macroeconomic factors have improved and we have sustained good credit quality, we have released $35.3 million in reserves compared to a reserve build of $36.1 million during the first half of last year related to the uncertainty surrounding COVID-19. Compared to the second quarter of 2020, provision -- pre-provision net revenue declined by $32.2 million or by 15.2%. Solid core net revenue growth was more than offset by a $52.9 million decline in the fair market value adjustment on marketable equity securities. As a reminder, during the first quarter of last year, given what we saw at severe dislocation in the bank equity market where many banks were trading below 1 times tangible book value, we opportunistically bulked up our bank equity portfolio. During the second quarter of last year, these bank equity prices rebounded, and we sold the bulk of the securities for realized gains and experienced improvement in the fair market value of the portfolio that remained. This resulted in a positive fair market value adjustment during the second quarter of last year totaling $64.6 million. During the current quarter, the fair market value improved by $11.7 million resulting in the $52 point million  decline. The fair market value adjustment decline was partially offset by lower provision for credit losses, higher core noninterest income and higher net interest income, resulting in a minimal decline in net income for the comparable quarters. On Pages 4 and 5, I will cover trends in net interest income and net interest margin. After experiencing a decline in net interest income during the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter, net interest income increased during the current quarter as we opportunistically put some of our excess liquidity to work in the investment portfolio increasing the average balance by $777 million and the yield by eight basis points. Net interest income grew by $9.1 million over the comparable quarter in 2020 due to lower rates paid on interest-bearing deposits as well as increased interest and fee income on SBA-PPP loans, both only partially offset by a decline in yield on earning assets. While we were pleased with the increase in the absolute level of net interest income during the quarter, as expected, net interest margin declined by 12 basis points from the linked quarter. As we discussed last quarter, given the significant increase in deposits, which continued during the second quarter and the pending merger with CIT, we continue to operate with liquidity above normal operating ranges, which puts downward pressure on our net interest margin. Excess liquidity negatively impacted the change in margin from the first quarter by 13 basis points. Therefore, compared to prior quarters, the rate environment had a minimal positive impact on margins, primarily lower deposit costs and higher investment yield, while asset mix was the primary factor contributing to the decline in margin. As we mentioned last quarter, loans continue to come on the books at rates lower than maturing loans. This has put downward pressure on margin in recent quarters, but did moderate during the second quarter as rates on new business and commercial loans increased by approximately 25 basis points. In fact, the yield on loans ex-PPP did not change compared to the first quarter. We expect that net interest margin will continue to be a headwind throughout the remainder of 2021, but that the decline will continue to moderate in the coming quarters as it did in the second quarter. Turning to Page 6, I will cover noninterest income, which totaled $134.2 million during the second quarter. Noninterest income declined about $2.5 million compared to the linked quarter. The most significant factor in the decline was a decrease in mortgage income, which was primarily the result of mortgage servicing rights impairment in the second quarter versus mortgage servicing rights impairment recapture in the first quarter. This occurred as mortgage rates after increasing in the first quarter decreased in the second quarter. We did opportunistically sell securities during the quarter for a gain of $15.8 million, an increase of $6.6 million over the linked quarter. Outside of mortgage income, we had a good quarter from a core noninterest income standpoint. Cardholder services income increased due to higher sales volumes. Wealth and merchant services had good quarters with income remaining fairly consistent with the first quarter. Noninterest income declined $31.3 million when compared to the second quarter of 2020 due primarily to the $52.9 million decline in fair market value adjustments on marketable equity securities that I discussed earlier. Core noninterest income grew over the comparable quarter in 2020 by $20 million as wealth management income, cardholder and merchant services income and deposit-related fees all increased offsetting a decline in mortgage income. For the remainder of 2021, we expect continued strength in the areas that have performed well so far this year, including wealth, card and merchant. We expect mortgage volume to decline as refinance activity slows, but the decline will be somewhat offset by service charges returning closer to pre-pandemic levels. The punchline here is that we expect core noninterest income in the third and fourth quarters to be in the $109 million to $110 million range, so fairly consistent with the second quarter isolating for mortgage servicing rights impairment. Turning to Page 7, I will cover noninterest expense. Noninterest expense increased by $5.7 million over the linked quarter, primarily as a result of merit increases effective at the beginning of the second quarter. Other expenses were generally in line with their normal quarterly trend. Noninterest expense increased by $9.9 million over the comparable quarter in 2020, also primarily driven by higher personnel expense. We remain pleased with the level of expenses and the year-over-year decline in our efficiency ratio. We expect core noninterest expense ex-merger-related costs to remain in line with the recent run rate. Turning to Page 8, we provide balance sheet highlights and key ratios. I will cover the significant components of the balance sheet on the subsequent slides. On Page 9, I'll cover loan growth for the linked quarter and year-over-year periods. During the linked quarter, we saw a solid pickup in loan growth with the largest category in owner-occupied commercial real estate loans, which was more than offset by forgiveness of a large portion of our PPP loans. Ex-PPP loans grew organically at an annualized rate of seven percent during the second quarter. The story was similar on a year-to-date basis, the total loans relatively stable as PPP forgiveness almost completely offset a 5.1% increase in organic loans. Overall, we were pleased with organic loan growth during the first half of the year and expect organic loan balances to continue to grow during the second half of the year in the mid-single-digit percentage range. The ultimate level of loan growth will ultimately be dependent on continued economic expansion in our markets. Turning to Pages 10 and 11, I will cover our credit quality trends and allowance for credit losses. Credit continues to perform well as we experienced further improvement in the economy. As indicated by a historically low net charge-off ratio of three basis points during the second quarter and a nonperforming asset ratio of 0.74%, the lowest ratio over the past five linked quarters and the lowest level since the second quarter of 2019. Given these trends and improvement in the macroeconomic factors, we have recognized a credit provision benefit of $30.6 million through the first two quarters of this year compared to a reserve build of $36.1 million during the same period last year related to uncertainties surrounding the pandemic. Our allowance ratio ex-PPP loans declined from 0.69% in the first quarter to 0.61% in the second, covering net charge-offs during the quarter by 20.33 times and covering average net charge-off over the last five quarters 11.3 times. These coverage ratios compare to a loan book with an average life of approximately four years. We are now operating with an allowance ratio approximating where it was when we adopted CECL on January 1, 2020, or looking at it another way near the pre-pandemic level. While we saw no significant portfolio deterioration during the worst of the pandemic, we will continue to monitor industry risks associated with the impact that additional outbreaks may have on our loan portfolio performance. We remain comfortable with our allowance level and while we do not expect that net charge-offs will remain at these historically low levels, we have seen little indication that charge-offs going forward will have a significant impact on the level of our allowance. Moving on to Pages 12 and 13, I will cover deposit trends and our funding mix. We continue to experience strong deposit growth during the second quarter with demand deposits and checking with interest accounts leading the way. Deposits grew at an annualized rate of 9.2% since the end of the first quarter and by 16.7% on a year-over-year basis. Our balance sheet continues to be funded predominantly by core deposits with deposits representing over 96% of our funding base at the end of the quarter. We are pleased that most of our deposit growth has occurred in core checking accounts. And at the end of the second quarter, noninterest-bearing deposits accounted for approximately 43% of our total deposits. Total deposit costs ended the quarter at seven basis points, which was down one basis point from the first quarter and down 11 basis points from the same quarter a year ago. Looking forward, while our go-to-market strategy will continue to stress core deposit growth, we do expect growth to begin to moderate as the effect of government stimulus subsides and customers put their cash to use. Turning to Page 14, our capital position remains strong and ratios are above or within target ranges. As of the end of the second quarter, our CET1 ratio was 11.14%, and our total risk-based capital ratio was 14.15%. The majority of the growth in our risk-based capital ratios was attributable to strong earnings during the first half of the year, partially offset by growth in total risk-weighted assets. As we noted in prior quarters, our Tier one leverage ratio continues to be impacted by significant asset growth, both from government stimulus and organic deposit growth but it remains above internal thresholds, and we are comfortable with the current level. Turning to Page 15, I will close out by providing an update on our merger with CIT. As Frank mentioned in the opening, we continue to be excited about this merger. Our collective teams remain connected and have positioned us well for legal close and the ultimate integration of the company. Since our last call, we received approval of our application from the FDIC and are currently awaiting approval from the Federal Reserve. We continue to be in communication with the Fed and are positive that an approval of our application is forthcoming. There are no outstanding information requests with respect to our application. It is also our understanding that there are no concerns that may impact ultimate approval. Completion of the merger remains subject to Fed approval and customary closing conditions. We expect closing to occur during this quarter. Both companies have worked hard to develop initial business unit integration plans, which include key system decisions and recommendations. Once we move past legal close, we will review and finalize these integration plans and time lines. Key system conversions are slated to begin in the first quarter of 2022. When we announced this merger, we stated that it was financially compelling and that it would create a premier nationwide commercial and consumer bank with enhanced scale to drive growth, improve profitability and enhance shareholder value. We believe this remains the case, and our collective teams are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for the combined company. Last October, we shared with you estimated day one accounting marks and financial projections based on our merger due diligence. Our plan is to provide you an update as soon as practical following legal close. I can tell you that both companies are well positioned financially for this merger, and the conditions have improved since October, particularly with respect to credit quality. Specifically, we are pleased with the trends in credit quality that CIT has reported this year and the impact they have had on the allowance for credit losses. Again, more to come as soon as practical after legal close with respect to day one accounting marks and financial projections. This concludes my comments. Thank you all for joining us today. I will now open it up for Q and A.\nOperator:  Our first question comes from Kevin Fitzsimmons. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nKevin Fitzsimmons: Hey guys. It's Kevin Fitzsimmons, D.A. Davidson. I appreciate all the detailed updates. One area I wanted to drill in a little deeper into was loan growth. So ex-PPP looked like a pretty healthy seven percent growth linked quarter, as you said, Craig, and given the outlook for mid-single digit. Just curious if you can drill down a little further in terms of what is really driving the growth and what the headwinds are? We've heard quite a bit about elevated pay downs and payoffs and line utilization not quite being there on the C&I side. And you all are in a lot of different markets. So I'm curious what you're seeing in terms of the Southeast or some of your other metro markets you're in throughout the country? Thanks.\nCraig Nix: Thanks for the question, Kevin. I would say just from a quantitative standpoint, the growth has come in commercial real estate loans and primarily owner occupied. We've also seen some growth in residential mortgage loans. We put some products out there for -- such as home improvement loans, and this has fueled some of that growth. I think that we're very pleased with the seven percent annualized growth during the quarter, and we really attribute that to those new products, number one. But number two, we were very proactive during the pandemic in reaching out to our customers. And we think this has paid dividends with new opportunities for loans as the economy has improved. And the headwinds that we would anticipate in the future may be related to if there are further outbreaks or things of that nature. But we see opportunities to grow our loans at similar rates as we go forward, assuming the economy continues to open up and expand.\nKevin Fitzsimmons: Okay, great. Also, given what you mentioned about the margin that I think all banks are facing this issue, this drag from excess liquidity, and you guys mentioned that you put some of that to work in securities. So I'm just curious how high you would continue taking the securities portfolio just on a stand-alone basis in trying to fight off some of that yield pressure from the excess liquidity? Thanks.\nCraig Nix: Well, I don't really have a bright line in terms of the size of the investment portfolio. I can tell you that at the end of the first quarter, we huddled up, and we decided -- we put a goal out there to put close to $1 billion to work there to optimize our yield on earning assets moving out of cash and into investments. We remain diligent to add to that portfolio moving forward. As you know, we're running around 15% of our earning assets and cash right now. We're normally at four percent. So there's certainly a cost to that. And part of the way to mitigate that outside of loan growth is to opportunistically add to the investment portfolio where it makes sense. So that strategy -- we foresee that strategy continuing throughout the remainder of the year.\nKevin Fitzsimmons: Okay. And just one last one. I appreciate those comments on the CIT merger. So if I'm reading it correctly, just between the lines, it sounds like where the message is there's no big issue or obstacle that's stopping it. It's just you're in communication. It's just a matter of letting the process play out and getting legal close, correct?\nCraig Nix: That's correct, Kevin.\nKevin Fitzsimmons: Okay. Thanks guys.\nCraig Nix: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brady Gailey. Your line is now open, please go ahead.\nBrady Gailey: Hey. Thank you, good morning guys. So maybe one more on loan growth, great loan growth this quarter, I hear you on the guidance of mid-single digits. What do you think loan growth will look like as a combined company with CIT? A lot of times, when you go through a big acquisition, loan balances can be somewhat flat or maybe even shrink a little bit before they kind of normalize out and then start to grow from there. So how do you think about the dynamics of organic core loan growth with CIT in the mix?\nCraig Nix: We would maintain the mid-single-digit growth expectation there. But obviously, I'm stating the obvious here, but it really does depend on to the extent the economy keeps opening up, but our expectations would be mid-single-digit percentage growth combined.\nBrady Gailey: Okay, all right, great. And then when you think about, you guys have historically been pretty active buying back your stock. I know it's been a little problematic just with the CIT deal pending. But assuming that will close soon, what are your thoughts on the buyback? I mean if you look at the stock, it's trading at about 1.5 times pro forma tangible book value per share, which is pretty attractive relative to your profitability profile. So how do you think about the buyback from here?\nCraig Nix: We acknowledge that the price is attractive. I will tell you, our first priority will be integrating CIT. But as we combine the companies and build capital, we definitely plan to opportunistically resume our share repurchase program.\nBrady Gailey: Okay. And then, Craig, you mentioned how you're going to be updating and disclosing kind of where the deal marks shook out after legal close. I know a lot has changed today versus mid-October. The world seems to be doing better than what we had all -- were thinking back then. So to me, it seems like the deal-related marks are going to come down. So I know you can't talk about specifics, but maybe just talk about what impact that could have on forward tangible book value and earnings? Like obviously, if the marks go down, you think that would be a positive tangible book value per share. But then is there any real EPS impact maybe from lower accretable yield? I mean, just talk about the dynamics that could be in consideration there?\nCraig Nix: Well, I will talk qualitatively about that, number one, certainly, are encouraged by the credit quality trends, which will bode well for where the credit mark may be compared to where it was in October. That's as of today, things could change between now and closing. So that movement is generally positive. From an EPS perspective, I know that we came out with EPS guidance in October of last year. I really don't see much movement there, based on just what we know as of today either. So I think the financial dynamics behind this, obviously, with a lower credit mark, we would come into it with higher capital. But I think that the financial dynamics are even more compelling than they were in October. So we expect good news there, but we shall see upon legal close where those things shake out.\nBrady Gailey: Got it. And then finally from me, CIT has a lot of really expensive holding company debt. And I know that's a big opportunity for additional EPS accretion kind of beyond what you guys laid out in October. You have two options; you can either just let that debt mature over time, or you can kind of bite the bullet and go ahead and take care of that debt upfront. Any idea which way you're leaning as far as what you're going to do with all that rather expensive holding company debt with CIT?\nCraig Nix: Well, as you know, we're going to mark that debt-to-market. So we'll get the benefit of current market rates. I can tell you with great certainty that our eye is on that constantly. We mark that debt-to-market and are now doing a cost-benefit analysis of that. And that decision will be made post legal day one close.\nBrady Gailey: Okay, great. Thanks for all that guys.\nCraig Nix: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Marina. Your line is open, please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks. Good morning. I had two follow-up questions. On the commercial loan growth side, it's noticeable that the lines of credit from the FDIC disclosures have expanded, particularly at CIT, but it's also at First Citizens side. What does it take borrowers to kind of draw on those lines? Do you see signals coming that they'll be more active with that? The lines themselves have expanded, which I see as a positive as well.\nJames Bryan: This is Jim Bryan. I think the activity on the lines of credit for First Citizens are really driven by our focus on C&I activity. We have historically not been a C&I lender, and we began that journey prior to COVID, but we have been able to continue with that and have picked up some nice opportunities. I don't see a negative in line advance. I think it's more active participation in the market and the rebuild of activity with our C&I clients.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, great. That's helpful. And then just a quick back other question on the capital levels, pro forma capital. I presume it's stronger now than it was when you announced the acquisition in mid-October. Do you have a sense of kind of how low you can take the capital ratios once the merger is closed?\nCraig Nix: Well, we came out with -- and I'll focus on CET1, we came out with a pro forma in October of around 9.5%. That has -- that number will come in higher than that. I'm not going to talk about a specific number, but it will be higher for the reasons we discussed earlier around credit quality primarily and good earnings by both companies. In terms of how low we're willing to take it, I think our operating range for CET1 is nine percent to 11%, and we would in an environment where there's economic uncertainty, we might operate at the higher end of that range in a better business environment, maybe down toward the lower end of that range, but how low we're willing to take capital, obviously, is we have to consider regulatory limits, but we believe that we will be well within our range on CET1 at that time. And as we build capital, again, as we combine the companies, I think we'll have opportunities to repurchase shares.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great, thank you, Craig. I appreciated that.\nCraig Nix: Thank you.\nOperator: And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to our host for any closing remarks.\nDeanna Hart: Great, thank you. And thank you, everyone for joining this morning. As always, we are appreciative of your ongoing interest in our company. If you have any further questions or need additional information, please feel free to reach out. I hope everyone has a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.",

As you could imagine, we've spent the first half of 2021 focused on our upcoming merger with CIT. I'm pleased with the progress of both teams to prepare us for legal close and integration of our companies. We remain excited about our merger with CIT and look forward to capitalizing on the expertise of our companies to deliver value to our shareholders and stakeholders. Subject to Fed approval and customary closing conditions, we expect to close the merger during the third quarter. In addition to merger and integration planning, our team has executed on a number of financial and strategic objectives that we laid out in our 2021 strategic plan. One key area of focus is expanding our customer relationship model to improve our customers' experience. We've made good progress leveraging data to provide our bankers a comprehensive view of our customers allowing us to better serve their financial needs.

            "name": "Craig Nix",
            "content": "Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Page 3 of the investor presentation, I will cover our second quarter earnings highlights. We achieved another quarter of strong earnings. Net income totaled $152.8 million, an increase of $5.5 million over the linked quarter and a slight decline from the second quarter of 2020. We are pleased to announce that earnings translated into a return on average assets of 1.13% and a return on average equity of 14.64%. Net income per common share was $15.09, up from $14.53 in the first quarter and $14.74 in the comparable quarter a year ago. Pre-provision net revenue narrowly declined compared to the first quarter. The most significant factor causing the decline was related to higher personnel costs associated with merit increases, which took effect at the beginning of the quarter. Mortgage servicing rights impairments negatively affected noninterest income. Otherwise, our revenue-producing lines of businesses posted another good quarter.

We continued to experience strong credit quality and low net charge-offs during the second quarter. In addition, macroeconomic factors continued to improve, resulting in a further reserve release. As a result, the benefit from provision for credit losses increased from $11 million during the first quarter to $19.6 million during the second quarter. To date, as macroeconomic factors have improved and we have sustained good credit quality, we have released $35.3 million in reserves compared to a reserve build of $36.1 million during the first half of last year related to the uncertainty surrounding COVID-19. Compared to the second quarter of 2020, provision -- pre-provision net revenue declined by $32.2 million or by 15.2%. Solid core net revenue growth was more than offset by a $52.9 million decline in the fair market value adjustment on marketable equity securities. As a reminder, during the first quarter of last year, given what we saw at severe dislocation in the bank equity market where many banks were trading below 1 times tangible book value, we opportunistically bulked up our bank equity portfolio. During the second quarter of last year, these bank equity prices rebounded, and we sold the bulk of the securities for realized gains and experienced improvement in the fair market value of the portfolio that remained. This resulted in a positive fair market value adjustment during the second quarter of last year totaling $64.6 million. During the current quarter, the fair market value improved by $11.7 million resulting in the $52 point million  decline. The fair market value adjustment decline was partially offset by lower provision for credit losses, higher core noninterest income and higher net interest income, resulting in a minimal decline in net income for the comparable quarters. On Pages 4 and 5, I will cover trends in net interest income and net interest margin. After experiencing a decline in net interest income during the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter, net interest income increased during the current quarter as we opportunistically put some of our excess liquidity to work in the investment portfolio increasing the average balance by $777 million and the yield by eight basis points. Net interest income grew by $9.1 million over the comparable quarter in 2020 due to lower rates paid on interest-bearing deposits as well as increased interest and fee income on SBA-PPP loans, both only partially offset by a decline in yield on earning assets. While we were pleased with the increase in the absolute level of net interest income during the quarter, as expected, net interest margin declined by 12 basis points from the linked quarter. As we discussed last quarter, given the significant increase in deposits, which continued during the second quarter and the pending merger with CIT, we continue to operate with liquidity above normal operating ranges, which puts downward pressure on our net interest margin. Excess liquidity negatively impacted the change in margin from the first quarter by 13 basis points. Therefore, compared to prior quarters, the rate environment had a minimal positive impact on margins, primarily lower deposit costs and higher investment yield, while asset mix was the primary factor contributing to the decline in margin. As we mentioned last quarter, loans continue to come on the books at rates lower than maturing loans. This has put downward pressure on margin in recent quarters, but did moderate during the second quarter as rates on new business and commercial loans increased by approximately 25 basis points. In fact, the yield on loans ex-PPP did not change compared to the first quarter. We expect that net interest margin will continue to be a headwind throughout the remainder of 2021, but that the decline will continue to moderate in the coming quarters as it did in the second quarter. Turning to Page 6, I will cover noninterest income, which totaled $134.2 million during the second quarter. Noninterest income declined about $2.5 million compared to the linked quarter.

Noninterest income declined $31.3 million when compared to the second quarter of 2020 due primarily to the $52.9 million decline in fair market value adjustments on marketable equity securities that I discussed earlier. Core noninterest income grew over the comparable quarter in 2020 by $20 million as wealth management income, cardholder and merchant services income and deposit-related fees all increased offsetting a decline in mortgage income. For the remainder of 2021, we expect continued strength in the areas that have performed well so far this year, including wealth, card and merchant. We expect mortgage volume to decline as refinance activity slows, but the decline will be somewhat offset by service charges returning closer to pre-pandemic levels. The punchline here is that we expect core noninterest income in the third and fourth quarters to be in the $109 million to $110 million range, so fairly consistent with the second quarter isolating for mortgage servicing rights impairment.

We remain pleased with the level of expenses and the year-over-year decline in our efficiency ratio. We expect core noninterest expense ex-merger-related costs to remain in line with the recent run rate. Turning to Page 8, we provide balance sheet highlights and key ratios. I will cover the significant components of the balance sheet on the subsequent slides. On Page 9, I'll cover loan growth for the linked quarter and year-over-year periods. During the linked quarter, we saw a solid pickup in loan growth with the largest category in owner-occupied commercial real estate loans, which was more than offset by forgiveness of a large portion of our PPP loans. Ex-PPP loans grew organically at an annualized rate of seven percent during the second quarter. The story was similar on a year-to-date basis, the total loans relatively stable as PPP forgiveness almost completely offset a 5.1% increase in organic loans. Overall, we were pleased with organic loan growth during the first half of the year and expect organic loan balances to continue to grow during the second half of the year in the mid-single-digit percentage range. The ultimate level of loan growth will ultimately be dependent on continued economic expansion in our markets. Turning to Pages 10 and 11, I will cover our credit quality trends and allowance for credit losses. Credit continues to perform well as we experienced further improvement in the economy. As indicated by a historically low net charge-off ratio of three basis points during the second quarter and a nonperforming asset ratio of 0.74%, the lowest ratio over the past five linked quarters and the lowest level since the second quarter of 2019. Given these trends and improvement in the macroeconomic factors, we have recognized a credit provision benefit of $30.6 million through the first two quarters of this year compared to a reserve build of $36.1 million during the same period last year related to uncertainties surrounding the pandemic. Our allowance ratio ex-PPP loans declined from 0.69% in the first quarter to 0.61% in the second, covering net charge-offs during the quarter by 20.33 times and covering average net charge-off over the last five quarters 11.3 times. These coverage ratios compare to a loan book with an average life of approximately four years. We are now operating with an allowance ratio approximating where it was when we adopted CECL on January 1, 2020, or looking at it another way near the pre-pandemic level. While we saw no significant portfolio deterioration during the worst of the pandemic, we will continue to monitor industry risks associated with the impact that additional outbreaks may have on our loan portfolio performance. We remain comfortable with our allowance level and while we do not expect that net charge-offs will remain at these historically low levels, we have seen little indication that charge-offs going forward will have a significant impact on the level of our allowance. Moving on to Pages 12 and 13, I will cover deposit trends and our funding mix. We continue to experience strong deposit growth during the second quarter with demand deposits and checking with interest accounts leading the way. Deposits grew at an annualized rate of 9.2% since the end of the first quarter and by 16.7% on a year-over-year basis. Our balance sheet continues to be funded predominantly by core deposits with deposits representing over 96% of our funding base at the end of the quarter. We are pleased that most of our deposit growth has occurred in core checking accounts. And at the end of the second quarter, noninterest-bearing deposits accounted for approximately 43% of our total deposits. Total deposit costs ended the quarter at seven basis points, which was down one basis point from the first quarter and down 11 basis points from the same quarter a year ago. Looking forward, while our go-to-market strategy will continue to stress core deposit growth, we do expect growth to begin to moderate as the effect of government stimulus subsides and customers put their cash to use. Turning to Page 14, our capital position remains strong and ratios are above or within target ranges. As of the end of the second quarter, our CET1 ratio was 11.14%, and our total risk-based capital ratio was 14.15%. The majority of the growth in our risk-based capital ratios was attributable to strong earnings during the first half of the year, partially offset by growth in total risk-weighted assets. As we noted in prior quarters, our Tier one leverage ratio continues to be impacted by significant asset growth, both from government stimulus and organic deposit growth but it remains above internal thresholds, and we are comfortable with the current level. Turning to Page 15, I will close out by providing an update on our merger with CIT. As Frank mentioned in the opening, we continue to be excited about this merger. Our collective teams remain connected and have positioned us well for legal close and the ultimate integration of the company. Since our last call, we received approval of our application from the FDIC and are currently awaiting approval from the Federal Reserve. We continue to be in communication with the Fed and are positive that an approval of our application is forthcoming. There are no outstanding information requests with respect to our application. It is also our understanding that there are no concerns that may impact ultimate approval. Completion of the merger remains subject to Fed approval and customary closing conditions. We expect closing to occur during this quarter. Both companies have worked hard to develop initial business unit integration plans, which include key system decisions and recommendations. Once we move past legal close, we will review and finalize these integration plans and time lines. Key system conversions are slated to begin in the first quarter of 2022. When we announced this merger, we stated that it was financially compelling and that it would create a premier nationwide commercial and consumer bank with enhanced scale to drive growth, improve profitability and enhance shareholder value. We believe this remains the case, and our collective teams are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for the combined company. Last October, we shared with you estimated day one accounting marks and financial projections based on our merger due diligence. Our plan is to provide you an update as soon as practical following legal close. I can tell you that both companies are well positioned financially for this merger, and the conditions have improved since October, particularly with respect to credit quality. Specifically, we are pleased with the trends in credit quality that CIT has reported this year and the impact they have had on the allowance for credit losses. Again, more to come as soon as practical after legal close with respect to day one accounting marks and financial projections. This concludes my comments. Thank you all for joining us today. I will now open it up for Q and A. Thanks for the question, Kevin. I would say just from a quantitative standpoint, the growth has come in commercial real estate loans and primarily owner occupied. We've also seen some growth in residential mortgage loans. We put some products out there for -- such as home improvement loans, and this has fueled some of that growth. I think that we're very pleased with the seven percent annualized growth during the quarter, and we really attribute that to those new products, number one. But number two, we were very proactive during the pandemic in reaching out to our customers. And we think this has paid dividends with new opportunities for loans as the economy has improved. And the headwinds that we would anticipate in the future may be related to if there are further outbreaks or things of that nature. But we see opportunities to grow our loans at similar rates as we go forward, assuming the economy continues to open up and expand. Well, I don't really have a bright line in terms of the size of the investment portfolio. I can tell you that at the end of the first quarter, we huddled up, and we decided -- we put a goal out there to put close to $1 billion to work there to optimize our yield on earning assets moving out of cash and into investments. We remain diligent to add to that portfolio moving forward. As you know, we're running around 15% of our earning assets and cash right now. We're normally at four percent. So there's certainly a cost to that. And part of the way to mitigate that outside of loan growth is to opportunistically add to the investment portfolio where it makes sense. So that strategy -- we foresee that strategy continuing throughout the remainder of the year. That's correct, Kevin. Thank you. We would maintain the mid-single-digit growth expectation there. But obviously, I'm stating the obvious here, but it really does depend on to the extent the economy keeps opening up, but our expectations would be mid-single-digit percentage growth combined. We acknowledge that the price is attractive. I will tell you, our first priority will be integrating CIT. But as we combine the companies and build capital, we definitely plan to opportunistically resume our share repurchase program. Well, I will talk qualitatively about that, number one, certainly, are encouraged by the credit quality trends, which will bode well for where the credit mark may be compared to where it was in October. That's as of today, things could change between now and closing. So that movement is generally positive. From an EPS perspective, I know that we came out with EPS guidance in October of last year. I really don't see much movement there, based on just what we know as of today either. So I think the financial dynamics behind this, obviously, with a lower credit mark, we would come into it with higher capital. But I think that the financial dynamics are even more compelling than they were in October. So we expect good news there, but we shall see upon legal close where those things shake out. Well, as you know, we're going to mark that debt-to-market. So we'll get the benefit of current market rates. I can tell you with great certainty that our eye is on that constantly. We mark that debt-to-market and are now doing a cost-benefit analysis of that. And that decision will be made post legal day one close. Thank you. Well, we came out with -- and I'll focus on CET1, we came out with a pro forma in October of around 9.5%. That has -- that number will come in higher than that. I'm not going to talk about a specific number, but it will be higher for the reasons we discussed earlier around credit quality primarily and good earnings by both companies. In terms of how low we're willing to take it, I think our operating range for CET1 is nine percent to 11%, and we would in an environment where there's economic uncertainty, we might operate at the higher end of that range in a better business environment, maybe down toward the lower end of that range, but how low we're willing to take capital, obviously, is we have to consider regulatory limits, but we believe that we will be well within our range on CET1 at that time. And as we build capital, again, as we combine the companies, I think we'll have opportunities to repurchase shares. Thank you."

At this time, all the participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce the host for today's conference call, Ms. Deanna Hart, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nDeanna Hart:\nFrank Holding: Thank you, Deanna, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for our first quarter earnings call. We are pleased to report $147.3 million in earnings for the first quarter as our business model continues to demonstrate strength and stability. On the heels of a year that challenged even the best of companies, I'm proud that our team remains focused and continues to support our customers and communities during these challenging times. This quarter, we've been hard at work on the second round of PPP funding and originated $1.1 billion in new PPP loans to support approximately 9,600 customers. We made additional improvements to our forgiveness process, allowing for streamlined application and processing with our customers and the SBA. Also with respect to the most recent round of stimulus payments, we provided even better customer experience thanks to the proactive efforts of our bankers and support teams. These continue to be exciting times for First Citizens and we remain pleased with our progress toward completion of our transformational merger with CIT, the largest and most significant in our history. When our merger with CIT is completed, together we'll be a stronger and better bank, better for our associates, our customers and our communities. Our complementary strengths will position us to help customers do more with their money and make more of their futures. The bottom line is we're taking our company and our future to the next level. I'll now highlight Page 3 of our investor deck to provide an update on our activities surrounding the merger. In February, we received approval from the North Carolina Commissioner of Banks as well as from the stockholders of both companies. We continue to prepare for an anticipated closing in mid-2021, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of our remaining regulatory approvals.\nCraig Nix: Hey, thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. As Frank mentioned, we released strong first quarter financial results today. I will now walk through our investor presentation and provide additional detail and commentary on the more significant components of our financial results during the first quarter. Starting on Page 4, net income totaled $147.3 million, a 158% increase over the first quarter of 2020 and an increase of 6.7% over the linked quarter. Earnings translated into a return on average assets of 1.16% and a return on average equity of 14.7%. Net income per common share totaled $14.53, up $9.07 over the first quarter of 2020, driven primarily by increases in pre-provision net revenue, a release of provision due to lower net charge-offs, strong credit performance and improving macroeconomic conditions and 2020 share repurchase activity. Compared to a year ago, pre-provision net revenue increased by $77.9 million or about 76.1%. The largest driver behind this increase was a $67.4 million favorable change in the fair value adjustment on our marketable equity securities portfolio, but we also benefited from core noninterest income growth in our fee-based lines of business. Credit quality remained strong with net charge-offs near historic low of 4 basis points compared to 10 basis points a year ago and 7 basis points in the linked quarter. Nonperforming assets remained stable during the quarter. Pages 5 and 6 cover trends in net interest income and net interest margin. Net interest income declined by $19.1 million from the linked quarter. Most of the decline was due to a $21.7 million decline in loan interest income. Of the $21.7 million decline, $12.2 million related to a decline in fee and interest income on SBA-PPP loans due primarily to a decline in forgiveness activity during the quarter.\nOperator:  Your first question is from the line of Brad Gailey.\nBrady Gailey: Yeah, it's Brady Gailey. Good morning, guys.\nFrank Holding: Good morning.\nBrady Gailey: So I wanted to start with the loan yield. The loan yield fell a little more than I was anticipating in the quarter. I know, Craig, you mentioned some PPP noise there. But relative to the 3.92% loan yield, what was the new loan yield coming on in the quarter, if you look at the first quarter's production? Just any other commentary about the linked quarter decline we saw on the loan yield?\nCraig Nix: Okay. I'm going to ask Tom Eklund, our Treasurer, to address that question.\nTom Eklund: Yeah, so quarter-over-quarter our new loan yields remain relatively stable at around 3% on the business, commercial and on the mortgage side. As the steepening of the yield curve really hasn't priced through yet, what we're seeing and what we're expecting is really an improvement here into the second quarter, as the steepening of the yield curve and what we're quoting to clients currently sort of works its way through the pipeline.\nBrady Gailey: Okay. All right, so is 3% flat new loan yield is a decent amount of ways from the portfolio yield? I mean, do you expect to see some decent decline in that loan yield going forward?\nTom Eklund: There is a couple of things that - when I say 3%, that's really on our business and commercial loan yield and on our mortgage loan yields. So, yes, there's a little bit of room left to fall, but it's not necessarily representative of the entire portfolio, if you count higher-yielding products such as credit cards, other consumer loans, et cetera. But needless to say, there's a little bit of a gap there. But again, I think as the first quarter starts pricing through, our quoted yields have ticked up in the range of 30 to 35 basis points on new volume.\nBrady Gailey: Okay. All right. And then my next question is just on regulatory approval. It's great to see you guys got approval from the state. You're still waiting on the FDIC and the fed, I believe. Any update there? Is there anything going on? I'm not sure if there is a community protest or anything that could potentially delay the closing of this deal?\nCraig Nix: We don't anticipate anything of that nature. Our completed merger applications are with the Fed and the FDIC. We've had ongoing communications with them and the dialogue I would say has been constructive and productive. So we anticipate completion of the merger mid-2021, but that's pending the regulatory approval and customary closing conditions. But there's really nothing underlying that gives us significant concerns.\nBrady Gailey: Okay. And maybe just one more question, if I can. If you look at the excess liquidity that's on your balance sheet, it continues to grow. It went from 9% of average earning assets up to 12% of average earning assets this quarter. So it's notable liquidity. I know the CIT deal plays nicely into that, with you all using some of that liquidity to pay off some of their high-cost funding. But outside of CIT, I mean, do you think about putting some of that excess liquidity in the FCNCA bond book at this point?\nCraig Nix: We're doing that opportunistically. I will say that by design we are certainly building up excess liquidity to provide us with flexibility in optimizing our funding mix with CIT. In normal times, we're much more comfortable with our cash position in the 3% to 4% of earning assets range. And right now, I think it's around 12%. So that certainly has provided a drag to margin, but we believe that having this excess liquidity provides us with opportunities for funding synergies once we combine First Citizens and CIT. So it is by design. We would not be comfortable with a 12% cash to earning asset position if we were not - if we do not have a pending merger.\nBrady Gailey: Yeah. All right, great. Well, thanks for the color, guys.\nCraig Nix: Yeah. Thank you. Good questions.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Kevin Fitzsimmons with D.A. Davidson.\nKevin Fitzsimmons: Hey, good morning everyone.\nCraig Nix: Good morning.\nFrank Holding: Good morning, Kevin.\nKevin Fitzsimmons: Just wondering, I know, I appreciate the outlook about on the heels of the negative provision that you could have further to come. And I'm just curious how we should think of the ACL ratio in terms of - and I know that varies quarter-to-quarter based on what you're inputting in the CECL model, but how we should think about that ratio settling? And I know it's going to get very complicated with CIT coming on board, but when we think about the need to build that you're making it clear, you're not - you don't need to build it any further, but it seems like you're sending a message that there could be further releases going forward. Is that the message?\nCraig Nix: Yeah. Kevin, I don't want to get prescriptive about the absolute level of the allowance as we move forward, but I would say that if trends continue as they have in terms of just really good credit quality indicators across the board, we did put up a $36.1 million reserve related to COVID-19. If you really - and reserve money is sort of fungible, but if you really isolated what we did in the current quarter, there would have been approximately a $13 million release of those reserves. So if you do the math there, there's likely - there's $23 million out there related to COVID uncertainty. So that's a number we'll continue to look at going forward. But in terms of the absolute level of the allowance, I think, what we would say is that you could look back to where it was pre-pandemic. And I think you could anticipate if things continue to - if credit quality trends hold up that you could see us drift back to those levels over time.\nKevin Fitzsimmons: Okay. I appreciate that. And just on the combined company, obviously, you all provided some outlook on the allowance ratio and credit marks and things like that. And it seems like we've come a long way in terms of how everyone's thinking about credit over the last several months. And are you all - I know, it's kind of sensitive timing, because you've got the closing coming up, but are you - can you give any broad brush strokes on how those assumptions may have changed from when you originally announced the deal?\nCraig Nix: I would say just directionally, we're pleased with the macroeconomic trends that we're seeing out there. And I think those trends sort of translate over. Although, we're not ready to provide specific guidance on where those absolute level of the combined ACL will be, but we are encouraged by what we're seeing in the environment. We were encouraged with CIT credit quality trends in the fourth quarter. So I think just directionally things have improved, but there's a lot of time between now and when we will be providing those numbers, hopefully, mid-2021 when we produce our first quarter combined, we'll share that. But generally, we're encouraged with the way trends are moving and that should bode well, but not ready to call that at this point in time.\nKevin Fitzsimmons: And just as a follow-up to Brady's question about the timeline on regulatory approval. Is it, in your opinion, more a matter of just the size and complexity of this deal? Or is it that we have a new administration and there's maybe a different tone on these kind of approvals, or as opposed to anything really specific that's holding up the approval of the deal?\nCraig Nix: We don't see anything specific holding it up. In fact, we think these timelines are normal and customary on the transaction the size. And I'm not going to speculate on the other matters.\nKevin Fitzsimmons: Okay. And then - and just one last one for me a broad question. A lot of time has passed from when you announced the CIT deal and you guys outlined the positives. Anything noteworthy that has changed over this time, either - or maybe both in terms of you being more excited about it or that you feel it's going to be incrementally more of a challenge than you might have thought when you announced the deal related to CIT.\nCraig Nix: We remain very enthusiastic about this deal both companies have great talent and teams. Our teams are in constant coordination, working towards integration. And personally, I'll let Frank speak on this too, I'm more excited. So we're ready to roll.\nFrank Holding: Kevin, this is Frank Holding. I'll echo Craig's comment. The anticipation is building here. I think our optimism is building here. The more time we spend with our counterparts at CIT Group, the more energetic we become. And so we're ready to go ahead and make it happen.\nKevin Fitzsimmons: Okay. Thanks, Frank. Thanks, Craig.\nFrank Holding: Thanks, Kevin.\nCraig Nix: Thanks, Kevin.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous.\nBrian Foran: Good morning. Maybe just to follow on that last question. I'm  speak to the deposit trends. I guess, what strikes me when I look across the 2 results this morning, CIT's book is shrinking, but with a significantly reduced cost. Your book is growing, and obviously, the cost is rock bottom. But when I find them, it looks like you're actually putting up pretty nice combined deposit growth. And the pro forma deposit costs are quickly converging with the typical regional bank. So I wonder if you could just - if you step back holistically and think about that deposit opportunity across the 2 banks, is that the right way to think about it? And is maybe some of that funding synergies, which were always there, but not included in the deal targets starting to come through a little quicker than maybe envisioned?\nCraig Nix: Well, we certainly acknowledge the sort of natural decline in the combined deposit costs just due to the rate environment. With respect to deposit rate, I mean, we do attribute some of that to government stimulus and companies holding on the cash balances. But even strip out - if you strip out the impact of reciprocal PPP deposits, government stimulus at First Citizens, I'll speak to our deposit growth about half of that annualized growth in the quarter was related to organic growth. And I'll go back to - I'll attribute that to our go-to-market strategy, which really does emphasize deposit gathering, obviously, there's - the consumer is holding on the higher cash balances and businesses as well, so that's contributing some of that organic growth. But those are really strong internal growth rates. And that in and of itself will provide us with flexibility in funding earning assets as we combine the companies, so we're not ready to quantify what those funding synergies are, but we do believe that they are out there. And we are encouraged with the way deposit trends, and costs are moving.\nFrank Holding: I would - this is Frank Holding. We are smiling at your question. And we're observing the same thing that you're observing. And that is that these synergies are appearing at a rate that exceeded our expectations initially.\nBrian Foran: Thanks a lot and I've come to a . The fee trends, the $112 million core noninterest income, I wonder - you cite some cross-currents, mortgage, maybe headwinds, merchant and in wealth a tailwind. Should we think about $112 million as kind of a new base? Is it maybe a little high and somewhere between the $102 million, $103 million where it was before? Just as we think about the kind of overall level, those core fees are going to maybe be able to sustain, any kind of points you would give us?\nCraig Nix: We're going to let Elliot Howard, Director FP&A, address that question.\nElliot Howard: Yeah. Thanks. I think the $112 million in core is pretty representative of a run-rate going forward. I mean, we did have the $3 million release of the MSR impairment, as Craig mentioned, but I think when you think about our noninterest income, I mean, it's really stable recurring sources. And so, from the wealth and merchant, I mean, I think they are really here to stay. Mortgage, we're certainly watchful there. Demand is still strong. We think that will moderate given the higher rate environment.\nBrian Foran: Great. Well, thank you for taking the questions.\nFrank Holding: Thank you, Brian.\nOperator: This ends our Q&A session, and I'd like to turn the call back over to our host for any closing remarks.\nDeanna Hart: Thank you. And thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. As always, we're appreciative of your ongoing interest in our company. If you have any further questions or need additional information, please feel free to reach out. I hope you all have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.",

Kevin, I don't want to get prescriptive about the absolute level of the allowance as we move forward, but I would say that if trends continue as they have in terms of just really good credit quality indicators across the board, we did put up a $36.1 million reserve related to COVID-19.

In fact, we think these timelines are normal and customary on the transaction the size. And I'm not going to speculate on the other matters. We remain very enthusiastic about this deal both companies have great talent and teams. Our teams are in constant coordination, working towards integration. And personally, I'll let Frank speak on this too, I'm more excited. So we're ready to roll. Thanks, Kevin. Well, we certainly acknowledge the sort of natural decline in the combined deposit costs just due to the rate environment. With respect to deposit rate, I mean, we do attribute some of that to government stimulus and companies holding on the cash balances. But even strip out - if you strip out the impact of reciprocal PPP deposits, government stimulus at First Citizens, I'll speak to our deposit growth about half of that annualized growth in the quarter was related to organic growth. And I'll go back to - I'll attribute that to our go-to-market strategy, which really does emphasize deposit gathering, obviously, there's - the consumer is holding on the higher cash balances and businesses as well, so that's contributing some of that organic growth. But those are really strong internal growth rates. And that in and of itself will provide us with flexibility in funding earning assets as we combine the companies, so we're not ready to quantify what those funding synergies are, but we do believe that they are out there. And we are encouraged with the way deposit trends, and costs are moving. We're going to let Elliot Howard, Director FP&A, address that question."

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce the host of this conference call, Ms. Deanna Hart, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nDeanna Hart: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for First Citizens Bank\u2019s fourth quarter earnings call. It is my pleasure to introduce our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Frank Holding, as well as our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Nix, who will provide an update on our financial results and outlook. We are also pleased to have several other members of our leadership team in attendance with us today who will be available to participate in the question-and-answer portion of the call, if needed. During the call, we will be referencing our investor presentation, which you can find on our Web site. An agenda for today\u2019s presentation is on Page 2 of these materials. Following the completion of our presentation, we\u2019ll happily take questions. As a reminder, our comments will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. We assume no obligation to update such statements. These risks are outlined for you on Page 3 of the presentation. We will also reference non-GAAP financial measures in the presentation. Reconciliations of these measures against the most directly comparable GAAP measures are found in Section 5 of the presentation. Finally, First Citizens is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Frank.\nFrank Holding: Thank you, Deanna, and good morning to everyone. We appreciate all of you joining us today. And I'll make some comments about the year and then update you on our 2023 strategic priorities. And then I'll turn it over to Craig Nix to highlight our financial results for the fourth quarter and the outlook for 2023.  Starting on Page 5, 2022 was a great year for First Citizens. In addition to the completion of our merger, we delivered solid financial results marked by strong top line growth, low credit losses and well controlled expenses. We were pleased with the performance of our lines of business, achieving robust loan growth in both the general and commercial banks.  And despite a challenging year for deposits driven by unprecedented quantitative tightening, we experienced modest growth in non-interest checking accounts and only a slight decline in deposits during the year. Our merger integration is substantially complete. And we're now focused on creating positive operating leverage by growing revenues and optimizing our operations. We remain on track to achieve our $250 million cost savings goal.  During the third quarter, we announced a share repurchase plan to optimize our capital levels, and we completed the plan early in the fourth quarter, repurchasing 1.5 million Class A common shares. This plan allowed us to return excess capital to our shareholders while exceeding our CET 1 target, and is expected to be approximately 10% accretive to earnings per share in 2023. Our capital position remains strong relative to our risk profile. And we believe that we will have the ability to resume share buybacks in the second half of this year.  From a profitability standpoint, we finished right in line with our guidance and are pleased with our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year. Strong loan growth and rising interest rates drove a 20% increase in net interest income over the prior year. This strong margin growth combined with solid non-interest income growth and well controlled expenses drove a year-over-year 45.5% increase in pre-provision net revenue.  Earning asset yields increased by 68 basis points. And we were able to manage rising deposit costs despite a challenging and competitive environment. The pace of rate hikes did begin to put pressure on margin as we entered the fourth quarter. During my tenure at First Citizens, we've been through several tightening cycles and we've always grown and prospered through them. Looking at non-interest income, our fee income producing lines of business provided continued support to our net revenue led by growth in rental income on operating lease assets, as our rail portfolio saw increased utilization and positive momentum from higher lease rates. We also saw growth in areas such as wealth and card despite a challenging market environment for wealth. You'll remember that we announced the elimination of certain NSF and OD charges that took place in the second half of 2022 reducing deposit service charge income. But we've had strong growth in commercial service charges to help offset some of this NSF, OD impact. Despite inflationary headwinds, we maintain prudent expense discipline which resulted in positive operating leverage for the full year, as well as an improvement in our efficiency ratio, which we expect to maintain in the low to mid 50s on an annualized basis moving forward.  We're pleased with the growth in loans we saw in 2022 with total loans increasing by $5.6 billion, or 8.5% over year end 2021. We saw growth in the general bank and within the commercial bank and industry verticals and business capital. While we experienced an increase in non-accrual loans in the fourth quarter, net charge-offs remained well below historic norms. Overall, credit quality remains strong and we are not seeing broad based signs of stress in our loan portfolio.  Now turning to Page 6, I'll quickly highlight a few of our strategic priorities moving forward. Investing in our core businesses to achieve profitable organic growth. We're pleased with the momentum in many of our core lines of business, including our branch network, wealth, business capital, the industry verticals and middle market banking. And we're going to continue to add revenue producers and enhance our capabilities in these areas to remain competitive and expand market share.  Optimize capital and focus on core deposit growth. A key foundation to our strategy is our focus on full long-term banking relationships, which in addition to making loans includes the deposit relationship. Our goal is to fund earning assets with low cost stable deposits, and this remains a significant component of our go-to-market strategy.  In terms of capital allocation, our number one priority is focus on our customers. But to the extent we have excess capital after funding internal growth, our strategy is to redeploy it into share repurchases at attractive prices.  A focus on talent acquisition and retention. We're going to continue to be proactive in adding talent to support our continued growth. In addition to our focus on talent and our associates, we will remain focused on our customers to make sure we're aligning our products and services across all segments in ways that meet their financial needs.  As we move into 2023, we will continue to work on distributing the capabilities we have as a firm across our lines of business more broadly, which will help create additional revenue synergies as clients have access to a wider variety of products.  Capitalize on the benefits of shifting from merger integration to operating as a combined company to boost our operating leverage. While we are in line to achieve our cost savings goals, we're going to continue to focus on further optimization and efficiency as we believe there is an opportunity to build upon the efficiency we have recognized to date. And we will continue to assess processes and capitalize on revenue synergies and opportunities.  Manage risk effectively. We're committed to strong risk management and regulatory compliance. In 2023, we will continue to build out and execute on our new regulatory capabilities to ensure we meet the requirements of the large financial institutions framework. We have made great progress on our readiness to comply with heightened regulatory standards, and we worked hard to develop the capabilities and planning needed to ultimately satisfy the regulatory standards. In the coming year, we will be intently focused on executing upon these plans.  To conclude, while we acknowledge certain concerns in the broader economy, we enter 2023 with solid capital and liquidity positions, and are well positioned to continue to build customer relationships and grow our balance sheet profitably. We will remain focused on our client-focused model and committed to delivering solid results regardless of the market conditions. I want to thank our associates across the company for working so hard to make us successful in our transformation to a large financial institution and at the same time supporting our shareholders, customers and communities.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Craig Nix.\nCraig Nix: Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Page 8 of the deck, fourth quarter GAAP net income to common stockholders was $243 million, or $16.67 per common share. Our fourth quarter GAAP results were impacted by the strategic decision to exit $1.2 billion of bank-owned life insurance policies, resulting in a tax charge of $55 million. Favorable market conditions prompted us to exit this long-term liquid asset. And as we receive proceeds from this surrender, it allows us to invest in high quality liquid assets at higher yields resulting in minimum capital and liquidity accretion.  On an adjusted basis, net income to common stockholders was $306 million, or $20.94 per common share, yielding an annualized ROE of 13.89% and an ROA of 1.15%. EPS was in line with the guidance we provided on our third quarter call. Comparable EPS, ROE and ROTC shown on this page for 2021 periods offer First Citizens BancShares on a standalone basis. ROA, PPNR ROA, NIM and the net charge-off and efficiency ratios are presented as if the company were combined during the 2021 historical periods. I'll dive a little deeper into these components in a moment as we look at the underlying trends that produced our results.  On pages 9, 10 and 11, we provide two condensed income statements and commentary. The table at the top of the page represents our reported GAAP results. And the table at the bottom supplements those results showing net income adjusted for notable items. Commentary for quarter-to-date GAAP results is included on Page 9 and for adjusted results on Page 10. Page 11 discusses year-to-date results with GAAP commentary at the top part of the highlight section and adjusted at the bottom. All income statements are presented as if FCB and CIT were merged during the 2021 historical periods presented. The section in the middle of the page summarizes the impact of notable items to derive the adjusted results from the reported results.  The most significant notable items in the fourth quarter included the reclassification of 135 million in depreciation and maintenance expense on operating lease equipment for non-interest expense and non-interest income, the $55 million tax charge I just mentioned related to the BOLI surrender, and $29 million in merger-related expenses.  Focusing now on Page 10, adjusted net income available to common shareholders was 306 million for the fourth quarter, down from 326 million in the third quarter, and from 291 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year. The decrease during the linked quarter was due to an increase in provision for credit losses and slightly lower pre-provision net revenue.  The provision build was primarily due to an increase in reserves on loans individually evaluated for impairment, slightly higher net charge-offs, net loan growth and continued deterioration in the economic outlook, all partially offset by change in portfolio net. The increase over the comparable quarter a year ago was due to $171 million or 51.7% increase in PPNR, only partially offset by a $157 million increase in provision expense.  Page 12 provides detail with respect to notable items for the relevant quarterly and year-to-date periods. During the fourth quarter, these adjustments had a net impact of adding $4.27 to GAAP EPS. Turning to Page 13, net interest income totaled $802 million for the quarter, up over the linked quarter by $7 million.  As we anticipated in our fourth quarter guidance, rising deposit costs and an increase in interest-bearing deposit balances caused net interest income growth to decelerate. Our cumulative deposit beta increased from 6% to 14% during the quarter, in line with our expectations.  Interest income increased by $134 million over the linked quarter due to loan growth and a higher yield on earning assets. Interest expense increased $127 million due to higher funding costs and interest-bearing deposit balances. An analysis of the comparable quarter and year-to-date periods is provided at the bottom of the slide for your reference.  Turning to Page 14, net interest margin was 3.36% in the fourth quarter, a 4 basis points decline from the third and increased by 80 basis points from the fourth quarter a year ago. Before I discuss the key components of the net decline in margin from the linked quarter, it is important to note that with the pace of the share repurchase program that began in early August, we more fully felt the impact of the reduced earning assets in our margin this quarter, which was essentially tied to the foregone cash, which would have continued to increase in yield given the Fed rate hike this past quarter. This had a 4 basis points negative impact on the margin during the fourth quarter.  While the yield on earning assets continued to benefit from repricing, which occurred during the quarter, deposit repricing caught up amidst the competition for deposits. Combined with deposits going slightly more than was on the quarter, it had a slight negative drag on margin. Additionally, a reduction in non-interest-bearing deposits during the quarter also contributed to this slight decline. Moving forward, we believe the strength of our balance sheet will enable us to weather these interest rate headwinds favorably, as we expect to continue to benefit from increasing asset yields, while deposit costs are expected to level off in the back half of 2023. Turning to Page 15, the line graph on the left hand side of the page indicate we continue to be asset sensitive, albeit slightly less than prior quarters due to reduced cash balances. We have and will continue to take a measured approach to interest and market rate risk management to position our balance sheet to benefit from higher interest rates while at the same time providing some downside protection against lower interest rates.  We estimate that a 100 basis points shock in rates would increase net interest income by 3.4%. And a 100 basis points ramp will increase it by 1.5% over the next 12 months, unchanged from the prior quarter. The main drivers of our asset sensitivity are our variable rate loan portfolio, which represents 45% of total loans, our cash position and expected modest deposit betas driven by our strong core deposit base.  Turning to Page 16, we provide some additional information on our actual and expected deposit betas. In terms of our deposit base, 56% of our deposits exhibit lower betas and 44% exhibit moderate to higher betas. The 56% of deposits shown on the slide that exhibit lower betas are non-interest income bearing deposits and branch network checking with interest and savings accounts. Branch network, money market accounts and CDs representative of about 26% of total deposit exhibit moderate betas. And finally, Direct Bank money market, savings and time deposits representative of approximately 18% of total deposits exhibit higher betas.  Our cumulative beta through the fourth quarter was 14%, which was in line with our projection last quarter. We expect cumulative beta to increase to 22% by the end of the first quarter as deposits continue to catch up from recent rate increases. Over the interest rate hiking cycle, we forecast our cumulative beta will be approximately 25%. However, as Frank mentioned earlier, we are in unprecedented times with respect to Fed tightening. Our through the cycle deposit beta will ultimately be dependent on whether we continue to grow our loan portfolio as expected, whether the current rate forecast come to fruition and the impact of the competitive environment for deposits.  Turning to Page 17, we show GAAP non-interest income for the past five linked quarters and for the comparable year-over-year periods. Non-interest income as adjusted is shown in the blue bars for the same periods. I will focus my comments on adjusted non-interest income. Adjusted non-interest income increased by $2 million from the linked quarter to $290 million. While the total change was not significant, we did see a $9 million improvement in rental income on operating lease assets net, and that's net of maintenance and depreciation, driven by higher gross revenue from continued strong utilization and higher lease rates, as well as lower depreciation and maintenance expenses.  Maintenance expense on operating leases can be more idiosyncratic, with this quarter more favorable. However, we do expect it to move higher in the coming quarters. Our fee generating lines of business also had another great quarter. And we saw increases in service charges on deposit accounts, higher factoring and insurance commissions, increased cardholder income and higher fee income and other service charges. These changes were partially offset by a decline in other non-interest income spread across several smaller line items. Non-interest income was up 26 million over the prior year quarter with the largest driver being improved adjusted rental income on operating lease equipment for similar reasons I just discussed for the linked quarter. Turning to Page 18, we show GAAP non-interest expense for the past five linked quarters and for the comparable year-over-year periods. Non-interest expense as adjusted is shown in the blue bars for the same periods. And I'll focus my comments on adjusting. The primary drivers of the $13 million increase over the linked quarter included a $6 million increase in marketing costs due to efforts in the Direct Bank to maintain and attract new deposit balances.  Net occupancy expense increased by $3 million, primarily due to increased repairs that were episodic in nature and utilities costs primarily attributable to inflation. Personnel costs were up by $2 million. The adjusted efficiency ratio of 54.08% remains in our target range of low to mid 50s. While we will continue to make expense management a priority for 2023 and beyond, we feel that our continued recognition of cost save is helping maintain expense growth in the low single digits than otherwise would be in the 5% to 6% range given inflation headwinds.  Page 19 outlines our adjusted non-interest income and expense composition, which remained relatively stable compared to the prior quarter aside from changes to rental income on operating leases and other income explained just a moment ago. Page 20 shows balance sheet highlights and key ratios. I won't spend time covering these as I've cover the significant component with subsequent pages of the debt.  Turning to Page 21, we had another good quarter of loan growth with loans increasing by $1 billion over the linked quarter, or by 5.6% on an annualized basis, as our team continued to deliver for our customers and we benefit from reduced prepayments due to the higher interest rate environment. Loan growth for the quarter was primarily driven by the branch network, which grew by $1 billion, or 14.7% on an annualized basis.  Within the branch network, growth was concentrated in business and commercial loans. Mortgage loans grew by $355 million, or 15.4% on an annualized basis. The growth was primarily due to slowing prepayment rates, but production was up in our ARM loans, which we kept on the balance sheet. We continue to see our mortgage pipelines naturally flow given the right environment.  And during the fourth quarter, approximately 90% of our funded mortgage loan volume was for purchases compared to an approximate 50/50 purchase versus refinance split in the fourth quarter of last year. Total loans in the commercial bank declined by $523 million during the quarter, driven primarily by lower factoring balances which declined $448 million due to expected seasonal decline following the third quarter high mark. This decline was partially offset by $193 million in growth and business capital loans.  On a year-over-year basis, loans increased by 5.6 billion, or about 8.5% primarily due to increases in the branch network, which grew by 3.5 billion and mortgage channel grew by 1.6 million; and in the commercial bank, industry verticals grew by 1 billion led by strong growth in healthcare and TMT, business capital was up 632 billion over '21 and all of these increases were offset by $742 million decline in real estate finance loans.  As we look back on both the quarterly and full year results, I would like to recognize our sales teams for the hard work and excellent execution following the merger, as well as for the resulting strong performance that these efforts have spread across our many lines of business.  Page 22 shows our loan composition by type and segment for reference. Turning to Page 23, deposits increased by 1.9 billion, or 8.4% on an annualized basis from the linked quarter. The main driver of the growth was a $3.5 billion increase in interest-bearing deposits due to increases in time deposits and savings accounts partially offset by a decrease in money market deposits. A large portion of this growth is delivered through our Direct Bank.  As you'll remember from our previous call, we have worked diligently to leverage this channel to increase balances to help fund our loan growth. We do anticipate continued deposit growth in the Direct Bank in 2023 to help support loan growth. While this channel is higher costs compared to the traditional branch network, it will enable us to reduce more expensive FHLB borrowings than we have added in the past few quarters.  Our cost of deposits increased by 43 basis points during the quarter to 78 basis points, in line with our guidance. The increase is representative of the impact from the Fed rate hike and our need to raise rates to stay competitive with our peers. But our cost of funding has quickly caught up with our yield on earning assets. Our cumulative deposit data was well controlled at 14% despite the Fed funds rate increasing by 425 basis points since the end of 2021.  While we expect continued increases in deposit costs in the first quarter, we expect them to moderate then flatten in mid '23 as the Fed reduces its pace of increases and begins to lower rates. For your efforts, we have included our deposit composition by type and segment on Page 24. Turning to Page 25, our balance sheet continues to be funded predominantly by deposits, representing over 93% of our funding base.  As I mentioned last quarter, the FHLB borrowings we initiated had quarterly call features and you'll note we decreased those borrowings by approximately 1.6 billion this quarter, which is reflective of the deposit growth I just spoke to a moment ago. We believe the non-deposit concentration metrics will continue to flatten as our deposit balances continue to increase in the first quarter.  Continuing to Page 26, you'll see that credit quality continues to be strong even though we did see a small uptick in that charge-off and an increase in non-accrual loans during the quarter. The 14 basis points net charge-off ratio remains well below historic levels and beat our guidance. Provision for credit losses increased by $19 million due to a higher provision build and a $6 million increase in net charge-offs.  Moving to the bottom of the page, the non-accrual loan ratio increased 2.89% this quarter from 0.65% last quarter, but remains below the fourth quarter of 2019 pre-pandemic level of 0.97%. The increase in non-accruals was driven primarily by our non-owner occupied commercial real estate portfolio and more specifically related to general office exposure in the commercial bank segment.  You may remember, we discussed potential concerns in this portfolio last quarter and some of these changes have now pushed through to the portfolio. We have been closely monitoring this portfolio since the start of the pandemic and are continuing to see market disruption due to hybrid work models which impact vacancy and leasing rates. We have also seen an uptick in charge-offs and credit quality metrics in our small ticket leasing portfolio within business capital as borrowers continue to face inflationary pressures and supply chain disruption.  We are also monitoring this portfolio closely and have modified our credit risk appetite for new originations during the recent months. While we do not believe these two portfolios are necessarily predictive of trends in the broader portfolio, we are actively monitoring them to ensure any potential trends are identified early. Our allowance ratio increased by 4 basis points to 1.3% during the fourth quarter.  Moving on to Page 27, we provide a roll forward of the ACL from the linked quarter. For our CECL modeling, we start with the Moody's baseline scenario and then wait to both the upside and downside scenarios depending on market conditions. This quarter, baseline estimates reflected a continued slowdown in the economy, the elevated interest rate environment and meaningful reduction in real estate values, all of which impacted our allowance levels.  As we have now begun to see our baseline forecast more closely aligned to the downside scenario, we adjusted our scenario weighting this quarter given that our baseline reserves now incorporate more recessionary risks. Our current weighting is 30% to the upside, 30% to the baseline and 40% to the downside, reflecting a 10% shift between the downside weighting and the baseline weighting from the previous quarter.  The ACL increased by $40 million over the third quarter, now totaling $922 million, or 1.3% of total loans. We did have a net reserve build in the fourth quarter and are operating our company with the expectation for a mild recession in 2023. Our reserve build for the quarter was due to the net growth in loans, an increase in specific reserves on individually evaluated loans, as well as a slightly more negative macroeconomic outlook than in the prior quarter. These negative impacts were partially offset by a decline related to a mix shift during the quarter to portfolios with lower reserve rates. The ACL provided 9.3 years coverage of fourth quarter net charge-off on a portfolio with a weighted average life of approximately 3.5 years. Turning to Page 28, our capital position remains strong with all ratios above or in the upper end of our target ranges. At the end of the fourth quarter, our CET 1 ratio was 10.08% and our total risk-based capital ratio was 13.18%. The 29 basis points decline in our CET ratio was primarily the result of our share repurchase activity, which concluded in October. Net income growth continued to outpace loan-driven risk weighted asset growth and a decrease in CET 1 helped to optimize our capital ratios closer to our target ranges, whereas before our share repurchase plan, we were well above them.  As Frank mentioned in his comments, we plan to pursue another share repurchase plan in the second half of 2023. I feel confident in our ability to execute on this plan while remaining within our target capital ranges. During the fourth quarter, tangible book value per share increased modestly due to strong earnings performance, which more than offset the impact of AOCI in the share repurchase plan.  Turning to Page 29, we summarize our BOLI surrender strategy as well as with its financial benefits. Much of our investment activity during the fourth quarter was a result of this decision. And while this resulted in a $55 million tax charge in the fourth quarter, we anticipate the payback on the strategy to be approximately two years.  This is in line with our long-term view of the business and emphasis on driving tangible book value growth. We were able to pre-invest the additional liquidity and high yielding investments which should help to meaningfully increase our investment portfolio yield in the first quarter of 2023. The impacts from this surrender are reflected in our financial outlook that I will share next. Turning to Page 31, I will conclude by discussing our financial outlook for the first quarter and full year 2023. The first column is our fourth quarter 2022 results. The numbers for non-interest income expense are adjusted for notable items. Column two provides our guidance for the first quarter of 2023 and column three for the full year. There are a lot of variables that can impact this projection, and this guidance continues to assume recessionary impacts are mild.  Okay. For loans, during the fourth quarter, loans grew an annualized rate of 5.6%, down from the high double digit percentage growth rate in the second and third quarters. We expect flat to low single digit percentage annualized loan growth in the first quarter, as the absolute rate environment puts downward pressure on customers' lending appetite and given seasonal patterns typically witnessed during this period.  For the full year, we believe the mid single digit percentage growth in the fourth quarter is more indicative of where it will be for the full year 2023. While the absolute rate environment and economic uncertainty is tempering our clients' appetite to borrow in some segments, we still have strong pipelines in many of our core areas, and coupled with low rates of prepayment, this will lead us to mid single digit loan growth in 2023.  We think loan growth will be driven by continued momentum in business and commercial lending in the branch network. Our middle market business due to continued additions to our sales force, continued expansion of our wealth business through adding bankers and expanded presence outside of the Carolinas market and further growth both in our industry verticals and business capital segments.  Offsetting this growth, we do expect to see continued declines in real estate finance, as the client appetite to borrow is diminished in the current rate environment and we remain selective on the terms to extend new credit. We do acknowledge that uncertainty around the external environment, especially regarding economic risk and the pace of continued interest rate hikes, could cause actual growth rates to deviate from our expectations.  Moving on to deposits, during the fourth quarter, we actively took steps to curb some of the higher price deposit attrition we experienced in the second and third quarters and successfully grew balance in the fourth quarter at an annualized rate of over 8% led by the Direct Bank. Our expectation for the first quarter is high single digit annualized percentage growth based upon momentum in our Direct Bank and the seasonality in both our branch network and homeowners association banking business.  Our expectation is that this heightened growth in the first quarter will enable us to pay down some of the outstanding FHLB advances we currently have on the balance sheet. On the full year, we expect mid single digits percentage growth with non-interest-bearing growth also in mid single digits. While the high interest rate environment is a headwind here, we believe the client acquisition and our relationship-based approach that emphasizes no loan alone [ph] will help drive our deposit growth in 2023.  From an interest rate perspective, our outlook assumes that rates follow the implied forward curve. We forecast two interest rate hikes in the first quarter of 2023 and one in the second, with the Fed funds rate peaking at a range of 5% to 5.25%. In the back half of the year, we forecast two 25 basis points reductions in the Fed funds rate ending the year at a range of 4.5% to 4.75%. The expected timing of the cut leads to a reduction in the inversion of the yield curve in the back half of '23 which helps moderate some of the pressure on net interest margin.  Now on the net interest income, for the first quarter, we expect flat to a slightly negative annualized percentage decline compared to the fourth quarter primarily on reduced day count. We expect net interest margin to be stable relative to the fourth quarter. On a full year basis, we expect net interest margin to be stable to modestly increasing and year-over-year net interest income growth to be in the mid teens percentage growth range largely on the heels of improvement that we achieved in 2022.  Our forecast includes some lagged pricing impact on deposits and we project our cumulative deposit beta will increase from 14% to 22% in the first quarter. However, our variable loan portfolio will help temper the impact of increased deposit costs. And throughout 2023, we expect to benefit from the large favorable gap between new production yields and existing book yields on fixed rate loans and investments. This continued repricing of fixed rate loans and investments will help us achieve moderate margin expansion starting in the second quarter and in the back half of 2023. However, it's important to point out that most of the benefits of margin expansion are behind us.  The net interest income outlook remains uncertain and changes to our interest rate assumptions could have meaningful impacts to deposit product and pricing decisions as well as customer behavior and competitive dynamics. While we don't expect meaningful disintermediation of our non-interest-bearing account, it\u2019s something we will continue to monitor.  From a credit loss perspective, we are not seeing broad concerning trends in our portfolio with the stress related to a few smaller portfolios that I mentioned earlier. We are actively monitoring these portfolios and have taken proactive steps to limit our exposure. We do expect net charge-offs to continue to uptick in the next quarter in the range of 15 to 25 basis points and begin to return to more historical levels. For the full year 2023, we expect net charge-offs in the 20 to 30 basis points range. We continue to expect strong credit performance in our general bank segment and in many areas of our commercial segment and again have not seen signs of deterioration broadly.  On the non-interest income compared to the fourth quarter, we expect flat to low single digits annualized percentage decline, primarily due to the reduction in BOLI income and seasonal factoring declines being partially offset by continued growth in our wealth and payments lines of business. In terms of full 2023 guidance, we expect flat to low single digit percentage growth. While we project mid to high single digit growth in net operating lease income for the full year, we do expect a slight quarterly decline in the first quarter based upon the lower maintenance expense in the fourth quarter of '22.  We expect continued momentum in our wealth and payments businesses as a result of organic growth which we believe will be offset by the year-over-year impact of lower service charges, the reduction in BOLI income and a decline in factory commissions resulting from slower consumer demand. After the full year impact of NSF, OD changes and the BOLI reduction, we will project closer to mid single digit percentage growth in non-interest income. Moving to non-interest expense, we expect mid single digit annualized growth in the first quarter. We expect a slight increase in our efficiency ratio during the quarter primarily due to seasonal employee benefit increases. Looking forward, we expect to continue to feel the pressures of inflation especially as it relates to wages, professional services, and contract costs. Despite this, we feel confident in our ability to maintain our efficiency ratio in the low to mid 50s in the coming quarters, as we remove an estimated $50 million out of our cost base helping to neutralize natural non-interest expense growth. We expect the remaining cost base to be stacked towards the back end of 2023 and will have a more pronounced impact on 2024.  All said, we expect mid single digits percentage growth in adjusted non-interest expense in 2023. The expense growth will be led by inflationary factors in salaries and wages, the increasing depreciation impact from the closeout of many strategic and optimization projects, higher marketing costs for the Direct Bank, the impact of the industry-wide increase in FDIC assessment rates and higher marketing costs in the Direct Bank, all partially being offset by the cost saves.  Without the change in FDIC expense and the impact of the Direct Bank increase in marketing expense, we expect expense growth to be at the low single digit percentage range in 2023. And finally, on the income taxes, we expect our corporate tax rate to be in the range of 24.5% to 25% for the first quarter and the full year '23, which is a slight increase over previous guidance due to the surrender of the BOLI policies. In closing, we are pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results in 2022. As Frank mentioned in his comments, we remain confident in our ability to grow profitably and deliver on our commitments. We are positioned to perform well in a broad range of economic scenarios given our capital and liquidity positions, our talented associates, focused on our customers, our diverse business mix, and strong risk management culture.  With that, I will turn it over to the operator for instructions for the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from Brady Gailey from KBW. Your line is open.\nBrady Gailey: Thank you. Good morning, guys.\nFrank Holding: Good morning.\nBrady Gailey: So I wanted to start with the increase in the non-performing loans. Can you just give us a little more color? Was that just one or two loans, or was that a lot of loans? Was that legacy First Citizens or legacy CIT? And can you tell us what the total size of your office CRE loan portfolio is at the end of the year?\nCraig Nix: It was concentrated in large loans. I'm going to let Marisa give a little color on all that. Marisa, are you on the line?\nMarisa Harney: I am. Good morning. The increase in non-accruals was specifically a handful -- less than a handful of names, so a couple of large names; commercial bank, legacy CIT real estate portfolio, Class B office to drill it down as close as I can. The overall office portfolio in our non-owner occupied or investor commercial real estate is about 2.5 billion, 2.6 billion. It's equally split between the commercial bank and the general bank. The general bank is not seeing any deterioration in that office portfolio. It's a very granular portfolio, much more community based. And the few larger loans that are in the general bank typically have a very strong investment grade credit tenant. So the office portfolio in commercial is about 1.3 billion. It's centered in repositioned bridge. That means it's relatively short tenured. And it is in Class B office. It's broad based in terms of geographies. And obviously as things move into non-accrual, the credit and special assets team evaluate those four impairments. And we feel comfortable that we've done our job in terms of determining where we need specific reserves. But it is, obviously as Craig mentioned, a portfolio that we're watching closely. We are not in that business originating new office.\nBrady Gailey: Okay. All right, that's very helpful. And just to be clear, the 2.5 billion to 2.6 billion, that's the total office CRE than the commercial bank and the general bank?\nMarisa Harney: That's correct. And as I said, the 1.3 is the commercial bank portfolio that has the Class B office that we've been referring to.\nBrady Gailey: Okay. All right. And then just a question on guidance. I know last quarter, you guys gave some specific EPS guidance for the next quarter and the next year, specifically I know 2023 was guided to $95 to $100 a share. That was not in the slide deck this time. Is that still the expectation for '23 earnings to be 95 to 100 per share? Or is it hard to tell just given the uncertainty of what the provision line could be this year?\nCraig Nix: Brady, I would say that range is still relevant that we would guide towards the lower end of that range.\nBrady Gailey: Okay. And then finally for me, is there any scenario where the share buyback could begin before the back half of this year? You guys are making good money. You clearly have excess capital. Like is there any scenario that the buybacks have come earlier than the back half of '23?\nCraig Nix: Brady, not really. Our capital planning process is ongoing, but really comes to a head in the first quarter. So we will align the share repurchase with that capital plan and our capital actions and our submission to our regulators of that plan. So it's really that timing dictates the ultimate timing of the share repurchase plan. So we do not anticipate starting that prior to the second half of the year.\nBrady Gailey: Okay. All right, great. Thanks for the color, guys.\nFrank Holding: Thank you.\nOperator: We now turn to Stephen Scouten from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nStephen Scouten: Thanks, everyone. Maybe just following up on that share repurchase question and kind of the procedural structure of that, had there been any changes to who you would need to request from a regulatory perspective that repurchase authorization from your request last year? Would you foresee any incremental difficulty given the size changes and maybe any regulatory changes?\nFrank Holding: Stephen, we're not expecting any changes in the approval or the process that we'll go through. And we're also assessing it the same way that we did last year, so no changes at all in any of that.\nStephen Scouten: Okay. And when will be your first CCAR submission?\nTom Eklund: Stephen, this is Tom Eklund. We believe our -- so we will be subject to the capital plan rule starting in 2024. And we believe our first CCAR submission being a Category 4 bank will be in 2026, unless we are asked to participate sooner than that. It's obviously at the discretion of the regulatory bodies.\nStephen Scouten: Okay, got it. That's helpful. Thank you. And then I guess, as I'm thinking about your net interest margin guidance, a little surprised but encouraged to hear you think you can move that potentially higher, especially in the second quarter. It sounds like, Craig, from your comments that maybe that's due to your back book of loans, repricing faster than the back book of deposits? Is that kind of the main phenomenon that would lead that higher?\nCraig Nix: That is absolutely correct. But I would say modestly higher.\nStephen Scouten: Okay, great. And then can you give us an idea of what you're seeing from a spread perspective today in terms of maybe new loan yields and incremental deposit costs and how that compares to your current margin?\nCraig Nix: Right now, if you just look at new loan yields that are coming on, our new loans are coming on the books between 5.5% and 6%. The marginal cost of our deposits when you consider the various deposits that we have out there, we\u2019re savings money markets in the 350 range. So spreads 254 [ph], so spreads are around 200 basis points. Tom, do you have anything you'd like to add to that?\nTom Eklund: No. I think that's accurate. Obviously, rates shift as the market shifts and we pay close attention to both Fed hikes and also sort of how the curve behaves, I suppose.\nCraig Nix: But in that dynamic, the inversion of the yield curve remains a challenge.\nTom Eklund: Absolutely.\nStephen Scouten: Yes, definitely. Okay. And maybe just one last thing for me is just on the non-interest-bearing deposit growth. I know you said you think you could grow that mid single digits as well. Anything to note there in particular in terms of customer acquisition plans or otherwise that would lead to that, because I think that's industry-wide where we've been seeing the most pressure especially this quarter, is that maybe negative mix shift away from the non-interest-bearing deposits?\nCraig Nix: Yes. I think if you look at just mix of deposits, we are forecasting non-interest-bearing to remain consistent as a percentage of total deposits. And I would just anchor back to our go-to-market strategy, the no loan alone strategy always has emphasized growing non-interest-bearing deposits and we've been able to do that through various rate cycles. We will acknowledge that quantitative tightening and potential disintermediation can be headwinds there. But we feel like a 5% growth goal there is achievable and reasonable.\nStephen Scouten: Okay, great. Well, thank you all for all the color. I appreciate it.\nTom Eklund: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We now turn to Brian Foran from Autonomous. Your line is open.\nBrian Foran: Hi. Just going back to the 95 to 100 of EPS and maybe focusing more on the low end of the range, I should be able to do the math. But I mean, is that just because of the nudges on the fee expense and tax rate or is that also because of more uncertainty or higher potential provisions that you're contemplating?\nCraig Nix: Brian, look, just comparing the previous guidance that we gave in the third quarter to the current guidance, we have increased our deposit growth from low to mid single digits to mid single digits growth. We have changed our non-interest income from low single digit growth to flat to low single digit growth. We have increased our non-interest expense guidance from low to mid single to mid single digit growth. So with all that, when you total that up and run it through the model, it just puts us at the lower -- it leaves us within that range of 95 to 100 that puts us on the lower end, and it obviously does not incorporate share repurchases in the second half of the year. So I\u2019ll say all that is a lot of moving parts.\nBrian Foran: That's very helpful. And then the Fed cuts you're incorporating, do those really affect NII at all or do they happen like in December of '23 in the model, and so they're not really -- I guess do the Fed -- the 50 basis points of Fed cuts have been impacted the third and fourth quarter NII?\nElliot Howard: This is Elliot Howard. I would say one of the cuts kind of back in the third quarter, so that has a marginal impact. But the last one is certainly at the very end of the year, so very minimal impact on '23 for that one.\nBrian Foran: Okay. That is it for me. Thank you.\nFrank Holding: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Christopher Marinac from Janney Montgomery Scott. Your line is open.\nChristopher Marinac: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask about the deposit beta and kind of the roadmap to 25%. How much of that also spills over into kind of some business account activity beyond what you're doing with the CIT Bank?\nFrank Holding: Sorry, were you referring to business -- commercial business or commercial account activity there? I didn't quite catch the question.\nChristopher Marinac: Yes, it was business account activity as well as just the kind of interplay between deposit raising within your online channel, as discussed earlier versus kind of business opportunities within some of your core business accounts?\nFrank Holding: Yes. The majority of the beta, as Craig covered sort of the beta categories, where we see the highest beta is obviously in the direct channel. It's a lower fixed cost channel, but higher variables, higher interest expense there. So that is really sort of the main driver for the overall beta for us.\nCraig Nix: Yes, that represents 18% of our deposit beta. If you look at the branch network, we did have a mix of lower beta and moderate beta, that's 71% of deposits. So those two channels are around 90%. So the branch network really smooth that beta out, lowers it in total.\nTom Eklund: Yes. I'd say overall, we're experiencing beta similar to historical experience out of the branch network. It's really sort of the online and those deposit gathering channels that are driving the beta up.\nChristopher Marinac: So that 18%, Craig, would that stay constant or would that change over time?\nCraig Nix: You\u2019re talking about 92% of the --\nTom Eklund: I think 18% of the deposit beta?\nCraig Nix: 18%. Yes, I think it\u2019s -- but not significantly. If you look at sort of where we're projecting things to shake out, I think that the Direct Bank might increase marginally, maybe by a percentage point or two, but we anticipate that the branch network is going to be close to that 70% level going forward.\nChristopher Marinac: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you for that clarification. And then just on the CET 1 ratio over time, what would be the lower bound that you're comfortable with? And is that at all changing from what you may have thought a few quarters ago?\nCraig Nix: Our low end of CET 1 is 9% and that's consistent with prior quarter, and we don't anticipate a change there.\nChristopher Marinac: Okay, very well. Thank you for all the background this morning. It\u2019s very helpful.\nFrank Holding: Thank you.\nOperator: We have a follow-up question from Brian Foran at Autonomous. Your line is open.\nBrian Foran: Hi. Just two quick ones or I guess maybe one has a couple of parts, but on capital just following up on that. So absent the buyback, what you would accrete kind of 30 to 40 bps of CET 1 a quarter, does that sound about right?\nCraig Nix: You're close. Yes, that's very close.\nBrian Foran: And then you said the low end is 9. Is it 9 to 10 is the full through the cycle range, or what's the range of capital? Just remind me what the capital target is?\nCraig Nix: 9 to 10 is the range for CET 1.\nBrian Foran: Okay. And then I just want to come back to the front book, back book new loan pricing. So you're saying it's 5.5 to 6 for new production. And was the message that's good, because the existing portfolio yields 5 or was the message that's less good, because it's 200 basis points above the marginal cost of funds, or I just didn't know which to lean on in terms of the takeaway?\nElliot Howard: Brian, this is Elliot Howard. I think we would view it as positive. We look at 5.5% to 6% pricing. Specifically in the branch network, we're a lot more into fixed. Current yield on that portfolio is a little less than 4%. So we've got a pretty favorable gap when we look at that. Some of the fixed repricing will kind of be a win that are back in the second half of 2023.\nBrian Foran: So that's just for the fixed rate piece of the loan portfolio?\nElliot Howard: That's right. And that's where the pricing differential -- I mean variable pretty much prices to [indiscernible] moves up and down with the variable rate index.\nBrian Foran: And just remind me the fixed rate piece is half of the book or a little bit more than half the book? \nCraig Nix: It\u2019s 55% fixed, 45% variable.\nBrian Foran: Okay, so relative to like a lot of other banks. I guess every bank has this dynamic, but it's a bigger piece of your loan book. And so just in terms of the puts and takes into next year, it has a little bit more of a tailwind for you, because you got a little bit less of the immediate Fed funds benefit in '22 than a typical regional bank. But next year, you get a little bit more of the trailing front book, back book kind of ratcheting up than the average bank would?\nCraig Nix: Well said.\nBrian Foran: Yes, I realized that wasn't even a question. I was just like making a statement. Okay. Thank you. That's helpful because I was thinking you are comparing it to the entire loan book and the marginal cost. So that's helpful. That clears it up. Thank you very much.\nFrank Holding: Thank you, Brian.\nOperator: I\u2019m not showing any further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to our host for closing remarks.\nDeanna Hart: Thank you. And thank you everyone for participating in our call today. We appreciate your ongoing interest in our company. And if you have any further questions or need additional information, please feel free to reach out to the Investor Relations team. I hope everyone has a great rest of your day.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Craig Nix",
            "content": "Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Page 8 of the deck, fourth quarter GAAP net income to common stockholders was $243 million, or $16.67 per common share. Our fourth quarter GAAP results were impacted by the strategic decision to exit $1.2 billion of bank-owned life insurance policies, resulting in a tax charge of $55 million. Favorable market conditions prompted us to exit this long-term liquid asset. And as we receive proceeds from this surrender, it allows us to invest in high quality liquid assets at higher yields resulting in minimum capital and liquidity accretion.  On an adjusted basis, net income to common stockholders was $306 million, or $20.94 per common share, yielding an annualized ROE of 13.89% and an ROA of 1.15%. EPS was in line with the guidance we provided on our third quarter call. Comparable EPS, ROE and ROTC shown on this page for 2021 periods offer First Citizens BancShares on a standalone basis. ROA, PPNR ROA, NIM and the net charge-off and efficiency ratios are presented as if the company were combined during the 2021 historical periods. I'll dive a little deeper into these components in a moment as we look at the underlying trends that produced our results.  On pages 9, 10 and 11, we provide two condensed income statements and commentary. The table at the top of the page represents our reported GAAP results. And the table at the bottom supplements those results showing net income adjusted for notable items. Commentary for quarter-to-date GAAP results is included on Page 9 and for adjusted results on Page 10. Page 11 discusses year-to-date results with GAAP commentary at the top part of the highlight section and adjusted at the bottom. All income statements are presented as if FCB and CIT were merged during the 2021 historical periods presented. The section in the middle of the page summarizes the impact of notable items to derive the adjusted results from the reported results.  The most significant notable items in the fourth quarter included the reclassification of 135 million in depreciation and maintenance expense on operating lease equipment for non-interest expense and non-interest income, the $55 million tax charge I just mentioned related to the BOLI surrender, and $29 million in merger-related expenses.  Focusing now on Page 10, adjusted net income available to common shareholders was 306 million for the fourth quarter, down from 326 million in the third quarter, and from 291 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year. The decrease during the linked quarter was due to an increase in provision for credit losses and slightly lower pre-provision net revenue.  The provision build was primarily due to an increase in reserves on loans individually evaluated for impairment, slightly higher net charge-offs, net loan growth and continued deterioration in the economic outlook, all partially offset by change in portfolio net. The increase over the comparable quarter a year ago was due to $171 million or 51.7% increase in PPNR, only partially offset by a $157 million increase in provision expense.  Page 12 provides detail with respect to notable items for the relevant quarterly and year-to-date periods. During the fourth quarter, these adjustments had a net impact of adding $4.27 to GAAP EPS. Turning to Page 13, net interest income totaled $802 million for the quarter, up over the linked quarter by $7 million.  As we anticipated in our fourth quarter guidance, rising deposit costs and an increase in interest-bearing deposit balances caused net interest income growth to decelerate. Our cumulative deposit beta increased from 6% to 14% during the quarter, in line with our expectations.  Interest income increased by $134 million over the linked quarter due to loan growth and a higher yield on earning assets. Interest expense increased $127 million due to higher funding costs and interest-bearing deposit balances. An analysis of the comparable quarter and year-to-date periods is provided at the bottom of the slide for your reference.  Turning to Page 14, net interest margin was 3.36% in the fourth quarter, a 4 basis points decline from the third and increased by 80 basis points from the fourth quarter a year ago. Before I discuss the key components of the net decline in margin from the linked quarter, it is important to note that with the pace of the share repurchase program that began in early August, we more fully felt the impact of the reduced earning assets in our margin this quarter, which was essentially tied to the foregone cash, which would have continued to increase in yield given the Fed rate hike this past quarter. This had a 4 basis points negative impact on the margin during the fourth quarter.  While the yield on earning assets continued to benefit from repricing, which occurred during the quarter, deposit repricing caught up amidst the competition for deposits. Combined with deposits going slightly more than was on the quarter, it had a slight negative drag on margin. Additionally, a reduction in non-interest-bearing deposits during the quarter also contributed to this slight decline. Moving forward, we believe the strength of our balance sheet will enable us to weather these interest rate headwinds favorably, as we expect to continue to benefit from increasing asset yields, while deposit costs are expected to level off in the back half of 2023. Turning to Page 15, the line graph on the left hand side of the page indicate we continue to be asset sensitive, albeit slightly less than prior quarters due to reduced cash balances. We have and will continue to take a measured approach to interest and market rate risk management to position our balance sheet to benefit from higher interest rates while at the same time providing some downside protection against lower interest rates.  We estimate that a 100 basis points shock in rates would increase net interest income by 3.4%. And a 100 basis points ramp will increase it by 1.5% over the next 12 months, unchanged from the prior quarter. The main drivers of our asset sensitivity are our variable rate loan portfolio, which represents 45% of total loans, our cash position and expected modest deposit betas driven by our strong core deposit base.  Turning to Page 16, we provide some additional information on our actual and expected deposit betas. In terms of our deposit base, 56% of our deposits exhibit lower betas and 44% exhibit moderate to higher betas. The 56% of deposits shown on the slide that exhibit lower betas are non-interest income bearing deposits and branch network checking with interest and savings accounts. Branch network, money market accounts and CDs representative of about 26% of total deposit exhibit moderate betas. And finally, Direct Bank money market, savings and time deposits representative of approximately 18% of total deposits exhibit higher betas.  Our cumulative beta through the fourth quarter was 14%, which was in line with our projection last quarter. We expect cumulative beta to increase to 22% by the end of the first quarter as deposits continue to catch up from recent rate increases. Over the interest rate hiking cycle, we forecast our cumulative beta will be approximately 25%. However, as Frank mentioned earlier, we are in unprecedented times with respect to Fed tightening. Our through the cycle deposit beta will ultimately be dependent on whether we continue to grow our loan portfolio as expected, whether the current rate forecast come to fruition and the impact of the competitive environment for deposits.  Turning to Page 17, we show GAAP non-interest income for the past five linked quarters and for the comparable year-over-year periods. Non-interest income as adjusted is shown in the blue bars for the same periods. I will focus my comments on adjusted non-interest income. Adjusted non-interest income increased by $2 million from the linked quarter to $290 million. While the total change was not significant, we did see a $9 million improvement in rental income on operating lease assets net, and that's net of maintenance and depreciation, driven by higher gross revenue from continued strong utilization and higher lease rates, as well as lower depreciation and maintenance expenses.  Maintenance expense on operating leases can be more idiosyncratic, with this quarter more favorable. However, we do expect it to move higher in the coming quarters. Our fee generating lines of business also had another great quarter. And we saw increases in service charges on deposit accounts, higher factoring and insurance commissions, increased cardholder income and higher fee income and other service charges. These changes were partially offset by a decline in other non-interest income spread across several smaller line items. Non-interest income was up 26 million over the prior year quarter with the largest driver being improved adjusted rental income on operating lease equipment for similar reasons I just discussed for the linked quarter. Turning to Page 18, we show GAAP non-interest expense for the past five linked quarters and for the comparable year-over-year periods. Non-interest expense as adjusted is shown in the blue bars for the same periods. And I'll focus my comments on adjusting. The primary drivers of the $13 million increase over the linked quarter included a $6 million increase in marketing costs due to efforts in the Direct Bank to maintain and attract new deposit balances.  Net occupancy expense increased by $3 million, primarily due to increased repairs that were episodic in nature and utilities costs primarily attributable to inflation. Personnel costs were up by $2 million. The adjusted efficiency ratio of 54.08% remains in our target range of low to mid 50s. While we will continue to make expense management a priority for 2023 and beyond, we feel that our continued recognition of cost save is helping maintain expense growth in the low single digits than otherwise would be in the 5% to 6% range given inflation headwinds.  Page 19 outlines our adjusted non-interest income and expense composition, which remained relatively stable compared to the prior quarter aside from changes to rental income on operating leases and other income explained just a moment ago. Page 20 shows balance sheet highlights and key ratios. I won't spend time covering these as I've cover the significant component with subsequent pages of the debt.  Turning to Page 21, we had another good quarter of loan growth with loans increasing by $1 billion over the linked quarter, or by 5.6% on an annualized basis, as our team continued to deliver for our customers and we benefit from reduced prepayments due to the higher interest rate environment. Loan growth for the quarter was primarily driven by the branch network, which grew by $1 billion, or 14.7% on an annualized basis.  Within the branch network, growth was concentrated in business and commercial loans. Mortgage loans grew by $355 million, or 15.4% on an annualized basis. The growth was primarily due to slowing prepayment rates, but production was up in our ARM loans, which we kept on the balance sheet. We continue to see our mortgage pipelines naturally flow given the right environment.  And during the fourth quarter, approximately 90% of our funded mortgage loan volume was for purchases compared to an approximate 50/50 purchase versus refinance split in the fourth quarter of last year. Total loans in the commercial bank declined by $523 million during the quarter, driven primarily by lower factoring balances which declined $448 million due to expected seasonal decline following the third quarter high mark. This decline was partially offset by $193 million in growth and business capital loans.  On a year-over-year basis, loans increased by 5.6 billion, or about 8.5% primarily due to increases in the branch network, which grew by 3.5 billion and mortgage channel grew by 1.6 million; and in the commercial bank, industry verticals grew by 1 billion led by strong growth in healthcare and TMT, business capital was up 632 billion over '21 and all of these increases were offset by $742 million decline in real estate finance loans.  As we look back on both the quarterly and full year results, I would like to recognize our sales teams for the hard work and excellent execution following the merger, as well as for the resulting strong performance that these efforts have spread across our many lines of business.  Page 22 shows our loan composition by type and segment for reference. Turning to Page 23, deposits increased by 1.9 billion, or 8.4% on an annualized basis from the linked quarter. The main driver of the growth was a $3.5 billion increase in interest-bearing deposits due to increases in time deposits and savings accounts partially offset by a decrease in money market deposits. A large portion of this growth is delivered through our Direct Bank.  As you'll remember from our previous call, we have worked diligently to leverage this channel to increase balances to help fund our loan growth. We do anticipate continued deposit growth in the Direct Bank in 2023 to help support loan growth. While this channel is higher costs compared to the traditional branch network, it will enable us to reduce more expensive FHLB borrowings than we have added in the past few quarters.  Our cost of deposits increased by 43 basis points during the quarter to 78 basis points, in line with our guidance. The increase is representative of the impact from the Fed rate hike and our need to raise rates to stay competitive with our peers. But our cost of funding has quickly caught up with our yield on earning assets. Our cumulative deposit data was well controlled at 14% despite the Fed funds rate increasing by 425 basis points since the end of 2021.  While we expect continued increases in deposit costs in the first quarter, we expect them to moderate then flatten in mid '23 as the Fed reduces its pace of increases and begins to lower rates. For your efforts, we have included our deposit composition by type and segment on Page 24. Turning to Page 25, our balance sheet continues to be funded predominantly by deposits, representing over 93% of our funding base.  As I mentioned last quarter, the FHLB borrowings we initiated had quarterly call features and you'll note we decreased those borrowings by approximately 1.6 billion this quarter, which is reflective of the deposit growth I just spoke to a moment ago. We believe the non-deposit concentration metrics will continue to flatten as our deposit balances continue to increase in the first quarter.  Continuing to Page 26, you'll see that credit quality continues to be strong even though we did see a small uptick in that charge-off and an increase in non-accrual loans during the quarter. The 14 basis points net charge-off ratio remains well below historic levels and beat our guidance. Provision for credit losses increased by $19 million due to a higher provision build and a $6 million increase in net charge-offs.  Moving to the bottom of the page, the non-accrual loan ratio increased 2.89% this quarter from 0.65% last quarter, but remains below the fourth quarter of 2019 pre-pandemic level of 0.97%. The increase in non-accruals was driven primarily by our non-owner occupied commercial real estate portfolio and more specifically related to general office exposure in the commercial bank segment.  You may remember, we discussed potential concerns in this portfolio last quarter and some of these changes have now pushed through to the portfolio. We have been closely monitoring this portfolio since the start of the pandemic and are continuing to see market disruption due to hybrid work models which impact vacancy and leasing rates. We have also seen an uptick in charge-offs and credit quality metrics in our small ticket leasing portfolio within business capital as borrowers continue to face inflationary pressures and supply chain disruption.  We are also monitoring this portfolio closely and have modified our credit risk appetite for new originations during the recent months. While we do not believe these two portfolios are necessarily predictive of trends in the broader portfolio, we are actively monitoring them to ensure any potential trends are identified early. Our allowance ratio increased by 4 basis points to 1.3% during the fourth quarter.  Moving on to Page 27, we provide a roll forward of the ACL from the linked quarter. For our CECL modeling, we start with the Moody's baseline scenario and then wait to both the upside and downside scenarios depending on market conditions. This quarter, baseline estimates reflected a continued slowdown in the economy, the elevated interest rate environment and meaningful reduction in real estate values, all of which impacted our allowance levels.  As we have now begun to see our baseline forecast more closely aligned to the downside scenario, we adjusted our scenario weighting this quarter given that our baseline reserves now incorporate more recessionary risks. Our current weighting is 30% to the upside, 30% to the baseline and 40% to the downside, reflecting a 10% shift between the downside weighting and the baseline weighting from the previous quarter.  The ACL increased by $40 million over the third quarter, now totaling $922 million, or 1.3% of total loans. We did have a net reserve build in the fourth quarter and are operating our company with the expectation for a mild recession in 2023. Our reserve build for the quarter was due to the net growth in loans, an increase in specific reserves on individually evaluated loans, as well as a slightly more negative macroeconomic outlook than in the prior quarter. These negative impacts were partially offset by a decline related to a mix shift during the quarter to portfolios with lower reserve rates. The ACL provided 9.3 years coverage of fourth quarter net charge-off on a portfolio with a weighted average life of approximately 3.5 years. Turning to Page 28, our capital position remains strong with all ratios above or in the upper end of our target ranges. At the end of the fourth quarter, our CET 1 ratio was 10.08% and our total risk-based capital ratio was 13.18%. The 29 basis points decline in our CET ratio was primarily the result of our share repurchase activity, which concluded in October. Net income growth continued to outpace loan-driven risk weighted asset growth and a decrease in CET 1 helped to optimize our capital ratios closer to our target ranges, whereas before our share repurchase plan, we were well above them.  As Frank mentioned in his comments, we plan to pursue another share repurchase plan in the second half of 2023. I feel confident in our ability to execute on this plan while remaining within our target capital ranges. During the fourth quarter, tangible book value per share increased modestly due to strong earnings performance, which more than offset the impact of AOCI in the share repurchase plan.  Turning to Page 29, we summarize our BOLI surrender strategy as well as with its financial benefits. Much of our investment activity during the fourth quarter was a result of this decision. And while this resulted in a $55 million tax charge in the fourth quarter, we anticipate the payback on the strategy to be approximately two years.  This is in line with our long-term view of the business and emphasis on driving tangible book value growth. We were able to pre-invest the additional liquidity and high yielding investments which should help to meaningfully increase our investment portfolio yield in the first quarter of 2023. The impacts from this surrender are reflected in our financial outlook that I will share next. Turning to Page 31, I will conclude by discussing our financial outlook for the first quarter and full year 2023. The first column is our fourth quarter 2022 results. The numbers for non-interest income expense are adjusted for notable items. Column two provides our guidance for the first quarter of 2023 and column three for the full year. There are a lot of variables that can impact this projection, and this guidance continues to assume recessionary impacts are mild.  Okay. For loans, during the fourth quarter, loans grew an annualized rate of 5.6%, down from the high double digit percentage growth rate in the second and third quarters. We expect flat to low single digit percentage annualized loan growth in the first quarter, as the absolute rate environment puts downward pressure on customers' lending appetite and given seasonal patterns typically witnessed during this period.  For the full year, we believe the mid single digit percentage growth in the fourth quarter is more indicative of where it will be for the full year 2023. While the absolute rate environment and economic uncertainty is tempering our clients' appetite to borrow in some segments, we still have strong pipelines in many of our core areas, and coupled with low rates of prepayment, this will lead us to mid single digit loan growth in 2023.  We think loan growth will be driven by continued momentum in business and commercial lending in the branch network. Our middle market business due to continued additions to our sales force, continued expansion of our wealth business through adding bankers and expanded presence outside of the Carolinas market and further growth both in our industry verticals and business capital segments.  Offsetting this growth, we do expect to see continued declines in real estate finance, as the client appetite to borrow is diminished in the current rate environment and we remain selective on the terms to extend new credit. We do acknowledge that uncertainty around the external environment, especially regarding economic risk and the pace of continued interest rate hikes, could cause actual growth rates to deviate from our expectations.  Moving on to deposits, during the fourth quarter, we actively took steps to curb some of the higher price deposit attrition we experienced in the second and third quarters and successfully grew balance in the fourth quarter at an annualized rate of over 8% led by the Direct Bank. Our expectation for the first quarter is high single digit annualized percentage growth based upon momentum in our Direct Bank and the seasonality in both our branch network and homeowners association banking business.  Our expectation is that this heightened growth in the first quarter will enable us to pay down some of the outstanding FHLB advances we currently have on the balance sheet. On the full year, we expect mid single digits percentage growth with non-interest-bearing growth also in mid single digits. While the high interest rate environment is a headwind here, we believe the client acquisition and our relationship-based approach that emphasizes no loan alone [ph] will help drive our deposit growth in 2023.  From an interest rate perspective, our outlook assumes that rates follow the implied forward curve. We forecast two interest rate hikes in the first quarter of 2023 and one in the second, with the Fed funds rate peaking at a range of 5% to 5.25%. In the back half of the year, we forecast two 25 basis points reductions in the Fed funds rate ending the year at a range of 4.5% to 4.75%. The expected timing of the cut leads to a reduction in the inversion of the yield curve in the back half of '23 which helps moderate some of the pressure on net interest margin.  Now on the net interest income, for the first quarter, we expect flat to a slightly negative annualized percentage decline compared to the fourth quarter primarily on reduced day count. We expect net interest margin to be stable relative to the fourth quarter. On a full year basis, we expect net interest margin to be stable to modestly increasing and year-over-year net interest income growth to be in the mid teens percentage growth range largely on the heels of improvement that we achieved in 2022.  Our forecast includes some lagged pricing impact on deposits and we project our cumulative deposit beta will increase from 14% to 22% in the first quarter. However, our variable loan portfolio will help temper the impact of increased deposit costs. And throughout 2023, we expect to benefit from the large favorable gap between new production yields and existing book yields on fixed rate loans and investments. This continued repricing of fixed rate loans and investments will help us achieve moderate margin expansion starting in the second quarter and in the back half of 2023. However, it's important to point out that most of the benefits of margin expansion are behind us.  The net interest income outlook remains uncertain and changes to our interest rate assumptions could have meaningful impacts to deposit product and pricing decisions as well as customer behavior and competitive dynamics. While we don't expect meaningful disintermediation of our non-interest-bearing account, it's something we will continue to monitor.  From a credit loss perspective, we are not seeing broad concerning trends in our portfolio with the stress related to a few smaller portfolios that I mentioned earlier. We are actively monitoring these portfolios and have taken proactive steps to limit our exposure. We do expect net charge-offs to continue to uptick in the next quarter in the range of 15 to 25 basis points and begin to return to more historical levels. For the full year 2023, we expect net charge-offs in the 20 to 30 basis points range. We continue to expect strong credit performance in our general bank segment and in many areas of our commercial segment and again have not seen signs of deterioration broadly.  On the non-interest income compared to the fourth quarter, we expect flat to low single digits annualized percentage decline, primarily due to the reduction in BOLI income and seasonal factoring declines being partially offset by continued growth in our wealth and payments lines of business. In terms of full 2023 guidance, we expect flat to low single digit percentage growth. While we project mid to high single digit growth in net operating lease income for the full year, we do expect a slight quarterly decline in the first quarter based upon the lower maintenance expense in the fourth quarter of '22.  We expect continued momentum in our wealth and payments businesses as a result of organic growth which we believe will be offset by the year-over-year impact of lower service charges, the reduction in BOLI income and a decline in factory commissions resulting from slower consumer demand. After the full year impact of NSF, OD changes and the BOLI reduction, we will project closer to mid single digit percentage growth in non-interest income. Moving to non-interest expense, we expect mid single digit annualized growth in the first quarter. We expect a slight increase in our efficiency ratio during the quarter primarily due to seasonal employee benefit increases. Looking forward, we expect to continue to feel the pressures of inflation especially as it relates to wages, professional services, and contract costs. Despite this, we feel confident in our ability to maintain our efficiency ratio in the low to mid 50s in the coming quarters, as we remove an estimated $50 million out of our cost base helping to neutralize natural non-interest expense growth. We expect the remaining cost base to be stacked towards the back end of 2023 and will have a more pronounced impact on 2024.  All said, we expect mid single digits percentage growth in adjusted non-interest expense in 2023. The expense growth will be led by inflationary factors in salaries and wages, the increasing depreciation impact from the closeout of many strategic and optimization projects, higher marketing costs for the Direct Bank, the impact of the industry-wide increase in FDIC assessment rates and higher marketing costs in the Direct Bank, all partially being offset by the cost saves.  Without the change in FDIC expense and the impact of the Direct Bank increase in marketing expense, we expect expense growth to be at the low single digit percentage range in 2023. And finally, on the income taxes, we expect our corporate tax rate to be in the range of 24.5% to 25% for the first quarter and the full year '23, which is a slight increase over previous guidance due to the surrender of the BOLI policies. In closing, we are pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results in 2022. As Frank mentioned in his comments, we remain confident in our ability to grow profitably and deliver on our commitments. We are positioned to perform well in a broad range of economic scenarios given our capital and liquidity positions, our talented associates, focused on our customers, our diverse business mix, and strong risk management culture.  With that, I will turn it over to the operator for instructions for the Q&A portion of the call. It was concentrated in large loans. I'm going to let Marisa give a little color on all that. Marisa, are you on the line? Brady, I would say that range is still relevant that we would guide towards the lower end of that range. Brady, not really. Our capital planning process is ongoing, but really comes to a head in the first quarter. So we will align the share repurchase with that capital plan and our capital actions and our submission to our regulators of that plan. So it's really that timing dictates the ultimate timing of the share repurchase plan. So we do not anticipate starting that prior to the second half of the year. That is absolutely correct. But I would say modestly higher. Right now, if you just look at new loan yields that are coming on, our new loans are coming on the books between 5.5% and 6%. The marginal cost of our deposits when you consider the various deposits that we have out there, we're savings money markets in the 350 range. So spreads 254 [ph], so spreads are around 200 basis points. Tom, do you have anything you'd like to add to that? But in that dynamic, the inversion of the yield curve remains a challenge. Yes. I think if you look at just mix of deposits, we are forecasting non-interest-bearing to remain consistent as a percentage of total deposits. And I would just anchor back to our go-to-market strategy, the no loan alone strategy always has emphasized growing non-interest-bearing deposits and we've been able to do that through various rate cycles. We will acknowledge that quantitative tightening and potential disintermediation can be headwinds there. But we feel like a 5% growth goal there is achievable and reasonable. Brian, look, just comparing the previous guidance that we gave in the third quarter to the current guidance, we have increased our deposit growth from low to mid single digits to mid single digits growth. We have changed our non-interest income from low single digit growth to flat to low single digit growth. We have increased our non-interest expense guidance from low to mid single to mid single digit growth. So with all that, when you total that up and run it through the model, it just puts us at the lower -- it leaves us within that range of 95 to 100 that puts us on the lower end, and it obviously does not incorporate share repurchases in the second half of the year. So I'll say all that is a lot of moving parts. Yes, that represents 18% of our deposit beta. If you look at the branch network, we did have a mix of lower beta and moderate beta, that's 71% of deposits. So those two channels are around 90%. So the branch network really smooth that beta out, lowers it in total. You're talking about 92% of the -- 18%. Yes, I think it's -- but not significantly. If you look at sort of where we're projecting things to shake out, I think that the Direct Bank might increase marginally, maybe by a percentage point or two, but we anticipate that the branch network is going to be close to that 70% level going forward. Our low end of CET 1 is 9% and that's consistent with prior quarter, and we don't anticipate a change there. You're close. Yes, that's very close. 9 to 10 is the range for CET 1. It's 55% fixed, 45% variable. Well said."

But the last one is certainly at the very end of the year, so very minimal impact on '23 for that one. Brian, this is Elliot Howard. I think we would view it as positive. We look at 5.5% to 6% pricing. Specifically in the branch network, we're a lot more into fixed. Current yield on that portfolio is a little less than 4%. So we've got a pretty favorable gap when we look at that. Some of the fixed repricing will kind of be a win that are back in the second half of 2023. That's right. And that's where the pricing differential -- I mean variable pretty much prices to [indiscernible] moves up and down with the variable rate index."

            "name": "Frank Holding",
            "content": "Thank you, Deanna, and good morning to everyone. We appreciate all of you joining us today. And I'll make some comments about the year and then update you on our 2023 strategic priorities. And then I'll turn it over to Craig Nix to highlight our financial results for the fourth quarter and the outlook for 2023.  Starting on Page 5, 2022 was a great year for First Citizens. In addition to the completion of our merger, we delivered solid financial results marked by strong top line growth, low credit losses and well controlled expenses. We were pleased with the performance of our lines of business, achieving robust loan growth in both the general and commercial banks.  And despite a challenging year for deposits driven by unprecedented quantitative tightening, we experienced modest growth in non-interest checking accounts and only a slight decline in deposits during the year. Our merger integration is substantially complete. And we're now focused on creating positive operating leverage by growing revenues and optimizing our operations. We remain on track to achieve our $250 million cost savings goal.  During the third quarter, we announced a share repurchase plan to optimize our capital levels, and we completed the plan early in the fourth quarter, repurchasing 1.5 million Class A common shares. This plan allowed us to return excess capital to our shareholders while exceeding our CET 1 target, and is expected to be approximately 10% accretive to earnings per share in 2023. Our capital position remains strong relative to our risk profile. And we believe that we will have the ability to resume share buybacks in the second half of this year.  From a profitability standpoint, we finished right in line with our guidance and are pleased with our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year. Strong loan growth and rising interest rates drove a 20% increase in net interest income over the prior year. This strong margin growth combined with solid non-interest income growth and well controlled expenses drove a year-over-year 45.5% increase in pre-provision net revenue.  Earning asset yields increased by 68 basis points. And we were able to manage rising deposit costs despite a challenging and competitive environment. The pace of rate hikes did begin to put pressure on margin as we entered the fourth quarter. During my tenure at First Citizens, we've been through several tightening cycles and we've always grown and prospered through them. Looking at non-interest income, our fee income producing lines of business provided continued support to our net revenue led by growth in rental income on operating lease assets, as our rail portfolio saw increased utilization and positive momentum from higher lease rates. We also saw growth in areas such as wealth and card despite a challenging market environment for wealth. You'll remember that we announced the elimination of certain NSF and OD charges that took place in the second half of 2022 reducing deposit service charge income. But we've had strong growth in commercial service charges to help offset some of this NSF, OD impact. Despite inflationary headwinds, we maintain prudent expense discipline which resulted in positive operating leverage for the full year, as well as an improvement in our efficiency ratio, which we expect to maintain in the low to mid 50s on an annualized basis moving forward.  We're pleased with the growth in loans we saw in 2022 with total loans increasing by $5.6 billion, or 8.5% over year end 2021. We saw growth in the general bank and within the commercial bank and industry verticals and business capital. While we experienced an increase in non-accrual loans in the fourth quarter, net charge-offs remained well below historic norms. Overall, credit quality remains strong and we are not seeing broad based signs of stress in our loan portfolio.  Now turning to Page 6, I'll quickly highlight a few of our strategic priorities moving forward. Investing in our core businesses to achieve profitable organic growth. We're pleased with the momentum in many of our core lines of business, including our branch network, wealth, business capital, the industry verticals and middle market banking. And we're going to continue to add revenue producers and enhance our capabilities in these areas to remain competitive and expand market share.  Optimize capital and focus on core deposit growth. A key foundation to our strategy is our focus on full long-term banking relationships, which in addition to making loans includes the deposit relationship. Our goal is to fund earning assets with low cost stable deposits, and this remains a significant component of our go-to-market strategy.  In terms of capital allocation, our number one priority is focus on our customers. But to the extent we have excess capital after funding internal growth, our strategy is to redeploy it into share repurchases at attractive prices.  A focus on talent acquisition and retention. We're going to continue to be proactive in adding talent to support our continued growth. In addition to our focus on talent and our associates, we will remain focused on our customers to make sure we're aligning our products and services across all segments in ways that meet their financial needs.  As we move into 2023, we will continue to work on distributing the capabilities we have as a firm across our lines of business more broadly, which will help create additional revenue synergies as clients have access to a wider variety of products.  Capitalize on the benefits of shifting from merger integration to operating as a combined company to boost our operating leverage. While we are in line to achieve our cost savings goals, we're going to continue to focus on further optimization and efficiency as we believe there is an opportunity to build upon the efficiency we have recognized to date. And we will continue to assess processes and capitalize on revenue synergies and opportunities.  Manage risk effectively. We're committed to strong risk management and regulatory compliance. In 2023, we will continue to build out and execute on our new regulatory capabilities to ensure we meet the requirements of the large financial institutions framework. We have made great progress on our readiness to comply with heightened regulatory standards, and we worked hard to develop the capabilities and planning needed to ultimately satisfy the regulatory standards. In the coming year, we will be intently focused on executing upon these plans.  To conclude, while we acknowledge certain concerns in the broader economy, we enter 2023 with solid capital and liquidity positions, and are well positioned to continue to build customer relationships and grow our balance sheet profitably. We will remain focused on our client-focused model and committed to delivering solid results regardless of the market conditions. I want to thank our associates across the company for working so hard to make us successful in our transformation to a large financial institution and at the same time supporting our shareholders, customers and communities.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Craig Nix. Good morning. Thank you. Stephen, we're not expecting any changes in the approval or the process that we'll go through. And we're also assessing it the same way that we did last year, so no changes at all in any of that. Thank you. Sorry, were you referring to business -- commercial business or commercial account activity there? I didn't quite catch the question. Yes. The majority of the beta, as Craig covered sort of the beta categories, where we see the highest beta is obviously in the direct channel. It's a lower fixed cost channel, but higher variables, higher interest expense there. So that is really sort of the main driver for the overall beta for us. Thank you. Thank you, Brian."

            "content": "I am. Good morning. The increase in non-accruals was specifically a handful -- less than a handful of names, so a couple of large names; commercial bank, legacy CIT real estate portfolio, Class B office to drill it down as close as I can. The overall office portfolio in our non-owner occupied or investor commercial real estate is about 2.5 billion, 2.6 billion. It's equally split between the commercial bank and the general bank. The general bank is not seeing any deterioration in that office portfolio. It's a very granular portfolio, much more community based. And the few larger loans that are in the general bank typically have a very strong investment grade credit tenant. So the office portfolio in commercial is about 1.3 billion. It's centered in repositioned bridge. That means it's relatively short tenured. And it is in Class B office. It's broad based in terms of geographies. And obviously as things move into non-accrual, the credit and special assets team evaluate those four impairments. And we feel comfortable that we've done our job in terms of determining where we need specific reserves. But it is, obviously as Craig mentioned, a portfolio that we're watching closely. We are not in that business originating new office. That's correct. And as I said, the 1.3 is the commercial bank portfolio that has the Class B office that we've been referring to."

We hope this call will be informative and give you a sense of the success we enjoyed through the third quarter and the path we\u2019re on moving forward. We announced another quarter of solid financial results this morning, and I\u2019m confident about both our trajectory moving forward and our ability to continue delivering long-term shareholder value. While we face some economic headwinds and the potential for a recession, we\u2019ve not seen meaningful signs of stress in our credit portfolio to date. We are encouraged by the resiliency of our clients in the face of elevated inflation and rising interest rates. During the quarter, loan growth momentum continued and was broad across our lines of business. The strong quality loan growth we experienced this quarter in tandem with the positive asset re-pricing we have experienced in the rising rate environment helped produce another quarter of strong net interest income growth and positive operating leverage. Starting on Page 5, I\u2019ll highlight the 10 takeaways for the quarter and Craig will take a deeper look at our third quarter results and prospects moving forward in the next sessions of this presentation. First, we are pleased to announce that we have repurchased 99.4% of the 1.5 million shares of Class A common stock authorized by our Board for repurchase as of the market close yesterday. The 1.5 million shares represents approximately 10% of the Class A common shares or 9.4% of the total common shares outstanding prior to the repurchase. This repurchase program allowed us to return excess capital to our shareholders and set the foundation to deliver even stronger returns in the coming quarters, given a more optimal capital level. The second one, we continue to focus on merger optimization efforts and remain confident that we will achieve our cost savings goal of $250 million. We estimate that we will come in slightly below our merger cost estimate of $445 million. Number three, pre-provision net revenue continued to be a bright spot, growing by 21.3% over the second quarter indicative of significant margin expansion, solid fee income growth generation and good expense management. Fourth, net interest margin expanded by 36 basis points during the quarter due to higher interest rates and strong loan growth, only partially offset by higher funding cost and borrowings. Five, expense management continues to be a focus, and we achieved an efficiency ratio during the quarter of 53%. We\u2019re especially pleased with our efficiency ratio given the inflationary headwinds, which are impacting the industry and market as a whole. Six, for the second consecutive quarter, we\u2019ve had a provision build related to deterioration in CECL macroeconomic forecast in addition to maintenance reserves to cover loan growth and net charge-offs. Seven, despite a larger provision expense compared to last quarter, credit quality remains excellent. The net charge-off ratio during the quarter remained below non-stressed historical averages and decreased compared to the linked quarter. Further, our non-accrual ratio declined during the quarter. We remain pleased with our loan portfolio performance and as covered in detail on last quarter\u2019s call, our portfolios are underwritten to endure times of economic stress. With that said, we continue to monitor the potential impacts of higher rates, inflation, a possible recession and geopolitical instability on our loan portfolio. Eight, loans grew at an annualized rate of 12% during the quarter, marking another strong quarter. Loan growth was broad in both commercial and the general business bank \u2013 General Bank business segments and was an output of the long-term business development efforts from our lenders and our continued emphasis on adding staff in areas that can support quality growth. Nine, while we continue to see a decline in total deposits, we were pleased that the rate of decline was lower than in the prior quarter. As expected, we experienced further attrition in higher-cost acquired money market deposits. The decline was partially offset by growth in our direct bank as we look to remain competitive in the online space. Ten, as a result of strong loan growth and reduced deposits, we did add $3.9 billion in wholesale borrowings during the quarter. Despite the change in our funding mix, we feel good about our current and pro forma liquidity position. Turning to Page 6. We provide more detail on our share repurchase plan progress to date. We were able to repurchase shares faster than anticipated, allowing us to quickly rightsize our capital closer to the target operating range. We estimate that the repurchases will be accretive to 2023 EPS by approximately 10%. Further, while there is initial dilution to TBV in the third quarter of $15.75 we estimate this will be earned back in less than three years. For now, we are pausing our repurchase plan as we monitor loan growth and the macroeconomic environment moving forward. We plan to submit our capital plan in the second quarter of 2023. After consideration of that plan, it will be our intent to return any excess capital over our internal targets to shareholders in the form of share repurchases beginning in the second half of next year. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Craig to expand on our third quarter financial results and share our financial outlook moving forward. Craig?\nCraig Nix: Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Page 8. I am happy to report GAAP net income of $315 million or $19.25 per common share, yielding an annualized ROE of 12.49% and an ROA of 1.16%. On an adjusted basis, net income was $338 million or $20.77 per common share, yielding an annualized ROE of 13.47% and an ROA of 1.24%. Comparable EPS, ROE and ROTCE shown on this page for prior periods, our First Citizens BancShares on a stand-alone basis. ROA, PPNR ROA and NIM and the net charge-off ratio are presented as if the companies were combined during the historical periods. I\u2019ll dive a little deeper into these components in a moment as we look at the underlying trends that produce our results. Continuing on to Page 9, we provide two condensed income statement, the one at the top representing our reported GAAP results and the one at the bottom, supplementing those results showing net income adjusted for notable items. Both income statements are presented as if FCB and CIT reemerge during the historical periods. The section in the middle of the page summarizes the impact of notable items to derive the adjusted results from the reported results. The most significant notable items were $139 million and depreciation and maintenance expense on operating leases as well as $33 million in merger-related expenses. Page 11 provides a detailed listing of the notable items affecting the quarter along with their impact on net income and diluted earnings per share. I will now focus on the adjusted results at the bottom of the page. Pre-provision net revenue increased by $89 million or 21.3% over the linked quarter and by $224 million or 79.4% over the comparable quarter a year ago. The increase for both periods was driven by positive operating leverage as net revenues grew at a faster pace than expenses. Net income available to common shareholders was $326 million for the quarter, up from $270 million in the second quarter and $262 million in the third quarter of the prior year. The increase during the linked quarter was due to an increase in pre-provision net revenue and lower preferred dividends, partially offset by an increase in provision for credit losses. The increase compared to the same quarter a year ago was due to higher pre-provision net revenue, partially offset by higher preferred dividends and increase in provision for credit losses. Page 10 provides a view of our year-to-date results for your reference. Page 11 provides detail with respect to notable items for the relevant quarterly and year-to-date periods. During the third quarter, these adjustments had a minimal net impact adding $1.52 to GAAP EPS. Turning to Page 12. Net interest income totaled $795 million during the quarter, up 13.6% over the second quarter. Interest income increased by $149 million over the linked quarter due to loan growth and a higher yield on earning assets. Interest expense increased by $54 million due to higher funding costs as the rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased by 24 basis points, and we added wholesale borrowings to cover the decline in deposits since the end of the first quarter. An analysis of the comparable quarter and year-to-date periods is provided at the bottom of the slide for your reference. Turning to Page 13. We highlight the drivers of the 36 basis points and 87 basis points margin expansion from the linked and comparable prior quarters, respectively. I will focus my comments on the change during the linked quarter where the 36 basis points margin expansion was due to a higher yield on earning assets and loan growth, partially offset by a higher cost of interest-bearing deposits and the impact of additional borrowings. While funding costs increased, partially offsetting some of the asset re-pricing during the quarter, we believe we are well-positioned to increase our net interest margin over the coming quarters, albeit at a slower pace than this year. There will be some catch-up in deposit re-pricing over the next few quarters amidst higher interest rates and strong industry competition for funding. Nevertheless, we believe the strength of our balance sheet will enable us to weather these headwinds favorably, especially in light of continued momentum we expect on increasing asset yields. Turning to Page 14. The line graph on the left-hand side of the page indicate we continue to be asset sensitive, albeit slightly less than in prior quarters. We had and will continue to take a measured approach to interest in market rate risk management to position our balance sheet to benefit from higher interest rates while at the same time providing downside protection against lower interest rates. We estimate that a 100 basis points shock in rates would increase net interest income by 3.4% and a 100 basis point ramp, which increased by 1.5% over the next 12 months. The main drivers of our asset sensitivity are our variable rate loan portfolio, which represents 45% of total loans, our cash position and expected modest deposit betas driven by our strong core deposit base. We estimate our full-cycle deposit beta at 25%, which is aligned with our historical experience. Turning to Page 15. We provided some additional information on deposit beta. In terms of our deposit base, 59% of our deposits exhibit lower betas and 41% exhibit mid to higher beta. Our cumulative beta through the third quarter was 6%. We expect the cumulative beta to be 14% at year-end as our stand-alone fourth quarter deposit beta is estimated to be 34%. Again, over the interest rate hiking cycle, we forecast our beta to be approximately 25%. Turning to Page 16. I will focus my comments on the increase in non-interest income from the linked quarter analysis of the comparable prior year quarter and year-to-date periods, for non-interest income increased by 20% and 16%, respectively, is presented for your reference. Non-interest income increased by $6 million over the linked quarter, with core increasing by $5 million. $5 million increase was primarily due to higher capital markets income and an increase in rental income on operating leases, partially offset by a decline in service charges on deposit accounts as the impact of our recent changes to OD/NSF fees took effect. The higher net rental income on operating leases was due to increased gross rental income on favorable re-pricing rate offsetting combined higher depreciation and maintenance expense. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect non-interest income to be flat to slightly down due primarily to elevated capital market fees in the third quarter. Looking into 2023, we see continued momentum in our wealth and payments businesses as a result of organic growth, offsetting the full year-over-year impact of service charges. While we expect gross rental income on operating leases to continue to increase on the heels of strong utilization and favorable car re-pricing rate. We do anticipate year-over-year net operating lease income to be flatter due to the timing of more recertification costs scheduled in 2023 as well as the impact of inflation on labor and car repairs. We also see slight pressure on factoring commissions as potential consumer demand slows. As of the full year impact of NSF/OD changes, we would project mid-single digit percentage growth of longest income in 2023. However, with the impact of NSF/OD changes, we expect low-single digit percentage growth. Turning to Page 17. Linked quarter non-interest expense increased by $12 million, $11 million of which was core. The $11 million increase was primarily driven by a $10 million increase in personnel expense. This is due to net staff additions, revenue-related incentive compensation, lease increases from inflationary pressures, especially as it relates to new hires as well as higher temporary personnel costs. The net staff additions are primarily related to building out teams to support our move to large bank compliance as well as the backfill vacancy. The other primary driver was a $6 million increase in marketing expenses related to direct bank efforts to maintain and attract new deposit balances. These were partially offset by decreases in FDIC insurance and professional fees. We are pleased that our efficiency ratio improved again during the quarter, dropping to 53.34%. We feel that our continued recognition of cost saves is helping maintain expense growth in the low-single digits that otherwise would be in the range of 5% to 6%, given inflation headwind. Looking forward, we expect to continue to feel the pressures of inflation, especially as it relates to wages, professional service and contract call. Despite this, we feel confident in our ability to maintain our efficiency ratio in the lower 50s in the coming quarters as we removed another estimated $70 million out of our cost base helping to neutralize natural non-interest expense growth that exclusive of merger cost saves would be closer to mid-single-digit range for this year. Looking to 2023, we expect a low to mid-single-digit percentage increase in adjusted non-interest expense year-over-year driven mainly by inflationary pressures in salaries and wages, higher revenue-related incentives. The across the industry increase in FDIC assessment rates, higher marketing costs in the direct bank, all being partially offset by remaining cost saves. We are on track to recognize $200 million in cost saves by the end of 2022 and the full $250 million by the end of 2023. Page 18 outlines our non-interest income and expense composition, which remained relatively stable compared to the prior quarter with the exception of a decline in deposit service charges from the NSF OD exchanges I referenced earlier. Page 19 shows balance sheet highlights and key ratios. I will cover the significant components on subsequent pages of the deck. Turning to Page 20. We had another quarter of strong loan growth with loans increasing by $2.1 billion over the linked quarter or 12% on an annualized basis as our teams continue to generate production above target levels and we benefit from reduced prepayments due to the higher interest rate environment. Loan growth for the quarter was broad-based. General Bank loans grew at an annualized rate of 12.8% led by the branch network. Growth was primarily concentrated in business and commercial loans. Elsewhere, while overall mortgage loan production was down, we had growth in mortgage loans as we have originated more ARM products that we keep on the balance sheet. Our mortgage pipelines are continuing to slow given the rate environment and towards the end of the third quarter, over 90% of our funded mortgage loan volume was for purchases compared to an approximate 50-50 split at the same time last year. The commercial bank also saw further positive momentum, posting an annualized growth rate of 11.7%, led by our industry verticals and business capital, as well as seasonal growth in our factoring business as retail businesses begin to ramp inventory for the holiday season. In our industry verticals, we continue to see strong production in energy, health care, in tech, media and telecom. In Business Capital, origination in the Technology segment is strong, and we are seeing some quarter-over-quarter improvement in the office imaging space. On a year-over-year basis, loans increased $3.8 billion or about 5.8%, primarily due to increases for similar reasons I just discussed. We are very pleased with the execution of our sales teams following the merger this year, and the strong performance has been spread across many business lines. Moving forward, we feel positive about our loan growth prospects. However, we do expect loan growth to moderate to mid to high single-digit percentage point in the fourth quarter as the absolute rate environment puts downward pressure on customers\u2019 lending appetite. We anticipate mid-single-digit percentage points increase in loans for the full year 2023, driven by continued momentum in our business and commercial lending and the branch network increased hiring and expansion of our middle market business, continued expansion of our wealth business through adding bankers that expanded presence outside of the Carolinas market and further growth in both our industry vertical and Business Capital segment. We do acknowledge that uncertainty around the external environment, especially with regard to economic risk and cost actual growth rates to deviate from our expectations. Page 21 shows our loan proposition by type and segment. Composition has not deviated significantly from the second quarter. Turning to Page 22. Deposits declined by $1.8 billion or 7.9% on an annualized basis from the linked quarter. The main driver of the decline was a $1.8 billion decline in interest-bearing deposits due to reductions in money market and checking the interest deposits as we continue to see more rate-sensitive customers and our acquired branches begin to move funds in response to continued rate increases. Despite the decrease in interest-bearing deposits, we are pleased that non-interest bearing deposits grew by $11 million since the end of the second quarter. Pro tier within the branch network, which we attributed a continued emphasis on developing client relationships, which includes not only fulfilling our clients\u2019 lending needs, but also focuses on depository and other banking service needs. Our branch network remains dedicated to its strategy to develop full client relationships and we believe this strategy will continue to help us increase non-interest bearing deposits in the coming quarters despite a challenging funding environment. Additionally, we were encouraged to see growth in our direct bank as we have worked to increase balances in the third quarter to help fund our strong loan growth. We do anticipate continued growth in the direct bank in the fourth quarter to help support loan growth. Our cost of deposits increased by 16 basis points during the quarter to 35 basis points. The increase is representative of the impact from the Fed rate hikes and our need to raise rates to stay competitive with IPOs. We do remain guarded on the outlook for absolute deposit growth for the remainder of 2022 as the interest rate environment continues to evolve and the Fed impact liquidity in the system by deleveraging its balance sheet. However, we do expect mid-single-digit percentage growth in deposits in the fourth quarter as we have raised our sheet rates and are offering attractive money market and CD specials in our markets. In addition, we plan to add broker deposits during the quarter. For your reference, we have included high graphs on Page 23 showing deposit composition by type and segment. Turning to Page 24. Our balance sheet continues to be funded predominantly by deposits, representing over 91% of our funding base. As Frank mentioned in his comments, we\u2019ll note an increase in FHLB borrowings this quarter, which is reflective of our continued strong loan growth and deposit decline. We believe the concentration metrics will begin to flatten as our deposit balances begin to modestly increase in the fourth quarter. I would like to point out that the FHLB borrowings that we added are variable rate and provide quarterly call features, allowing us the flexibility to remove this funding source as we work to further grow deposits in future quarters. Continuing to Page 25, you\u2019ll see that our credit quality continues to be very strong. The net charge-off ratio for the quarter remained at historic lows at 10 basis points and was down 3 basis points from the linked quarter. Provision for credit losses increased by $18 million to $59 million this quarter, primarily as a result of deterioration in CECL macroeconomic scenarios, only partially offset by improving credit quality and portfolio mix. We also provided maintenance reserves for loan growth and to cover net charge-offs. Moving to the bottom of the page. The non-accrual loan ratio declined again, this will over to 0.65% from 0.76% in the prior quarter and from 0.86% in the same quarter in the prior year. Despite the provision build, the ACL ratio remained flat at 1.26% and covering quarterly net charge-offs 12.6 times and the five-quarter rolling average 15.8 times. Moving on to Page 26, we provide a roll forward of the ACL from the linked quarter. The ACL was up $32 million to $882 million. Net charge-offs totaled $18 million during the quarter, and portfolio mix had the impact of reducing the ACL by $7 million. While the CECL macroeconomic forecast shows some deterioration, we spend to a $42 million increase in the ACL. Actual performance and credit metrics remain strong, subtracting $5 million from the second quarter ACL. Loan growth added $20 million. Turning to Page 27. Our capital position remains strong with all ratios above or in the upper end of our target ranges. As of the end of the third quarter, our CET1 ratio was 10.37%, and our total risk-based ratio was 13.46%. The 98 basis points decline in our CET1 ratio is primarily the result of our share repurchase activity. Net income growth outpaced the loan-driven risk-weighted asset growth. The decrease in CET1 helped to optimize our capital ratios closer to our target range, whereas before our repurchase \u2013 share repurchase plan, we were well above the range. During the third quarter, tangible book value per share declined modestly due to negative AOCI adjustment and the impact of the share repurchases not being completely offset by strong earnings. Turning to Page 29. I will conclude by discussing our financial outlook for the fourth quarter of 2022 and 2023 fiscal year. On Page 29, the first column with our third quarter 2022 results. The numbers for non-interest income and expense are adjusted for notable items. Column 2 provides our guidance for the fourth quarter and Column 3 for the full year 2022. Column 4 is our initial updated look at 2023 based upon our current forecast and projections. There are a lot of variables that could impact this projection, and this guidance assumes any type of recessionary impact are mild. From a loan growth perspective, we expect a mid to high single-digit percentage range in the fourth quarter and a mid-single-digit percentage growth range in 2023. We saw a slight slowdown in loan growth in the third quarter compared to the second, while still eclipsing 10% annualized growth. We expect this rate of increase to moderate due to the increasing rate environment and in fact, have seen some pipelines begin to slow in areas such as mortgage and real estate finance. On deposits, we are actively taking steps to curb some of the higher-priced deposit attrition we have seen in the past two quarters. Our expectation for the fourth quarter is mid-single-digit percentage growth, bolstered by continued growth from our branch network, in addition to a focus on adding balances in our direct bank through competitive product offering as well as increasing our broker deposit position. For 2023, we expect low to mid-single-digit percentage growth as non-interest bearing and time deposits grow, while money market balances remained flat. We are committed to taking the steps necessary to grow our deposit base to support loan growth, even in the face of rising deposit cost pressure. For net charge-offs, we expect a gradual return to pre-pandemic non-stress levels but have not seen any meaningful strength in our portfolios to this point. We expect net charge-offs in the range of 15 to 25 basis points in the fourth quarter and in the 20 to 30 basis points range for 2023. The increase in our net charge-off projection is not due to any apparent stress in our portfolios in present time. Rather, we think the impact of inflation and rising rates coupled with mild recessionary pressures may result in our losses returning to more historic levels, which on a combined basis are close to 25 to 30 basis points. Our current forecast assumes that the Fed will raise rates by another 125 basis points in the fourth quarter for an ending Fed funds effective range of 4.25% to 4.5% by year-end. Our expectation for 2023 is a rate remained flat for the duration of the year with the first rate cut not anticipated until early 2024. For net interest income, we expect low single-digit percentage growth in the fourth quarter and a generally flat margin. For the full year 2023, we expect net interest in from growth in the mid-teens percentage range, largely on the heels of margin expansion that has occurred in the second half of 2022. 2023, from a margin perspective, we expect a gradual expansion from the level seen in the third quarter of 2022. While we will continue to see interest income expansion from earning asset repricing upwards, there remains a lag on deposit pricing and the momentum from deposits repricing in the fourth quarter 2022 in the first quarter of 2023 will largely offset the increase in asset repricing. As I stated earlier, our cumulative deposit rate at the end of the third quarter was 6% and we expect it to be closer to 35% over the next two quarters, resulting in a cumulative beta as of year-end 2022 of 14% and 25% cumulative over the rate hike cycle. Given that we are currently in unprecedented times as it relates to the velocity of rising rates and the ultimate impact the competition for deposits may have upon pricing, betas could be higher than we were estimating causing actual results to deviate from these expectations. I touched on our non-interest income and expense projections in my earlier comments, so I will not repeat them here. Given that we have completed our share repurchase plan and much has changed since we gave EPS guidance earlier this year, we are updating that guidance here. Even though we intend to resume share repurchases in the second half of 2023, conditions warrant, and our projections hold the EPS estimates do not include any repurchases in 2023. For the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share in the $21 to $23 range, which is in line to slightly above the third quarter. For the full year 2023, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the $95 to $100 range. This does not include the after-tax impact of an estimated $50 million to $60 million merger call, which will take the estimate down to an estimated range of $93 to $98. We feel good about our earnings momentum heading into 2023 despite economic headwinds. We expect to maintain positive operating leverage as the momentum from margin expansion the last two quarters carried over into 2023 and the last leg of our merger synergies helped to reduce the velocity of expense growth impacted by inflation. In closing, we are very pleased with our third quarter results and the hard work put in by our associates to make it happen. We remain confident in our ability to grow and deliver on our commitments as First Citizens is well positioned across a broad range of economic outcomes given our relationship-focused client model, conservative credit culture, diverse business mix, strong capital position and most importantly, our shift from a focus on integration to execution and growth. With that, I will now turn the call back over to the operator for instructions for the Q&A portion of our call.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brady Gailey of KBW. Brady, your line is open. Please proceed.\nBrady Gailey: Thank you. Good morning, guys.\nFrank Holding: Good morning.\nBrady Gailey: Good morning. I wanted to start on the buyback for the back half of next year. If I look at your common equity Tier 1 today, it\u2019s 10.4%. If you include the buybacks that you\u2019ve done so far in October, that takes it down to roughly 10% pro forma. You\u2019ll be growing that ratio back up to almost 11% by mid next year. So as far as potential sizing of the buyback for the back half of next year, I mean, do you think we could see another kind of sizable buyback similar to the one you guys just completed?\nCraig Nix: Brady, if our projections hold, we would contemplate a fairly sizable buyback in the second half of next year. I would just point out that in the fourth quarter and first quarter, we will be operating much closer to our target ranges. And then we begin to \u2013 if our projections hold, we begin to lift out of that in the second quarter of next year.\nBrady Gailey: And Craig, the target range is still I know your range is 9% to 11%, but kind of the real focus is still 10% common equity Tier 1.\nCraig Nix: Yes. And Brady, we dropped that target range to 9% to 10% from 9% to 11% in our capital plan. So the range now for CET1 is 9% to 10%.\nBrady Gailey: Okay. All right. And then as you guys continue to get used to CIT being in the mix are there any \u2013 I know there are several businesses that came over such as factory and railcar and equipment finance. And the other, there were some unique niches in there. Is there any kind of strategic update? Or is there any change in how you guys are thinking about some of those more unique CIT businesses going forward?\nCraig Nix: I\u2019ll let Howard will address that.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Yes. Brady, I would say not really. I think now that certainly, we\u2019re 10 months into the merger being consummated and certainly a lot longer runway than that from point it was announced. I think we\u2019re very pleased with where we are in this business. As I think you look at rail factoring, equipment finance, we\u2019ve got very strong kind of industry positions. I think we\u2019ve been very pleased this year with certainly kind of rail turnaround and where the utilization is. I think factoring, we\u2019ve had good momentum in commissions and then the business capital, we\u2019ve really had strong growth this year and see certainly further room to run there. So I think the subsequent period, everything is going well, and we\u2019ve been able to really retain key good leadership there in those spaces.\nBrady Gailey: Okay. Great. Thanks for the color guys.\nCraig Nix: Thank you, Brady.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Scouten of Piper Sandler. Stephen, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nStephen Scouten: Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I guess, I was wanting to drill down a little bit around the funding expectations moving forward. I know you outlined some expected deposit growth in the fourth quarter and then into 2023. I\u2019m just kind of wondering around the broker deposits, what sort of term you\u2019re thinking about adding there what rates you\u2019re seeing? And then also kind of why it seems like you favor the direct bank acquisition of deposits versus the acquired branches, kind of what the relative benefits are there? Thanks.\nCraig Nix: Let me start with that last point. I don\u2019t think we favor one over the other. It\u2019s just that the direct bank has achieved stronger growth as we move into the fourth quarter. So it\u2019s really not \u2013 there\u2019s no signaling here that we favor one channel over the other. In terms of just \u2013 and I\u2019ll let Tom address the birth of deposit question. But in terms of the \u2013 sort of the funding mix we would anticipate that we gravitate away from wholesale funding back to deposits, that 91% deposits gradually going up to around 94% in 2023. So from a funding mix standpoint, we certainly would rather have more deposits. Although we\u2019re not alarmed by 91%, our liquidity metrics look good, we\u2019re green. We\u2019re still managing to our low liquidity risk appetite. So no real concerns there, but we would see a gradual shift back to deposit. And I\u2019ll let Tom talk a little bit about the strategy around the broker deposits.\nTom Eklund: Yes, sure. So on the brokerage side, I mean, we\u2019re obviously trying to split maturities up to not create future cliffs, where we have maturities sort of bundled in months there. So we\u2019ve used the blended approach. We\u2019ve gone from 12 months, 18 months, 24 months and 36 months here. Start off the quarter and expect to continue that over the coming months, sort of spread those maturities up. We view those broker TDs, although they fall under the deposit category, the sort of a hybrid between sort of the deposit base and the wholesale funding to help with that funding difference between the loan growth and deposit.\nStephen Scouten: Okay. Very helpful. And then just kind of maybe a little bit longer term as you look ahead, starting the CCAR process next year. I\u2019m just kind of wondering where you guys are in that process, level of comfortability there? And will that be the biggest driver, I suppose, on ultimately the size of the share repurchase?\nCraig Nix: Absolutely a factor. It will be wrapped in. Capital planning certainly will be \u2013 we\u2019ll consider whether our capital plan would allow for a repurchase. Again, we think our numbers and capital ratios will bear that out. In terms of CCAR, that\u2019s definitely the most significant change to our capital program as far as being part of the LFI framework and subject to CCAR. We will obviously be sign the capital buffer based on the Federal Reserve bank stress testing our portfolio and support those changes, massive efforts are underway internally and have been for some time. We\u2019ve completed a GAAP assessment of our current practices around capital planning and stress testing. We\u2019ve also completed our annual stress test we got earlier this year, and we feel comfortable about our \u2013 and that\u2019s how we establish our targets. We feel comfortable about those, and we feel confident that we will be able and prepared to meet all regulatory requirements.\nStephen Scouten: Great. Very helpful. Thanks for the color guys and great quarter.\nCraig Nix: Thanks, Stephen.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Foran of Autonomous. Brian, your line is open. Please proceed.\nBrian Foran: Hi, good morning. I appreciate the EPS guide and all your comments about macro uncertainty that go into it. I just want to clarify, it sounds like you\u2019re embedding a very mild recession in there. And then B, any thoughts you can help us with on the size of reserve builds included in that 95 to 100 EPS guide and any thoughts around sensitivity if the economy does better or worse than your base case?\nCraig Nix: Well, Brian, in terms of \u2013 and I\u2019ll talk about the reserve build in terms of provision. I don\u2019t think we contemplate a massive increase in the reserve ratio. But in terms of provision on the increased charge-offs, we would expect around a let\u2019s say, $100 million increases of vision expense next year, which directly correlates to increased charge-offs. Obviously, as it relates to the \u2013 driving the ACL percentage higher. We monitor both internal and external factors and the determination of the ACL internally. We\u2019re looking at our credit quality indicators. Are we seeing pockets of deterioration in our portfolios. Our internal metrics trending up in a bad way. And then all we have in requests for concessions and extensions. And none of that, and Marisa correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but none of that is apparent right now or forecasted into our ACL percentage for provisioning next year. We also really monitor the external environment as part of our ACL process. So at the end of the day, to increase the percentage that would be driven by some specific deterioration beyond what\u2019s already covered in sort of the baseline and downside scenario waving of our ACL. We wait the downside 50%, we wait the baseline to 20 and the \u2013 if the upside is 30 and those upside and downsides represent \u2013 or project 5% are based on an upside about a 5% unemployment rate the downside about 8% and I think we\u2019re some ways off on that. So in terms of projecting right now, we felt like it was prudent to maintain the reserve percentage but also add charge-offs. So and those things sort of fungible what we could add to macroeconomics and now let Craig \u2013 vice versa. Right now is our best yes, where we think we are. So at present time, things look good and any provision deal would be related to macroeconomic deterioration in sort of the Moody\u2019s forecast. I hope that answers the question, long winded, but that\u2019s one that\u2019s probably in terms of variability or in precision in the forecast, it would be provisioned and then obviously, deposit bases.\nBrian Foran: Got it. And just to make sure on tariff rating correctly. So basically, you\u2019re saying you\u2019re building in reserve builds to support loan growth next year but you\u2019re not building in big changes in the allowance to loan ratio beyond that.\nFrank Holding: That\u2019s correct.\nBrian Foran: Okay. Appreciate it and totally hear you on the uncertainty. I think you\u2019re one of the few banks willing to even put your neck out there with an EPS guide. So I appreciate that.\nFrank Holding: Thank you, Brian.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Christopher Marinac of Janney. Christopher, your line is open. Please proceed.\nChristopher Marinac: Hey, thanks. Good morning. And Craig, I\u2019ll start with the kind of similar question that Brian did, which is just to get into just the classified and criticized trends. I mean is there anything sort of signaling anything higher just in terms of the charge-offs guide for Q4 with alone just higher provision next year.\nCraig Nix: In terms of criticized percentage, Class 5 percentage, we really are sort of tracking those trends pre-pandemic or you could say, at CECL adoption. And when you look at those ratios in the fourth quarter of 2019, our criticized percentage was 5.16%. It\u2019s down to 4.91% and has really declined every quarter. And these are combined for CIT and First Citizens for comparability purposes. They turned it down every quarter after hitting a high of 8.28% in the fourth quarter of 2020. And from a classified perspective, at the fourth quarter, we were at 3.35%, hit a high of 5.18%. They also have declined every quarter but remain about 50 basis points over the fourth quarter 2019 at 3.83% and then we look at other credit quality metrics and about eight of nine of them are better than the pre-pandemic/CECL adoption date. So we feel really good about our credit quality trends. Marisa, do you have anything to add to that?\nMarisa Harney: No, that\u2019s absolutely right. All of our metrics have been grinding tighter meaning better, obviously, the pandemic had its impact on those numbers, as Craig indicated, as you see it went up and then back down but we\u2019re very pleased to see our numbers back to that pre-pandemic level. And in terms of what we see coming in, obviously, the totals are going down. We have some concerns not huge and not of an impact nature, but just watch item \u2013 we continue to watch commercial real estate and in particular, office given all of the continued confusion about back to office. And it\u2019s some small, again, very small movement in roll forward from 30- to 60-day delinquencies in our small business leasing business. But again, these are relatively small portfolios. Obviously, what you all and we all look for is the canary in the coal mine. And so far, those are the only areas where we\u2019ve curtailed some originations. We\u2019re not going to be doing new Class B office anytime soon. And we\u2019ve tightened up the buy box around some of our auto decision small business in that space. But each of those portfolios are in the kind of $2 billion range. So not anything that I think would drive those numbers to be materially different than what Craig said.\nChristopher Marinac: Great. Thank you for all the background that\u2019s really helpful. And then, Craig, just to go back to the funding comment you made earlier. If 91% core goes up to 94%. I think I heard you right. Is that a good figure to think about kind of the longer-term that you stay well above 90%? Or is there kind of an upper bound where you might be something north of 10% on just the wholesale piece?\nCraig Nix: Well, just for a little context there. We\u2019ve been as high as 96% there combined and recently, we were there. So 94% starts to get it back to that level. And again, I don\u2019t want to send in a lot \u2013 we were an alarmed at 91%. But obviously, we\u2019d rather have more by funding represented by core deposits. So that\u2019s trending in our opinion in the right direction.\nChristopher Marinac: Great. Understood. Thank you, again for all the information this morning.\nCraig Nix: Thank you, Chris.\nOperator: I\u2019m not showing any further questions at this time. So I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to our host for any closing remarks.\nDeanna Hart: Thank you, and thank you, everybody, for participating in our call today. We appreciate your ongoing interest in our company. And if you have any further questions or need additional information, please feel free to reach out to our Investor Relations team. I hope you all have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

So on the brokerage side, I mean, we're obviously trying to split maturities up to not create future cliffs, where we have maturities sort of bundled in months there. So we've used the blended approach. We've gone from 12 months, 18 months, 24 months and 36 months here. Start off the quarter and expect to continue that over the coming months, sort of spread those maturities up. We view those broker TDs, although they fall under the deposit category, the sort of a hybrid between sort of the deposit base and the wholesale funding to help with that funding difference between the loan growth and deposit."

            "content": "Thank you, Deanna, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate all of you joining us today. We hope this call will be informative and give you a sense of the success we enjoyed through the third quarter and the path we're on moving forward. We announced another quarter of solid financial results this morning, and I'm confident about both our trajectory moving forward and our ability to continue delivering long-term shareholder value. While we face some economic headwinds and the potential for a recession, we've not seen meaningful signs of stress in our credit portfolio to date. We are encouraged by the resiliency of our clients in the face of elevated inflation and rising interest rates. During the quarter, loan growth momentum continued and was broad across our lines of business. The strong quality loan growth we experienced this quarter in tandem with the positive asset re-pricing we have experienced in the rising rate environment helped produce another quarter of strong net interest income growth and positive operating leverage. Starting on Page 5, I'll highlight the 10 takeaways for the quarter and Craig will take a deeper look at our third quarter results and prospects moving forward in the next sessions of this presentation. First, we are pleased to announce that we have repurchased 99.4% of the 1.5 million shares of Class A common stock authorized by our Board for repurchase as of the market close yesterday. The 1.5 million shares represents approximately 10% of the Class A common shares or 9.4% of the total common shares outstanding prior to the repurchase. This repurchase program allowed us to return excess capital to our shareholders and set the foundation to deliver even stronger returns in the coming quarters, given a more optimal capital level. The second one, we continue to focus on merger optimization efforts and remain confident that we will achieve our cost savings goal of $250 million. We estimate that we will come in slightly below our merger cost estimate of $445 million. Number three, pre-provision net revenue continued to be a bright spot, growing by 21.3% over the second quarter indicative of significant margin expansion, solid fee income growth generation and good expense management. Fourth, net interest margin expanded by 36 basis points during the quarter due to higher interest rates and strong loan growth, only partially offset by higher funding cost and borrowings. Five, expense management continues to be a focus, and we achieved an efficiency ratio during the quarter of 53%. We're especially pleased with our efficiency ratio given the inflationary headwinds, which are impacting the industry and market as a whole. Six, for the second consecutive quarter, we've had a provision build related to deterioration in CECL macroeconomic forecast in addition to maintenance reserves to cover loan growth and net charge-offs. Seven, despite a larger provision expense compared to last quarter, credit quality remains excellent. The net charge-off ratio during the quarter remained below non-stressed historical averages and decreased compared to the linked quarter. Further, our non-accrual ratio declined during the quarter. We remain pleased with our loan portfolio performance and as covered in detail on last quarter's call, our portfolios are underwritten to endure times of economic stress. With that said, we continue to monitor the potential impacts of higher rates, inflation, a possible recession and geopolitical instability on our loan portfolio. Eight, loans grew at an annualized rate of 12% during the quarter, marking another strong quarter. Loan growth was broad in both commercial and the general business bank \u2013 General Bank business segments and was an output of the long-term business development efforts from our lenders and our continued emphasis on adding staff in areas that can support quality growth. Nine, while we continue to see a decline in total deposits, we were pleased that the rate of decline was lower than in the prior quarter. As expected, we experienced further attrition in higher-cost acquired money market deposits. The decline was partially offset by growth in our direct bank as we look to remain competitive in the online space. Ten, as a result of strong loan growth and reduced deposits, we did add $3.9 billion in wholesale borrowings during the quarter. Despite the change in our funding mix, we feel good about our current and pro forma liquidity position. Turning to Page 6. We provide more detail on our share repurchase plan progress to date. We were able to repurchase shares faster than anticipated, allowing us to quickly rightsize our capital closer to the target operating range. We estimate that the repurchases will be accretive to 2023 EPS by approximately 10%. Further, while there is initial dilution to TBV in the third quarter of $15.75 we estimate this will be earned back in less than three years. For now, we are pausing our repurchase plan as we monitor loan growth and the macroeconomic environment moving forward. We plan to submit our capital plan in the second quarter of 2023. After consideration of that plan, it will be our intent to return any excess capital over our internal targets to shareholders in the form of share repurchases beginning in the second half of next year. With that, I'll turn it over to Craig to expand on our third quarter financial results and share our financial outlook moving forward. Craig? Good morning. That's correct. Thank you, Brian."

            "name": "Craig Nix",
            "content": "Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Page 8. I am happy to report GAAP net income of $315 million or $19.25 per common share, yielding an annualized ROE of 12.49% and an ROA of 1.16%. On an adjusted basis, net income was $338 million or $20.77 per common share, yielding an annualized ROE of 13.47% and an ROA of 1.24%. Comparable EPS, ROE and ROTCE shown on this page for prior periods, our First Citizens BancShares on a stand-alone basis. ROA, PPNR ROA and NIM and the net charge-off ratio are presented as if the companies were combined during the historical periods. I'll dive a little deeper into these components in a moment as we look at the underlying trends that produce our results. Continuing on to Page 9, we provide two condensed income statement, the one at the top representing our reported GAAP results and the one at the bottom, supplementing those results showing net income adjusted for notable items. Both income statements are presented as if FCB and CIT reemerge during the historical periods. The section in the middle of the page summarizes the impact of notable items to derive the adjusted results from the reported results. The most significant notable items were $139 million and depreciation and maintenance expense on operating leases as well as $33 million in merger-related expenses. Page 11 provides a detailed listing of the notable items affecting the quarter along with their impact on net income and diluted earnings per share. I will now focus on the adjusted results at the bottom of the page. Pre-provision net revenue increased by $89 million or 21.3% over the linked quarter and by $224 million or 79.4% over the comparable quarter a year ago. The increase for both periods was driven by positive operating leverage as net revenues grew at a faster pace than expenses. Net income available to common shareholders was $326 million for the quarter, up from $270 million in the second quarter and $262 million in the third quarter of the prior year. The increase during the linked quarter was due to an increase in pre-provision net revenue and lower preferred dividends, partially offset by an increase in provision for credit losses. The increase compared to the same quarter a year ago was due to higher pre-provision net revenue, partially offset by higher preferred dividends and increase in provision for credit losses. Page 10 provides a view of our year-to-date results for your reference. Page 11 provides detail with respect to notable items for the relevant quarterly and year-to-date periods. During the third quarter, these adjustments had a minimal net impact adding $1.52 to GAAP EPS. Turning to Page 12. Net interest income totaled $795 million during the quarter, up 13.6% over the second quarter. Interest income increased by $149 million over the linked quarter due to loan growth and a higher yield on earning assets. Interest expense increased by $54 million due to higher funding costs as the rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased by 24 basis points, and we added wholesale borrowings to cover the decline in deposits since the end of the first quarter. An analysis of the comparable quarter and year-to-date periods is provided at the bottom of the slide for your reference. Turning to Page 13. We highlight the drivers of the 36 basis points and 87 basis points margin expansion from the linked and comparable prior quarters, respectively. I will focus my comments on the change during the linked quarter where the 36 basis points margin expansion was due to a higher yield on earning assets and loan growth, partially offset by a higher cost of interest-bearing deposits and the impact of additional borrowings. While funding costs increased, partially offsetting some of the asset re-pricing during the quarter, we believe we are well-positioned to increase our net interest margin over the coming quarters, albeit at a slower pace than this year. There will be some catch-up in deposit re-pricing over the next few quarters amidst higher interest rates and strong industry competition for funding. Nevertheless, we believe the strength of our balance sheet will enable us to weather these headwinds favorably, especially in light of continued momentum we expect on increasing asset yields. Turning to Page 14. The line graph on the left-hand side of the page indicate we continue to be asset sensitive, albeit slightly less than in prior quarters. We had and will continue to take a measured approach to interest in market rate risk management to position our balance sheet to benefit from higher interest rates while at the same time providing downside protection against lower interest rates. We estimate that a 100 basis points shock in rates would increase net interest income by 3.4% and a 100 basis point ramp, which increased by 1.5% over the next 12 months. The main drivers of our asset sensitivity are our variable rate loan portfolio, which represents 45% of total loans, our cash position and expected modest deposit betas driven by our strong core deposit base. We estimate our full-cycle deposit beta at 25%, which is aligned with our historical experience. Turning to Page 15. We provided some additional information on deposit beta. In terms of our deposit base, 59% of our deposits exhibit lower betas and 41% exhibit mid to higher beta. Our cumulative beta through the third quarter was 6%. We expect the cumulative beta to be 14% at year-end as our stand-alone fourth quarter deposit beta is estimated to be 34%. Again, over the interest rate hiking cycle, we forecast our beta to be approximately 25%. Turning to Page 16. I will focus my comments on the increase in non-interest income from the linked quarter analysis of the comparable prior year quarter and year-to-date periods, for non-interest income increased by 20% and 16%, respectively, is presented for your reference. Non-interest income increased by $6 million over the linked quarter, with core increasing by $5 million. $5 million increase was primarily due to higher capital markets income and an increase in rental income on operating leases, partially offset by a decline in service charges on deposit accounts as the impact of our recent changes to OD/NSF fees took effect. The higher net rental income on operating leases was due to increased gross rental income on favorable re-pricing rate offsetting combined higher depreciation and maintenance expense. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect non-interest income to be flat to slightly down due primarily to elevated capital market fees in the third quarter. Looking into 2023, we see continued momentum in our wealth and payments businesses as a result of organic growth, offsetting the full year-over-year impact of service charges. While we expect gross rental income on operating leases to continue to increase on the heels of strong utilization and favorable car re-pricing rate. We do anticipate year-over-year net operating lease income to be flatter due to the timing of more recertification costs scheduled in 2023 as well as the impact of inflation on labor and car repairs. We also see slight pressure on factoring commissions as potential consumer demand slows. As of the full year impact of NSF/OD changes, we would project mid-single digit percentage growth of longest income in 2023. However, with the impact of NSF/OD changes, we expect low-single digit percentage growth. Turning to Page 17. Linked quarter non-interest expense increased by $12 million, $11 million of which was core. The $11 million increase was primarily driven by a $10 million increase in personnel expense. This is due to net staff additions, revenue-related incentive compensation, lease increases from inflationary pressures, especially as it relates to new hires as well as higher temporary personnel costs. The net staff additions are primarily related to building out teams to support our move to large bank compliance as well as the backfill vacancy. The other primary driver was a $6 million increase in marketing expenses related to direct bank efforts to maintain and attract new deposit balances. These were partially offset by decreases in FDIC insurance and professional fees. We are pleased that our efficiency ratio improved again during the quarter, dropping to 53.34%. We feel that our continued recognition of cost saves is helping maintain expense growth in the low-single digits that otherwise would be in the range of 5% to 6%, given inflation headwind. Looking forward, we expect to continue to feel the pressures of inflation, especially as it relates to wages, professional service and contract call. Despite this, we feel confident in our ability to maintain our efficiency ratio in the lower 50s in the coming quarters as we removed another estimated $70 million out of our cost base helping to neutralize natural non-interest expense growth that exclusive of merger cost saves would be closer to mid-single-digit range for this year. Looking to 2023, we expect a low to mid-single-digit percentage increase in adjusted non-interest expense year-over-year driven mainly by inflationary pressures in salaries and wages, higher revenue-related incentives. The across the industry increase in FDIC assessment rates, higher marketing costs in the direct bank, all being partially offset by remaining cost saves. We are on track to recognize $200 million in cost saves by the end of 2022 and the full $250 million by the end of 2023. Page 18 outlines our non-interest income and expense composition, which remained relatively stable compared to the prior quarter with the exception of a decline in deposit service charges from the NSF OD exchanges I referenced earlier. Page 19 shows balance sheet highlights and key ratios. I will cover the significant components on subsequent pages of the deck. Turning to Page 20. We had another quarter of strong loan growth with loans increasing by $2.1 billion over the linked quarter or 12% on an annualized basis as our teams continue to generate production above target levels and we benefit from reduced prepayments due to the higher interest rate environment. Loan growth for the quarter was broad-based. General Bank loans grew at an annualized rate of 12.8% led by the branch network. Growth was primarily concentrated in business and commercial loans. Elsewhere, while overall mortgage loan production was down, we had growth in mortgage loans as we have originated more ARM products that we keep on the balance sheet. Our mortgage pipelines are continuing to slow given the rate environment and towards the end of the third quarter, over 90% of our funded mortgage loan volume was for purchases compared to an approximate 50-50 split at the same time last year. The commercial bank also saw further positive momentum, posting an annualized growth rate of 11.7%, led by our industry verticals and business capital, as well as seasonal growth in our factoring business as retail businesses begin to ramp inventory for the holiday season. In our industry verticals, we continue to see strong production in energy, health care, in tech, media and telecom. In Business Capital, origination in the Technology segment is strong, and we are seeing some quarter-over-quarter improvement in the office imaging space. On a year-over-year basis, loans increased $3.8 billion or about 5.8%, primarily due to increases for similar reasons I just discussed. We are very pleased with the execution of our sales teams following the merger this year, and the strong performance has been spread across many business lines. Moving forward, we feel positive about our loan growth prospects. However, we do expect loan growth to moderate to mid to high single-digit percentage point in the fourth quarter as the absolute rate environment puts downward pressure on customers' lending appetite. We anticipate mid-single-digit percentage points increase in loans for the full year 2023, driven by continued momentum in our business and commercial lending and the branch network increased hiring and expansion of our middle market business, continued expansion of our wealth business through adding bankers that expanded presence outside of the Carolinas market and further growth in both our industry vertical and Business Capital segment. We do acknowledge that uncertainty around the external environment, especially with regard to economic risk and cost actual growth rates to deviate from our expectations. Page 21 shows our loan proposition by type and segment. Composition has not deviated significantly from the second quarter. Turning to Page 22. Deposits declined by $1.8 billion or 7.9% on an annualized basis from the linked quarter. The main driver of the decline was a $1.8 billion decline in interest-bearing deposits due to reductions in money market and checking the interest deposits as we continue to see more rate-sensitive customers and our acquired branches begin to move funds in response to continued rate increases. Despite the decrease in interest-bearing deposits, we are pleased that non-interest bearing deposits grew by $11 million since the end of the second quarter. Pro tier within the branch network, which we attributed a continued emphasis on developing client relationships, which includes not only fulfilling our clients' lending needs, but also focuses on depository and other banking service needs. Our branch network remains dedicated to its strategy to develop full client relationships and we believe this strategy will continue to help us increase non-interest bearing deposits in the coming quarters despite a challenging funding environment. Additionally, we were encouraged to see growth in our direct bank as we have worked to increase balances in the third quarter to help fund our strong loan growth. We do anticipate continued growth in the direct bank in the fourth quarter to help support loan growth. Our cost of deposits increased by 16 basis points during the quarter to 35 basis points. The increase is representative of the impact from the Fed rate hikes and our need to raise rates to stay competitive with IPOs. We do remain guarded on the outlook for absolute deposit growth for the remainder of 2022 as the interest rate environment continues to evolve and the Fed impact liquidity in the system by deleveraging its balance sheet. However, we do expect mid-single-digit percentage growth in deposits in the fourth quarter as we have raised our sheet rates and are offering attractive money market and CD specials in our markets. In addition, we plan to add broker deposits during the quarter. For your reference, we have included high graphs on Page 23 showing deposit composition by type and segment. Turning to Page 24. Our balance sheet continues to be funded predominantly by deposits, representing over 91% of our funding base. As Frank mentioned in his comments, we'll note an increase in FHLB borrowings this quarter, which is reflective of our continued strong loan growth and deposit decline. We believe the concentration metrics will begin to flatten as our deposit balances begin to modestly increase in the fourth quarter. I would like to point out that the FHLB borrowings that we added are variable rate and provide quarterly call features, allowing us the flexibility to remove this funding source as we work to further grow deposits in future quarters. Continuing to Page 25, you'll see that our credit quality continues to be very strong. The net charge-off ratio for the quarter remained at historic lows at 10 basis points and was down 3 basis points from the linked quarter. Provision for credit losses increased by $18 million to $59 million this quarter, primarily as a result of deterioration in CECL macroeconomic scenarios, only partially offset by improving credit quality and portfolio mix. We also provided maintenance reserves for loan growth and to cover net charge-offs. Moving to the bottom of the page. The non-accrual loan ratio declined again, this will over to 0.65% from 0.76% in the prior quarter and from 0.86% in the same quarter in the prior year. Despite the provision build, the ACL ratio remained flat at 1.26% and covering quarterly net charge-offs 12.6 times and the five-quarter rolling average 15.8 times. Moving on to Page 26, we provide a roll forward of the ACL from the linked quarter. The ACL was up $32 million to $882 million. Net charge-offs totaled $18 million during the quarter, and portfolio mix had the impact of reducing the ACL by $7 million. While the CECL macroeconomic forecast shows some deterioration, we spend to a $42 million increase in the ACL. Actual performance and credit metrics remain strong, subtracting $5 million from the second quarter ACL. Loan growth added $20 million. Turning to Page 27. Our capital position remains strong with all ratios above or in the upper end of our target ranges. As of the end of the third quarter, our CET1 ratio was 10.37%, and our total risk-based ratio was 13.46%. The 98 basis points decline in our CET1 ratio is primarily the result of our share repurchase activity. Net income growth outpaced the loan-driven risk-weighted asset growth. The decrease in CET1 helped to optimize our capital ratios closer to our target range, whereas before our repurchase \u2013 share repurchase plan, we were well above the range. During the third quarter, tangible book value per share declined modestly due to negative AOCI adjustment and the impact of the share repurchases not being completely offset by strong earnings. Turning to Page 29. I will conclude by discussing our financial outlook for the fourth quarter of 2022 and 2023 fiscal year. On Page 29, the first column with our third quarter 2022 results. The numbers for non-interest income and expense are adjusted for notable items. Column 2 provides our guidance for the fourth quarter and Column 3 for the full year 2022. Column 4 is our initial updated look at 2023 based upon our current forecast and projections. There are a lot of variables that could impact this projection, and this guidance assumes any type of recessionary impact are mild. From a loan growth perspective, we expect a mid to high single-digit percentage range in the fourth quarter and a mid-single-digit percentage growth range in 2023. We saw a slight slowdown in loan growth in the third quarter compared to the second, while still eclipsing 10% annualized growth. We expect this rate of increase to moderate due to the increasing rate environment and in fact, have seen some pipelines begin to slow in areas such as mortgage and real estate finance. On deposits, we are actively taking steps to curb some of the higher-priced deposit attrition we have seen in the past two quarters. Our expectation for the fourth quarter is mid-single-digit percentage growth, bolstered by continued growth from our branch network, in addition to a focus on adding balances in our direct bank through competitive product offering as well as increasing our broker deposit position. For 2023, we expect low to mid-single-digit percentage growth as non-interest bearing and time deposits grow, while money market balances remained flat. We are committed to taking the steps necessary to grow our deposit base to support loan growth, even in the face of rising deposit cost pressure. For net charge-offs, we expect a gradual return to pre-pandemic non-stress levels but have not seen any meaningful strength in our portfolios to this point. We expect net charge-offs in the range of 15 to 25 basis points in the fourth quarter and in the 20 to 30 basis points range for 2023. The increase in our net charge-off projection is not due to any apparent stress in our portfolios in present time. Rather, we think the impact of inflation and rising rates coupled with mild recessionary pressures may result in our losses returning to more historic levels, which on a combined basis are close to 25 to 30 basis points. Our current forecast assumes that the Fed will raise rates by another 125 basis points in the fourth quarter for an ending Fed funds effective range of 4.25% to 4.5% by year-end. Our expectation for 2023 is a rate remained flat for the duration of the year with the first rate cut not anticipated until early 2024. For net interest income, we expect low single-digit percentage growth in the fourth quarter and a generally flat margin. For the full year 2023, we expect net interest in from growth in the mid-teens percentage range, largely on the heels of margin expansion that has occurred in the second half of 2022. 2023, from a margin perspective, we expect a gradual expansion from the level seen in the third quarter of 2022. While we will continue to see interest income expansion from earning asset repricing upwards, there remains a lag on deposit pricing and the momentum from deposits repricing in the fourth quarter 2022 in the first quarter of 2023 will largely offset the increase in asset repricing. As I stated earlier, our cumulative deposit rate at the end of the third quarter was 6% and we expect it to be closer to 35% over the next two quarters, resulting in a cumulative beta as of year-end 2022 of 14% and 25% cumulative over the rate hike cycle. Given that we are currently in unprecedented times as it relates to the velocity of rising rates and the ultimate impact the competition for deposits may have upon pricing, betas could be higher than we were estimating causing actual results to deviate from these expectations. I touched on our non-interest income and expense projections in my earlier comments, so I will not repeat them here. Given that we have completed our share repurchase plan and much has changed since we gave EPS guidance earlier this year, we are updating that guidance here. Even though we intend to resume share repurchases in the second half of 2023, conditions warrant, and our projections hold the EPS estimates do not include any repurchases in 2023. For the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share in the $21 to $23 range, which is in line to slightly above the third quarter. For the full year 2023, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the $95 to $100 range. This does not include the after-tax impact of an estimated $50 million to $60 million merger call, which will take the estimate down to an estimated range of $93 to $98. We feel good about our earnings momentum heading into 2023 despite economic headwinds. We expect to maintain positive operating leverage as the momentum from margin expansion the last two quarters carried over into 2023 and the last leg of our merger synergies helped to reduce the velocity of expense growth impacted by inflation. In closing, we are very pleased with our third quarter results and the hard work put in by our associates to make it happen. We remain confident in our ability to grow and deliver on our commitments as First Citizens is well positioned across a broad range of economic outcomes given our relationship-focused client model, conservative credit culture, diverse business mix, strong capital position and most importantly, our shift from a focus on integration to execution and growth. With that, I will now turn the call back over to the operator for instructions for the Q&A portion of our call. Brady, if our projections hold, we would contemplate a fairly sizable buyback in the second half of next year. I would just point out that in the fourth quarter and first quarter, we will be operating much closer to our target ranges. And then we begin to \u2013 if our projections hold, we begin to lift out of that in the second quarter of next year. Yes. And Brady, we dropped that target range to 9% to 10% from 9% to 11% in our capital plan. So the range now for CET1 is 9% to 10%. I'll let Howard will address that. Thank you, Brady. Let me start with that last point. I don't think we favor one over the other. It's just that the direct bank has achieved stronger growth as we move into the fourth quarter. So it's really not \u2013 there's no signaling here that we favor one channel over the other. In terms of just \u2013 and I'll let Tom address the birth of deposit question. But in terms of the \u2013 sort of the funding mix we would anticipate that we gravitate away from wholesale funding back to deposits, that 91% deposits gradually going up to around 94% in 2023. So from a funding mix standpoint, we certainly would rather have more deposits. Although we're not alarmed by 91%, our liquidity metrics look good, we're green. We're still managing to our low liquidity risk appetite. So no real concerns there, but we would see a gradual shift back to deposit. And I'll let Tom talk a little bit about the strategy around the broker deposits. Absolutely a factor. It will be wrapped in. Capital planning certainly will be \u2013 we'll consider whether our capital plan would allow for a repurchase. Again, we think our numbers and capital ratios will bear that out. In terms of CCAR, that's definitely the most significant change to our capital program as far as being part of the LFI framework and subject to CCAR. We will obviously be sign the capital buffer based on the Federal Reserve bank stress testing our portfolio and support those changes, massive efforts are underway internally and have been for some time. We've completed a GAAP assessment of our current practices around capital planning and stress testing. We've also completed our annual stress test we got earlier this year, and we feel comfortable about our \u2013 and that's how we establish our targets. We feel comfortable about those, and we feel confident that we will be able and prepared to meet all regulatory requirements. Thanks, Stephen. Well, Brian, in terms of \u2013 and I'll talk about the reserve build in terms of provision. I don't think we contemplate a massive increase in the reserve ratio. But in terms of provision on the increased charge-offs, we would expect around a let's say, $100 million increases of vision expense next year, which directly correlates to increased charge-offs. Obviously, as it relates to the \u2013 driving the ACL percentage higher. We monitor both internal and external factors and the determination of the ACL internally. We're looking at our credit quality indicators. Are we seeing pockets of deterioration in our portfolios. Our internal metrics trending up in a bad way. And then all we have in requests for concessions and extensions. And none of that, and Marisa correct me if I'm wrong, but none of that is apparent right now or forecasted into our ACL percentage for provisioning next year. We also really monitor the external environment as part of our ACL process. So at the end of the day, to increase the percentage that would be driven by some specific deterioration beyond what's already covered in sort of the baseline and downside scenario waving of our ACL. We wait the downside 50%, we wait the baseline to 20 and the \u2013 if the upside is 30 and those upside and downsides represent \u2013 or project 5% are based on an upside about a 5% unemployment rate the downside about 8% and I think we're some ways off on that. So in terms of projecting right now, we felt like it was prudent to maintain the reserve percentage but also add charge-offs. So and those things sort of fungible what we could add to macroeconomics and now let Craig \u2013 vice versa. Right now is our best yes, where we think we are. So at present time, things look good and any provision deal would be related to macroeconomic deterioration in sort of the Moody's forecast. I hope that answers the question, long winded, but that's one that's probably in terms of variability or in precision in the forecast, it would be provisioned and then obviously, deposit bases. In terms of criticized percentage, Class 5 percentage, we really are sort of tracking those trends pre-pandemic or you could say, at CECL adoption. And when you look at those ratios in the fourth quarter of 2019, our criticized percentage was 5.16%. It's down to 4.91% and has really declined every quarter. And these are combined for CIT and First Citizens for comparability purposes. They turned it down every quarter after hitting a high of 8.28% in the fourth quarter of 2020. And from a classified perspective, at the fourth quarter, we were at 3.35%, hit a high of 5.18%. They also have declined every quarter but remain about 50 basis points over the fourth quarter 2019 at 3.83% and then we look at other credit quality metrics and about eight of nine of them are better than the pre-pandemic/CECL adoption date. So we feel really good about our credit quality trends. Marisa, do you have anything to add to that? Well, just for a little context there. We've been as high as 96% there combined and recently, we were there. So 94% starts to get it back to that level. And again, I don't want to send in a lot \u2013 we were an alarmed at 91%. But obviously, we'd rather have more by funding represented by core deposits. So that's trending in our opinion in the right direction. Thank you, Chris."

As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce the host of this conference call, Ms. Deanna Hart, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Deanna, you may begin.\nDeanna Hart: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review First Citizens Bank's second quarter 2022 financial results. It is my pleasure to introduce our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Frank Holding; our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Nix; our President, Peter Bristow; and our Chief Credit Officer, Marisa Harney, who will be speaking to you today to provide an update on our merger integration progress and our second quarter 2022 performance. We are also pleased to have several other members of our leadership team in attendance, who will be available to participate in the question-and-answer portion of our call, if needed. During the call, we will be referencing our investor presentation, which you can find on our website. An agenda for today's presentation is on Page 2 of the materials. Following the completion of our formal presentation, we'll be happy to take any questions you may have. As you are aware, we closed the merger with CIT Group on January 3, 2022. Given the magnitude of this merger on our legacy results, we have included combined numbers for historical periods for comparison purposes. There are footnotes embedded in the presentation to indicate when historical numbers are combined or if they are presented on a legacy First Citizens stand-alone basis. As a reminder, our comments during today's presentation will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from expectations. We assume no obligation to update such statements. These risks are outlined for your view on Page 3 of the presentation. We will also reference non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures against the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available in the appendix. Finally, First Citizens is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. With that, I'll hand it over to Frank.\nFrank Holding: Thank you, Deanna, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate all of you joining us today, and we hope this call will be informative and give you a sense of where we've been as well as where we're headed in the second half of the year. We announced another quarter of solid financial results this morning and remain excited and optimistic about the direction of our company. While we recognize there are some economic uncertainties in the current environment. Our customers, by and large, continue to be in good shape and our portfolios are performing well. We saw positive momentum in net interest income as a result of the recent increases -- recent rate increases, as well as an improved mix of earning assets driven by a solid quarter of loan growth, all leading to another quarter of positive operating leverage. We're excited to announce that our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase point, which will allow us to repurchase up to 1.5 million shares of our Class A common stock over the next 12 months, representing approximately 9.4% of our total common shares outstanding. Returning excess capital to our shareholders is a key strategic focus, and we are excited about this opportunity to execute on the plan. Turning to Page 5 of the investor presentation. We are now substantially complete with merger integration and are continuing to concentrate our efforts on optimization of our processes and operations. We recently completed the former One West bank branch conversion with no significant issues, thanks to the dedication of our hard working integration team. Our long-term focus, attention to relationships and diversity of our business segments have positioned us well for the future, which we are extremely excited about. Turning to Page 6. I'm going to provide a quick update on our cost savings initiatives. If you'll remember in the first quarter call, we talked -- we reported cost savings to date of $100 million. Since that time, we've made good progress reducing our annual expense run rate by another $70 million increase in the cost savings to date of $170 million or 68% of our $250 million target. The largest reduction to date has been in personnel expense, but we've additionally benefited from savings in areas such as FDIC insurance, professional fees and third-party processing expenses. We remain confident in our ability to achieve our $250 million cost savings target by the end of 2023. We've also been hard at work on many of our strategic business objectives, which include building out capabilities across various lines of business to recognize revenue synergies as a combined company. And with that, Peter Bristow, our President, who leads our Commercial Bank and Rail Business segments will provide an update on the state of those businesses. Peter?\nPeter Bristow: Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to speak with you today about the exciting opportunities we are seeing in our Commercial Bank. As Frank mentioned, we've been able to capture some of the synergies we knew existed between our two great companies early on, and we are thrilled at how this merger has positioned us for long-term success. We've put an emphasis on retaining the top talent in our Commercial Bank, and we believe our ability to execute on this continuity of sales leadership has positioned us well not only for our quarterly results, but also in the future. On that positive note, Q2 was a strong quarter for the Commercial Bank with solid performance across our businesses. In addition, our strong business leadership has enabled our teams to hit the ground running as we integrate the banks. Our Commercial Finance business has continued to see momentum and demand remains strong in most verticals with pipelines well above 2021 levels. We are continuing to see strong pockets of growth within our renewable energy, medical office real estate and in our technology, media and telecom businesses. Additionally, we're seeing an ongoing flow of referral business from our branch network and middle-market banking relationship managers to many of the legacy CIT business lines. Leveraging these combined organization expertise, we can offer new products and services to meet these growing client needs. This includes the ability to deliver increased capital market capabilities to FCB cloud-base and delivering FCB's wide breadth of treasury management products and services to CIT's commercial customers. With that said, we are continuing to monitor the markets closely as market volatility has increased driven by the Fed balance sheet runoff forgetting in earnest and continued rate increases. As credit spreads reset higher, we expect well structured deals to continue to be highly competitive. In real estate finance, the lending environment remains extremely competitive with record levels of capital being raised for lending and investment. We're seeing that play out as originations are strong, but like many in the industry, we continue to be impacted by elevated prepayments and significant competition for new deals driving down our balances. Our credit quality remains strong, but given where we are in the current economic cycle, we don't want to take a digital credit or structure risk in this area. Within our factoring business, we're seeing that retail sectors are still performing well, although we are being selective on customers. The new business pipeline is strong and with added sales leadership and a continued integration in the FCB footprint, new business should continue to build. However, as consumer confidence starts to be impacted by increased inflation and market volatility, spending had its good change across the entire economy, and we will continue to be watchful. Moving to Business Capital, which is our leasing organization. Originations and portfolio performance remains stellar, despite declines in small business optimism and increasing economic uncertainty. Current asset levels are near record highs for business capital and credit quality remains strong as net losses continue to run favorable to historic rates. At prior high asset levels, the business had notable franchise finance and transportation portfolio balances, and today, those have since largely run off. Still a sizable opportunity exists to better serve bank customers, who sell equipment with business capital, vendor finance capabilities, creating stickiness and deepening key relationships. FCD legacy vendor programs are going to be transitioned to the Business Capital unit, as initial pilot vendors are going to be consolidated in August with the remaining to follow by year end. In our Rail business, utilization improved to 96.2% in Q2, up 72 basis points from the prior quarter. For the third consecutive quarter, repricing was favorable at 114% of the expiring rate. We are starting to see the results of our focus on extending terms, averaging 43 months across the portfolio and 48 months on freight cars for the quarter. While there are no recessionary indications of parent in the portfolio currently, we continue to watch the markets closely, particularly with industrial production and the purchasing managers index being down slightly in June. Our near-term outlook remains positive but mixed across certain markets. We expect utilization to be flat to modestly improving through 2022. The strong performance of our Commercial Bank will not be possible without the experienced nimble management teams across each of these businesses. These established leaders help provide stability to both our associates and our clients while also identifying new leaders to promote additional opportunities, which is critical to our continued success. One of the items we continue to be pleased with is the performance of the legacy CIT portfolio as we deal with the economic uncertainty of today. Prior to the merger, the CIT team executed a multi-year strategy to reduce portfolio risk and our Chief Credit Officer, Marisa Harney, is here today to provide an overview of these efforts. Marisa, I'll turn it over to you.\nMarisa Harney: Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everybody. As Peter noted, reducing credit risk was a strategic initiative for CIT in the years leading up to our merger with First Citizens and managing this risk remains critically important given the macroeconomic uncertainties we're all facing today. And as Frank mentioned earlier, loan growth has been solid this quarter as we continue to originate business in areas where we believe there are opportunities, while maintaining consistent underwriting standards. We continue to manage our portfolio prudently and effectively, and I want to take a minute to demonstrate how legacy CIT executed on these efforts prior to the merger, positioning our commercial bank for long-term success. Beginning with Page 9 of the presentation, I'd like to provide an overview of the legacy CIT profile, specifically related to changes that were initiated following the 2008, 2009 financial crisis. And those efforts were aimed at strengthening the portfolio. As depicted on the slide, CIT sold or significantly reduced high-risk portfolios that were deemed likely to cause stress in times of economic disruption. As part of our multi-year transformation, we exited many of the riskiest asset classes that were in our portfolio going into the last credit cycle, including subprime mortgages, mezzanine and subordinated commercial real estate loans and private student loans. We also exited businesses with higher credit risk, asset risk and regulatory risk, such as commercial air operating leases and international equipment portfolio. Further, we significantly reduced exposure to cash flow or enterprise value dependent loans, the bulk of which were leverage loans to approximately 10% of our exposure as of the merger close. The de-risking of our portfolios enables us to focus on appropriate risk adjusted returns and will serve us well as we consider the challenges in the current macroeconomic environment. This is achieved by enacting more robust credit underwriting standards and enhancing credit discipline among other things. The strong risk culture and credit risk discipline resulted in a more stable and healthy loan book, as demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Page 10 demonstrates that we were able not only to weather the pandemic, but to thrive, by continuing to enjoy strong asset quality, despite the macroeconomic pressures and uncertainty in the market. And this was accomplished again by being selective and disciplined in the face of very competitive market conditions. As we look forward to our future as a combined company, you'll see that Page 11 shows First Citizens and CIT have complemented each other to create a combined company with a moderate credit risk. While each legacy company was more skewed to one side of the risk spectrum or the other, the combined company's risk appetite will enable us to be more competitive in the changing market, while still maintaining a balanced approach with a focus on long-term growth and stability. Despite some of the uncertainties out there, I'm very comfortable about the quality of our book. We continue to strengthen our portfolio and demonstrate our discipline through new business originations that continue to come in at better risk ratings than our existing credit portfolio. The combined company's deep industry expertise and structuring capabilities give us confidence that we're properly balancing our growth strategy with our underwriting strategy. This merger integration we've come a long way in a brief time. We're in a good position and thanks to our experienced and professional associates, who're executing well. We believe we'll position well to keep this momentum going strong. I'm now going to pass the mic to Craig to discuss our second quarter financial results in more detail. Craig?\nCraig Nix: Great. Thank you, Marisa, and hello, everyone. I'm going to start on Page 13. I will begin with second quarter takeaways, which as Frank mentioned points to another strong quarter of financial performance. As Frank mentioned, we are excited to resume our share repurchase program, which has been suspended since the third quarter of 2020. We believe the share repurchases will allow us to return to more optimal capital levels, while leaving room for organic growth, deliver higher returns on capital and earnings per share, and return capital to our shareholders in the most cost efficient way. Pre-provision net revenue growth continues to be a bright spot. PPNR adjusted for notable items grew by 17.1% over the linked quarter and by 38.5% over the second quarter of last year. Positive operating leverage of 6.9% and 12.8% was achieved for the linked and comparable quarters, respectively, as revenue growth exceeded expense growth by a wide margin in both periods. The most significant contributing factor to PPNR growth was a 7.9% increase in net interest income over the linked quarter and a 14.4% increase over the comparable quarter last year. Net interest margin expanded by 31 basis points from 2.73% to 3.04% during the second quarter. We also are pleased with expense management, especially given inflation headwinds. Our efficiency ratio improved to 57.55% during the quarter, due to strong net revenue growth and the continued recognition of merger cost savings that Frank alluded to earlier. We had a provision build during the quarter after having several quarters of provision reversals as COVID-related reserves were released. The build during the current quarter increased provision expense over the linked quarter by $91 million. The current quarter build was primarily related to a deterioration in the CECL macroeconomic forecast, used to arrive at the ACL, as well as maintenance reserves to cover net charge-offs and loan growth. Despite the provision build, the ACL remains fairly stable in terms of dollars and the ACL ratio declined 3 basis points from 1.29% to 1.26%. As Marisa mentioned, credit quality remains excellent. The net charge-off ratio during the quarter remained below historic norms at 13 basis points and the nonaccrual ratio declined during the quarter to 0.76%. Loan growth exceeded our expectations this quarter, growing at an annualized rate of 13.5% and by 14.3% ex-PPP. Growth was strong broadly in both the Commercial and General Bank business segments. And finally, total deposits declined during the quarter as higher cost acquired deposits ran all. However, the decline was partially offset by strong growth in noninterest-bearing deposits in our branch network. Now turning to Page 14, I will touch on the financial highlights for the quarter. Please note that our GAAP results are presented on Pages 36 through 38 in the appendix. The primary focus of my comments today will be on supplemental reporting, which combines legacy BancShares and legacy CIT for historical periods presented with adjustments to account for the after-tax basis of notable items such as gains and expenses, associated with the merger, gains and losses on sale and debt extinguishment and other nonrecurring non-core items. GAAP net income for the second quarter was $255 million, a $14.86 per share. On an adjusted basis, net income was $287 million or $16.86 per share, yielding an annualized ROE of 11.9% and an ROA of 1.07%. On to Page 15, we present two condensed income statement. The one at the top representing our reported GAAP results for the first and second quarters of '22. And the results as of legacy FCB and CIT are combined for the second quarter of 2021. The second in the middle summarizes the impact of notable items to derive the adjusted results at the bottom of the page from the reported results. Page 17 provides a detailed listing of the notable items affecting the quarter and year-to-date periods, along with their impact on these line items and diluted earnings per share. Focusing on the adjusted results at the bottom of the page, net income available to common shareholders was $270 million for the second quarter, down from $299 million in the first quarter and $286 million in the second quarter of the prior year. The decline for both periods were due to increases in provisions for credit losses of USD91 million and USD136 million, respectively, as reserves were build in the current quarter and release for the comparable quarters. The increase in provision expense was largely offset by PPNR growth, which increased by $60 million or 16.8% over the linked quarter and by $114 million or 37.6% over the comparable quarter a year ago. The increases for both periods were driven by positive operating leverage as net revenue grew at a faster pace than expenses. Page 16 provides a view of our year-to-date result on the same basis for your reference. Page 17 provides detail with respect to notable items for the relative quarterly and year-to-date periods. During the second quarter, these adjusted -- minimal net impact of adding $2 to GAAP EPS. Starting on Page 18, I'll touch on the major trends impacting our operating results. And as noted otherwise, the historical financial trends on the upcoming pages are consolidated, as if the merger took place during the period presented. Net interest income totaled $700 million for the quarter, up 7.9% over the first quarter, and 14.4% over the second quarter last year. The drivers of the increase over the linked quarter were loan growth, higher yields on earning assets and the $3 billion debt redemption that occurred in February. The yield on earning assets increased by 29 basis points, and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities remains fairly stable, declining by 1 basis point, primarily due to the debt redemption only partially offset by a 2 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing deposits. Analysis for the comparable quarter and year-to-date periods are presented on Page 18 for your reference. Now turning to Page 19. We highlight the drivers of the 31 and 48 basis points margin expansion from the linked and comparable prior year quarters respectively. We continue to see positive impact from the debt redemption that took place at the end of February, allowing us to eliminate a higher cost funding channel and rebalance our mix of earning assets. This coupled with strong loan growth in reductions in interest-bearing deposits, eliminated the excess liquidity that we have had on our balance sheet since the start of the pandemic. The 31 basis points increase in margin from the linked quarter was due to the impact of higher loan yields and strong loan growth, the impact of the debt redemption and expanding yields on investment securities and overnight investments, partially offset by a small decline in SBA-PPP income and slightly higher interest-bearing deposit costs. With respect to earning asset yields, the loan yield increased by 13 basis points over the linked quarter, as we started to benefit from the recent rate increases. Purchase accounting and PPP income impact on the loan yield was minimal. We expect the loan yield to continue to increase as we recognize the full benefit of rate increases as many of our variable rate loans did not reset until the start of the third quarter, given floors that were embedded in some of them. The yield on our earnings -- on our investment securities portfolio increased by 14 basis points during the quarter, and we expect continued improvement throughout the remainder of the year. The improved yield was driven by higher reinvestment rates and lower prepayments and premium amortization on our MBS portfolio. The yield on purchase volumes during the quarter averaged 3.5% compared to the overall portfolio yield of 1.85%. NIM was up in the comparable quarter by 48 basis points, some of them exist that I stressed in the linked quarter with the exception of the timing deposit rate and a higher investment securities balance, both of which provided for additional expansion, partially offset by a $1.1 billion decline in average loan balances, lower purchase accounting accretion and SBA-PPP income. Looking ahead, while we expect interest expense to increase, we expect interest income will increase at a faster pace, leading to further growth in net interest income over the coming quarters. And at this time, we expect the earning asset yield will increase at a faster pace than the cost of funding them, thus leading to continued expansion of net interest margin. Turning to Page 20. The line graph on the left hand side of the page indicate, we continue to be asset sensitive, albeit slightly less than in the prior quarters due to a reduction in rate sensitive assets. As we noted before, we have been operating the liquidity above normal operating ranges for a number of quarters, and we're able to optimize our asset mix during the second quarter. We have and will continue to take a measured approach to interest and market rate risk management to position our balance sheet to benefit from higher interest rates, while at the same time providing downside protection, should interest rates fall in the future. We estimate that a 100 basis point shock in rates with increased net interest income by 5.2% and a 100 basis point ramp that increased it by 2% over the next 12 months. The main drivers of our asset sensitivity are our variable rate loan portfolios, which represents 43% of total loans, our cash position and expected modest deposit betas driven by our strong core deposit base. We model our blended deposit beta between 20% and 25%, which is aligned with historical experience and a rising rate environment. Core noninterest income, turning to Page 21, increased by $3 million over the linked quarter, or by 1.1%. The increase is primarily due to higher capital markets and wealth management income, partially offset by a decline in net rental income or operating leases due to higher depreciation and maintenance expenses despite growth in gross rental income. While net operating lease income was down compared to the prior quarter, we are encouraged by the continued growth this quarter in gross operating lease income, a further reflection of rail utilization increasing to 96% from 95.5% in the first quarter and 90% last year. We see further momentum here as repricing rates were 114% of first quarter prices. The higher depreciation expense was related to an update on salvage values and operating leases. And moving forward, we expect quarterly depreciation to be in the range of the average experience for the first two quarters of this year. The increase in maintenance expense was expected as a higher percentage of cars renewed leases during the quarter and the impact of inflation. The timing of maintenance expense can be lumpy, however, we expect moving forward it to be in the range of what we experienced in the second quarter to slightly higher moving forward. The increase in wealth management income was led by our brokers channel, which offset some of the pressure we felt in trust from broad-based equity and bond market decline. In brokerage, the income was driven by slight safety of production in both annuities and structured products was significantly up in the second quarter. We do expect further momentum in workers in the second half of the year, which will help offset headwinds from declining asset value. Our assets under management declined to $31.7 billion in the second quarter, down from $32.2 billion in the previous quarter, compared to the second quarter of '21, however, assets under management are up $1.4 billion, which reflects continued client acquisition efforts and expansion of our wealth management sales teams. Regarding capital markets fees, we saw an increase of $4 million from the prior quarter, with a slightly higher number of total deals. While the quarter-over-quarter experience was positive, the overall outlook is muted as industry-wide issuance is down year-over-year and is expected to continue to be down, given the absolute rate environment. Core noninterest income increased by $37 million as compared to the second quarter of last year, led by increases in net rental income on operating leases, service charges on deposits and wealth management income, all partially offset by a decline in mortgage income. Net rental income was higher due to increased utilization, as discussed earlier. In wealth management, the increase was led by workers and trust. The increase in service charges is split between commercial and individual with commercial led by pricing increases in client acquisition and individual charges rising above the press levels in the second quarter of '21, as a result of consumer stimulus. Turning to the remainder of 2022, we expect continued momentum in our wealth, merchant, card and wealthy income producing businesses. While service charges on deposits will decline as we enacted the NSFOD policy changes at the beginning of the third quarter, we anticipate a high single-digit percentage increase in adjusted noninterest income year-over-year. With respect to the lost fee income from NSFOD fees, we are looking for opportunities to offset it by broadening customer relationships to product offerings that will add value, such as card, merchant, wealth and treasury payment services. Now turning to Page 22. Noninterest expense adjusted for depreciation and maintenance on operating leases was $609 million, a $77 million decline from the linked quarter and a $55 million increase over the second quarter last year. The $77 million decline from the linked quarter was due to a $101 million decline in merger-related expenses, partially offset by a $27 million reversal of expense in the first quarter related to the termination of two legacy retiree benefit plans and a $6 million decline in core noninterest expense. In terms of the decline in merger-related expenses, the first quarter included more significant deal-related change in control, retention and severance payments, as well as legal and consulting costs. Our total estimate for one-time merger expenses is still in line with the $445 million we guided at the beginning of the year. The $6 million decline in core noninterest expense from the linked quarter was primarily related to an $11 million reduction in personnel costs driven by lower benefit expenses, lower incentive compensation and higher deferred origination costs. Partially offset by higher salary expense due to annual merit increases and net staff additions. The net staff additions are a result of building out teams to support our move to large bank compliance as well as the backfill vacancies from the prior quarter. Personnel expense is one of the areas, where we are facing the greatest inflationary pressures, especially as it relates to new hires, but the impact of new hires are somewhat muted in the quarter driven by the continued recognition of cost saves. Analysis for the comparable quarter and year-to-date periods are presented on Page 22 for your reference. Before I leave noninterest expense though, the big takeaway here is that our efficiency ratio improved to 57.55% during the quarter. Its core net revenue growth outpaced core expense growth for both comparable periods. When we initially announced the merger, we estimated a mid-50s efficiency ratio once we are fully synergized and the improvement this quarter in the efficiency ratio is in line with us hitting those expectations. As Frank mentioned, we expect positive operating leverage from further net interest income expansion and muted expense growth from cost saves helping to temper inflationary pressures. Therefore, we expect the efficiency ratio to continue to trend down to the mid-50s in the current -- in the coming quarters. With respect to inflation, we are feeling pressure in wages, professional services and time track costs. We do expect, however, as we are able to remove another $30 million out of our cost base this year, it will help neutralize the natural noninterest expense growth that exclusive of merger cost saves will be closer to the mid single-digit range for this year. Prior period that our noninterest expense growth was more naturally in the 3% range, however, the current inflationary pressures, we estimate this to be closer to the 5% to 6% range. We expect a low single-digit percentage increase in adjusted noninterest expense year-over-year, with respect to merger-related expenses moving forward, we expect them to be in the general range of where they were for the second quarter. For your reference, we've included pie graphs on Page 23, showing the composition of our core noninterest income and expense. Page 24 provides balance sheet highlights and key ratios, and I will cover the significant component on subsequent pages. Turning to Page 25 and a bright spot during the quarter. Total loans increased $2.2 billion over the linked quarter or by 13.5% on an annualized basis, exceeding our single -- our mid single-digit guide last quarter as our teams generated production above target levels and prepayments reduced due to increasing interest rates. In the General Bank had an annualized rate of 18.4%, led by the branch network. Growth was primarily concentrated in business and commercial loans. We have continued to add bankers in our commercial business teams, and we think the growth in the second quarter was a result of the continued business development efforts of our branch teams in addition to loan borrowing pulling through ahead of the rising rate environment. Additionally, within the General Bank, we saw growth in residential mortgage loans for the quarter, even the overall mortgage production was down, lower prepayments and the shift in production of the ARM products that we hold on balance sheet contributed to the growth. We continue to be encouraged by the growth in the General Bank as we penetrate higher growth markets and continue to be relevant in our legacy footprint. To expand on Peter's earlier comments on the commercial bank, loans grew at an annualized rate of 8.4%, led by strong growth from a number of our industry verticals, middle-market banking and business capital. Offsetting the growth somewhat, we continue to see loan declines in real estate finance loans due to continued elevated prepayments. However, we are comfortable with our current level of new production in real estate finance, having opted not to increase those levels of production to cover the elevated runoff, given where we are in the economic cycles. On a year-over-year basis, loans increased $1.3 billion or by 2%, excluding the impact of purchase accounting adjustments and PPP runoffs, loans increased by $2.8 billion or 4.3%. The growth from the prior year quarter was in similar areas that I just noted for the linked quarter. As we would step in our outlook section, while we expect to have continued loan momentum in the third quarter, we do expect the pace to moderate from the second quarter. We believe that both the rising rate environment as well as a few larger loans booking in the second quarter will moderate our growth back into the range of mid single-digits in the third quarter. To the extent we exceed those expectations, we view as a positive, as we are pursuing good credit aligned with our risk appetite as Marisa mentioned, and we have increased our rates in line with market movements. So we would expect that growth to further enhance our -- the bank's earnings. For the reference, we've included pie graph on Page 26, showing loan composition by type and segment. Moving to Page 27. Deposits declined $2.3 billion or by 9.9% on an annualized basis, a 2.5% quarter-to-quarter unannualized. The main driver of the declines in the linked quarter was a $3 billion decline in interest-bearing deposits driven by reductions in money market deposits and time deposits, as we sell, the most rate sensitive customers begin to move funds in response to recent Fed rate increases. The reductions were primarily concentrated and acquired higher cost channels, including the direct bank and legacy One West branches. These declines were offset by -- partially offset by growth in noninterest-bearing deposits of $747 million or 11.6% annualized rate, primarily from our branch network. We have been very encouraged by the continued double-digit percentage growth in noninterest-bearing deposits in our branch network, which we attribute to continued emphasis on developing client relationships, which includes not only fulfilling our client lending needs, but also focuses on depository and other banking service needs. Our cost of deposits was 19 basis points, which was flat compared to the linked quarter and down 8 basis points from the second quarter last year. We do remain guarded on the outlook for absolute deposit growth in 2022 as the interest rate environment continues to evolve and the Fed impact liquidity in the system by deleveraging its balance sheet. We do expect to decline in interest-bearing deposits to moderate in the coming months and continue to be partially offset by growth in DDA and checking accounts. For your reference, we have included pie graphs on Page 28, selling deposit composition by type and segment. Moving with age 29, our balance sheet continues to be funded predominantly by core deposits, with total deposits representing over 95% of our funding base at the end of the quarter. Continuing to Page 30, as Marisa mentioned, credit quality remains strong. The net charge-off ratio was 13 basis points, well below historic norms, deterioration in the CECL macroeconomic forecast and strong loan growth, partially offset by improved credit quality led to a $42 million provision for credit losses compared to a $49 million benefit in the prior quarter. The non-accrual ratio improved from 82 basis points to 76 basis points. And despite the positive provision expense, the ACL ratio declined by 3 basis points. Turning to Page 31, we provide a walk forward of the ACL from the first to the second quarter. The ACL was up by $2 million to $850 million. Net charge-offs totaled $22 million during the quarter. Credit metrics held up well and the impact -- and had the impact of reducing the ACL by $19 million. Portfolio mix had the impact of reducing the ACL by $17 million of loan composition shifted out of portfolio as a higher loss rates into those with lower loss rates. While the go-forward macroeconomic forecast shows some deterioration, resulted in a $26 million increase in the ACL. Actual performance remained strong. Growth in the portfolio during the quarter added $34 million. The ACL at quarter end covered annualized net charge-offs 9.6x. Turning to Page 32. Our capital position remains strong, with all ratios above or in the upper end of our target ranges. As of the end of the second quarter, our CET1 ratio was 11.34%, and our total risk-based capital ratio was 14.46%. While we had strong loan growth during the quarter, increasing our risk-weighted assets, we were able to moderately gain capital ratios, given the strength in our core earnings. During the second quarter, tangible book value per share grew modestly from $574 to $579, as strong earnings were partially offset by negative AOCI adjustments. AOCI adjustment for these tangible book value per share down about $30 or by 7%, but way overshadowed by $170 or 41% positive impact due to the CIT acquisition. Turning to Page 34. I will conclude by assessing our financial outlook for the third quarter and for the remaining six months of the year. On Page 34, the first and third columns list our second quarter 2022 and full fiscal year 2021 adjusted actuals for the relevant metrics or balance sheet items. The number in these columns are adjusted for notable items to arrive at core noninterest income and expense. Column 2 provides our guidance for the third quarter and column four for the full fiscal year 2022. From a loan growth perspective, we expect growth to be in the mid single-digit percentage range in the third quarter and in the mid-single to high single-digit range for the year. While we foresee continued mid to high single-digit growth in our branch network, we do continue to feel some pressure on the real estate financing -- finance portfolio due to accelerated prepayments. And while loan growth was robust in the second quarter, the absolute rise in interest rates may temper our customers' appetite to borrow with a moderate overall loan growth from the levels we saw in the second quarter. While mortgage pipelines on production are expected to continue to decline through the rate environment, the corresponding slowdown in prepayments and the shifting of production to ARM products, which we hold on balance sheet should continue to profit mortgage loan growth in the coming quarters. We will continue to proactively add bankers in our wealth, middle market banking and large metro branch network to support loan growth. Our combined cost of funds will continue to afford us opportunities to compete in the large commercial space on high credit rate opportunities that might not have been profitable prior to the merger and collaboration of our general and commercial banking leading teams seeing referrals to each other will help increase loan volumes. On deposits, we expect to see some continued attrition in some of our higher-priced accounts in the third quarter. However, we expect the pace of deposit runoff to slow from the second quarter. We are continuing to take steps to ensure rate offerings in our branches and in the direct bank are competitive. We are also keeping an eye on the global impact of the Fed reducing its balance sheet and the systematic impact this will have on deposits in the system. For the full year, we expect a negative low to mid single-digits deposit decline, given both the rising rate environment as well as our intent to optimize the deposit growth, keeping our beta low. Our expectation is that demand deposit growth will continue at a mid single-digit percentage growth rate. For net charge-offs, we expect a gradual return to pre-pandemic non-stressed levels. We expect net charge-offs in the range of 15 to 25 basis points in the third quarter and 12 to 22 basis points for the full year. The increase in our net charge-off projection is not due to any apparent stress in our portfolios, rather we think the impact on inflation and rising rates may result in our losses returning to more historic levels, which will take closer to the 25 to 30 basis points range for the combined company. Our current forecast assumes that the Fed will raise rates by 125 basis points in the third quarter. 75 basis points already behind us, so 50 more moving forward, ending at a range in the third quarter, up 2.75% to 3%. And so with 50 basis points of hikes in the fourth quarter ending a range of 3.25% to 3.50%. For net interest income, we expect increases in the high single-digits from the second quarter to the third quarter as the full quarter impact of second quarter loan growth is recognized and asset yields continue to improve. The good news is, we are starting to see new borrowing rates, increase in every major products, for example, commercial rates were up approximately 40 basis points compared to the first quarter. Most of these rate increases occurred at the end of the quarter, so we haven't seen that pull through completely to the margin yet. We expect net interest margin to expand again in the third quarter as the increase in earning asset yields outpace the increase in our funding costs. On the full year basis, we expect high teens percentage growth in net interest income, mainly due to the debt redemption improving earning asset yields and loan growth, improving our asset utilization. From a core noninterest income perspective, we do anticipate a negative mid to high single-digit decline compared to the second quarter, mainly driven by the change in our NSFOD policy that took place on July 1. This change is expected to reduce annualized NSFOD revenue by approximately $37 million on an annual basis. Aside from NSFOD changes, we expect wealth revenue to be flat as while we have no minimum brokerage, the broad-based market declines that occurred in the second quarter may present a headwind for trust revenue. We also expect flat to moderate declines in factoring, primarily given seasonal factors. On a full year basis, we expect upper single-digit growth compared to the prior year, mainly due to improvement in net operating lease, wealth and card income offsetting the mid-year impact of the NSFOD changes. From a core noninterest expense standpoint, we expect the third quarter to be flat to low single-digits growth over the second quarter, as continued inflationary pressures and the expense base were offset by several recognition of the merger synergies. For the year, we expect noninterest expense percentage growth to be low single-digits, this represents the core expense growth rate is driven by inflationary pressures in the range of 5% to 6% being offset by the $100 million in additional cost saves, we estimate to be recognized throughout 2022. From a cost savings standpoint, we estimate that $170 million in cost saves is in the run rate currently and we project $200 million to be in the run rate by the fourth quarter of this year. In 2023, we expect $250 million to be in our run rate by the fourth quarter. To close, we are very pleased with our second quarter results, excited about the share repurchase plan, and the hard work put in by our associates to make all of this happen. With that, I will turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: . Our first question comes from Stephen Scouten from Piper Sandler.\nStephen Scouten: Just one quick clarifier first. I was curious when you expect it to actually begin the share repurchase plan?\nCraig Nix: We're planning August 1. Fairly immediately.\nStephen Scouten: Great. And then just as I look at the updates in the guidance, I guess the biggest delta or the biggest change quarter-over-quarter was really in the deposit guidance to this now low to mid single-digit decline. And obviously, we saw the higher cost deposits down pretty materially this quarter. So I'm wondering, has that been a little bit faster for this given the faster pace of rate hikes? Or have there been any other changes that's led to that change in the guidance? And then just within that, I wanted to confirm that you felt like you've reached kind of your efficient mix on your balance sheet and wouldn't expect to see further liquidity reductions from here?\nCraig Nix: The answer to the first question, deposits run off in the second quarter was slightly above what we would have projected. Some of that is seasonal due to tax season. We're feeling really good about our liquidity position right now. And in fact, the earnings asset mix really optimized during the quarter with overnight investments, investment securities and loans within our desired target range of earning assets. In fact, we have a little bit more room to grow in loans and a little bit more room to reduce cash, quite frankly. So we're pleased -- and don't foresee any liquidity issues moving forward and our ability to fund loan growth, earning asset growth. Tom, would you like to add anything to that?\nTom Eklund: No, I think you did it.\nStephen Scouten: Okay. And then, I guess just my follow-up question would be maybe around the loan growth and kind of where you saw that from a legacy markets versus new markets? And then maybe even as you guys kind of outlined on Slide 11, if you could give us a feel for how that production and that strong growth this quarter kind of fell within that lower risk profile of the legacy platform to the higher to moderate risk segments as well kind of from a composition perspective?\nCraig Nix: Okay. I would just say at a high level, we were pleased that the loan growth was strong across the board, it's broad. The main drivers would be commercial and business loans and the branch network, they were up $1.1 billion and a 17% annualized. As mentioned, mortgage, primarily ARM loans, they were up $535 million, a 26.8% annualized. Commercial finance within the Commercial Bank, Peter alluded to, loans were up $640 million, 6.3% annualized. Business capital, our leasing line of business were up $233 million, which is 20% annualized. We did see a $326 million decline in real estate finance line, it's about 21%, it's an annualized reduction, although production is pretty good there, even though we had a decline. If you break it down within commercial finance, we saw -- as alluded to strengthening the verticals. And primarily, that was concentrated in energy, healthcare, telecom. And middle-market banking also had a very good quarter. Just looking forward, we're encouraged that pipelines are strong. They're beginning to see referrals to the Commercial Bank from the legacy FCB lines of business. So we do see continued loan growth going forward, but somewhat muted. And in terms of -- I think you had a question about when we change our risk appetite, we stuck right with our risk appetite. Marisa, do you have any comments there to add to that?\nMarisa Harney: Well, I'd just say, given the businesses that Craig referred to, with General Bank and the branch originated business really falls within that legacy First Citizens primarily green, if you want to refer to -- as you're referring to Page 11. The growth in -- and that's true on the consumer side and on the small business side. The growth in the commercial verticals, our energy group is very strong in renewables, and our healthcare group has been growing strong in healthcare, real estate, a little different, and we treat that a little bit differently in terms of our appetite versus commercial -- general, commercial real estate. So I would say that we're sticking to our netting. There was not an emphasis to grow by taking additional risk and certainly not in those areas that we would consider to be higher risk given the red.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brady Gailey from KBW.\nBrady Gailey: So Craig, I heard your comments that accretable yield and PPP added minimal impacts in the quarter, which is a little surprising, especially on the accretable yield side, given CIT wasn't closed that long ago. I think you guys had $33 million of accretable yield last quarter. So what -- maybe just what's the dollar amount of accretable yield that you realized in the second quarter?\nCraig Nix: So in the second quarter, accretable yield recognized is $22 million, so close to $60 million for the year. It is additive, so net interest margin would have been 8 basis points lower in absolute terms during the current quarter around it. But our purchase accounting investments overall were very immaterial to the balance sheet. The $21.6 million, representing only 3% of net interest income. So it had 8 basis points impact on the NIM, and that was 2 basis points on yield on earning assets accreted. So it was really sort of neutral to loans, 2 basis points primarily evolved around investment. And it was 6 basis points favorable to the confidences bearing liabilities. So that's the component of it. We don't really talk much about it, because it is so immaterial, but that's a good question. And hopefully, that straightens that out. We just don't expect that to have a material impact going forward.\nBrady Gailey: And I'm guessing as the PPP winds down, the PPP impact was fairly minimal in the second quarter. I think it was about $9.5 million last quarter. I'm guessing it's down from that this quarter.\nCraig Nix: Yes. It has an insignificant impact at this point in time. We're actually going to stop talking about it. Next quarter...\nBrady Gailey: Okay. I'll just find on the -- All right. And then on the buyback, it's a nice buyback announcement this morning. How do you think about the buy back longer-term, I mean, just  the next year, but beyond the next year, I mean, do you think that a buyback is just kind of always something that you guys will have in place? Or is this more of a one-time, \"hey, we have a lot of excess capital. We're going to get common equity Tier 1 closer to 10%, and then you'll kind of be done with the buyback.\" How do you think about it?\nCraig Nix: Well, I mean, all things being equal, I think you would see us continue the buy back, obviously, we can't predict the future with a lot of accuracy, but based on where we believe that we will land on our CET1 ratio with respect to this particular plan, we do believe that we will have excess capacity to continue. Obviously, that contains loan growth, that contains with economic situation, et cetera. But they saw on a steady state, we would continue to kind of stay in plan.\nBrady Gailey: All right. And then finally for me, I just wanted to ask a question on the picture of the rail car business. It's not something that legacy First Citizens was involved in. But as you've gotten to know it over the last couple of years, do you think that rail car will be around longer-term at First Citizens? Or do you think that that's a business that -- if it made sense to sell that business, it'd be a little bit of an earnings headwind, but it'd probably be a nice tangible book value gain. Is that a business that you could look to sell longer-term?\nCraig Nix: Longer-term, I can't address longer-term. But right now, we're very pleased with the rail. It's generating 27% of our noninterest income, performing well, we have good experience teams there. So we like the business. And they plan to exit at this time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Christopher Marinac from Janney Montgomery Scott.\nChristopher Marinac: I wanted to ask about the scenario about the margin, if the Fed were to stop raising rates or perhaps you can go backwards. Is that something that you think about protecting? Is there sort of a window of kind of trying to capture as much as you can, while the Fed is still tightening?\nTom Eklund: Yes, that's a great question. We're looking at asset sensitivity on our balance sheets, going through our analysis. So you saw a decline slightly quarter-over-quarter cash balance at the time there. We feel comfortable when we see it, we're slightly asset sensitive, but we don't feel like we're overly positioned for rising or falling rates.\nChristopher Marinac: And then just I guess looking out beyond the charge-offs guide before this year, do you see any signal that support any higher losses in the next year? Or at this juncture, would it be fair to think that the loss pace could kind of be intact as we head into the beginning part of next year?\nCraig Nix: I think it's very possible to be intact based on leading indicators. If we look at eight or nine just high-level credit quality indicators and eight of the nine are better or much better than they were pre-pandemic. So there's really nothing indicating that we will return to the historic norms, but that continues quickly as we all know. So we might have a bit of conservatism in that charge-off ratio as it relates to the remainder of this year, and potentially into next year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Foran from Autonomous Research.\nBrian Foran: I think you covered a lot of what I was going to ask already. Maybe just -- am I thinking about the buyback and capital, right? I mean, it seems like you've been using up this, you'd still probably be maybe at the midpoint to slightly above the kind of 9% or 11% CET1 range by middle of next year. I know there's a lot of moving parts. But do you have a sense of where you think this buyback will take you to on a CET1 basis?\nCraig Nix: Yes. We're hedging it to around 10.6%, this will be 60 basis points over the high end of our CET1 range. So now we're talking about excess capital, all things being equal. We're very encouraged by that, although we would certainly like to have a more optimal capital level. This particular repurchase is depending on price to take us to 10.6% at its conclusion.\nBrian Foran: And then the noninterest-bearing deposit growth was definitely a stand out this quarter. Most other banks had pretty chunky declines there. I know you touched on it in the presentation, but can you just maybe give us a little bit under the hood? Like, is it small and midsized businesses that you're growing? Or what do you think drove that kind of divergence where you were able to grow than almost every other bank strength this quarter?\nCraig Nix: Well, about half of our DDA deposits are commercial. And we do see a lot of growth there, because that's our go-to-market strategy, sort of a move alone loan type approach there, and it always has been an emphasis. And we continue to see double-digit growth, that's really about all the ways to it.\nOperator: Thank you. I am not showing any further questions at this time. Therefore, I'd like to turn the call back over to our host, Deanna Hart for any closing remarks. Deanna, please go ahead.\nDeanna Hart: Thank you. And everyone, again, thank you for participating in our call today. We appreciate your ongoing interest in our company. And if you have any further questions or need additional information, please feel free to reach out to the Investor Relations team through our website. I hope you have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may all disconnect. Have a wonderful day ahead.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Craig Nix",
            "content": "Great. Thank you, Marisa, and hello, everyone. I'm going to start on Page 13. I will begin with second quarter takeaways, which as Frank mentioned points to another strong quarter of financial performance. As Frank mentioned, we are excited to resume our share repurchase program, which has been suspended since the third quarter of 2020. We believe the share repurchases will allow us to return to more optimal capital levels, while leaving room for organic growth, deliver higher returns on capital and earnings per share, and return capital to our shareholders in the most cost efficient way. Pre-provision net revenue growth continues to be a bright spot. PPNR adjusted for notable items grew by 17.1% over the linked quarter and by 38.5% over the second quarter of last year. Positive operating leverage of 6.9% and 12.8% was achieved for the linked and comparable quarters, respectively, as revenue growth exceeded expense growth by a wide margin in both periods. The most significant contributing factor to PPNR growth was a 7.9% increase in net interest income over the linked quarter and a 14.4% increase over the comparable quarter last year. Net interest margin expanded by 31 basis points from 2.73% to 3.04% during the second quarter. We also are pleased with expense management, especially given inflation headwinds. Our efficiency ratio improved to 57.55% during the quarter, due to strong net revenue growth and the continued recognition of merger cost savings that Frank alluded to earlier. We had a provision build during the quarter after having several quarters of provision reversals as COVID-related reserves were released. The build during the current quarter increased provision expense over the linked quarter by $91 million. The current quarter build was primarily related to a deterioration in the CECL macroeconomic forecast, used to arrive at the ACL, as well as maintenance reserves to cover net charge-offs and loan growth. Despite the provision build, the ACL remains fairly stable in terms of dollars and the ACL ratio declined 3 basis points from 1.29% to 1.26%. As Marisa mentioned, credit quality remains excellent. The net charge-off ratio during the quarter remained below historic norms at 13 basis points and the nonaccrual ratio declined during the quarter to 0.76%. Loan growth exceeded our expectations this quarter, growing at an annualized rate of 13.5% and by 14.3% ex-PPP. Growth was strong broadly in both the Commercial and General Bank business segments. And finally, total deposits declined during the quarter as higher cost acquired deposits ran all. However, the decline was partially offset by strong growth in noninterest-bearing deposits in our branch network. Now turning to Page 14, I will touch on the financial highlights for the quarter. Please note that our GAAP results are presented on Pages 36 through 38 in the appendix. The primary focus of my comments today will be on supplemental reporting, which combines legacy BancShares and legacy CIT for historical periods presented with adjustments to account for the after-tax basis of notable items such as gains and expenses, associated with the merger, gains and losses on sale and debt extinguishment and other nonrecurring non-core items. GAAP net income for the second quarter was $255 million, a $14.86 per share. On an adjusted basis, net income was $287 million or $16.86 per share, yielding an annualized ROE of 11.9% and an ROA of 1.07%. On to Page 15, we present two condensed income statement. The one at the top representing our reported GAAP results for the first and second quarters of '22. And the results as of legacy FCB and CIT are combined for the second quarter of 2021. The second in the middle summarizes the impact of notable items to derive the adjusted results at the bottom of the page from the reported results. Page 17 provides a detailed listing of the notable items affecting the quarter and year-to-date periods, along with their impact on these line items and diluted earnings per share. Focusing on the adjusted results at the bottom of the page, net income available to common shareholders was $270 million for the second quarter, down from $299 million in the first quarter and $286 million in the second quarter of the prior year. The decline for both periods were due to increases in provisions for credit losses of USD91 million and USD136 million, respectively, as reserves were build in the current quarter and release for the comparable quarters. The increase in provision expense was largely offset by PPNR growth, which increased by $60 million or 16.8% over the linked quarter and by $114 million or 37.6% over the comparable quarter a year ago. The increases for both periods were driven by positive operating leverage as net revenue grew at a faster pace than expenses. Page 16 provides a view of our year-to-date result on the same basis for your reference. Page 17 provides detail with respect to notable items for the relative quarterly and year-to-date periods. During the second quarter, these adjusted -- minimal net impact of adding $2 to GAAP EPS. Starting on Page 18, I'll touch on the major trends impacting our operating results. And as noted otherwise, the historical financial trends on the upcoming pages are consolidated, as if the merger took place during the period presented. Net interest income totaled $700 million for the quarter, up 7.9% over the first quarter, and 14.4% over the second quarter last year. The drivers of the increase over the linked quarter were loan growth, higher yields on earning assets and the $3 billion debt redemption that occurred in February. The yield on earning assets increased by 29 basis points, and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities remains fairly stable, declining by 1 basis point, primarily due to the debt redemption only partially offset by a 2 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing deposits. Analysis for the comparable quarter and year-to-date periods are presented on Page 18 for your reference. Now turning to Page 19. We highlight the drivers of the 31 and 48 basis points margin expansion from the linked and comparable prior year quarters respectively. We continue to see positive impact from the debt redemption that took place at the end of February, allowing us to eliminate a higher cost funding channel and rebalance our mix of earning assets. This coupled with strong loan growth in reductions in interest-bearing deposits, eliminated the excess liquidity that we have had on our balance sheet since the start of the pandemic. The 31 basis points increase in margin from the linked quarter was due to the impact of higher loan yields and strong loan growth, the impact of the debt redemption and expanding yields on investment securities and overnight investments, partially offset by a small decline in SBA-PPP income and slightly higher interest-bearing deposit costs. With respect to earning asset yields, the loan yield increased by 13 basis points over the linked quarter, as we started to benefit from the recent rate increases. Purchase accounting and PPP income impact on the loan yield was minimal. We expect the loan yield to continue to increase as we recognize the full benefit of rate increases as many of our variable rate loans did not reset until the start of the third quarter, given floors that were embedded in some of them. The yield on our earnings -- on our investment securities portfolio increased by 14 basis points during the quarter, and we expect continued improvement throughout the remainder of the year. The improved yield was driven by higher reinvestment rates and lower prepayments and premium amortization on our MBS portfolio. The yield on purchase volumes during the quarter averaged 3.5% compared to the overall portfolio yield of 1.85%. NIM was up in the comparable quarter by 48 basis points, some of them exist that I stressed in the linked quarter with the exception of the timing deposit rate and a higher investment securities balance, both of which provided for additional expansion, partially offset by a $1.1 billion decline in average loan balances, lower purchase accounting accretion and SBA-PPP income. Looking ahead, while we expect interest expense to increase, we expect interest income will increase at a faster pace, leading to further growth in net interest income over the coming quarters. And at this time, we expect the earning asset yield will increase at a faster pace than the cost of funding them, thus leading to continued expansion of net interest margin. Turning to Page 20. The line graph on the left hand side of the page indicate, we continue to be asset sensitive, albeit slightly less than in the prior quarters due to a reduction in rate sensitive assets. As we noted before, we have been operating the liquidity above normal operating ranges for a number of quarters, and we're able to optimize our asset mix during the second quarter. We have and will continue to take a measured approach to interest and market rate risk management to position our balance sheet to benefit from higher interest rates, while at the same time providing downside protection, should interest rates fall in the future. We estimate that a 100 basis point shock in rates with increased net interest income by 5.2% and a 100 basis point ramp that increased it by 2% over the next 12 months. The main drivers of our asset sensitivity are our variable rate loan portfolios, which represents 43% of total loans, our cash position and expected modest deposit betas driven by our strong core deposit base. We model our blended deposit beta between 20% and 25%, which is aligned with historical experience and a rising rate environment. Core noninterest income, turning to Page 21, increased by $3 million over the linked quarter, or by 1.1%. The increase is primarily due to higher capital markets and wealth management income, partially offset by a decline in net rental income or operating leases due to higher depreciation and maintenance expenses despite growth in gross rental income. While net operating lease income was down compared to the prior quarter, we are encouraged by the continued growth this quarter in gross operating lease income, a further reflection of rail utilization increasing to 96% from 95.5% in the first quarter and 90% last year. We see further momentum here as repricing rates were 114% of first quarter prices. The higher depreciation expense was related to an update on salvage values and operating leases. And moving forward, we expect quarterly depreciation to be in the range of the average experience for the first two quarters of this year. The increase in maintenance expense was expected as a higher percentage of cars renewed leases during the quarter and the impact of inflation. The timing of maintenance expense can be lumpy, however, we expect moving forward it to be in the range of what we experienced in the second quarter to slightly higher moving forward. The increase in wealth management income was led by our brokers channel, which offset some of the pressure we felt in trust from broad-based equity and bond market decline. In brokerage, the income was driven by slight safety of production in both annuities and structured products was significantly up in the second quarter. We do expect further momentum in workers in the second half of the year, which will help offset headwinds from declining asset value. Our assets under management declined to $31.7 billion in the second quarter, down from $32.2 billion in the previous quarter, compared to the second quarter of '21, however, assets under management are up $1.4 billion, which reflects continued client acquisition efforts and expansion of our wealth management sales teams. Regarding capital markets fees, we saw an increase of $4 million from the prior quarter, with a slightly higher number of total deals. While the quarter-over-quarter experience was positive, the overall outlook is muted as industry-wide issuance is down year-over-year and is expected to continue to be down, given the absolute rate environment. Core noninterest income increased by $37 million as compared to the second quarter of last year, led by increases in net rental income on operating leases, service charges on deposits and wealth management income, all partially offset by a decline in mortgage income. Net rental income was higher due to increased utilization, as discussed earlier. In wealth management, the increase was led by workers and trust. The increase in service charges is split between commercial and individual with commercial led by pricing increases in client acquisition and individual charges rising above the press levels in the second quarter of '21, as a result of consumer stimulus. Turning to the remainder of 2022, we expect continued momentum in our wealth, merchant, card and wealthy income producing businesses. While service charges on deposits will decline as we enacted the NSFOD policy changes at the beginning of the third quarter, we anticipate a high single-digit percentage increase in adjusted noninterest income year-over-year. With respect to the lost fee income from NSFOD fees, we are looking for opportunities to offset it by broadening customer relationships to product offerings that will add value, such as card, merchant, wealth and treasury payment services. Now turning to Page 22. Noninterest expense adjusted for depreciation and maintenance on operating leases was $609 million, a $77 million decline from the linked quarter and a $55 million increase over the second quarter last year. The $77 million decline from the linked quarter was due to a $101 million decline in merger-related expenses, partially offset by a $27 million reversal of expense in the first quarter related to the termination of two legacy retiree benefit plans and a $6 million decline in core noninterest expense. In terms of the decline in merger-related expenses, the first quarter included more significant deal-related change in control, retention and severance payments, as well as legal and consulting costs. Our total estimate for one-time merger expenses is still in line with the $445 million we guided at the beginning of the year. The $6 million decline in core noninterest expense from the linked quarter was primarily related to an $11 million reduction in personnel costs driven by lower benefit expenses, lower incentive compensation and higher deferred origination costs. Partially offset by higher salary expense due to annual merit increases and net staff additions. The net staff additions are a result of building out teams to support our move to large bank compliance as well as the backfill vacancies from the prior quarter. Personnel expense is one of the areas, where we are facing the greatest inflationary pressures, especially as it relates to new hires, but the impact of new hires are somewhat muted in the quarter driven by the continued recognition of cost saves. Analysis for the comparable quarter and year-to-date periods are presented on Page 22 for your reference. Before I leave noninterest expense though, the big takeaway here is that our efficiency ratio improved to 57.55% during the quarter. Its core net revenue growth outpaced core expense growth for both comparable periods. When we initially announced the merger, we estimated a mid-50s efficiency ratio once we are fully synergized and the improvement this quarter in the efficiency ratio is in line with us hitting those expectations. As Frank mentioned, we expect positive operating leverage from further net interest income expansion and muted expense growth from cost saves helping to temper inflationary pressures. Therefore, we expect the efficiency ratio to continue to trend down to the mid-50s in the current -- in the coming quarters. With respect to inflation, we are feeling pressure in wages, professional services and time track costs. We do expect, however, as we are able to remove another $30 million out of our cost base this year, it will help neutralize the natural noninterest expense growth that exclusive of merger cost saves will be closer to the mid single-digit range for this year. Prior period that our noninterest expense growth was more naturally in the 3% range, however, the current inflationary pressures, we estimate this to be closer to the 5% to 6% range. We expect a low single-digit percentage increase in adjusted noninterest expense year-over-year, with respect to merger-related expenses moving forward, we expect them to be in the general range of where they were for the second quarter. For your reference, we've included pie graphs on Page 23, showing the composition of our core noninterest income and expense. Page 24 provides balance sheet highlights and key ratios, and I will cover the significant component on subsequent pages. Turning to Page 25 and a bright spot during the quarter. Total loans increased $2.2 billion over the linked quarter or by 13.5% on an annualized basis, exceeding our single -- our mid single-digit guide last quarter as our teams generated production above target levels and prepayments reduced due to increasing interest rates. In the General Bank had an annualized rate of 18.4%, led by the branch network. Growth was primarily concentrated in business and commercial loans. We have continued to add bankers in our commercial business teams, and we think the growth in the second quarter was a result of the continued business development efforts of our branch teams in addition to loan borrowing pulling through ahead of the rising rate environment. Additionally, within the General Bank, we saw growth in residential mortgage loans for the quarter, even the overall mortgage production was down, lower prepayments and the shift in production of the ARM products that we hold on balance sheet contributed to the growth. We continue to be encouraged by the growth in the General Bank as we penetrate higher growth markets and continue to be relevant in our legacy footprint. To expand on Peter's earlier comments on the commercial bank, loans grew at an annualized rate of 8.4%, led by strong growth from a number of our industry verticals, middle-market banking and business capital. Offsetting the growth somewhat, we continue to see loan declines in real estate finance loans due to continued elevated prepayments. However, we are comfortable with our current level of new production in real estate finance, having opted not to increase those levels of production to cover the elevated runoff, given where we are in the economic cycles. On a year-over-year basis, loans increased $1.3 billion or by 2%, excluding the impact of purchase accounting adjustments and PPP runoffs, loans increased by $2.8 billion or 4.3%. The growth from the prior year quarter was in similar areas that I just noted for the linked quarter. As we would step in our outlook section, while we expect to have continued loan momentum in the third quarter, we do expect the pace to moderate from the second quarter. We believe that both the rising rate environment as well as a few larger loans booking in the second quarter will moderate our growth back into the range of mid single-digits in the third quarter. To the extent we exceed those expectations, we view as a positive, as we are pursuing good credit aligned with our risk appetite as Marisa mentioned, and we have increased our rates in line with market movements. So we would expect that growth to further enhance our -- the bank's earnings. For the reference, we've included pie graph on Page 26, showing loan composition by type and segment. Moving to Page 27. Deposits declined $2.3 billion or by 9.9% on an annualized basis, a 2.5% quarter-to-quarter unannualized. The main driver of the declines in the linked quarter was a $3 billion decline in interest-bearing deposits driven by reductions in money market deposits and time deposits, as we sell, the most rate sensitive customers begin to move funds in response to recent Fed rate increases. The reductions were primarily concentrated and acquired higher cost channels, including the direct bank and legacy One West branches. These declines were offset by -- partially offset by growth in noninterest-bearing deposits of $747 million or 11.6% annualized rate, primarily from our branch network. We have been very encouraged by the continued double-digit percentage growth in noninterest-bearing deposits in our branch network, which we attribute to continued emphasis on developing client relationships, which includes not only fulfilling our client lending needs, but also focuses on depository and other banking service needs. Our cost of deposits was 19 basis points, which was flat compared to the linked quarter and down 8 basis points from the second quarter last year. We do remain guarded on the outlook for absolute deposit growth in 2022 as the interest rate environment continues to evolve and the Fed impact liquidity in the system by deleveraging its balance sheet. We do expect to decline in interest-bearing deposits to moderate in the coming months and continue to be partially offset by growth in DDA and checking accounts. For your reference, we have included pie graphs on Page 28, selling deposit composition by type and segment. Moving with age 29, our balance sheet continues to be funded predominantly by core deposits, with total deposits representing over 95% of our funding base at the end of the quarter. Continuing to Page 30, as Marisa mentioned, credit quality remains strong. The net charge-off ratio was 13 basis points, well below historic norms, deterioration in the CECL macroeconomic forecast and strong loan growth, partially offset by improved credit quality led to a $42 million provision for credit losses compared to a $49 million benefit in the prior quarter. The non-accrual ratio improved from 82 basis points to 76 basis points. And despite the positive provision expense, the ACL ratio declined by 3 basis points. Turning to Page 31, we provide a walk forward of the ACL from the first to the second quarter. The ACL was up by $2 million to $850 million. Net charge-offs totaled $22 million during the quarter. Credit metrics held up well and the impact -- and had the impact of reducing the ACL by $19 million. Portfolio mix had the impact of reducing the ACL by $17 million of loan composition shifted out of portfolio as a higher loss rates into those with lower loss rates. While the go-forward macroeconomic forecast shows some deterioration, resulted in a $26 million increase in the ACL. Actual performance remained strong. Growth in the portfolio during the quarter added $34 million. The ACL at quarter end covered annualized net charge-offs 9.6x. Turning to Page 32. Our capital position remains strong, with all ratios above or in the upper end of our target ranges. As of the end of the second quarter, our CET1 ratio was 11.34%, and our total risk-based capital ratio was 14.46%. While we had strong loan growth during the quarter, increasing our risk-weighted assets, we were able to moderately gain capital ratios, given the strength in our core earnings. During the second quarter, tangible book value per share grew modestly from $574 to $579, as strong earnings were partially offset by negative AOCI adjustments. AOCI adjustment for these tangible book value per share down about $30 or by 7%, but way overshadowed by $170 or 41% positive impact due to the CIT acquisition. Turning to Page 34. I will conclude by assessing our financial outlook for the third quarter and for the remaining six months of the year. On Page 34, the first and third columns list our second quarter 2022 and full fiscal year 2021 adjusted actuals for the relevant metrics or balance sheet items. The number in these columns are adjusted for notable items to arrive at core noninterest income and expense. Column 2 provides our guidance for the third quarter and column four for the full fiscal year 2022. From a loan growth perspective, we expect growth to be in the mid single-digit percentage range in the third quarter and in the mid-single to high single-digit range for the year. While we foresee continued mid to high single-digit growth in our branch network, we do continue to feel some pressure on the real estate financing -- finance portfolio due to accelerated prepayments. And while loan growth was robust in the second quarter, the absolute rise in interest rates may temper our customers' appetite to borrow with a moderate overall loan growth from the levels we saw in the second quarter. While mortgage pipelines on production are expected to continue to decline through the rate environment, the corresponding slowdown in prepayments and the shifting of production to ARM products, which we hold on balance sheet should continue to profit mortgage loan growth in the coming quarters. We will continue to proactively add bankers in our wealth, middle market banking and large metro branch network to support loan growth. Our combined cost of funds will continue to afford us opportunities to compete in the large commercial space on high credit rate opportunities that might not have been profitable prior to the merger and collaboration of our general and commercial banking leading teams seeing referrals to each other will help increase loan volumes. On deposits, we expect to see some continued attrition in some of our higher-priced accounts in the third quarter. However, we expect the pace of deposit runoff to slow from the second quarter. We are continuing to take steps to ensure rate offerings in our branches and in the direct bank are competitive. We are also keeping an eye on the global impact of the Fed reducing its balance sheet and the systematic impact this will have on deposits in the system. For the full year, we expect a negative low to mid single-digits deposit decline, given both the rising rate environment as well as our intent to optimize the deposit growth, keeping our beta low. Our expectation is that demand deposit growth will continue at a mid single-digit percentage growth rate. For net charge-offs, we expect a gradual return to pre-pandemic non-stressed levels. We expect net charge-offs in the range of 15 to 25 basis points in the third quarter and 12 to 22 basis points for the full year. The increase in our net charge-off projection is not due to any apparent stress in our portfolios, rather we think the impact on inflation and rising rates may result in our losses returning to more historic levels, which will take closer to the 25 to 30 basis points range for the combined company. Our current forecast assumes that the Fed will raise rates by 125 basis points in the third quarter. 75 basis points already behind us, so 50 more moving forward, ending at a range in the third quarter, up 2.75% to 3%. And so with 50 basis points of hikes in the fourth quarter ending a range of 3.25% to 3.50%. For net interest income, we expect increases in the high single-digits from the second quarter to the third quarter as the full quarter impact of second quarter loan growth is recognized and asset yields continue to improve. The good news is, we are starting to see new borrowing rates, increase in every major products, for example, commercial rates were up approximately 40 basis points compared to the first quarter. Most of these rate increases occurred at the end of the quarter, so we haven't seen that pull through completely to the margin yet. We expect net interest margin to expand again in the third quarter as the increase in earning asset yields outpace the increase in our funding costs. On the full year basis, we expect high teens percentage growth in net interest income, mainly due to the debt redemption improving earning asset yields and loan growth, improving our asset utilization. From a core noninterest income perspective, we do anticipate a negative mid to high single-digit decline compared to the second quarter, mainly driven by the change in our NSFOD policy that took place on July 1. This change is expected to reduce annualized NSFOD revenue by approximately $37 million on an annual basis. Aside from NSFOD changes, we expect wealth revenue to be flat as while we have no minimum brokerage, the broad-based market declines that occurred in the second quarter may present a headwind for trust revenue. We also expect flat to moderate declines in factoring, primarily given seasonal factors. On a full year basis, we expect upper single-digit growth compared to the prior year, mainly due to improvement in net operating lease, wealth and card income offsetting the mid-year impact of the NSFOD changes. From a core noninterest expense standpoint, we expect the third quarter to be flat to low single-digits growth over the second quarter, as continued inflationary pressures and the expense base were offset by several recognition of the merger synergies. For the year, we expect noninterest expense percentage growth to be low single-digits, this represents the core expense growth rate is driven by inflationary pressures in the range of 5% to 6% being offset by the $100 million in additional cost saves, we estimate to be recognized throughout 2022. From a cost savings standpoint, we estimate that $170 million in cost saves is in the run rate currently and we project $200 million to be in the run rate by the fourth quarter of this year. In 2023, we expect $250 million to be in our run rate by the fourth quarter. To close, we are very pleased with our second quarter results, excited about the share repurchase plan, and the hard work put in by our associates to make all of this happen. With that, I will turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. We're planning August 1. Fairly immediately. The answer to the first question, deposits run off in the second quarter was slightly above what we would have projected. Some of that is seasonal due to tax season. We're feeling really good about our liquidity position right now. And in fact, the earnings asset mix really optimized during the quarter with overnight investments, investment securities and loans within our desired target range of earning assets. In fact, we have a little bit more room to grow in loans and a little bit more room to reduce cash, quite frankly. So we're pleased -- and don't foresee any liquidity issues moving forward and our ability to fund loan growth, earning asset growth. Tom, would you like to add anything to that? Okay. I would just say at a high level, we were pleased that the loan growth was strong across the board, it's broad. The main drivers would be commercial and business loans and the branch network, they were up $1.1 billion and a 17% annualized. As mentioned, mortgage, primarily ARM loans, they were up $535 million, a 26.8% annualized. Commercial finance within the Commercial Bank, Peter alluded to, loans were up $640 million, 6.3% annualized. Business capital, our leasing line of business were up $233 million, which is 20% annualized. We did see a $326 million decline in real estate finance line, it's about 21%, it's an annualized reduction, although production is pretty good there, even though we had a decline. If you break it down within commercial finance, we saw -- as alluded to strengthening the verticals. And primarily, that was concentrated in energy, healthcare, telecom. And middle-market banking also had a very good quarter. Just looking forward, we're encouraged that pipelines are strong. They're beginning to see referrals to the Commercial Bank from the legacy FCB lines of business. So we do see continued loan growth going forward, but somewhat muted. And in terms of -- I think you had a question about when we change our risk appetite, we stuck right with our risk appetite. Marisa, do you have any comments there to add to that? So in the second quarter, accretable yield recognized is $22 million, so close to $60 million for the year. It is additive, so net interest margin would have been 8 basis points lower in absolute terms during the current quarter around it. But our purchase accounting investments overall were very immaterial to the balance sheet. The $21.6 million, representing only 3% of net interest income. So it had 8 basis points impact on the NIM, and that was 2 basis points on yield on earning assets accreted. So it was really sort of neutral to loans, 2 basis points primarily evolved around investment. And it was 6 basis points favorable to the confidences bearing liabilities. So that's the component of it. We don't really talk much about it, because it is so immaterial, but that's a good question. And hopefully, that straightens that out. We just don't expect that to have a material impact going forward. Yes. It has an insignificant impact at this point in time. We're actually going to stop talking about it. Next quarter... Well, I mean, all things being equal, I think you would see us continue the buy back, obviously, we can't predict the future with a lot of accuracy, but based on where we believe that we will land on our CET1 ratio with respect to this particular plan, we do believe that we will have excess capacity to continue. Obviously, that contains loan growth, that contains with economic situation, et cetera. But they saw on a steady state, we would continue to kind of stay in plan. Longer-term, I can't address longer-term. But right now, we're very pleased with the rail. It's generating 27% of our noninterest income, performing well, we have good experience teams there. So we like the business. And they plan to exit at this time. I think it's very possible to be intact based on leading indicators. If we look at eight or nine just high-level credit quality indicators and eight of the nine are better or much better than they were pre-pandemic. So there's really nothing indicating that we will return to the historic norms, but that continues quickly as we all know. So we might have a bit of conservatism in that charge-off ratio as it relates to the remainder of this year, and potentially into next year. Yes. We're hedging it to around 10.6%, this will be 60 basis points over the high end of our CET1 range. So now we're talking about excess capital, all things being equal. We're very encouraged by that, although we would certainly like to have a more optimal capital level. This particular repurchase is depending on price to take us to 10.6% at its conclusion. Well, about half of our DDA deposits are commercial. And we do see a lot of growth there, because that's our go-to-market strategy, sort of a move alone loan type approach there, and it always has been an emphasis. And we continue to see double-digit growth, that's really about all the ways to it."

We feel comfortable when we see it, we're slightly asset sensitive, but we don't feel like we're overly positioned for rising or falling rates."

We appreciate all of you joining us today, and we hope this call will be informative and give you a sense of where we've been as well as where we're headed in the second half of the year. We announced another quarter of solid financial results this morning and remain excited and optimistic about the direction of our company. While we recognize there are some economic uncertainties in the current environment. Our customers, by and large, continue to be in good shape and our portfolios are performing well. We saw positive momentum in net interest income as a result of the recent increases -- recent rate increases, as well as an improved mix of earning assets driven by a solid quarter of loan growth, all leading to another quarter of positive operating leverage. We're excited to announce that our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase point, which will allow us to repurchase up to 1.5 million shares of our Class A common stock over the next 12 months, representing approximately 9.4% of our total common shares outstanding. Returning excess capital to our shareholders is a key strategic focus, and we are excited about this opportunity to execute on the plan. Turning to Page 5 of the investor presentation. We are now substantially complete with merger integration and are continuing to concentrate our efforts on optimization of our processes and operations. We recently completed the former One West bank branch conversion with no significant issues, thanks to the dedication of our hard working integration team. Our long-term focus, attention to relationships and diversity of our business segments have positioned us well for the future, which we are extremely excited about. Turning to Page 6. I'm going to provide a quick update on our cost savings initiatives. If you'll remember in the first quarter call, we talked -- we reported cost savings to date of $100 million. Since that time, we've made good progress reducing our annual expense run rate by another $70 million increase in the cost savings to date of $170 million or 68% of our $250 million target. The largest reduction to date has been in personnel expense, but we've additionally benefited from savings in areas such as FDIC insurance, professional fees and third-party processing expenses. We remain confident in our ability to achieve our $250 million cost savings target by the end of 2023. We've also been hard at work on many of our strategic business objectives, which include building out capabilities across various lines of business to recognize revenue synergies as a combined company. And with that, Peter Bristow, our President, who leads our Commercial Bank and Rail Business segments will provide an update on the state of those businesses. Peter?"

            "name": "Marisa Harney",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everybody. As Peter noted, reducing credit risk was a strategic initiative for CIT in the years leading up to our merger with First Citizens and managing this risk remains critically important given the macroeconomic uncertainties we're all facing today. And as Frank mentioned earlier, loan growth has been solid this quarter as we continue to originate business in areas where we believe there are opportunities, while maintaining consistent underwriting standards. We continue to manage our portfolio prudently and effectively, and I want to take a minute to demonstrate how legacy CIT executed on these efforts prior to the merger, positioning our commercial bank for long-term success. Beginning with Page 9 of the presentation, I'd like to provide an overview of the legacy CIT profile, specifically related to changes that were initiated following the 2008, 2009 financial crisis. And those efforts were aimed at strengthening the portfolio. As depicted on the slide, CIT sold or significantly reduced high-risk portfolios that were deemed likely to cause stress in times of economic disruption. As part of our multi-year transformation, we exited many of the riskiest asset classes that were in our portfolio going into the last credit cycle, including subprime mortgages, mezzanine and subordinated commercial real estate loans and private student loans. We also exited businesses with higher credit risk, asset risk and regulatory risk, such as commercial air operating leases and international equipment portfolio. Further, we significantly reduced exposure to cash flow or enterprise value dependent loans, the bulk of which were leverage loans to approximately 10% of our exposure as of the merger close. The de-risking of our portfolios enables us to focus on appropriate risk adjusted returns and will serve us well as we consider the challenges in the current macroeconomic environment. This is achieved by enacting more robust credit underwriting standards and enhancing credit discipline among other things. The strong risk culture and credit risk discipline resulted in a more stable and healthy loan book, as demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Page 10 demonstrates that we were able not only to weather the pandemic, but to thrive, by continuing to enjoy strong asset quality, despite the macroeconomic pressures and uncertainty in the market. And this was accomplished again by being selective and disciplined in the face of very competitive market conditions. As we look forward to our future as a combined company, you'll see that Page 11 shows First Citizens and CIT have complemented each other to create a combined company with a moderate credit risk. While each legacy company was more skewed to one side of the risk spectrum or the other, the combined company's risk appetite will enable us to be more competitive in the changing market, while still maintaining a balanced approach with a focus on long-term growth and stability. Despite some of the uncertainties out there, I'm very comfortable about the quality of our book. We continue to strengthen our portfolio and demonstrate our discipline through new business originations that continue to come in at better risk ratings than our existing credit portfolio. The combined company's deep industry expertise and structuring capabilities give us confidence that we're properly balancing our growth strategy with our underwriting strategy. This merger integration we've come a long way in a brief time. We're in a good position and thanks to our experienced and professional associates, who're executing well. We believe we'll position well to keep this momentum going strong. I'm now going to pass the mic to Craig to discuss our second quarter financial results in more detail. Craig? Well, I'd just say, given the businesses that Craig referred to, with General Bank and the branch originated business really falls within that legacy First Citizens primarily green, if you want to refer to -- as you're referring to Page 11. The growth in -- and that's true on the consumer side and on the small business side. The growth in the commercial verticals, our energy group is very strong in renewables, and our healthcare group has been growing strong in healthcare, real estate, a little different, and we treat that a little bit differently in terms of our appetite versus commercial -- general, commercial real estate. So I would say that we're sticking to our netting. There was not an emphasis to grow by taking additional risk and certainly not in those areas that we would consider to be higher risk given the red."

            "name": "Peter Bristow",
            "content": "Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to speak with you today about the exciting opportunities we are seeing in our Commercial Bank. As Frank mentioned, we've been able to capture some of the synergies we knew existed between our two great companies early on, and we are thrilled at how this merger has positioned us for long-term success. We've put an emphasis on retaining the top talent in our Commercial Bank, and we believe our ability to execute on this continuity of sales leadership has positioned us well not only for our quarterly results, but also in the future. On that positive note, Q2 was a strong quarter for the Commercial Bank with solid performance across our businesses. In addition, our strong business leadership has enabled our teams to hit the ground running as we integrate the banks. Our Commercial Finance business has continued to see momentum and demand remains strong in most verticals with pipelines well above 2021 levels. We are continuing to see strong pockets of growth within our renewable energy, medical office real estate and in our technology, media and telecom businesses. Additionally, we're seeing an ongoing flow of referral business from our branch network and middle-market banking relationship managers to many of the legacy CIT business lines. Leveraging these combined organization expertise, we can offer new products and services to meet these growing client needs. This includes the ability to deliver increased capital market capabilities to FCB cloud-base and delivering FCB's wide breadth of treasury management products and services to CIT's commercial customers. With that said, we are continuing to monitor the markets closely as market volatility has increased driven by the Fed balance sheet runoff forgetting in earnest and continued rate increases. As credit spreads reset higher, we expect well structured deals to continue to be highly competitive. In real estate finance, the lending environment remains extremely competitive with record levels of capital being raised for lending and investment. We're seeing that play out as originations are strong, but like many in the industry, we continue to be impacted by elevated prepayments and significant competition for new deals driving down our balances. Our credit quality remains strong, but given where we are in the current economic cycle, we don't want to take a digital credit or structure risk in this area. Within our factoring business, we're seeing that retail sectors are still performing well, although we are being selective on customers. The new business pipeline is strong and with added sales leadership and a continued integration in the FCB footprint, new business should continue to build. However, as consumer confidence starts to be impacted by increased inflation and market volatility, spending had its good change across the entire economy, and we will continue to be watchful. Moving to Business Capital, which is our leasing organization. Originations and portfolio performance remains stellar, despite declines in small business optimism and increasing economic uncertainty. Current asset levels are near record highs for business capital and credit quality remains strong as net losses continue to run favorable to historic rates. At prior high asset levels, the business had notable franchise finance and transportation portfolio balances, and today, those have since largely run off. Still a sizable opportunity exists to better serve bank customers, who sell equipment with business capital, vendor finance capabilities, creating stickiness and deepening key relationships. FCD legacy vendor programs are going to be transitioned to the Business Capital unit, as initial pilot vendors are going to be consolidated in August with the remaining to follow by year end. In our Rail business, utilization improved to 96.2% in Q2, up 72 basis points from the prior quarter. For the third consecutive quarter, repricing was favorable at 114% of the expiring rate. We are starting to see the results of our focus on extending terms, averaging 43 months across the portfolio and 48 months on freight cars for the quarter. While there are no recessionary indications of parent in the portfolio currently, we continue to watch the markets closely, particularly with industrial production and the purchasing managers index being down slightly in June. Our near-term outlook remains positive but mixed across certain markets. We expect utilization to be flat to modestly improving through 2022. The strong performance of our Commercial Bank will not be possible without the experienced nimble management teams across each of these businesses. These established leaders help provide stability to both our associates and our clients while also identifying new leaders to promote additional opportunities, which is critical to our continued success. One of the items we continue to be pleased with is the performance of the legacy CIT portfolio as we deal with the economic uncertainty of today. Prior to the merger, the CIT team executed a multi-year strategy to reduce portfolio risk and our Chief Credit Officer, Marisa Harney, is here today to provide an overview of these efforts. Marisa, I'll turn it over to you."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the First Citizens BancShares First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce the host of this conference call, Ms. Deanna Hart, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nDeanna Hart: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to review First Citizens BancShares first quarter 2022 financial results. It is my pleasure to introduce our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Frank Holding, as well as our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Nix. During the call, they will be referencing our investor presentation which you can find on our website. We are also pleased to have several other members of our leadership team in attendance with us today who are available to participate in the question-and-answer portion of our call, if needed. Following the completion of our formal presentation materials, we\u2019ll be happy to take any questions you may have. As you are aware, we closed the merger with CIT Group on January 3, 2022, and first quarter results are for the combined company. Given the magnitude of this merger on our legacy results, we have included combined numbers for the historical periods for comparison purposes. There are footnotes within the presentation to indicate when historical numbers are combined or on a First Citizens standalone basis. As a reminder, our comments during today\u2019s presentation will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. We assume no obligation to update these statements. These risks are outlined for you on page 3 of the presentation. We will also reference non-GAAP financial measures in the presentation. Reconciliations of these measures against the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available in the appendix. Finally, First Citizens is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. With that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Frank.\nFrank Holding: Thank you, Deanna, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate all of you joining us today. We are pleased to announce solid first quarter results this morning. We continue to remain focused on ensuring a timely and successful integration with CIT and made good progress during the quarter, and we\u2019re very excited about our prospects moving forward. As Craig will touch on when he covers our financial outlook, we expect net interest margin to continue to expand. Our customers, by and large, are in good shape, so we feel good about the prospects for loan growth. And we expect continued momentum in our fee income generating lines of business as well as further progress on our cost save target. Turning to page 5 of the investor presentation. We continue to remain focused on ensuring a timely and successful merger integration for our customers and associates. Leveraging our dedicated integration management office comprised of execution-oriented leaders with multiple acquisitions, conversions and integrations under their belts, we are working hard to ensure the value of the deal is realized for employees, customers and shareholders. And I\u2019m pleased to say, we are exactly where we expected to be at this point in time. All of us are focused on ensuring our teams are coordinated and meeting our integration time line. As we\u2019ve said before and are experiencing as we integrate, integration risk can be better managed in this merger because of the structure of CIT. Instead of converting a large bank over a long weekend, which is typically the case, CIT is a diverse group -- or it has a diverse and unique business units and groups that will include some conversions, like One West, which is slated for mid-July, but will also include lifting and shifting or replatforming other lines of businesses, like factoring, commercial finance and rail, which will be managed individually and sequenced in a way that manages the integration cleanly over the next few months. Turning to page 6. I want to thank all of our associates for their dedication, hard work and sacrifice to ensure that we are making progress on our integration milestones. We are pleased with our progress on our cost saves target of $250 million and expect that $200 million will be in the run rate by the end of this year. As Craig will soon cover, during the first quarter, we achieved positive operating leverage as net revenue grew at a faster pace than expenses, leading to strong core earnings and pre-provision net revenue growth. We will continue to focus on redeploying excess liquidity into loans and investments at higher rates to boost net interest income and margin. We look forward to making progress -- further progress on merger integration and producing strong results in the second quarter. Before I turn it over to Craig, I\u2019d like to say that despite some of the uncertainty out there, given geopolitical and macroeconomic issues, we remain very excited and optimistic about our growth prospects. We are already shifting from integration focus to execution in many areas throughout the bank, and we\u2019re working hard to capture the synergistic value from the CIT merger on the revenue and expense side, and that\u2019s already bearing fruit. We are well-positioned to perform well given -- we are well-positioned to perform well, given our long-term focus, our focus on relationships, our risk appetite and the diversity of our business segments and our enhanced earnings profile, as we are now merged with CIT. Now, Craig will provide a closer look at our financial quarter results. And then, we\u2019ll open the line for questions. Craig?\nCraig Nix: Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. Starting on page 8. As you may expect, our first quarter results have some noise in them due to purchase accounting and merger-related items. While I will cover the noise in my comments today, I do not want to detract from what Frank just described as solid first quarter results. So, I\u2019m going to begin with several positives, highlighting the quarter. Core deposit growth was strong with noninterest-bearing deposits growing by $1.2 billion since year-end an annualized growth rate of 20%. The loan portfolio grew due to strong growth in the branch network and in residential mortgages. In addition to organic loan growth, we continued to redeploy excess cash into investment securities at attractive entry points. Net interest margin expanded by 17 basis points over the linked-quarter, overcoming a decline in SBA-PPP income. Only 6 basis points of the expansion in margin was attributable to purchase accounting. We continued to generate positive momentum in the rail, card, merchant and wealth, fee income producing lines of business. Noninterest expense was well-controlled. And as Frank mentioned, we are confident that we will achieve our cost savings target. Net revenues grew at a faster pace than expenses, resulting in positive operating leverage during the quarter relative to the linked and comparable quarters in the prior year. As a result, pre-provision net revenue increased by 8% over the linked quarter and by 18% over the comparable quarter a year ago. Credit quality remained strong with a net charge-off ratio of 9 basis points. We ended the quarter strong from a capital and liquidity standpoint, supporting the resumption of share repurchases during the second half of the year. And finally, as Frank covered in his comments, merger integration is going well and is on track. Turning to page 9, I will touch on the financial highlights for the quarter. Please note that we are providing our GAAP results as well as supplemental reporting on an adjusted basis to account for the after-tax basis of notable items such as gains and expenses associated with mergers, gains and losses on sale and debt extinguishment and other nonrecurring noncore items. With that, I am happy to report GAAP net income of $264 million or $16.70 per share, yielding an annualized ROE of 11.18% and an ROA of 1%. On an adjusted basis, net income was $299 million or $18.95 per share, yielding an annualized ROE of 12.68% and an ROA of 1.12%. Comparable EPS, ROE and ROA shown on this page for prior periods are for First Citizens BancShares on a standalone basis. NIM and the net charge-off ratio are presented as if the companies were consolidated during the historical periods. I\u2019ll dive a little deeper into these components in a moment as we look at underlying trends that produced our results. Turning to page 10, we provide two income statements, the one at the top representing our reported GAAP results and the one at the bottom supplementing those results showing net income adjusted for notable items. Both income statements are presented as if FCB and CIT were merged during the historical periods presented. The section in the middle of the page summarizes the impact of notable items to drive the adjusted results from the reported results. The most significant notable items were the estimated $431 million bargain purchase gain, $513 million day 2 CECL provision and $135 million in merger-related expenses associated with the CIT merger. Page 11 provides a detailed listing of the notable items affecting the quarter along with their impact on net income and diluted earnings per share. Now, I will focus on the adjusted results at the bottom of page 10. Pre-provision net revenue increased by $26 million or 8% over the linked-quarter and by $54 million or 18% over the comparable quarter a year ago. The increases for both periods were driven by positive operating leverage. Net income available to common shareholders is $299 million, up from $291 million in the fourth quarter and down from $323 million in the first quarter of the prior year. The increase in net income during the linked-quarter was due to an increase in pre-provision net revenue, lower preferred dividend, partially offset by a decline in the benefit for credit losses. The decline compared to the same quarter a year ago was due to the decline in the benefit for credit losses, only partially being offset by an increase in pre-provision net revenue. As I mentioned, page 11 provides detail on notable items, most of the significant ones relate to our merger with CIT. I will call out here that on an adjusted basis, we will report rental income on operating leases net of depreciation and maintenance, which will reduce GAAP reported noninterest income and also reduced GAAP reported noninterest expense by the same amount. The net effect of these adjustments is neutral to pre-provision net revenue, pretax income and net income. In summary, noninterest income was adjusted downward by $570 million, mostly due to the estimated bargain purchase gain. To get to core noninterest expense, noninterest expense was adjusted downward by $238 million. After removing the day 2 CECL impact, pretax income was adjusted up by $181 million and these adjustments added $1.90 to reported or GAAP EPS. Now, starting with page 12, I\u2019ll touch on the major trends impacting our operating results. Unless noted otherwise, the financial trends on the upcoming pages are consolidated as if the merger with CIT took place during the historical period presented. Net interest income totaled $649 million for the quarter, representing a $30 million or 5% increase compared to the linked-quarter. The drivers of the increase were a $54 million decrease in interest expense, offset by a $24 million decline in interest income. The decline in interest expense was driven by reductions in interest expense on borrowings of $40 million and on deposit of $14 million. Of the $54 million decline in interest expense, $31 million related to purchase accounting, premium amortization with the remaining $23 million attributable to the $3 billion debt redemption in February and lower deposit rates. The cost of deposits declined by 6 basis points during the quarter as higher price time deposits continue to mature. While we expect that interest costs on deposits will begin to increase given Fed rate hikes, we will continue to let higher price time deposits, including brokered CDs, mature, which will help to alleviate some of the pressure of rising rates in the short term. Interest income was negatively impacted by declines in legacy CIT interest accretion that accounted for $23 million of the decrease and SBA-PPP income contributing to $7 million of the decrease and a lower day count. These factors were partially offset by improved investment yield and earning asset mix as we redeploy excess liquidity into investment securities, organic loan growth and to redeem long-term debt. Interest on investments was up $23 million compared to the linked-quarter due to a 36 basis-point increase in yield and a $1.9 billion increase in average balance. $7 million and 14 basis points of the increase was due to purchase accounting. The remaining positive impacts were due to higher reinvestment rates and lower prepayments on the MBS portfolio. Excluding the impact of lower accretion, SBA-PPP interest income and day count, interest income was up $32 million due to a higher investment portfolio yields and improved earning asset mix. The loan yields ex accretion and PPP loans was essentially flat with the prior quarter. Net interest income increased by $42 million over the comparable quarter in 2021 and net interest margin increased by 15 basis points. Net interest income increased for similar reasons described for the linked-quarter, with the exception that interest income was negatively impacted by earning asset mix relative to the comparable quarter in 2021. Turning to page 13, we highlight the drivers of the 17 and 15 basis points margin expansion from the linked and comparable prior year quarters, respectively. Purchase accounting was accretive to both quarters by 6 basis points. Excluding the impact of purchase accounting, net interest margin increased by 11 basis points from the linked quarter and by 9 from the comparable quarter. The increase for the linked quarter was due to the impact of the combination of improved funding and earning asset mix, higher investment yield and lower deposit costs, all outpacing the negative impact of lower SBA-PPP income. Similar themes exist for the comparable quarter increase. However, the decline in deposit rates was more accretive and earning asset mix had a more pronounced negative effect as average loans declined by $3.5 billion. As we look ahead to the remainder of 2022, while we expect interest expense to increase, we expect that interest income will increase at a faster pace, leading to growth in net interest income over the coming quarters. In addition, we expect the earning asset yields will increase at a faster pace than the cost of funding them, thus leading to continued expansion of net interest margin. Turning to page 14. The line graph on the left-hand side of the page indicates that we continue to be asset sensitive. While we have been opportunistic in reducing excess liquidity, we continue to operate with liquidity above normal operating ranges. We have and will continue to take a measured approach to interest rate risk and market risk management to position our balance sheet to benefit from higher interest rates while at the same time, providing downside protection, should interest rates fall in the future. We estimate that a 100 basis-point shock in rates would increase net interest income by 6.1% and at a 100 basis-point ramp by 2.5% over the next 12 months. The main drivers of the improvement are our variable rate loan portfolio, which represents 45% of total loans, our cash position and modest deposit betas, driven by our strong core deposit base. We model our blended deposit beta between 20% and 25%, which is aligned with historical experience in a rising rate environment. Currently, deposit betas are well below these expectations. Moving to page 15. Noninterest income totaled $726 million during the first quarter, which was an increase of $402 million over the linked-quarter and $302 million over the comparable quarter last year. The difference between the $850 million in GAAP noninterest income reported on page 9 and the $726 million shown here is that rental income on operating leases is reported net of depreciation and maintenance expense. On slide 16, noninterest expense has been reduced by the same amount. The $402 million increase in noninterest income for the linked-quarter was driven primarily by the estimated bargain purchase gain recorded in connection with the CIT merger, higher core noninterest income, the gain on debt extinguishment, partially offset by declines in gains on sale of operating leases and legacy CIT consumer mortgages. The gains on sale will be a less prominent part of our strategy moving forward, given our liquidity and capital position, and the purchase accounting reset on legacy consumer mortgage and rail assets. Core noninterest income increased $16 million or about 6% over the linked-quarter, primarily due to higher rental income on operating leases, an increase in card and merchant income, partially offset by a decline in factoring commissions due to expected seasonal decline in volume. Higher net rental income on operating leases was due primarily to lower maintenance cost on rail fleet -- on the rail fleet as less cars came off fleet during the quarter, requiring less transportation and maintenance costs. Core noninterest income increased by $36 million when compared to the first quarter, led by an increase in net rental income on operating leases, higher card and merchant, service charges on deposits and wealth management income, all partially offset by a decline in mortgage income. Higher rental income on operating leases was due to improvement in gross rental income due to higher rail fleet utilization, higher renewal rates on new leases as well as lower depreciation and maintenance costs. Rail fleet utilization increased to 95.5% at the end of the first quarter, up 2.4% from year-end. Mortgage income was negatively impacted by higher interest rates from reduced refinance activity and pressure on gain on sale margins, which have declined after being elevated in the latter half of 2020 and 2021 due to increased mortgage demand and the lower rate environment. Turning to the remainder of 2022, we expect continued momentum in our rail, merchant and card and wealthy income-producing lines of business. While service charges on deposits will decline as we enact the NSF OD policy changes we announced earlier this year, we anticipate a high single-digit percentage increase in adjusted noninterest income year-over-year. With respect to the lost fee income from NSF OD fees, we are looking for opportunities to offset it by broadening customer relationships through product offerings that will add value for our customers. Turning to page 16. Noninterest expense totaled $686 million during the first quarter, an increase of $117 million and $116 million over the linked-quarter and the comparable quarter, respectively. The $117 million increase over the linked-quarter was primarily driven by $222 million increase in merger-related expenses resulting from a combination of deal-related change in control, retention and severance payment and legal and consulting costs. Core noninterest expense increased by $20 million, and were partially offset by a $27 million expense reversal related to termination of 2 legacy benefit plans. The $20 million increase in core noninterest expense over the linked-quarter primarily related to higher personnel costs driven by a combination of factors, including higher performance and revenue-based incentives, seasonally higher FICA and 401(k) expenses and lower deferred loan origination call, all partially offset by lower salaries expense. The lower salary expense was a result of our continued focus on merger cost saves. The $116 million increase over the comparable quarter last year was due to the same reasons stated for the linked-quarter with the exception of the increase in merger-related expenses was also offset by a decline in intangible asset amortization. Core noninterest expense increased by $24 million due to higher personnel costs, third-party processing fees and marketing costs. The good news here is that our efficiency ratio improved to 61.57% during the quarter as core net revenue growth outpaced expense growth. Looking forward, we are feeling the pressures of inflation, especially as it relates to wage pressure, professional service and contract costs. We do expect, however, as we are able to remove another $100 million out of our cost base, it will help to neutralize the natural noninterest expense growth that exclusive of merger cost saves will be closer to the mid-single-digit range for this year. We expect a low-single-digit percentage increase in adjusted noninterest expense year-over-year. In terms of our efficiency ratio moving forward, with the expected positive net revenue impact of rate increases and continued efforts on cost savings initiatives, we could see continued improvement during the remainder of the year and into next year. We still feel good about our estimate of $300 million in merger-related expenses for the year, with the absolute level of merger expenses continuing to moderate in the coming quarters, with quarter one being the high watermark with most of the first quarter expense tied to the timing of the merger close. Page 17 provides balance sheet highlights and key ratios. I will cover the significant components of the balance sheet on subsequent pages. So, I won\u2019t spend time on this page, other than to note that you\u2019ll see that we are maintaining strong, healthy capital levels post merger, which we plan to leverage into organic growth and share repurchases during -- and share repurchases during the second half of the year. Turning to page 18. Total loans increased $313 million over the linked-quarter or by 1.9% on an annualized basis. If we remove the impact of purchase accounting and SBA-PPP loan decline, total loans increased by $455 million or by 2.8% on an annualized basis. Given the lower seasonal growth we typically experience during the first quarter and the necessary focus on merger integration, we are pleased with these results. The loan growth for the quarter was led by the branch network, which grew at an annualized rate of 6%, led by growth in commercial, business and consumer loans. This growth rate is encouraging as we continue to focus on both, client outreach efforts and adding additional bankers in high-performing markets where we feel there is a compelling organic growth opportunity. Elsewhere, we had growth in mortgage loans for the quarter, even as overall mortgage loan production was down as the decline in prepayment speeds due to higher interest rates enabled production to overcome loan runoff. On the downside, we continue to see learn declines in real estate finance loans, abundant liquidity in the system keeps pressure on pricing, and competitors are willing to refinance loans at lower spreads. Last, inflation in the rising rate environment are prompting some apprehension to new borrowing in the space. On a year-over-year basis, loans declined by $2.6 billion or 3.8% due to decreases in SBA-PPP and real estate finance loans, excluding SBA-PPP which accounted for $2.6 billion reduction in the net impact of purchase accounting. So, the $2.6 million reduction in PPP and the impact of purchase accounting, the decline was 0.3% or virtually flat as the growth mentioned previously in the branch network was able to neutralize declines in real estate finance loans. As we look forward, we do feel positive about the prospects for further loan growth. We anticipate a mid-single-digit percentage increase in loans for the full year \u201822. However, we do acknowledge that uncertainty around the external environment, especially with regard to economic and geopolitical risks could cause actual growth rate to deviate from our expectations. Moving to page 19. We experienced strong deposit growth during the quarter with deposits growing an annualized rate of approximately 4% or about $833 million. The main drivers of the quarter-over-quarter change were a $1.2 billion increase in noninterest-bearing checking accounts, representing almost 20% annualized growth. This was offset by a $388 million decrease in interest-bearing deposits due to $754 million decline in time deposits, partially offset by a net $376 million increase in other interest-bearing accounts. Our cost of deposits declined to 17 basis points during the quarter, down 6 basis points from the linked-quarter and 16 basis points from the first quarter of last year. Despite the fact that our noninterest-bearing deposit growth continued at record levels in the first quarter, we remain guarded on the outlook for continued absolute deposit rate in 2022 as the interest rate environment continues to evolve and the Fed impacts liquidity in the system by deleveraging balance sheet. As we continue to optimize our funding mix by placing higher cost deposits -- by replacing higher cost deposits with lower cost core checking account, we expect the continued decline in time deposits, offsetting growth in transaction accounts. Moving to page 20. Our balance sheet continues to be funded predominantly by core deposits, the total deposits representing over 96% of our funding base at the end of the quarter. Continuing to page 21, credit quality continues to be very strong. While the net charge-off ratio increased from 5 basis points to 9 basis points from the linked-quarter, it remains low, which in combination with improved macroeconomic scenarios, resulted in a negative provision of $49 million during the quarter, after excluding the day 2 CECL provision. The ACL ratio declined from 1.36 at the end of last year to 1.29 at the end of the first quarter. Turning to page 22. The combined ACL was $890 million at the end of 2021. As we reported in March on the date of the acquisition, we cleared out CIT\u2019s ACL of $712 million and established an estimated reserve for PCD loans of $284 million and an estimated day 2 provision for non-PCD loans of $454 million, which resulted in a $26 million increase in CIT\u2019s year-end ACL. The increase was primarily related to changes in specific reserves on loans individually evaluated for impairment at the acquisition date. This resulted in a day 1 combined ACL of $916 million. Subsequent to the acquisition date, we released $68 million in reserves, bringing the ACL down to $848 million or 1.29% of total loans. The release was a result of improvement in certain macroeconomic scenarios used in the estimation of the allowance, specifically around real estate values. Additionally, we saw improvement in the specific reserves on certain impaired loans during the quarter. The ACL at quarter-end covered annualized net charge-offs 14.3 times. Turning to page 23. Our capital position remains strong, with all ratios above or in the upper end of our target ranges. As of the end of the first quarter, our CET1 ratio was 11.36% and our total risk-based capital ratio was 14.48%. After accounting for the merger impact, which was slightly dilutive to our risk-based capital ratio and accretive to our Tier 1 leverage ratio, the growth during the quarter was attributable to strong earnings, partially offset by growth in total risk-weighted assets and dividend payments. The leverage ratio increased further due to the average asset impact from the debt redemption completed on February 24th. Our tangible book value per share grew by 40% to $574.09 during the quarter, driven by the value created from the CIT acquisition. Turning to page 25, I will conclude by discussing our financial outlook. Let me preface my comments here that this outlook assumes that the U.S. economy continues to perform well by most measures. This includes GDP growth as COVID continues to wane, that Ukraine crisis does not derail the U.S. economy, that monetary policy becomes tighter as the Fed tries to rein in inflation, inflation while currently elevated, doesn\u2019t move up significantly or declines, supply chain and geopolitical issues are resolved, the unemployment rate remains relatively low and income taxes remain at current levels. On page 25, the first and third columns list our first quarter \u201822 and full fiscal year \u201821 adjusted actuals for the relevant metric or balance sheet line items. The numbers in these columns are adjusted for notable items to arrive at core noninterest income and expense. Column two provides our growth and other assumptions for the second quarter and column 4 for the full fiscal year 2022. From a loan growth perspective, we expect growth to be in the mid-single-digit percentage range in both Q2 and for the year. While we foresee continued mid- to high-single-digit growth in our branch network, we do continue to feel some pressures in the real estate finance portfolio based upon accelerated prepayments in the competitive landscape. We will continue to proactively add bankers in our wealth, middle market banking and large metro branch network areas to support loan growth. We also anticipate that our cost of funds will afford us opportunities to compete more favorably in the large commercial space on high credit rate opportunities and the continued collaboration of our legacy FCB and CIT lending teams and sending referrals will help increase loan volumes as the cultures become integrated. We are already seeing referral activity pick up as FCB and CIT gain more understanding of each legacy company\u2019s products and capabilities. On deposits, we do not expect to continue the legacy First Citizens robust levels of growth over the past two years as we seek to optimize funding by replacing higher cost accounts with lower cost core checking accounts. While we had strong growth in the first quarter, we do expect seasonal outflows in our branch network and CAB business and consequently, we expect deposits to be slightly down in the second quarter. On the year, we expect flat to low-single-digit percentage growth. However, if we continue to see upside in our noninterest-bearing account, we could exceed that guidance. Our expectation is that demand deposit growth will continue at a mid-single-digit percentage growth rate but will be offset by continued optimization of the funding base, highlighting higher-priced CDs and money market accounts run off. For net charge-offs, we expect a gradual return to pre-pandemic non-stress levels for both First Citizens and CIT. We expect net charge-offs in the range of 10 to 20 basis points in the second quarter and 15 to 25 basis points for the full year. The increase in our net charge-off projection is not due to any apparent stress in our portfolios. Rather, we think the impact of inflation and rising rates may result in our losses returning to more historic levels. For net interest income, we expect continued growth in the second quarter in the mid-single-digits percentage range compared to Q1 as the impact of expected rate increases on earning asset yields outpace increases in the cost of funding earning assets. On a full year basis, we expect low- to mid-teens percentage growth. From a core noninterest income perspective, we expect to be down slightly compared to the first quarter as renewal rates on operating leases increase and maintenance costs return to more normal levels. For the year, we expect upper single-digit growth led by net rental income on operating leases as well as continued growth in wealth, merchant and card income. From a core noninterest expense standpoint, we expect the second quarter to be flat to slightly negative compared to the first quarter as the impact of annual merit increases are offset by a decline in seasonal benefits extend the continued recognition of merger cost saves. On the year, we expect noninterest expense percentage growth to be low single digits. From a cost savings standpoint, we estimate that $100 million in cost saves is in our run rate currently and project $200 million to be in the run rate by the fourth quarter of this year. In 2023, we expect $250 million to be in our run rate by the fourth quarter. In closing, we are very pleased with our first quarter results and the hard work put in by our associates to make it happen. With that, I will now turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator:  And your first question will come from Brady Gailey.\nBrady Gailey: So, as we approach the back half of this year, which is when you guys have signaled you\u2019ll reengage in the buyback, how do we think about the size of what that buyback could be? I mean, you guys clearly have a lot of excess capital. And I know historically, when you have been engaged in the buyback, you\u2019ve done it in size, like I think in 2019 and then 2020. Each of those years, you repurchased about 8% of the company. So, any thoughts on how you think about the size of what the buyback could be at the back half of this year and next year?\nFrank Holding: Brady, this is Frank Holding. I\u2019m going to give some sort of context for this question, and I\u2019m going to let Craig answer it a little more specifically. Given our early success in integration and demonstrating solid safety and soundness metrics with stable systems, we remain confident having a, I\u2019ll describe it as a robust stock repurchase plan in the second half of the year, as we\u2019ve discussed before. Simply, our deep experience in integration is proving out here. And we felt strong capital levels were prudent in a merger of this size, but our early success and the greater line of sight in projections around integration efforts along with strong safety and soundness metrics. But again, we feel that it\u2019s prudent, and we feel very good about having our second half plans for a, I\u2019ll describe it as robust stock repurchase plan is warranted. Craig, do you want to talk about anything, you want to expand on that?\nCraig Nix: Yes, sure, Frank. And I\u2019ll speak to this in terms of sort of where we sit in our CET1 sort of capital target range. And let\u2019s say that we target the middle of that range, which would put CET1 in around 10%. That would be the target. Excess capital would be approximately at the end of the quarter $1.1 billion. And then, if we take that out to the end of the year, around $1.6 billion. So, that should just give you some indication of the excess capital. I\u2019m not telegraphing the exact amount that we will request for our repurchase plan. But every -- based on the targets we put out there for EPS, every $1 billion repurchase, if we assume stock price is where it was when the market closed, is about 10% accretive to EPS. So, we believe -- and we have not modeled any of that into our forecast, but we believe that is a -- could be a powerful strategy for our EPS accretion moving forward.\nBrady Gailey: And then given what we\u2019ve seen just with the long end of the curve moving up, your bond rates -- your bond reinvestment rates are nicely higher, how are you guys thinking about continuing to deploy this excess liquidity? I mean, do you want to leave some there to run off CIT more expensive funding, or do you start to think about putting that into the bond portfolio more aggressively now that rates are higher? Like, what\u2019s the plan with all the excess liquidity at this point?\nCraig Nix: I think in a -- I\u2019ll let Tom Eklund speak to this. If I missed anything, Tom, step in here. But I think in a perfect world, if we can just wave a magic wand, we would like to see sort of our earning asset mix with overnight investments from around 4% to 5% investment portfolio in the 19% to 20% range and then loans 74% to 77%. Right now, we are on the high end of that range with overnight investment stuff, we have the excess liquidity. We\u2019re about where we want to be on the investment portfolio, but then that offset of excess liquidity we\u2019d like to see redeployed into the loan portfolio because simply put, with the current yield curve, if we were able to redeploy that excess liquidity, it will be accretive to margin by 10 to 15 basis points. And in terms of the absolute value of net interest income between $95 million and $143 million, which is not built into our current projections. So, I do think we should all keep in mind, we are restricted on how much we can redeploy in the loans, given that we have to have some liquidity reserve for liquidity stress tests and high-quality liquid assets against our deposits, but we do believe we have a great deal of balance sheet capacity here to boost earnings further than our projections in the K. Tom, did I miss anything there?\nTom Eklund: No, I think you hit the points really well there, Craig. So, no further comments from me.\nBrady Gailey: Great. That\u2019s good color. And then, just one more quick one, if I can. Can you all give us the amount of PPP fees that were in spread income and the amount of accretable yield that was realized in the first quarter?\nCraig Nix: I can give you the impact of purchase accounting, if you just bear with me. While I\u2019m doing that, if you could help here as well. In the first quarter, if you just aggregate the -- purchase accounting impact on net interest income, it was around $33 million pretax or 14 basis points. So if you strip back -- if you were to strip that out from a margin standpoint, our margin would have been -- was 2.73%, would have been 2.59%. And instead of the actual 17 and 15 basis points that we increased, we would have increased by 9 and 11. So, that just gives you some of the magnitude on the net interest income side. And on the fee income side, Elliot, I don\u2019t think that there was a tremendous amount of purchase accounting impact.\nElliot Howard: For the SBA-PPP, we had $9.5 million of income in the first quarter, Brady.\nCraig Nix: So, you\u2019re talking -- but that was interest income\u2026\nElliot Howard: Yes. Let me -- Brady, we\u2019ll get back to you on the exact split\u2026\nCraig Nix: But I\u2019ll just -- just for some perspective in the margin, our headline margin went up 15 basis points for the comparable quarter, 17 basis points for the linked. When you exclude both, purchase accounting and PPP, they would have been up 18 for both periods. So, while there\u2019s a lot of noise in there, what that indicates is that core net interest income is improving nicely. We stripped out for PPP and purchase accounting adjustments.\nElliot Howard: Yes. And Brady, the fee only portion in Q1 was $6 million.\nCraig Nix: Purchase accounting -- we spent a lot of time on purchase accounting, and it really does not have a huge impact on results.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Stephen Scouten with Piper Sandler.\nStephen Scouten: Craig, I wanted to follow up on something you said regarding the share repurchase. I think you said you\u2019re not targeting what you will request. So, is that indicative of the fact that a request hasn\u2019t been yet submitted to regulators? And if that\u2019s correct, do you have any insights on what timing from them would be from approval or kind of what the process looks like to get approval on your repurchase plan?\nCraig Nix: Yes. We definitely are engaging with our regulators, and so we\u2019re not just sitting on our hands with that. But it does take around a month for approval. So, that process will get -- will be in hand during this quarter, and very soon.\nStephen Scouten: Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. And then, I guess, the market today is kind of discounting all the money that banks and including you guys will probably earn some higher rates and careful about a recession and potential credit issues and whatnot. Can you give any color on how the legacy CIT book is looking in your view relative to your recent marks? And then, maybe if you had any changes in qualitative factors around your CECL modeling or how you guys are waiting towards Moody\u2019s economic scenarios or kind of however you\u2019re determining your CECL weightings and so forth?\nCraig Nix: We\u2019re feeling really good about the CIT portfolio. Credit quality is really strong. Those credits are sort of underwritten to stress scenarios. And CIT did a really good job of resisting market pressure to bend on credit quality and term. So just in general, we\u2019re feeling really good about it. In terms of the -- just the ACL, if you really -- if you look at where we are currently, we feel really good. And frankly, we feel like our reserve is conservative. And what I did went back and compared where we were at the end of the first quarter to the fourth quarter of \u201819, which is what we would consider pre-pandemic level. And our -- the ACL of the combined company was 1.29% and it was 1.43% back in fourth quarter of \u201819 as the companies would have been combined. The net charge-off ratio now is 9 and at the end of \u201819 it was 28. So, we now have 14% coverage, whereas we had 5% coverage -- 5 times coverage pre-pandemic. Another thing that Marisa Harney focuses on, our Chief Credit Officer, is how much does that allowance cover nonaccruals. We\u2019re covered 1.56 times now versus 1.47 times then. 30-day, 60-day past dues are down. Nonaccrual loans to total loans are down. Criticized loans are flat and classified loans slightly up. But most indicators along that spectrum indicate that we have a conservative and prudent allowance for loan losses. And I don\u2019t see any apparent near-term stress in the portfolio that would change our view on that. And Marisa, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re on the line, if you would want to add to that?\nMarisa Harney: Yes. No, everything that Craig said is absolutely true. The legacy CIT portfolios are, frankly, performing at some of their best levels from a credit quality perspective, even in the context of pre-pandemic, which is what I look at. A lot of people talk about, \"Oh, it\u2019s improved since 2020.\" Well, a lot has improved since 2020. But, our indicators are suggesting that we are back to, if not better than our pre-pandemic asset quality levels. And I think some of that is a testament to, as Craig indicated, our very balanced underwriting approach to what has been a very, very competitive loan market, not just in terms of pricing, but in terms of terms as well. So, I reiterate what Craig said. I don\u2019t see anything on the near horizon from a sector perspective or from a specific transactional perspective that gives me concern at this time. We\u2019re obviously watching all the macroeconomic indicators going forward. And as Craig said, we underwrite to stress scenarios. So, all is well.\nCraig Nix: One thing I would say just to make sure that we disclaim a little bit of it. The ACL on our CECL is highly influenced by the S3 Moody\u2019s severe economic forecast. And a lot of what you saw this quarter where we had the reversal was due to the fact that those macroeconomic factors in terms of unemployment and CRE price index, home price index, all of that improved in the severe scenario while the baseline stayed pretty moderate. With the news today, with the print today, that could change next quarter. So, we might see some pressure. Obviously, we see pressure, not to have negative provision, but we could see pressure to start building reserves back. So, that\u2019s one qualification that I would give to all that. But in terms of the portfolio, we\u2019re feeling really good about the way it\u2019s performing and its credit quality.\nStephen Scouten: Got it. Very helpful. And then, just last thing for me. How are you guys thinking about incremental -- I mean, I know you said you want to keep the liquidity for loan growth. You feel good about where the securities book is today. But at some point as rates begin -- continue to increase, how do you think about the relative spreads that you can obtain in the securities book with theoretically much less risk than in the loan book with geopolitical events and everything else potentially presenting greater risk? How do you think about that dynamic?\nCraig Nix: Well, our first priority is to lend the money, to lend the liquidity. The investment portfolio is sort of there to put whatever is left over in excess liquidity. And obviously, we want to try to maximize that yield. But at the same time, we want to protect ourselves from hits to TBV and market value as rates rise. And so, with respect to the securities portfolio, you\u2019ll see us generally buying residential government-backed or sponsored in Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities with shorter duration. And what we\u2019re trying to do there is reduce the volatility in a rising rate environment. So, either -- we\u2019re either buying securities that have -- they might be back about 30-year mortgages, but those are going to be seasoned or we just buy securities back about 15-year mortgages. So, the duration of our portfolio is probably a bit shorter than peer. We are in discussions now, and I\u2019ll let Tom hit this as well, give more detail, but we are discussing now about going a little longer with reinvested cash flows but would look for securities with more defined, locked out cash flows, bullet like cash flows. And we believe we could pick up some yield there, to your point and have more predictable cash flows. But we\u2019re likely to consider doing that as we move further into this rate cycle increase. We don\u2019t think it makes a lot of sense to go longer right now. I know others are doing that. Given that rates are heading up from here, we just -- we\u2019re at the beginning of the rate cycle. So, that\u2019s sort of the investment strategy, but I\u2019ll let Tom amplify that if he needs to say anything -- if he\u2019d like to say anything else about it.\nTom Eklund: No. I think Craig hit most of the certain points there. I mean, I think really, we\u2019re looking at the front-end cash flows currently. We believe in sort of buying stable season mortgages that have sort of gone through rate increase and decrease cycles in the past and sort of gotten through that first refi boom. As we move further out and we get some of our currently locked out cash flows rolling down the curve, we\u2019ll look to add additional duration exposure behind it. But currently, we\u2019re focused on that sure thing. And when buying duration, we\u2019re looking more for -- to Craig\u2019s point, defined cash flows there that don\u2019t have as much optionality as maybe new issue 30-year mortgages would happen.\nStephen Scouten: Great. Thanks, guys, for all the color. And congrats on all the progress that\u2019s already been made.\nCraig Nix: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Christopher Marinac.\nChristopher Marinac: I wanted to ask Frank about the regions of the country that are performing well within First Citizens footprint and any of that perhaps are weaker? And then, also any changes you\u2019ve seen in customer behavior the last two months?\nFrank Holding: This is Frank Holding. We see strong markets really across the country. There are no weak spots that we see. Certainly, some are stronger than others. I guess, generally, the larger metropolitan areas that we serve are probably -- have a more robust growth than some of the more suburban or rural areas, but we don\u2019t see any weakness. We\u2019ve noted no weakness in any particular part of the country.\nChristopher Marinac: Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then, Craig, just a quick question about being able to increase loan rates as the Fed has raised in March and then again, expected this quarter.\nCraig Nix: Loan rates, what I think you\u2019ll see is our loan yield sort of stabilized this quarter. And the rate sheets right now are higher than loans are rolling off. So we\u2019re going to naturally start to see a pickup in our loan yield. And the same thing is true for our investment portfolio yield.\nFrank Holding: Chris, I\u2019m going to add a little bit to that. You have to realize that outside of the Carolinas, all the markets that we expand into, we basically chose because the metrics there were that they had stronger population growth and greater household income and growth of that household income versus national averages. So, I don\u2019t want to say that the whole U.S. is performing equally, but we didn\u2019t choose those markets equally either.\nOperator: Thank you, speakers. I\u2019m not showing any further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to our host for any closing remarks.\nDeanna Hart: Thank you, and thank you, everyone, for participating in our call today. We appreciate your interest in our company. And if you have any further questions or need additional information, please feel free to reach out. I hope everyone has a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Craig Nix",
            "content": "Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. Starting on page 8. As you may expect, our first quarter results have some noise in them due to purchase accounting and merger-related items. While I will cover the noise in my comments today, I do not want to detract from what Frank just described as solid first quarter results. So, I'm going to begin with several positives, highlighting the quarter. Core deposit growth was strong with noninterest-bearing deposits growing by $1.2 billion since year-end an annualized growth rate of 20%. The loan portfolio grew due to strong growth in the branch network and in residential mortgages. In addition to organic loan growth, we continued to redeploy excess cash into investment securities at attractive entry points. Net interest margin expanded by 17 basis points over the linked-quarter, overcoming a decline in SBA-PPP income. Only 6 basis points of the expansion in margin was attributable to purchase accounting. We continued to generate positive momentum in the rail, card, merchant and wealth, fee income producing lines of business. Noninterest expense was well-controlled. And as Frank mentioned, we are confident that we will achieve our cost savings target. Net revenues grew at a faster pace than expenses, resulting in positive operating leverage during the quarter relative to the linked and comparable quarters in the prior year. As a result, pre-provision net revenue increased by 8% over the linked quarter and by 18% over the comparable quarter a year ago. Credit quality remained strong with a net charge-off ratio of 9 basis points. We ended the quarter strong from a capital and liquidity standpoint, supporting the resumption of share repurchases during the second half of the year. And finally, as Frank covered in his comments, merger integration is going well and is on track. Turning to page 9, I will touch on the financial highlights for the quarter. Please note that we are providing our GAAP results as well as supplemental reporting on an adjusted basis to account for the after-tax basis of notable items such as gains and expenses associated with mergers, gains and losses on sale and debt extinguishment and other nonrecurring noncore items. With that, I am happy to report GAAP net income of $264 million or $16.70 per share, yielding an annualized ROE of 11.18% and an ROA of 1%. On an adjusted basis, net income was $299 million or $18.95 per share, yielding an annualized ROE of 12.68% and an ROA of 1.12%. Comparable EPS, ROE and ROA shown on this page for prior periods are for First Citizens BancShares on a standalone basis. NIM and the net charge-off ratio are presented as if the companies were consolidated during the historical periods. I'll dive a little deeper into these components in a moment as we look at underlying trends that produced our results. Turning to page 10, we provide two income statements, the one at the top representing our reported GAAP results and the one at the bottom supplementing those results showing net income adjusted for notable items. Both income statements are presented as if FCB and CIT were merged during the historical periods presented. The section in the middle of the page summarizes the impact of notable items to drive the adjusted results from the reported results. The most significant notable items were the estimated $431 million bargain purchase gain, $513 million day 2 CECL provision and $135 million in merger-related expenses associated with the CIT merger. Page 11 provides a detailed listing of the notable items affecting the quarter along with their impact on net income and diluted earnings per share. Now, I will focus on the adjusted results at the bottom of page 10. Pre-provision net revenue increased by $26 million or 8% over the linked-quarter and by $54 million or 18% over the comparable quarter a year ago. The increases for both periods were driven by positive operating leverage. Net income available to common shareholders is $299 million, up from $291 million in the fourth quarter and down from $323 million in the first quarter of the prior year. The increase in net income during the linked-quarter was due to an increase in pre-provision net revenue, lower preferred dividend, partially offset by a decline in the benefit for credit losses. The decline compared to the same quarter a year ago was due to the decline in the benefit for credit losses, only partially being offset by an increase in pre-provision net revenue. As I mentioned, page 11 provides detail on notable items, most of the significant ones relate to our merger with CIT. I will call out here that on an adjusted basis, we will report rental income on operating leases net of depreciation and maintenance, which will reduce GAAP reported noninterest income and also reduced GAAP reported noninterest expense by the same amount. The net effect of these adjustments is neutral to pre-provision net revenue, pretax income and net income. In summary, noninterest income was adjusted downward by $570 million, mostly due to the estimated bargain purchase gain. To get to core noninterest expense, noninterest expense was adjusted downward by $238 million. After removing the day 2 CECL impact, pretax income was adjusted up by $181 million and these adjustments added $1.90 to reported or GAAP EPS. Now, starting with page 12, I'll touch on the major trends impacting our operating results. Unless noted otherwise, the financial trends on the upcoming pages are consolidated as if the merger with CIT took place during the historical period presented. Net interest income totaled $649 million for the quarter, representing a $30 million or 5% increase compared to the linked-quarter. The drivers of the increase were a $54 million decrease in interest expense, offset by a $24 million decline in interest income. The decline in interest expense was driven by reductions in interest expense on borrowings of $40 million and on deposit of $14 million. Of the $54 million decline in interest expense, $31 million related to purchase accounting, premium amortization with the remaining $23 million attributable to the $3 billion debt redemption in February and lower deposit rates. The cost of deposits declined by 6 basis points during the quarter as higher price time deposits continue to mature. While we expect that interest costs on deposits will begin to increase given Fed rate hikes, we will continue to let higher price time deposits, including brokered CDs, mature, which will help to alleviate some of the pressure of rising rates in the short term. Interest income was negatively impacted by declines in legacy CIT interest accretion that accounted for $23 million of the decrease and SBA-PPP income contributing to $7 million of the decrease and a lower day count. These factors were partially offset by improved investment yield and earning asset mix as we redeploy excess liquidity into investment securities, organic loan growth and to redeem long-term debt. Interest on investments was up $23 million compared to the linked-quarter due to a 36 basis-point increase in yield and a $1.9 billion increase in average balance. $7 million and 14 basis points of the increase was due to purchase accounting. The remaining positive impacts were due to higher reinvestment rates and lower prepayments on the MBS portfolio. Excluding the impact of lower accretion, SBA-PPP interest income and day count, interest income was up $32 million due to a higher investment portfolio yields and improved earning asset mix. The loan yields ex accretion and PPP loans was essentially flat with the prior quarter. Net interest income increased by $42 million over the comparable quarter in 2021 and net interest margin increased by 15 basis points. Net interest income increased for similar reasons described for the linked-quarter, with the exception that interest income was negatively impacted by earning asset mix relative to the comparable quarter in 2021. Turning to page 13, we highlight the drivers of the 17 and 15 basis points margin expansion from the linked and comparable prior year quarters, respectively. Purchase accounting was accretive to both quarters by 6 basis points. Excluding the impact of purchase accounting, net interest margin increased by 11 basis points from the linked quarter and by 9 from the comparable quarter. The increase for the linked quarter was due to the impact of the combination of improved funding and earning asset mix, higher investment yield and lower deposit costs, all outpacing the negative impact of lower SBA-PPP income. Similar themes exist for the comparable quarter increase. However, the decline in deposit rates was more accretive and earning asset mix had a more pronounced negative effect as average loans declined by $3.5 billion. As we look ahead to the remainder of 2022, while we expect interest expense to increase, we expect that interest income will increase at a faster pace, leading to growth in net interest income over the coming quarters. In addition, we expect the earning asset yields will increase at a faster pace than the cost of funding them, thus leading to continued expansion of net interest margin. Turning to page 14. The line graph on the left-hand side of the page indicates that we continue to be asset sensitive. While we have been opportunistic in reducing excess liquidity, we continue to operate with liquidity above normal operating ranges. We have and will continue to take a measured approach to interest rate risk and market risk management to position our balance sheet to benefit from higher interest rates while at the same time, providing downside protection, should interest rates fall in the future. We estimate that a 100 basis-point shock in rates would increase net interest income by 6.1% and at a 100 basis-point ramp by 2.5% over the next 12 months. The main drivers of the improvement are our variable rate loan portfolio, which represents 45% of total loans, our cash position and modest deposit betas, driven by our strong core deposit base. We model our blended deposit beta between 20% and 25%, which is aligned with historical experience in a rising rate environment. Currently, deposit betas are well below these expectations. Moving to page 15. Noninterest income totaled $726 million during the first quarter, which was an increase of $402 million over the linked-quarter and $302 million over the comparable quarter last year. The difference between the $850 million in GAAP noninterest income reported on page 9 and the $726 million shown here is that rental income on operating leases is reported net of depreciation and maintenance expense. On slide 16, noninterest expense has been reduced by the same amount. The $402 million increase in noninterest income for the linked-quarter was driven primarily by the estimated bargain purchase gain recorded in connection with the CIT merger, higher core noninterest income, the gain on debt extinguishment, partially offset by declines in gains on sale of operating leases and legacy CIT consumer mortgages. The gains on sale will be a less prominent part of our strategy moving forward, given our liquidity and capital position, and the purchase accounting reset on legacy consumer mortgage and rail assets. Core noninterest income increased $16 million or about 6% over the linked-quarter, primarily due to higher rental income on operating leases, an increase in card and merchant income, partially offset by a decline in factoring commissions due to expected seasonal decline in volume. Higher net rental income on operating leases was due primarily to lower maintenance cost on rail fleet -- on the rail fleet as less cars came off fleet during the quarter, requiring less transportation and maintenance costs. Core noninterest income increased by $36 million when compared to the first quarter, led by an increase in net rental income on operating leases, higher card and merchant, service charges on deposits and wealth management income, all partially offset by a decline in mortgage income. Higher rental income on operating leases was due to improvement in gross rental income due to higher rail fleet utilization, higher renewal rates on new leases as well as lower depreciation and maintenance costs. Rail fleet utilization increased to 95.5% at the end of the first quarter, up 2.4% from year-end. Mortgage income was negatively impacted by higher interest rates from reduced refinance activity and pressure on gain on sale margins, which have declined after being elevated in the latter half of 2020 and 2021 due to increased mortgage demand and the lower rate environment. Turning to the remainder of 2022, we expect continued momentum in our rail, merchant and card and wealthy income-producing lines of business. While service charges on deposits will decline as we enact the NSF OD policy changes we announced earlier this year, we anticipate a high single-digit percentage increase in adjusted noninterest income year-over-year. With respect to the lost fee income from NSF OD fees, we are looking for opportunities to offset it by broadening customer relationships through product offerings that will add value for our customers. Turning to page 16. Noninterest expense totaled $686 million during the first quarter, an increase of $117 million and $116 million over the linked-quarter and the comparable quarter, respectively. The $117 million increase over the linked-quarter was primarily driven by $222 million increase in merger-related expenses resulting from a combination of deal-related change in control, retention and severance payment and legal and consulting costs. Core noninterest expense increased by $20 million, and were partially offset by a $27 million expense reversal related to termination of 2 legacy benefit plans. The $20 million increase in core noninterest expense over the linked-quarter primarily related to higher personnel costs driven by a combination of factors, including higher performance and revenue-based incentives, seasonally higher FICA and 401(k) expenses and lower deferred loan origination call, all partially offset by lower salaries expense. The lower salary expense was a result of our continued focus on merger cost saves. The $116 million increase over the comparable quarter last year was due to the same reasons stated for the linked-quarter with the exception of the increase in merger-related expenses was also offset by a decline in intangible asset amortization. Core noninterest expense increased by $24 million due to higher personnel costs, third-party processing fees and marketing costs. The good news here is that our efficiency ratio improved to 61.57% during the quarter as core net revenue growth outpaced expense growth. Looking forward, we are feeling the pressures of inflation, especially as it relates to wage pressure, professional service and contract costs. We do expect, however, as we are able to remove another $100 million out of our cost base, it will help to neutralize the natural noninterest expense growth that exclusive of merger cost saves will be closer to the mid-single-digit range for this year. We expect a low-single-digit percentage increase in adjusted noninterest expense year-over-year. In terms of our efficiency ratio moving forward, with the expected positive net revenue impact of rate increases and continued efforts on cost savings initiatives, we could see continued improvement during the remainder of the year and into next year. We still feel good about our estimate of $300 million in merger-related expenses for the year, with the absolute level of merger expenses continuing to moderate in the coming quarters, with quarter one being the high watermark with most of the first quarter expense tied to the timing of the merger close. Page 17 provides balance sheet highlights and key ratios. I will cover the significant components of the balance sheet on subsequent pages. So, I won't spend time on this page, other than to note that you'll see that we are maintaining strong, healthy capital levels post merger, which we plan to leverage into organic growth and share repurchases during -- and share repurchases during the second half of the year. Turning to page 18. Total loans increased $313 million over the linked-quarter or by 1.9% on an annualized basis. If we remove the impact of purchase accounting and SBA-PPP loan decline, total loans increased by $455 million or by 2.8% on an annualized basis. Given the lower seasonal growth we typically experience during the first quarter and the necessary focus on merger integration, we are pleased with these results. The loan growth for the quarter was led by the branch network, which grew at an annualized rate of 6%, led by growth in commercial, business and consumer loans. This growth rate is encouraging as we continue to focus on both, client outreach efforts and adding additional bankers in high-performing markets where we feel there is a compelling organic growth opportunity. Elsewhere, we had growth in mortgage loans for the quarter, even as overall mortgage loan production was down as the decline in prepayment speeds due to higher interest rates enabled production to overcome loan runoff. On the downside, we continue to see learn declines in real estate finance loans, abundant liquidity in the system keeps pressure on pricing, and competitors are willing to refinance loans at lower spreads. Last, inflation in the rising rate environment are prompting some apprehension to new borrowing in the space. On a year-over-year basis, loans declined by $2.6 billion or 3.8% due to decreases in SBA-PPP and real estate finance loans, excluding SBA-PPP which accounted for $2.6 billion reduction in the net impact of purchase accounting. So, the $2.6 million reduction in PPP and the impact of purchase accounting, the decline was 0.3% or virtually flat as the growth mentioned previously in the branch network was able to neutralize declines in real estate finance loans. As we look forward, we do feel positive about the prospects for further loan growth. We anticipate a mid-single-digit percentage increase in loans for the full year \u201822. However, we do acknowledge that uncertainty around the external environment, especially with regard to economic and geopolitical risks could cause actual growth rate to deviate from our expectations. Moving to page 19. We experienced strong deposit growth during the quarter with deposits growing an annualized rate of approximately 4% or about $833 million. The main drivers of the quarter-over-quarter change were a $1.2 billion increase in noninterest-bearing checking accounts, representing almost 20% annualized growth. This was offset by a $388 million decrease in interest-bearing deposits due to $754 million decline in time deposits, partially offset by a net $376 million increase in other interest-bearing accounts. Our cost of deposits declined to 17 basis points during the quarter, down 6 basis points from the linked-quarter and 16 basis points from the first quarter of last year. Despite the fact that our noninterest-bearing deposit growth continued at record levels in the first quarter, we remain guarded on the outlook for continued absolute deposit rate in 2022 as the interest rate environment continues to evolve and the Fed impacts liquidity in the system by deleveraging balance sheet. As we continue to optimize our funding mix by placing higher cost deposits -- by replacing higher cost deposits with lower cost core checking account, we expect the continued decline in time deposits, offsetting growth in transaction accounts. Moving to page 20. Our balance sheet continues to be funded predominantly by core deposits, the total deposits representing over 96% of our funding base at the end of the quarter. Continuing to page 21, credit quality continues to be very strong. While the net charge-off ratio increased from 5 basis points to 9 basis points from the linked-quarter, it remains low, which in combination with improved macroeconomic scenarios, resulted in a negative provision of $49 million during the quarter, after excluding the day 2 CECL provision. The ACL ratio declined from 1.36 at the end of last year to 1.29 at the end of the first quarter. Turning to page 22. The combined ACL was $890 million at the end of 2021. As we reported in March on the date of the acquisition, we cleared out CIT's ACL of $712 million and established an estimated reserve for PCD loans of $284 million and an estimated day 2 provision for non-PCD loans of $454 million, which resulted in a $26 million increase in CIT's year-end ACL. The increase was primarily related to changes in specific reserves on loans individually evaluated for impairment at the acquisition date. This resulted in a day 1 combined ACL of $916 million. Subsequent to the acquisition date, we released $68 million in reserves, bringing the ACL down to $848 million or 1.29% of total loans. The release was a result of improvement in certain macroeconomic scenarios used in the estimation of the allowance, specifically around real estate values. Additionally, we saw improvement in the specific reserves on certain impaired loans during the quarter. The ACL at quarter-end covered annualized net charge-offs 14.3 times. Turning to page 23. Our capital position remains strong, with all ratios above or in the upper end of our target ranges. As of the end of the first quarter, our CET1 ratio was 11.36% and our total risk-based capital ratio was 14.48%. After accounting for the merger impact, which was slightly dilutive to our risk-based capital ratio and accretive to our Tier 1 leverage ratio, the growth during the quarter was attributable to strong earnings, partially offset by growth in total risk-weighted assets and dividend payments. The leverage ratio increased further due to the average asset impact from the debt redemption completed on February 24th. Our tangible book value per share grew by 40% to $574.09 during the quarter, driven by the value created from the CIT acquisition. Turning to page 25, I will conclude by discussing our financial outlook. Let me preface my comments here that this outlook assumes that the U.S. economy continues to perform well by most measures. This includes GDP growth as COVID continues to wane, that Ukraine crisis does not derail the U.S. economy, that monetary policy becomes tighter as the Fed tries to rein in inflation, inflation while currently elevated, doesn't move up significantly or declines, supply chain and geopolitical issues are resolved, the unemployment rate remains relatively low and income taxes remain at current levels. On page 25, the first and third columns list our first quarter \u201822 and full fiscal year \u201821 adjusted actuals for the relevant metric or balance sheet line items. The numbers in these columns are adjusted for notable items to arrive at core noninterest income and expense. Column two provides our growth and other assumptions for the second quarter and column 4 for the full fiscal year 2022. From a loan growth perspective, we expect growth to be in the mid-single-digit percentage range in both Q2 and for the year. While we foresee continued mid- to high-single-digit growth in our branch network, we do continue to feel some pressures in the real estate finance portfolio based upon accelerated prepayments in the competitive landscape. We will continue to proactively add bankers in our wealth, middle market banking and large metro branch network areas to support loan growth. We also anticipate that our cost of funds will afford us opportunities to compete more favorably in the large commercial space on high credit rate opportunities and the continued collaboration of our legacy FCB and CIT lending teams and sending referrals will help increase loan volumes as the cultures become integrated. We are already seeing referral activity pick up as FCB and CIT gain more understanding of each legacy company's products and capabilities. On deposits, we do not expect to continue the legacy First Citizens robust levels of growth over the past two years as we seek to optimize funding by replacing higher cost accounts with lower cost core checking accounts. While we had strong growth in the first quarter, we do expect seasonal outflows in our branch network and CAB business and consequently, we expect deposits to be slightly down in the second quarter. On the year, we expect flat to low-single-digit percentage growth. However, if we continue to see upside in our noninterest-bearing account, we could exceed that guidance. Our expectation is that demand deposit growth will continue at a mid-single-digit percentage growth rate but will be offset by continued optimization of the funding base, highlighting higher-priced CDs and money market accounts run off. For net charge-offs, we expect a gradual return to pre-pandemic non-stress levels for both First Citizens and CIT. We expect net charge-offs in the range of 10 to 20 basis points in the second quarter and 15 to 25 basis points for the full year. The increase in our net charge-off projection is not due to any apparent stress in our portfolios. Rather, we think the impact of inflation and rising rates may result in our losses returning to more historic levels. For net interest income, we expect continued growth in the second quarter in the mid-single-digits percentage range compared to Q1 as the impact of expected rate increases on earning asset yields outpace increases in the cost of funding earning assets. On a full year basis, we expect low- to mid-teens percentage growth. From a core noninterest income perspective, we expect to be down slightly compared to the first quarter as renewal rates on operating leases increase and maintenance costs return to more normal levels. For the year, we expect upper single-digit growth led by net rental income on operating leases as well as continued growth in wealth, merchant and card income. From a core noninterest expense standpoint, we expect the second quarter to be flat to slightly negative compared to the first quarter as the impact of annual merit increases are offset by a decline in seasonal benefits extend the continued recognition of merger cost saves. On the year, we expect noninterest expense percentage growth to be low single digits. From a cost savings standpoint, we estimate that $100 million in cost saves is in our run rate currently and project $200 million to be in the run rate by the fourth quarter of this year. In 2023, we expect $250 million to be in our run rate by the fourth quarter. In closing, we are very pleased with our first quarter results and the hard work put in by our associates to make it happen. With that, I will now turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. Yes, sure, Frank. And I'll speak to this in terms of sort of where we sit in our CET1 sort of capital target range. And let's say that we target the middle of that range, which would put CET1 in around 10%. That would be the target. Excess capital would be approximately at the end of the quarter $1.1 billion. And then, if we take that out to the end of the year, around $1.6 billion. So, that should just give you some indication of the excess capital. I'm not telegraphing the exact amount that we will request for our repurchase plan. But every -- based on the targets we put out there for EPS, every $1 billion repurchase, if we assume stock price is where it was when the market closed, is about 10% accretive to EPS. So, we believe -- and we have not modeled any of that into our forecast, but we believe that is a -- could be a powerful strategy for our EPS accretion moving forward. I think in a -- I'll let Tom Eklund speak to this. If I missed anything, Tom, step in here. But I think in a perfect world, if we can just wave a magic wand, we would like to see sort of our earning asset mix with overnight investments from around 4% to 5% investment portfolio in the 19% to 20% range and then loans 74% to 77%. Right now, we are on the high end of that range with overnight investment stuff, we have the excess liquidity. We're about where we want to be on the investment portfolio, but then that offset of excess liquidity we'd like to see redeployed into the loan portfolio because simply put, with the current yield curve, if we were able to redeploy that excess liquidity, it will be accretive to margin by 10 to 15 basis points. And in terms of the absolute value of net interest income between $95 million and $143 million, which is not built into our current projections. So, I do think we should all keep in mind, we are restricted on how much we can redeploy in the loans, given that we have to have some liquidity reserve for liquidity stress tests and high-quality liquid assets against our deposits, but we do believe we have a great deal of balance sheet capacity here to boost earnings further than our projections in the K. Tom, did I miss anything there? I can give you the impact of purchase accounting, if you just bear with me. While I'm doing that, if you could help here as well. In the first quarter, if you just aggregate the -- purchase accounting impact on net interest income, it was around $33 million pretax or 14 basis points. So if you strip back -- if you were to strip that out from a margin standpoint, our margin would have been -- was 2.73%, would have been 2.59%. And instead of the actual 17 and 15 basis points that we increased, we would have increased by 9 and 11. So, that just gives you some of the magnitude on the net interest income side. And on the fee income side, Elliot, I don't think that there was a tremendous amount of purchase accounting impact. So, you're talking -- but that was interest income... But I'll just -- just for some perspective in the margin, our headline margin went up 15 basis points for the comparable quarter, 17 basis points for the linked. When you exclude both, purchase accounting and PPP, they would have been up 18 for both periods. So, while there's a lot of noise in there, what that indicates is that core net interest income is improving nicely. We stripped out for PPP and purchase accounting adjustments. Purchase accounting -- we spent a lot of time on purchase accounting, and it really does not have a huge impact on results. Yes. We definitely are engaging with our regulators, and so we're not just sitting on our hands with that. But it does take around a month for approval. So, that process will get -- will be in hand during this quarter, and very soon. We're feeling really good about the CIT portfolio. Credit quality is really strong. Those credits are sort of underwritten to stress scenarios. And CIT did a really good job of resisting market pressure to bend on credit quality and term. So just in general, we're feeling really good about it. In terms of the -- just the ACL, if you really -- if you look at where we are currently, we feel really good. And frankly, we feel like our reserve is conservative. And what I did went back and compared where we were at the end of the first quarter to the fourth quarter of \u201819, which is what we would consider pre-pandemic level. And our -- the ACL of the combined company was 1.29% and it was 1.43% back in fourth quarter of \u201819 as the companies would have been combined. The net charge-off ratio now is 9 and at the end of \u201819 it was 28. So, we now have 14% coverage, whereas we had 5% coverage -- 5 times coverage pre-pandemic. Another thing that Marisa Harney focuses on, our Chief Credit Officer, is how much does that allowance cover nonaccruals. We're covered 1.56 times now versus 1.47 times then. 30-day, 60-day past dues are down. Nonaccrual loans to total loans are down. Criticized loans are flat and classified loans slightly up. But most indicators along that spectrum indicate that we have a conservative and prudent allowance for loan losses. And I don't see any apparent near-term stress in the portfolio that would change our view on that. And Marisa, I don't know if you're on the line, if you would want to add to that? One thing I would say just to make sure that we disclaim a little bit of it. The ACL on our CECL is highly influenced by the S3 Moody's severe economic forecast. And a lot of what you saw this quarter where we had the reversal was due to the fact that those macroeconomic factors in terms of unemployment and CRE price index, home price index, all of that improved in the severe scenario while the baseline stayed pretty moderate. With the news today, with the print today, that could change next quarter. So, we might see some pressure. Obviously, we see pressure, not to have negative provision, but we could see pressure to start building reserves back. So, that's one qualification that I would give to all that. But in terms of the portfolio, we're feeling really good about the way it's performing and its credit quality. Well, our first priority is to lend the money, to lend the liquidity. The investment portfolio is sort of there to put whatever is left over in excess liquidity. And obviously, we want to try to maximize that yield. But at the same time, we want to protect ourselves from hits to TBV and market value as rates rise. And so, with respect to the securities portfolio, you'll see us generally buying residential government-backed or sponsored in Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities with shorter duration. And what we're trying to do there is reduce the volatility in a rising rate environment. So, either -- we're either buying securities that have -- they might be back about 30-year mortgages, but those are going to be seasoned or we just buy securities back about 15-year mortgages. So, the duration of our portfolio is probably a bit shorter than peer. We are in discussions now, and I'll let Tom hit this as well, give more detail, but we are discussing now about going a little longer with reinvested cash flows but would look for securities with more defined, locked out cash flows, bullet like cash flows. And we believe we could pick up some yield there, to your point and have more predictable cash flows. But we're likely to consider doing that as we move further into this rate cycle increase. We don't think it makes a lot of sense to go longer right now. I know others are doing that. Given that rates are heading up from here, we just -- we're at the beginning of the rate cycle. So, that's sort of the investment strategy, but I'll let Tom amplify that if he needs to say anything -- if he'd like to say anything else about it. Thank you. Loan rates, what I think you'll see is our loan yield sort of stabilized this quarter. And the rate sheets right now are higher than loans are rolling off. So we're going to naturally start to see a pickup in our loan yield. And the same thing is true for our investment portfolio yield."

            "content": "Thank you, Deanna, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate all of you joining us today. We are pleased to announce solid first quarter results this morning. We continue to remain focused on ensuring a timely and successful integration with CIT and made good progress during the quarter, and we're very excited about our prospects moving forward. As Craig will touch on when he covers our financial outlook, we expect net interest margin to continue to expand. Our customers, by and large, are in good shape, so we feel good about the prospects for loan growth. And we expect continued momentum in our fee income generating lines of business as well as further progress on our cost save target. Turning to page 5 of the investor presentation. We continue to remain focused on ensuring a timely and successful merger integration for our customers and associates. Leveraging our dedicated integration management office comprised of execution-oriented leaders with multiple acquisitions, conversions and integrations under their belts, we are working hard to ensure the value of the deal is realized for employees, customers and shareholders. And I'm pleased to say, we are exactly where we expected to be at this point in time. All of us are focused on ensuring our teams are coordinated and meeting our integration time line. As we've said before and are experiencing as we integrate, integration risk can be better managed in this merger because of the structure of CIT. Instead of converting a large bank over a long weekend, which is typically the case, CIT is a diverse group -- or it has a diverse and unique business units and groups that will include some conversions, like One West, which is slated for mid-July, but will also include lifting and shifting or replatforming other lines of businesses, like factoring, commercial finance and rail, which will be managed individually and sequenced in a way that manages the integration cleanly over the next few months. Turning to page 6. I want to thank all of our associates for their dedication, hard work and sacrifice to ensure that we are making progress on our integration milestones. We are pleased with our progress on our cost saves target of $250 million and expect that $200 million will be in the run rate by the end of this year. As Craig will soon cover, during the first quarter, we achieved positive operating leverage as net revenue grew at a faster pace than expenses, leading to strong core earnings and pre-provision net revenue growth. We will continue to focus on redeploying excess liquidity into loans and investments at higher rates to boost net interest income and margin. We look forward to making progress -- further progress on merger integration and producing strong results in the second quarter. Before I turn it over to Craig, I'd like to say that despite some of the uncertainty out there, given geopolitical and macroeconomic issues, we remain very excited and optimistic about our growth prospects. We are already shifting from integration focus to execution in many areas throughout the bank, and we're working hard to capture the synergistic value from the CIT merger on the revenue and expense side, and that's already bearing fruit. We are well-positioned to perform well given -- we are well-positioned to perform well, given our long-term focus, our focus on relationships, our risk appetite and the diversity of our business segments and our enhanced earnings profile, as we are now merged with CIT. Now, Craig will provide a closer look at our financial quarter results. And then, we'll open the line for questions. Craig? Brady, this is Frank Holding. I'm going to give some sort of context for this question, and I'm going to let Craig answer it a little more specifically. Given our early success in integration and demonstrating solid safety and soundness metrics with stable systems, we remain confident having a, I'll describe it as a robust stock repurchase plan in the second half of the year, as we've discussed before. Simply, our deep experience in integration is proving out here. And we felt strong capital levels were prudent in a merger of this size, but our early success and the greater line of sight in projections around integration efforts along with strong safety and soundness metrics. But again, we feel that it's prudent, and we feel very good about having our second half plans for a, I'll describe it as robust stock repurchase plan is warranted. Craig, do you want to talk about anything, you want to expand on that? This is Frank Holding. We see strong markets really across the country. There are no weak spots that we see. Certainly, some are stronger than others. I guess, generally, the larger metropolitan areas that we serve are probably -- have a more robust growth than some of the more suburban or rural areas, but we don't see any weakness. We've noted no weakness in any particular part of the country. Chris, I'm going to add a little bit to that. You have to realize that outside of the Carolinas, all the markets that we expand into, we basically chose because the metrics there were that they had stronger population growth and greater household income and growth of that household income versus national averages. So, I don't want to say that the whole U.S. is performing equally, but we didn't choose those markets equally either."

            "content": "Yes. No, everything that Craig said is absolutely true. The legacy CIT portfolios are, frankly, performing at some of their best levels from a credit quality perspective, even in the context of pre-pandemic, which is what I look at. A lot of people talk about, \"Oh, it's improved since 2020.\" Well, a lot has improved since 2020. But, our indicators are suggesting that we are back to, if not better than our pre-pandemic asset quality levels. And I think some of that is a testament to, as Craig indicated, our very balanced underwriting approach to what has been a very, very competitive loan market, not just in terms of pricing, but in terms of terms as well. So, I reiterate what Craig said. I don't see anything on the near horizon from a sector perspective or from a specific transactional perspective that gives me concern at this time. We're obviously watching all the macroeconomic indicators going forward. And as Craig said, we underwrite to stress scenarios. So, all is well."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.  I would now like to introduce the host of this conference call, Ms. Deanna Hart, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nDeanna Hart: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Frank Holding; and Chief Financial Officer, Craig Nix, will provide fourth quarter business and financial updates today. During the call, we will reference our investor presentation, which you can find on our website. Our comments will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. We assume no obligation to update such statements. These risks are outlined for you on Page 3. We will also reference non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures against the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in Section 5 of the presentation. Finally, First Citizens is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of earnings transcripts provided by third parties.  I will now turn it over to Frank.\nFrank Holding : Thank you, Deanna, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to focus my comments today on our fourth quarter accomplishments and our 2024 strategic priorities before turning it over to Craig to cover our fourth quarter financial results and outlook for 2024. Let's start on Page 5. The fourth quarter capped off another exciting and successful year at First Citizens. We kicked off the year, 1 year into our successful merger with CIT and rang out the year combined with SVB, all as we celebrated our 125th year anniversary. I'm really proud of what we accomplished in 2023 and believe we have tremendous opportunity ahead of us. There is an undeniable sense of momentum at First Citizens and our ambition is to serve our clients in ways never imagined 125 years ago. And we're well positioned for the future, thanks to continued focus on our clients and customers and our solid financial results. We delivered another quarter of solid financial results, driven by a strong net interest margin and adjusted efficiency ratio of 48%. We're pleased that both our general and commercial bank segments grew loans by double-digit percentage points in 2023. Due to strong deposit growth during the year, we improved our liquidity position significantly and ended the year with a strong capital position marked by a CET1 ratio of 13.36%. We recently announced 2 major additions to our team, which will help us to continue to successfully navigate the ever-changing landscape for large financial institutions. First, David Leitch was appointed to the Board of Directors in January. David is a distinguished leader, executive and attorney and he brings extensive experience and valuable insight to our Board. He retired from Bank of America in 2022, where he served as Vice Chair from 2021, 2022, and its Global General Counsel from 2016 to 2021, and we're excited to have David join the Board. Second, we announced that Greg Smith will join our executive leadership team as the bank's Chief Information and Operations Officer. Greg joins our team from TD Bank Financial Group in Toronto, Canada, where he served as Head of Transformation and Corporate Operations. In this leadership role, he set the vision and built key capabilities to drive end-to-end transformational change. He was also responsible for managing corporate projects and technology platforms. In the CIOO role at First Citizens, he will be responsible for the strategic enablement of technology, operations, cyber and data functions across the enterprise. Greg's extensive background and depth of experience will make him well suited to take on these important responsibilities, and we're excited to have him on board. Moving to Page 6. We remain intently focused on our core strategies, and I'll highlight a few of them for 2024. First, we remain focused on our clients and customers. Our combinations with CIT and SVB introduced us to new strategic markets that allow us to deliver expanded products and solutions across our diversified lines of business. We continue to support SVB's innovation economy clients and are focused on capturing synergies with the commercial businesses we acquired from CIT. In the general bank, we have enhanced our deposit campaigns to continue to grow quality core deposits. As we noted last quarter, we continue to expand our wealth business across our geographic footprint and our expanding advisory and self-service options for our clients in that space. Developing our associates and adding talent to support growth remain important priorities. Our integration efforts are centered on ensuring that we retain our culture which emphasizes a relationship-based approach to banking, a client-centric customer -- client and customer-centric service delivery model, a long-term focus and strong risk management. Operational efficiency is very important to us. In addition to disciplined expense management, we are managing our balance sheet to optimize our liquidity and capital positions to support continued profitable growth. Core deposit growth will be a major priority as we continue to increase deposits as a percentage of our total funding mix. We also continue to make regulatory readiness, a top strategic priority. We have made meaningful progress on our efforts thus far, but acknowledge we need to continue to refine and mature our processes to support the change in the company's size and complexity. We will be intently focused on these efforts in 2024. Now let's look at Page 7. We continue to make good progress on SVB's integration. Our efforts there have been extremely important, helping us retain clients, stabilize deposit balances and develop strategic priorities for the combined organization. As we discussed on the last call, we developed an integration road map, and we expect the majority of those efforts to be completed in 2024. Our goal remains to support the acquired lines of business, maintain their unique capabilities, all while improving efficiency and risk management, positioning us for future growth. We acknowledge the headwinds in the innovation economy as well as the increased competition in the space. However, we remain encouraged by the strength and value the SVB franchise brings to its client base and its unwavering commitment to providing a relationship-focused service that is unmatched in the innovation ecosystem. To conclude, I am very pleased with our performance in 2023 and excited about growth opportunities as we enter 2024. Despite industry adversity in 2023, we were able to protect and grow customer relationships, stabilize deposits at SVB, grow core deposits and loans in our general and commercial bank segments and build upon our strong capital and liquidity positions. I'd like to thank all of our associates for making 2023 a successful and positioning the bank for a successful future. With that, I'll turn it over to Craig Nix. Craig?\nCraig Nix : Thank you, Frank, and thank you all of you for joining us today. I'm going to anchor my comments regarding our fourth quarter financial results to the takeaways outlined on Page 9. Pages 10 through 29 provide more detail supporting the results for your reference. Our return metrics remain solid and in line with our expectations. ROE and ROA adjusted for notable items from 13.53% and 1.28%, respectively. Compared to the third quarter, these metrics were impacted by an expected 3.9% sequential decline in net interest income driven by a reduction in accretion income and higher deposit costs. These impacts were partially offset by higher loan and investment portfolio yields, which benefited from maturity and replacement of lower-yielding assets during the quarter. These higher yields offset by higher deposit costs drove net interest income ex accretion to be essentially flat to the sequential quarter. NIM contracted by 21 basis points during the quarter to 3.86% driven primarily by the same factors affecting the decline in net interest income I just discussed. Ex accretion, NIM declined by 5 basis points to 3.46%. Adjusted noninterest income was down modestly by 3% sequentially and majority of the decrease related to a decline in the fair value of customer derivative positions as a result of lower interest rates. Additionally, as we previously guided, our rental business experienced a decline in net rental income due to higher maintenance expenses. As a reminder, given strong utilization rates and positive repricing trends, we made the strategic decision to pull forward regulatory requalification programs in order to increase the number of available cars for leasing in 2024. These updates position us well to continue to provide our customers with the equipment they need. While we expect some normalization to historically high utilization levels in 2024, we believe that our well-diversified fleet positions us well for the future. A bright spot in the quarter was an increase in capital market fees as our capital markets business had its highest figure on record as we were able to take advantage of market dislocation as many banks pull back. Adjusted noninterest expense was largely in line with expectations, increasing sequentially by less than 1%. We experienced expense growth during the quarter in consulting and project costs related to strategic investments we had delayed earlier in the year. As we noted on the third quarter call, consulting and project costs were lower in the second and third quarters as we assessed and reprioritized areas of focus heading into 2024. In addition, fourth quarter expenses reflected our expanded CRA commitment as part of our integration efforts to assist communities in Northern California and Eastern Massachusetts. These increases were almost completely offset by lower FDIC insurance and personnel expenses. We remain very cognizant of the importance of expense discipline as we head into 2024, given headwinds to net interest income facing us and many in the industry. Credit continues to normalize and traced with our expectations for the quarter with net charge-offs coming in at the lower end of our guidance range of 50 to 60 basis points. Net charge-offs were $177 million during the quarter, representing a ratio of 0.53% of average loans, basically flat compared to the third quarter. Losses were largely in the same portfolio where we experienced charge-offs in previous quarters. Within the commercial bank, net charge-offs were concentrated in the general office and small ticket equipment leasing portfolios. We also experienced an idiosyncratic loss in the energy portfolio this quarter that we believe is not indicative of broader terms in the portfolio. While we continue to see stress in our general office portfolio in the commercial bank due to continued inflationary pressure, elevated interest rates and market dislocation, we have limited exposure which totaled $1.2 billion or roughly 1% of loans at the end of the fourth quarter. As a reminder, this portfolio is concentrated in Class B repositioned bridge loans and is where we have seen deterioration in past dues, criticized assets and charge-offs. General office CRE continues to be carefully monitored, and we are carrying an ACL on these loans of 9.37% compared to 4.77% on the overall general office portfolio. Net charge-offs in the SVB segment remained elevated due to continued stress in the investor dependent portfolio, but did decline sequentially by $35 million. At quarter end, this portfolio totaled $4.3 billion or approximately 3% of total loans with the highest risk category, early-stage companies totaling $1.4 billion or just over 1% of total loans. The allowance for credit losses increased sequentially by 5 basis points to 1.31% due to some adverse credit migration in our commercial portfolio and higher specific reserves on loans individually reviewed. Under the current macroeconomic backdrop, we continually look for indicators of portfolio stress by reviewing delinquency trends and grading migration by industry and/or geography to identify areas of concern. While credit quality remains within our risk appetite, we anticipate elevated net charge-offs in the innovation, general office and equipment finance portfolios this year. We have taken proactive steps to help limit losses, and we feel that we are properly balancing our growth and underwriting strategy, emphasizing opportunities to build upon our expertise and provide an appropriate risk-adjusted return. Now moving to the balance sheet. Loans were up $100 million over the third quarter. The General and Commercial Bank segment grew loans by $1.3 billion and $716 million respectively, while the SVB segment experienced a decline of just under $2 billion. In the General Bank, growth was concentrated in small business and commercial loans in our branch network as we continue to grow our customer base and deepen relationships. We are focused on executing our strategy of growing our customer base and supporting existing clients where we have a relationship and a proven history. We believe this relationship banking approach will continue to serve us well. In the Commercial Bank, Growth was driven by strong production in our industry verticals and middle market banking. Within the industry verticals, growth was concentrated in TMT, health care and energy. Growth in our TMT vertical continues to be driven by strong demand for new data centers. Our energy vertical is benefiting from the power infrastructure and renewable energy markets. As for middle market, the team continued its expansion strategy in 2023, adding bankers in Boston, New York, Santa Monica, Atlanta and Dallas, contributing to increased loan production during the year. The reduction in SVB segment loans was driven primarily by a decline in global fund banking, but to a smaller extent we saw a reduction in our technology and health care banking business. Despite a slowdown in private equity and venture capital markets, we are encouraged by strengthening loan pipeline in Global Fund Banking, which expanded by approximately 40% [indiscernible] quarter as the team continues to support our existing clients as well as add new relationships. Global Fund Banking closed on $4.8 billion in new deals in the fourth quarter, a 129% increase over the third quarter. While utilization room is depressed due to the macroeconomic environment, we have the largest finance team in the market and total approved exposure on the loan book has stabilized and has started to ramp up as the team continues to execute. We remain the primary banking partner for the vast majority of our GFB clients, which positions us well to ramp up both loans and deposits quickly when the macroeconomic environment improves. The decline in technology and health care banking was driven by paydowns outpacing new fundings as the private market investment landscape continues to face headwinds resulting in a difficult exit environment, lower fundraising numbers and fewer deals. Deposits were down a modest 0.3% sequentially driven by a $1.5 billion decline in the SVB segment due to continued client cash burn and muted fundraising activity. Importantly though, investment inflows increased from the third quarter, while outflows from burn declined, which helped us beat our third quarter forecast of an approximate $5 billion decline. The branch network declined by $492 million due to expected seasonal outflows. These declines were partially offset by a $2 billion increase in direct bank deposits. While the direct bank channel is higher cost and now accounts for 26% of our deposit base, it is an additional lever we continue to use to remain resilient through a turbulent environment and is a strong source of insured consumer deposits supporting our liquidity base. It also enabled us to pay down higher-cost FHLB debt earlier in the year and most recently redeemed some of our smaller subordinated debt issuances given excess capital and liquidity positions. Moving to capital. We continue to maintain a position of strength as our CET1 ratio increased by 11 basis points sequentially and ended the quarter at 13.36%, which remains well above our internal target range of 9% to 10%. The impact from our loss share agreement continues to provide for higher capital levels and contributed approximately 120 basis points to our CET1 ratio this quarter, down from 140 basis points last quarter. Even without this benefit to our ratios, we remain well above our target capital ranges and anticipate operating at an elevated level in the near term. We are currently in our annual capital planning process which includes reassessment of our goals and targets for consideration of both SVB and future regulatory changes. This process includes a full stress test, including the acquired SVB portfolio. Additionally, we continue to monitor the proposed Basel III rules but remained well positioned for any changes, including the inclusion of AOCI marks. Our CET1 ratio at the end of the fourth quarter was estimated at 11.8% when these AOCI marks are included and the impact from the loss share agreement is removed. We have confidence in the rate that we are accreting capital and our absolute capital levels relative to our internal targets, our capacity to handle balance sheet growth, our SVB integration efforts and our positioning with respect to the Basel III end game. Therefore, we do anticipate that our 2024 capital plan will include a share repurchase plan, which once approved, will commence in the second half of this year. We also anticipate beginning a programmatic issuance of long-term debt in 2024 to ensure compliance with the proposed long-term debt requirements by the expected phase-in deadlines. We expect our binding and strain to be risk-weighted assets for long-term debt and estimate our long-term debt shortfall to be approximately $8 billion to $11 billion. While this strategy is partly dictated by regulatory requirements, we anticipate these funding actions along with our deposit growth strategies will support the replacement of some portion of the FDIC purchase money note, which matures in March of 2028. I will close today on Page 31 by discussing our first quarter and full year outlook for 2024. We anticipate that loans will remain flat to modestly increase in the first quarter, driven by low single-digit percentage Commercial Banking segment due to continued strong performance in our industry verticals. We anticipate SVB loan balances to remain flat in the mid-$50 billion range. As mentioned earlier, the Global Fund Banking business is benefiting from a strong pipeline due to being back in the market for clients during the second half of 2023 following the pause prior and immediately after the acquisition. This growth, however, will continue to be pressured by headwinds in the private equity and venture capital markets. We also anticipate a modest decline in the technology and health care banking business as lower levels of new fundings and line draws coupled with increased loan payoffs result in loan portfolio contraction. Looking at the full year, we expect loans to end in the $139 billion to $143 billion range or mid-single-digit percentage growth. We foresee increased volumes in our Global Fund Banking business as a result of increased outreach beginning in the second quarter of '23 and our increased pipeline. Additionally, we continue to see strong growth in our general and commercial bank segments. However, we do expect moderation to mid-single-digit percentage growth in these segments in 2023. Turning to deposits. We expect a low single-digit percentage point increase in the first quarter, primarily due to growth in the branch network driven by leveraging new products and initiatives to deepen client relationships that emphasize deposit growth as well as seasonal growth prior to April tax outflows. We are also focused on increasing our customer base by building deposits through proactive sales associate outreach, centralized marketing campaign and increased community connectivity. For the full year, we anticipate low to mid-single-digit percentage growth primarily related to growth in the general bank previously discussed and a mid-single-digit percentage growth in SVB deposits as market activity and the impacts of customer outreach begin to help produce deposit growth in the back half of 2024. With respect to SVB deposits, we expect the venture capital environment to remain challenging, particularly in the first half of 2024. Since April, we've seen SVB deposits remain largely stable despite continued cash burn exceeding funds sourced from fundraising activities. Encouragingly, we also added over 60 new primary operating business clients between April and November of 2023. We believe our emphasis on client engagement, coupled with better fundraising in the back half of 2024 will help propel modest growth in this segment. We'll continue to raise deposits in our direct bank. However, given the excess liquidity on our balance sheet, this pace will be moderated from the growth we experienced in 2023 with a growth rate of less than 10% anticipated in the channel. This obviously could change if we have unexpected deposit outflows elsewhere. Our interest rate forecast follows the implied forward curve, which includes 6 rate cuts in 2024, with the effective Fed funds rate declining from 5.5% to 4% by the end of the year. The implied curve currently diverges from the Fed dot plot expectations, which includes 3 rate cuts with effective Fed funds rate declining to 4.75%. It is our belief that we will see closer to 3 or 4 rate cuts given the continued strength in the labor market and the fact that inflation remains stubbornly above the Fed's target rate. Therefore, for our net interest income guidance, we provide a range with the top end assuming 3 rate cuts and the low end assuming 6 rate cuts. For the first quarter, we expect net interest income to be down in mid-single-digit percentage points range with and without accretion. The decline in headline net interest income will be driven by the impact of lower accretion and higher deposit costs, only partially offset by higher investment yields. For the full year, we expect net interest income in the range of $6.9 billion to $7.1 billion, with the low end assuming fixed rate cuts and the high end, assuming 3 rate cuts. In either case, we project accretion income close to $485 million for the year, which is a decline from $725 million in the last 3 quarters of '23 as loan discounts on some of the shorter portfolios have been fully recognized. Isolated net interest income for the second through fourth quarter period to take into effect the timing of the SVB merger with 6 rate cuts, we expect headline net interest income to be low double digits percentage points and ex accretion by high single-digit percentage point. With 3 rate cuts, we expect headline to be down high single-digit percentage points and ex accretion down low to mid-single-digit percentage points. We anticipate our full cycle data to be approximately 44%, which is materially in line with our previous estimate of 43%. Moving on to adjusted noninterest income. We expect the first quarter to be relatively in line with the fourth quarter in the $440 million to $460 million range. Looking at the full year and isolating for only the second through fourth quarters, we anticipate being flat as continued growth in net operating lease rental, wealth management and mortgage income are offset by a decline in client investment fees due to anticipated lower -- the anticipated lower interest rate environment. We expect full year noninterest income to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. As Frank mentioned in his comments, we are excited for the continued build-out of and momentum in our wealth platform and will look to fully convert the legacy silicon private businesses in 2024. Moving to expenses. We expect a modest increase from the fourth quarter due to seasonal increases in personnel expense from higher benefits and incentives and software costs due to continued build out of product capabilities that will help us be a premier partner in the innovation economy in areas such as cash management, FX and payments as well as continued investment in our wealth capabilities that will help us sell deeper into our new national reach. Furthermore, we will continue the modernization of our platforms in consumer, equipment finance and factoring to ensure we are well equipped to scale in the future. We also have a few regulatory projects we will be completing this year related to ISO payments and Dodd-Frank. In addition, as Frank alluded to earlier, we were focused on building out our capabilities in the large bank and regulatory spaces which will require some focused builds. As of this -- all of this will be partially offset by continued acquisition synergies. Looking at the full year and isolating for the second through fourth quarters, we anticipate noninterest expense to be flat to up low single digits percentage points which equates to an adjusted noninterest expense target for the year of between $4.6 billion and $4.7 billion. While we expect to achieve the lower 25% band of our cost saves goal by the end of 2024, these savings will be offset by continued capability build out for large bank expectations as well as costs related to the strategic priorities I just mentioned. Our adjusted efficiency ratio is expected to be in the low 50% range in 2024, up slightly from 49% for full year 2023. On credit, we anticipate net charge-offs to remain in the 50 to 60 basis points range in the first quarter, given continued pressure in the general office real estate, small ticket equipment leasing and innovation portfolios. For the year, we expect net charge-offs in the 45 to 55 basis points range as we expect some of the pressure in the investor dependent portfolio to soften in the back half of the year as well as some of the changes we made in underwriting small ticket leases in 2022 began to favorably impact the net charge-off ratio. For both the first quarter and full year of 2024, we expect our tax rate to be in the 27% to 28% range, which is exclusive of any discrete items. In closing, we have accomplished a lot in 2023, including the transformational acquisition of SVB, which brought significant scale to our business and new product offerings through our geographically diverse client base. While economic and geopolitical uncertainties remain, we believe the strength of our diversified businesses, our strong capital and liquidity positions and our hard-working and dedicated associates will help us continue to take care of our customers and clients and deliver meaningful returns to our shareholders. As we've proven during previous economic downturns, our business model is resilient and recession-ready in large part due to our disciplined through-the-cycle credit underwriting standards and robust risk management infrastructure. In 2024, we remain focused on allocating capital where we can drive deeper relationship business with the goal of continuing to deliver top-tier financial returns. I will now turn it over to the operator for instructions for the question-and-answer portion of the call.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos from JP Morgan.\nSteven Alexopoulos : I want to start on asset sensitivity and the net interest income guidance. So part of what makes you guys so asset sensitive, right, is the outsized cash position. How do you guys see cash balances trending through 2024? What's in the guidance? And if the Fed does start cutting rates, is that the time to start putting more cash to work? Or are you still more focused on SVB deposits and other issues?\nCraig Nix: Well, first of all, right now, cash is around 17% of earning assets. And ideally, over time, we'd like to see that migrate to 10% to 12% replaced with either loans or investments. So -- but at this point in time, where we are in the cycle, we believe we have time to get that down, especially given the purchase money note. I'll let Tom talk a little bit about the rate sensitivity and the cash balance and what we may be looking for doing to position ourselves going forward.\nTom Eklund: Yes, Steve. During the second half of last year, we put about $8 billion worth of migrated from cash to securities, and we expect that to continue into 2024. Really, what we're doing is we're taking a methodical approach, not trying to buy the curve on any one day, but sort of do it over time and we'll continue to do that. We also put on about $1 billion worth of fair value hedges where we moved some of our fixed rate borrowings to floating rates. And you can expect to see that sort of continue to mitigate that asset sensitivity over time.\nSteven Alexopoulos : Okay. Got it. But you're generally expecting cash balances to stay fairly elevated in terms of what's in the NII guidance, right? That's what you're saying.\nCraig Nix: Yes, I think that's true, although I think the percentage might drop some, but not into that 10% to 12% ban at the end of 2024.\nSteven Alexopoulos : Okay. And then my follow-up question, I don't know Mark's on the line but in terms of the SVB business, last quarter, you guys talked about some green shoots, positive signs, right, new account openings. Curious, what do you see in the most recent quarter in terms of clients' prospects coming back to the bank and what's your assessment of the state of the market right now? I saw early-stage losses up a bit. Capital falls down, pipeline up. Just looks like the view on the current ecosystem at the moment.\nCraig Nix: Mark, do you want to take that?\nUnidentified Company Representative: Yes. Happy to jump in there. Steve, it's [Mark Cater]. And the fourth quarter was really, in this regard, a lot like the third quarter, continued momentum with new clients, new lending, winning back business that had departed to other financial institutions, et cetera. And so very encouraged by that as we look ahead to '24. At the same time, as I think Craig already mentioned, our target markets, the innovation economy continues to go through the reset, its own downturn. And as mentioned, we expect that's going to continue in '24. And so our intention is to keep doing what we were doing in '23. And hoping that '25 and ahead is better conditions, but again, feel good about the momentum we've got and going into '24, notwithstanding that we still have market headwinds.\nOperator: The next question today comes from the line of Brody Preston from UBS.\nBrody Preston : Craig, I just wanted to follow up on the cash comment. So if we're -- if you're using the forward curve, which has the Fed funds ending at 4% at the high end of the target range for 2024, so like [3.78] at the midpoint. Why not use the cash at the end of the year or sometime in the first quarter of '25, maybe to pay back that FDIC note. I mean, you'd just be earning like 35 to 40 basis points on it at that time. So it's pretty NIM dilutive. And I'm assuming that you all feel like you have a pretty decent handle on the SVB deposits now. Like is that contemplated in your thought process at all?\nCraig Nix: Yes, I'm going to let Tom amplify what I'm going to say here. But right now, where rates are, there's a positive arbitrage in there. And while it's dilutive to NIM, it's accretive to net interest income. Obviously, as we move into more rate cuts, it becomes less attractive to leave that purchase money note out there. And with the excess liquidity we have, we would have some optionality of pulling that down. Tom, would you like to amplify that?\nTom Eklund: I mean, I think the only comment I'd make is that, again, that excess liquidity and having that cash provides that option for us should raise all of the forecasted path and the forward rate curve. That's where it...\nBrody Preston : And then I did want to circle back. I think I heard you earlier, Craig, that you said you expected the SVB loans to remain around like in the $50 billion-ish kind of area for this year. I guess I wanted to ask like a little bit of a 2-part question here. What is kind of like the mix that you're assuming within that just because I saw that the cash flow dependent balances were up about $1 billion this quarter. And then two, like how do you think about the components of growth and what it does to the multiple? Because you kind of have these 2 divergent paths, right? If you can grow SVB that should naturally come with higher DDA balances, and that's really enhancing to your multiple over the long term versus kind of growing the higher-yielding commercial bank and maybe funding it more with your savings product is great for balance sheet growth, but I think investors would do that as less multiple enhancing? Like how do you think about those 2 paths?\nElliot Howard: Yes. Brody, this is Elliot Howard. I think on the SVB growth, we're expected to be up slightly from about mid-50s range this year, and a lot of that in the Global Fund Banking. Craig mentioned that our pipeline was up $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter from where it was, just really as a result of kind of being back in the market more fully in the second quarter. I think we're still seeing headwinds as Mark mentioned, second health care, just given the overall kind of environment. Longer term, I think we're bullish on the SVB growth, market activity returns, just with a similar of a client in the outreach to new clients. I think with that, certainly, with the loan growth, we'd expect more deposit growth to come as well as that returns, and that's a -- keep a rate on what we have certainly again our savings product and direct banks. The more that we can grow the SVB, we do think that will be setting better for the overall bank in earnings.\nBrody Preston : Got it. So just to confirm, though, for 2024, it does sound like we're leaning more into the commercial bank and maybe kind of funding that with higher cost savings deposits. Is that fair?\nCraig Nix: We're also projecting mid-single-digit growth in the general bank as well. So it's just pretty spread across the loan portfolios.\nOperator: The next question today comes from the line of Christopher Marinac from Janney Montgomery Scott.\nChristopher Marinac : Just wanted to ask more about the general criticized loan trends beyond what we saw in the DAC on office and the SVB portfolio?\nAndy Giangrave: Yes. Sure. This is Andy Giangrave. Obviously, it's -- the trends we're seeing are concentrated in general office and innovation. I think we have seen moderate migration in C&I, but nothing at this point of any concern.\nChristopher Marinac : Great. And then the charge-off guide being a little higher now in Q1 and then a little lower for the whole year, does that indicate to sort of kind of past clean up or clean up from past issues? Or do you see sort of, I guess, some greater shoots that, that credit can improve as this year goes on?\nAndy Giangrave: Yes. I think it's going to be the continued theme that we spoke about last quarter and this quarter. It's going to be concentrated in office innovation and our equipment finance. Obviously, there's the secular shift in office that's still a challenge, especially in this interest rate environment. The innovation, I think Mark highlighted well the challenges in the market. And then in the equipment finance side, it's really working through some of those older vintages, but we feel like the tightening of our underwriting in that portfolio and some of the increase in collection efforts should start to show some benefits in the back half of the year.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from the line of Brian Foran from Autonomous.\nBrian Foran : Maybe to follow up on credit and these 4 kind of main portfolios, the Class C office, the 2 investor-dependent and in the small ticket equipment finance. I think they total about $6.5 billion now, and you give us the reserves on most. But then I guess you also have pretty heavy charge-offs already and some purchase accounting marks. I don't know if it's easier to talk about them as a group or some of them separate. Is there any way to like frame between the allowance, the charge-offs to date and the purchase accounting. Like what is the cumulative loss you've now recognized on these portfolios.\nCraig Nix: Brian, this is Craig. I'll take those individually and in aggregate because I think it's important to really size that portfolio relative to the overall loan portfolio. If you take those 3 components, commercial, general office, equipment finance and the investor-dependent loans, whether the growth stages or early stage. Those totaled about $11.3 billion which is 8% of the loan portfolio. If you look at -- and now -- and so all those portfolios, we have total loss absorbing capacity of around 6.06% on net charge-offs for the year of around [$3.6 billion]. So if you aggregate those portfolios, our coverage is 1.9x, if we slice it down to the individual portfolios, commercial, general office, we have a coverage ratio of 1.1 and allow us 7.99% on charge-off price of $7.48. On the equipment finance, the allowance is 3.52% and charge-offs 1.87% to around 1.9% coverage. And then on investor dependent, we have an allowance of 5.21 and a purchase discount of 3.58 which totals the total loss of building capacity of 8.79. So the allowance covers the charge-offs of 4.66, but when including that purchase discount, which is available to absorb losses takes it to 1.9x. So we feel really good about both our projections there and about our coverage in terms of charge-offs both that we've incurred and that we expect to occur moving forward.\nBrian Foran : That's really helpful. I guess on the buyback, I'm assuming you're not going to answer the obvious question of sizing it for the second half of the year. But maybe can you just remind us, as we've moved through this year, there's been CET1. There's been CET1 ex the loss share. There's been the leverage. It seems like some of the divergent metrics are starting to converge. But when you look at kind of your excess capital position and what number are you focused on? Is it the roughly 12 pro forma CET1 versus the 9% to 10% target? With the different capital metrics, what's the focus right now as you move to midyear?\nCraig Nix: Yes. We look at it sort of -- I mean, if we do an asset test as of 12/31/23, with Basel III, it's around 12%. If we do an asset test with Basel III at [ex loss] share, it's around 11%. So that range of 11% to 12% sort of asset debt, that\u2019s at 12/31/23 leaves us well above our target ranges. And then obviously, as time goes on, we're accreting earnings at about 36 basis points a quarter and risk-weighted assets, we're taking at 27. So we look -- it's going to continue -- our capital position is going to continue to build. So we do think that share repurchases are going to -- we feel confident about share repurchases, not only rate accreting capital, but just the absolute levels of capital, our capacity to handle our balance sheet growth, SVB integration efforts and our positioning with respect to Basel III, all give us confidence in a very purposed plan. And you're right, I really can't speak to the size of that until we get through our internal stress testing, which is being conducted now as part of our capital plan. We do expect the timing subject to necessary internal and regulatory approvals to be in the second half of this year. So I hope that's helpful, but we are looking at definitely target that our capital ratios are well above our target ranges, looking at it in a myriad of different ways.\nOperator: The next question today is a follow-up question from Steven Alexopoulos from JP Morgan.\nSteven Alexopoulos : So the market is pretty happy with the news of buybacks coming back in the second half. My question is, so given the tangible book value growth, such a key focus for the senior team, at this valuation, I'm sure you'd love to be buying back the stock today. But at what valuation do buybacks become less attractive, right? I mean if the stock is trading, Mark delivers what we think at SVB, just saying it's 1.5% or something like that. This year, do you still buy back in the second half? Like where is like the line of the sand where you don't find buybacks as attractive?\nCraig Nix: Well, we look at it just like we would any other acquisitions. So there are a myriad of payback periods and tangible dilution payback periods that we look at. I'm not going to get into our modeling on it. But we certainly scrutinize repurchases just like we would scrutinize purchasing another bank in the open market. Tom, do you have anything else? Tom is responsible for some of the modeling we do there. But I think that's generally -- I don't think I left anything out there.\nTom Eklund: No, I think that's exactly right. I mean we bought back above tangible value in the past and it really has to do with sort of what our earnings trajectory looks like and sort of what other opportunities are out there. So yes, it varies, but it's not like there's a firm feeling.\nSteven Alexopoulos : Got it. Okay. Just one other one. On the NII guide, do you guys include the expected cost of this $8 billion to $11 billion debt issuance? Is that in there? Or if you issue, will that then impact the NII guide?\nCraig Nix: It's in there, but the issuance this year would be muted, so it won't have a significant impact on this year's NIM. But going forward, it will based on where our costs are today and what the costs are anticipated on that will probably be a headwind moving forward.\nOperator: The next question today is a follow-up question from Brody Preston from UBS.\nBrody Preston : I just had a couple of clarifying questions that I wanted to ask. The first one was just on the innovation C&I and cash flow dependent portfolio. As I said earlier, that was up $1 billion in balances. Was there any like movement from like the growth stage portfolio there? Was that kind of like true growth within that portfolio? And if so, do you happen to kind of have a read on what the industry verticals were that drove that growth?\nCraig Nix: Mark, do you have any insights on that? I don't have that right in front of me here.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Yes. So for the SVB portion of the portfolio, the cash flow dependent growth would have been largely centered in sponsor finance and our project finance portfolios and where we've continued in sponsor to have some elevated criticized but on the new loan production. And generally speaking, these are loans that fund pretty close to inception. We're seeing really nice opportunities there, notwithstanding the broader backdrop. Hope that's helpful.\nBrody Preston : Okay. Great. That's helpful. And Craig, do you have what the unfunded commitment balances for the bank were at 12/31?\nCraig Nix: Not on hand. We'll take that offline.\nDeanna Hart: Yes. Brody, I can follow up with you. This is Deanna, on those numbers.\nBrody Preston : Okay. Great. And Deanna, just last one, I got you. That 198 loan accretion number, does that include any PAA that's related to the unfunded commitment book?\nDeanna Hart: Yes. It would be inclusive of both the on balance sheet and off balance sheet.\nOperator: I'm not showing any further questions at this time. So I'd like to turn the call back over to our host, Deanna Hart for any closing remarks.\nDeanna Hart: Thank you, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. We appreciate your ongoing interest in our company. And if you have any further questions or need additional information, please feel free to reach out to our Investor Relations team. We hope you have a great rest of your day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Craig Nix",
            "content": "Thank you, Frank, and thank you all of you for joining us today. I'm going to anchor my comments regarding our fourth quarter financial results to the takeaways outlined on Page 9. Pages 10 through 29 provide more detail supporting the results for your reference. Our return metrics remain solid and in line with our expectations. ROE and ROA adjusted for notable items from 13.53% and 1.28%, respectively. Compared to the third quarter, these metrics were impacted by an expected 3.9% sequential decline in net interest income driven by a reduction in accretion income and higher deposit costs. These impacts were partially offset by higher loan and investment portfolio yields, which benefited from maturity and replacement of lower-yielding assets during the quarter. These higher yields offset by higher deposit costs drove net interest income ex accretion to be essentially flat to the sequential quarter. NIM contracted by 21 basis points during the quarter to 3.86% driven primarily by the same factors affecting the decline in net interest income I just discussed. Ex accretion, NIM declined by 5 basis points to 3.46%. Adjusted noninterest income was down modestly by 3% sequentially and majority of the decrease related to a decline in the fair value of customer derivative positions as a result of lower interest rates. Additionally, as we previously guided, our rental business experienced a decline in net rental income due to higher maintenance expenses. As a reminder, given strong utilization rates and positive repricing trends, we made the strategic decision to pull forward regulatory requalification programs in order to increase the number of available cars for leasing in 2024. These updates position us well to continue to provide our customers with the equipment they need. While we expect some normalization to historically high utilization levels in 2024, we believe that our well-diversified fleet positions us well for the future. A bright spot in the quarter was an increase in capital market fees as our capital markets business had its highest figure on record as we were able to take advantage of market dislocation as many banks pull back. Adjusted noninterest expense was largely in line with expectations, increasing sequentially by less than 1%. We experienced expense growth during the quarter in consulting and project costs related to strategic investments we had delayed earlier in the year. As we noted on the third quarter call, consulting and project costs were lower in the second and third quarters as we assessed and reprioritized areas of focus heading into 2024. In addition, fourth quarter expenses reflected our expanded CRA commitment as part of our integration efforts to assist communities in Northern California and Eastern Massachusetts. These increases were almost completely offset by lower FDIC insurance and personnel expenses. We remain very cognizant of the importance of expense discipline as we head into 2024, given headwinds to net interest income facing us and many in the industry. Credit continues to normalize and traced with our expectations for the quarter with net charge-offs coming in at the lower end of our guidance range of 50 to 60 basis points. Net charge-offs were $177 million during the quarter, representing a ratio of 0.53% of average loans, basically flat compared to the third quarter. Losses were largely in the same portfolio where we experienced charge-offs in previous quarters. Within the commercial bank, net charge-offs were concentrated in the general office and small ticket equipment leasing portfolios. We also experienced an idiosyncratic loss in the energy portfolio this quarter that we believe is not indicative of broader terms in the portfolio. While we continue to see stress in our general office portfolio in the commercial bank due to continued inflationary pressure, elevated interest rates and market dislocation, we have limited exposure which totaled $1.2 billion or roughly 1% of loans at the end of the fourth quarter. As a reminder, this portfolio is concentrated in Class B repositioned bridge loans and is where we have seen deterioration in past dues, criticized assets and charge-offs. General office CRE continues to be carefully monitored, and we are carrying an ACL on these loans of 9.37% compared to 4.77% on the overall general office portfolio. Net charge-offs in the SVB segment remained elevated due to continued stress in the investor dependent portfolio, but did decline sequentially by $35 million. At quarter end, this portfolio totaled $4.3 billion or approximately 3% of total loans with the highest risk category, early-stage companies totaling $1.4 billion or just over 1% of total loans. The allowance for credit losses increased sequentially by 5 basis points to 1.31% due to some adverse credit migration in our commercial portfolio and higher specific reserves on loans individually reviewed. Under the current macroeconomic backdrop, we continually look for indicators of portfolio stress by reviewing delinquency trends and grading migration by industry and/or geography to identify areas of concern. While credit quality remains within our risk appetite, we anticipate elevated net charge-offs in the innovation, general office and equipment finance portfolios this year. We have taken proactive steps to help limit losses, and we feel that we are properly balancing our growth and underwriting strategy, emphasizing opportunities to build upon our expertise and provide an appropriate risk-adjusted return. Now moving to the balance sheet. Loans were up $100 million over the third quarter. The General and Commercial Bank segment grew loans by $1.3 billion and $716 million respectively, while the SVB segment experienced a decline of just under $2 billion. In the General Bank, growth was concentrated in small business and commercial loans in our branch network as we continue to grow our customer base and deepen relationships. We are focused on executing our strategy of growing our customer base and supporting existing clients where we have a relationship and a proven history. We believe this relationship banking approach will continue to serve us well. In the Commercial Bank, Growth was driven by strong production in our industry verticals and middle market banking. Within the industry verticals, growth was concentrated in TMT, health care and energy. Growth in our TMT vertical continues to be driven by strong demand for new data centers. Our energy vertical is benefiting from the power infrastructure and renewable energy markets. As for middle market, the team continued its expansion strategy in 2023, adding bankers in Boston, New York, Santa Monica, Atlanta and Dallas, contributing to increased loan production during the year. The reduction in SVB segment loans was driven primarily by a decline in global fund banking, but to a smaller extent we saw a reduction in our technology and health care banking business. Despite a slowdown in private equity and venture capital markets, we are encouraged by strengthening loan pipeline in Global Fund Banking, which expanded by approximately 40% [indiscernible] quarter as the team continues to support our existing clients as well as add new relationships. Global Fund Banking closed on $4.8 billion in new deals in the fourth quarter, a 129% increase over the third quarter. While utilization room is depressed due to the macroeconomic environment, we have the largest finance team in the market and total approved exposure on the loan book has stabilized and has started to ramp up as the team continues to execute. We remain the primary banking partner for the vast majority of our GFB clients, which positions us well to ramp up both loans and deposits quickly when the macroeconomic environment improves. The decline in technology and health care banking was driven by paydowns outpacing new fundings as the private market investment landscape continues to face headwinds resulting in a difficult exit environment, lower fundraising numbers and fewer deals. Deposits were down a modest 0.3% sequentially driven by a $1.5 billion decline in the SVB segment due to continued client cash burn and muted fundraising activity. Importantly though, investment inflows increased from the third quarter, while outflows from burn declined, which helped us beat our third quarter forecast of an approximate $5 billion decline. The branch network declined by $492 million due to expected seasonal outflows. These declines were partially offset by a $2 billion increase in direct bank deposits. While the direct bank channel is higher cost and now accounts for 26% of our deposit base, it is an additional lever we continue to use to remain resilient through a turbulent environment and is a strong source of insured consumer deposits supporting our liquidity base. It also enabled us to pay down higher-cost FHLB debt earlier in the year and most recently redeemed some of our smaller subordinated debt issuances given excess capital and liquidity positions. Moving to capital. We continue to maintain a position of strength as our CET1 ratio increased by 11 basis points sequentially and ended the quarter at 13.36%, which remains well above our internal target range of 9% to 10%. The impact from our loss share agreement continues to provide for higher capital levels and contributed approximately 120 basis points to our CET1 ratio this quarter, down from 140 basis points last quarter. Even without this benefit to our ratios, we remain well above our target capital ranges and anticipate operating at an elevated level in the near term. We are currently in our annual capital planning process which includes reassessment of our goals and targets for consideration of both SVB and future regulatory changes. This process includes a full stress test, including the acquired SVB portfolio. Additionally, we continue to monitor the proposed Basel III rules but remained well positioned for any changes, including the inclusion of AOCI marks. Our CET1 ratio at the end of the fourth quarter was estimated at 11.8% when these AOCI marks are included and the impact from the loss share agreement is removed. We have confidence in the rate that we are accreting capital and our absolute capital levels relative to our internal targets, our capacity to handle balance sheet growth, our SVB integration efforts and our positioning with respect to the Basel III end game. Therefore, we do anticipate that our 2024 capital plan will include a share repurchase plan, which once approved, will commence in the second half of this year. We also anticipate beginning a programmatic issuance of long-term debt in 2024 to ensure compliance with the proposed long-term debt requirements by the expected phase-in deadlines. We expect our binding and strain to be risk-weighted assets for long-term debt and estimate our long-term debt shortfall to be approximately $8 billion to $11 billion. While this strategy is partly dictated by regulatory requirements, we anticipate these funding actions along with our deposit growth strategies will support the replacement of some portion of the FDIC purchase money note, which matures in March of 2028. I will close today on Page 31 by discussing our first quarter and full year outlook for 2024. We anticipate that loans will remain flat to modestly increase in the first quarter, driven by low single-digit percentage Commercial Banking segment due to continued strong performance in our industry verticals. We anticipate SVB loan balances to remain flat in the mid-$50 billion range. As mentioned earlier, the Global Fund Banking business is benefiting from a strong pipeline due to being back in the market for clients during the second half of 2023 following the pause prior and immediately after the acquisition. This growth, however, will continue to be pressured by headwinds in the private equity and venture capital markets. We also anticipate a modest decline in the technology and health care banking business as lower levels of new fundings and line draws coupled with increased loan payoffs result in loan portfolio contraction. Looking at the full year, we expect loans to end in the $139 billion to $143 billion range or mid-single-digit percentage growth. We foresee increased volumes in our Global Fund Banking business as a result of increased outreach beginning in the second quarter of '23 and our increased pipeline. Additionally, we continue to see strong growth in our general and commercial bank segments. However, we do expect moderation to mid-single-digit percentage growth in these segments in 2023. Turning to deposits. We expect a low single-digit percentage point increase in the first quarter, primarily due to growth in the branch network driven by leveraging new products and initiatives to deepen client relationships that emphasize deposit growth as well as seasonal growth prior to April tax outflows. We are also focused on increasing our customer base by building deposits through proactive sales associate outreach, centralized marketing campaign and increased community connectivity. For the full year, we anticipate low to mid-single-digit percentage growth primarily related to growth in the general bank previously discussed and a mid-single-digit percentage growth in SVB deposits as market activity and the impacts of customer outreach begin to help produce deposit growth in the back half of 2024. With respect to SVB deposits, we expect the venture capital environment to remain challenging, particularly in the first half of 2024. Since April, we've seen SVB deposits remain largely stable despite continued cash burn exceeding funds sourced from fundraising activities. Encouragingly, we also added over 60 new primary operating business clients between April and November of 2023. We believe our emphasis on client engagement, coupled with better fundraising in the back half of 2024 will help propel modest growth in this segment. We'll continue to raise deposits in our direct bank. However, given the excess liquidity on our balance sheet, this pace will be moderated from the growth we experienced in 2023 with a growth rate of less than 10% anticipated in the channel. This obviously could change if we have unexpected deposit outflows elsewhere. Our interest rate forecast follows the implied forward curve, which includes 6 rate cuts in 2024, with the effective Fed funds rate declining from 5.5% to 4% by the end of the year. The implied curve currently diverges from the Fed dot plot expectations, which includes 3 rate cuts with effective Fed funds rate declining to 4.75%. It is our belief that we will see closer to 3 or 4 rate cuts given the continued strength in the labor market and the fact that inflation remains stubbornly above the Fed's target rate. Therefore, for our net interest income guidance, we provide a range with the top end assuming 3 rate cuts and the low end assuming 6 rate cuts. For the first quarter, we expect net interest income to be down in mid-single-digit percentage points range with and without accretion. The decline in headline net interest income will be driven by the impact of lower accretion and higher deposit costs, only partially offset by higher investment yields. For the full year, we expect net interest income in the range of $6.9 billion to $7.1 billion, with the low end assuming fixed rate cuts and the high end, assuming 3 rate cuts. In either case, we project accretion income close to $485 million for the year, which is a decline from $725 million in the last 3 quarters of '23 as loan discounts on some of the shorter portfolios have been fully recognized. Isolated net interest income for the second through fourth quarter period to take into effect the timing of the SVB merger with 6 rate cuts, we expect headline net interest income to be low double digits percentage points and ex accretion by high single-digit percentage point. With 3 rate cuts, we expect headline to be down high single-digit percentage points and ex accretion down low to mid-single-digit percentage points. We anticipate our full cycle data to be approximately 44%, which is materially in line with our previous estimate of 43%. Moving on to adjusted noninterest income. We expect the first quarter to be relatively in line with the fourth quarter in the $440 million to $460 million range. Looking at the full year and isolating for only the second through fourth quarters, we anticipate being flat as continued growth in net operating lease rental, wealth management and mortgage income are offset by a decline in client investment fees due to anticipated lower -- the anticipated lower interest rate environment. We expect full year noninterest income to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. As Frank mentioned in his comments, we are excited for the continued build-out of and momentum in our wealth platform and will look to fully convert the legacy silicon private businesses in 2024. Moving to expenses. We expect a modest increase from the fourth quarter due to seasonal increases in personnel expense from higher benefits and incentives and software costs due to continued build out of product capabilities that will help us be a premier partner in the innovation economy in areas such as cash management, FX and payments as well as continued investment in our wealth capabilities that will help us sell deeper into our new national reach. Furthermore, we will continue the modernization of our platforms in consumer, equipment finance and factoring to ensure we are well equipped to scale in the future. We also have a few regulatory projects we will be completing this year related to ISO payments and Dodd-Frank. In addition, as Frank alluded to earlier, we were focused on building out our capabilities in the large bank and regulatory spaces which will require some focused builds. As of this -- all of this will be partially offset by continued acquisition synergies. Looking at the full year and isolating for the second through fourth quarters, we anticipate noninterest expense to be flat to up low single digits percentage points which equates to an adjusted noninterest expense target for the year of between $4.6 billion and $4.7 billion. While we expect to achieve the lower 25% band of our cost saves goal by the end of 2024, these savings will be offset by continued capability build out for large bank expectations as well as costs related to the strategic priorities I just mentioned. Our adjusted efficiency ratio is expected to be in the low 50% range in 2024, up slightly from 49% for full year 2023. On credit, we anticipate net charge-offs to remain in the 50 to 60 basis points range in the first quarter, given continued pressure in the general office real estate, small ticket equipment leasing and innovation portfolios. For the year, we expect net charge-offs in the 45 to 55 basis points range as we expect some of the pressure in the investor dependent portfolio to soften in the back half of the year as well as some of the changes we made in underwriting small ticket leases in 2022 began to favorably impact the net charge-off ratio. For both the first quarter and full year of 2024, we expect our tax rate to be in the 27% to 28% range, which is exclusive of any discrete items. In closing, we have accomplished a lot in 2023, including the transformational acquisition of SVB, which brought significant scale to our business and new product offerings through our geographically diverse client base. While economic and geopolitical uncertainties remain, we believe the strength of our diversified businesses, our strong capital and liquidity positions and our hard-working and dedicated associates will help us continue to take care of our customers and clients and deliver meaningful returns to our shareholders. As we've proven during previous economic downturns, our business model is resilient and recession-ready in large part due to our disciplined through-the-cycle credit underwriting standards and robust risk management infrastructure. In 2024, we remain focused on allocating capital where we can drive deeper relationship business with the goal of continuing to deliver top-tier financial returns. I will now turn it over to the operator for instructions for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Well, first of all, right now, cash is around 17% of earning assets. And ideally, over time, we'd like to see that migrate to 10% to 12% replaced with either loans or investments. So -- but at this point in time, where we are in the cycle, we believe we have time to get that down, especially given the purchase money note. I'll let Tom talk a little bit about the rate sensitivity and the cash balance and what we may be looking for doing to position ourselves going forward. Yes, I think that's true, although I think the percentage might drop some, but not into that 10% to 12% ban at the end of 2024. Mark, do you want to take that? Yes, I'm going to let Tom amplify what I'm going to say here. But right now, where rates are, there's a positive arbitrage in there. And while it's dilutive to NIM, it's accretive to net interest income. Obviously, as we move into more rate cuts, it becomes less attractive to leave that purchase money note out there. And with the excess liquidity we have, we would have some optionality of pulling that down. Tom, would you like to amplify that? We're also projecting mid-single-digit growth in the general bank as well. So it's just pretty spread across the loan portfolios. Brian, this is Craig. I'll take those individually and in aggregate because I think it's important to really size that portfolio relative to the overall loan portfolio. If you take those 3 components, commercial, general office, equipment finance and the investor-dependent loans, whether the growth stages or early stage. Those totaled about $11.3 billion which is 8% of the loan portfolio. If you look at -- and now -- and so all those portfolios, we have total loss absorbing capacity of around 6.06% on net charge-offs for the year of around [$3.6 billion]. So if you aggregate those portfolios, our coverage is 1.9x, if we slice it down to the individual portfolios, commercial, general office, we have a coverage ratio of 1.1 and allow us 7.99% on charge-off price of $7.48. On the equipment finance, the allowance is 3.52% and charge-offs 1.87% to around 1.9% coverage. And then on investor dependent, we have an allowance of 5.21 and a purchase discount of 3.58 which totals the total loss of building capacity of 8.79. So the allowance covers the charge-offs of 4.66, but when including that purchase discount, which is available to absorb losses takes it to 1.9x. So we feel really good about both our projections there and about our coverage in terms of charge-offs both that we've incurred and that we expect to occur moving forward. Yes. We look at it sort of -- I mean, if we do an asset test as of 12/31/23, with Basel III, it's around 12%. If we do an asset test with Basel III at [ex loss] share, it's around 11%. So that range of 11% to 12% sort of asset debt, that's at 12/31/23 leaves us well above our target ranges. And then obviously, as time goes on, we're accreting earnings at about 36 basis points a quarter and risk-weighted assets, we're taking at 27. So we look -- it's going to continue -- our capital position is going to continue to build. So we do think that share repurchases are going to -- we feel confident about share repurchases, not only rate accreting capital, but just the absolute levels of capital, our capacity to handle our balance sheet growth, SVB integration efforts and our positioning with respect to Basel III, all give us confidence in a very purposed plan. And you're right, I really can't speak to the size of that until we get through our internal stress testing, which is being conducted now as part of our capital plan. We do expect the timing subject to necessary internal and regulatory approvals to be in the second half of this year. So I hope that's helpful, but we are looking at definitely target that our capital ratios are well above our target ranges, looking at it in a myriad of different ways. Well, we look at it just like we would any other acquisitions. So there are a myriad of payback periods and tangible dilution payback periods that we look at. I'm not going to get into our modeling on it. But we certainly scrutinize repurchases just like we would scrutinize purchasing another bank in the open market. Tom, do you have anything else? Tom is responsible for some of the modeling we do there. But I think that's generally -- I don't think I left anything out there. It's in there, but the issuance this year would be muted, so it won't have a significant impact on this year's NIM. But going forward, it will based on where our costs are today and what the costs are anticipated on that will probably be a headwind moving forward. Mark, do you have any insights on that? I don't have that right in front of me here. Not on hand. We'll take that offline."

I think on the SVB growth, we're expected to be up slightly from about mid-50s range this year, and a lot of that in the Global Fund Banking. Craig mentioned that our pipeline was up $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter from where it was, just really as a result of kind of being back in the market more fully in the second quarter. I think we're still seeing headwinds as Mark mentioned, second health care, just given the overall kind of environment. Longer term, I think we're bullish on the SVB growth, market activity returns, just with a similar of a client in the outreach to new clients. I think with that, certainly, with the loan growth, we'd expect more deposit growth to come as well as that returns, and that's a -- keep a rate on what we have certainly again our savings product and direct banks. The more that we can grow the SVB, we do think that will be setting better for the overall bank in earnings."

            "content": "Thank you, Deanna, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to focus my comments today on our fourth quarter accomplishments and our 2024 strategic priorities before turning it over to Craig to cover our fourth quarter financial results and outlook for 2024. Let's start on Page 5. The fourth quarter capped off another exciting and successful year at First Citizens. We kicked off the year, 1 year into our successful merger with CIT and rang out the year combined with SVB, all as we celebrated our 125th year anniversary. I'm really proud of what we accomplished in 2023 and believe we have tremendous opportunity ahead of us. There is an undeniable sense of momentum at First Citizens and our ambition is to serve our clients in ways never imagined 125 years ago. And we're well positioned for the future, thanks to continued focus on our clients and customers and our solid financial results. We delivered another quarter of solid financial results, driven by a strong net interest margin and adjusted efficiency ratio of 48%. We're pleased that both our general and commercial bank segments grew loans by double-digit percentage points in 2023. Due to strong deposit growth during the year, we improved our liquidity position significantly and ended the year with a strong capital position marked by a CET1 ratio of 13.36%. We recently announced 2 major additions to our team, which will help us to continue to successfully navigate the ever-changing landscape for large financial institutions. First, David Leitch was appointed to the Board of Directors in January. David is a distinguished leader, executive and attorney and he brings extensive experience and valuable insight to our Board. He retired from Bank of America in 2022, where he served as Vice Chair from 2021, 2022, and its Global General Counsel from 2016 to 2021, and we're excited to have David join the Board. Second, we announced that Greg Smith will join our executive leadership team as the bank's Chief Information and Operations Officer. Greg joins our team from TD Bank Financial Group in Toronto, Canada, where he served as Head of Transformation and Corporate Operations. In this leadership role, he set the vision and built key capabilities to drive end-to-end transformational change. He was also responsible for managing corporate projects and technology platforms. In the CIOO role at First Citizens, he will be responsible for the strategic enablement of technology, operations, cyber and data functions across the enterprise. Greg's extensive background and depth of experience will make him well suited to take on these important responsibilities, and we're excited to have him on board. Moving to Page 6. We remain intently focused on our core strategies, and I'll highlight a few of them for 2024. First, we remain focused on our clients and customers. Our combinations with CIT and SVB introduced us to new strategic markets that allow us to deliver expanded products and solutions across our diversified lines of business. We continue to support SVB's innovation economy clients and are focused on capturing synergies with the commercial businesses we acquired from CIT. In the general bank, we have enhanced our deposit campaigns to continue to grow quality core deposits. As we noted last quarter, we continue to expand our wealth business across our geographic footprint and our expanding advisory and self-service options for our clients in that space. Developing our associates and adding talent to support growth remain important priorities. Our integration efforts are centered on ensuring that we retain our culture which emphasizes a relationship-based approach to banking, a client-centric customer -- client and customer-centric service delivery model, a long-term focus and strong risk management. Operational efficiency is very important to us. In addition to disciplined expense management, we are managing our balance sheet to optimize our liquidity and capital positions to support continued profitable growth. Core deposit growth will be a major priority as we continue to increase deposits as a percentage of our total funding mix. We also continue to make regulatory readiness, a top strategic priority. We have made meaningful progress on our efforts thus far, but acknowledge we need to continue to refine and mature our processes to support the change in the company's size and complexity. We will be intently focused on these efforts in 2024. Now let's look at Page 7. We continue to make good progress on SVB's integration. Our efforts there have been extremely important, helping us retain clients, stabilize deposit balances and develop strategic priorities for the combined organization. As we discussed on the last call, we developed an integration road map, and we expect the majority of those efforts to be completed in 2024. Our goal remains to support the acquired lines of business, maintain their unique capabilities, all while improving efficiency and risk management, positioning us for future growth. We acknowledge the headwinds in the innovation economy as well as the increased competition in the space. However, we remain encouraged by the strength and value the SVB franchise brings to its client base and its unwavering commitment to providing a relationship-focused service that is unmatched in the innovation ecosystem. To conclude, I am very pleased with our performance in 2023 and excited about growth opportunities as we enter 2024. Despite industry adversity in 2023, we were able to protect and grow customer relationships, stabilize deposits at SVB, grow core deposits and loans in our general and commercial bank segments and build upon our strong capital and liquidity positions. I'd like to thank all of our associates for making 2023 a successful and positioning the bank for a successful future. With that, I'll turn it over to Craig Nix. Craig?"

Despite a volatile external market, we've delivered another solid quarter of financial results marked by strong revenue growth and disciplined expense management. Our focus continues to be on growing our core lines of business, maintaining our safety and stability through strong capital, credit and liquidity risk management and delivering long term tangible book value growth to our shareholders. This morning, we reported earnings per share of $55.92 excluding items noted in the presentation on Page 52. This exceeded our expectations and represented a 6% increase over the sequential quarter. Return metrics were also strong improving over the sequential quarter despite an increase in credit reserves and capital levels. These return metrics were supported by net interest margin that remained over 4% and an adjusted efficiency ratio of 46%. Deposits continued to be a huge focus for us during the quarter with period end deposits up 14% on an annualized basis or 3% sequentially. In addition to deposit growth, our commercial and general bank segments posted solid loan growth. Our liquidity and capital positions remain strong and stable, driven by our focus on core deposit gathering and a conservatively managed investment portfolio. We also remain focused on managing credit risk prudently. We did experience an increase in net charge offs this quarter with the majority of the charge offs related to investor dependent loans in the SVB portfolio. While we continue to monitor this portfolio closely, given some of the macroeconomic headwinds facing the innovation economy, we remain encouraged by the resiliency of our clients in the face of elevated inflation and rising interest rates. On Page 6, we continue to make great progress in integrating SVB and our initial stabilization efforts are complete. As a result of our continued focus on an outreach to our clients, we continue to see stabilization in loan and deposit balances during the quarter. We have materially completed our strategic assessment work. Currently, we are leveraging the insights from this work to identify opportunities to grow our market position in an innovation economy. Finally, we remain focused on regulatory readiness through our large bank program and a dedicated team of leaders and associates are ensuring we have a framework to meet heightened regulatory expectations and ensure sound business practices for large financial institutions. On Page 7, our strategic priorities have not changed and are included here for your reference. On Page 8, we provided tangible examples of supporting our clients in the innovation economy. We remain excited by the green shoots we're seeing as new and returning business comes to SVB six months post-acquisition. For example, during the third quarter, global fund banking originations increased by 18% compared to the sequential quarter and its pipeline has grown over 70%. We are committed to building on and investing in the SVB business to preserve long term client relationships and to generate new business with founders, entrepreneurs, innovation leaders and venture capital and private equity clients. During the quarter, our commitment was exemplified when we launched a nationwide Yes, SVB campaign to increase awareness that SVB is open for business and that we remain dedicated to supporting the innovation economy. We are also investing in new capabilities, including the rollout, the continued rollout of [SVB Go], an online digital banking platform to support our clients' needs by facilitating easier interactions, simple, secure and intuitive. The platform is designed for how our founders and innovation leaders run their businesses rather than how banks operate. Looking forward, we acknowledge the headwinds facing the innovation economy. The muted fundraising and investment pace coupled with limited exit opportunities continues to put pressure on innovation companies across all sectors and stages of development. This is resulting in some bulky charge offs, which Craig will speak to in more detail during his comments. Historically, 12 to 18 months into a down cycle VC investment reaches a floor after which valuations normalize and VC firms come back into the market. While US VC firms investment levels may continue to fall in the near term, we believe the long term outlook remains positive, primarily related to tailwinds that remain intact despite the most recent dislocation. The innovation economy is stronger than in past cycles as it grew two at 2.4 times the rate of the overall US economy between 2000 and 2021, and the COVID-19 pandemic has only accelerated digital adoption. Further, the innovation economy was 3.5 times larger in 2020 than in 2000. While we do not believe we are likely to see 2021 levels of valuation and investment for some time, if ever, we know that there is substantial dry powder waiting to be invested, which gives us confidence in the long term prospects of the innovation economy. Now turning to Page 9. We have exciting news in our wealth division. Since 2013 we've focused on our wealth management capabilities and have made significant progress growing organically. As a result, our private banking, brokerage and trust services have become a significant revenue source for us and we've recently expanded our reach beyond our legacy markets in the Carolinas, to California and the northeast. The SVB acquisition provided complementary expansion in terms of geographic distribution and accelerated entrance into attractive market we were already targeting. The opportunities extend beyond our footprint, however, we are focused on maintaining the great client relationship fostered by SVB private and deepening those relationships with our registered branch associates and digital platforms serving institutional, mass affluent and high net worth clients. Moving forward, we believe these complementary capabilities will accelerate the growth of our wealth franchise. We remain focused on executing against our core strategic priorities, which are the building blocks for long term sustainable value generation and are at the core of everything we do. I would like to thank all of our associates for their strong commitment to serving our customers, clients and communities. Thanks to you, I am confident we are well positioned to continue delivering strong results and long term value to our shareholders and stakeholders. In conclusion, I would like to address the recent tragic and horrible attacks inflicted on the innocent people in Israel. We are saddened by these events and wish for peace in the region and for the future security of everyone and especially our clients, associates and their families. I will now turn it over to Craig to provide an update on our third quarter financial results. Craig?\nCraig Nix: Thank you, Frank, and thank all of you for joining us today. I am going to anchor my comments on our third quarter financial results to the takeaways outlined on Page 11. For your reference, Pages 12 through 32 provide more detail supporting those results. As Frank just said, our return metrics were once again strong in the third quarter. ROE and ROA adjusted for notable items were 16.77% and 1.55%, respectively, both exceeding our expectations. Our return metrics were supported by 1.5% sequential increase in net interest income and a 5.9% sequential decline in expenses. Net interest income performance was the result of increased accretion income as well as the impact of higher rates increasing our loan and investment at yield. The cost of deposits increased by 44 basis points over the prior quarter to 2.12%, representing a cycle-to-date data of 37%. Despite the rise in deposit costs, our quarterly NIM showed continued strength coming in at 407, down three basis points from the linked quarter but up 65 basis points from the same quarter a year ago. The modest decline in NIM during the quarter was driven by higher deposit balances as well as a higher rate paid on deposits and lower average loans, partially offset by higher yield on earning assets and the elimination of FHLB borrowings. With the sell off in the longer to intermediate part of the yield curve, we allocated $5 billion of our excess cash in the short duration US treasury and agency mortgage backed securities during the quarter to mitigate some of our sensitivity to falling rates. Given our excess cash position, we expect that to continue in the fourth quarter. We do not expect these purchases to have a material impact on baseline earnings as the investment rates are in line with interest we earn on cash reserves. Adjusted non-interest income increased modestly by 1% sequentially. Of note during the quarter was our real business, which turned in another strong quarter with utilization rates above 98% and positive repricing trends. We have a well diversified fleet with high capacity and efficiency, positioning our portfolio well for any future downturn in the economy. We're also focused on growing and expanding our fee based business in areas such as payments and wealth management as Frank alluded to just a moment ago. We have been working recently to expand SVB\u2019s real time payment network, which will allow our clients to send and receive payments instantly. We are also working to offer instant settlement for merchants using payment facilitators and instant loan funding and disbursements, including early wage access. We are excited about the opportunity to accelerate SVB\u2019s capability and billing payment functions and are happy to be in a position to invest in opportunities such as these. Adjusted non-interest expense declined by $71 million or by 5.9% sequentially over 85% of the reduction related to synergies arising from the SVB acquisition. We also saw declines in our marketing costs, which as you may recall from previous calls, had been primarily associated with growing deposits in the direct bank. We grew deposits in this channel by $6.4 billion during the quarter, while spending less in advertising with efficiency led by new clients from previous periods continuing to increase balances. Strong expense management and discipline will remain a significant focus for us moving forward. Putting all of this together, we achieved an adjusted efficiency ratio of 46%, which was an improvement of approximately 4% over the prior quarter. Our third quarter adjusted PPNR grew by 8.6% over the linked quarter, driven by the diversification and growth of our net revenue streams as well as disciplined expense management. Now moving to the balance sheet. Loans were up by $187 million over the second quarter. The general and commercial banking segments grew by approximately $1 billion each while the SVB segment experienced a decline of just under $2 billion. In the General Bank growth was concentrated in small business and commercial loans and our branch network. We were excited to continue to build long term customer relationships in the General Bank and are pleased to see our investments in digital, call center, and branch technology over the past several years payoff. Further, our product breadth has benefited from the CIT and SVB transactions providing us with better ability to fulfill products based on the preferences of our clients and customers. In the commercial bank segment, growth was driven by strong production in our industry verticals, including energy, healthcare and TMT, as well as seasonal increases in factoring as clients build out inventory ahead of the holiday season. While origination volumes remain strong in our industry verticals, they were down from the sequential quarter but the balance sheet benefited from a decline in prepayments. The decline in SVB segment lines was due to three major factors. First, approximately half of the decline was the result of the expected wind down of our foreign exposure. Recall that we did not purchase any foreign entities as part of the acquisition, so we have been in the process of exiting these markets. Second, lower new loan fundings as the private market investment landscape continues to face headwinds, resulting in a difficult exit environment, lower fundraising numbers and fewer deals. And third, expected repayments. While foreign exposure had a significant impact on our third quarter loan balances, we do not anticipate it being a meaningful issue going forward as the majority of the exposure has been unwound at this point. We are also encouraged by trends in the technology and healthcare banking business. This business saw client attrition early on as a result of the March crisis. However, we have been pleased to see both new and returning business come back to this group, resulting from the initiatives we have undertaken since the acquisition. Deposits increased by 5.1 billion over the linked quarter, driven by $6.4 billion of growth in our direct bank. The direct bank now accounts for 35 billion, 24% of our deposit base. While this channel is higher cost compared to the traditional branch network, 92% of the deposits are insured and the increase in imbalances allowed us to reduce our wholesale funding reliance as we were able to pay off more expensive FHLB debt in the third quarter. We are pleased that the deposit growth we have experienced allowed us to work our loan to deposit ratio down to 91% from almost 99% at the time of the acquisition.  Moving to credit quality. Our metrics remained within our risk appetite but we continued to see deterioration and a few portfolios that we are diligently monitoring to quickly identify and address problems that may arise. The non-accrual loan ratio decreased by 2 basis points to 0.68% with total non-accrual loans decreasing moderately to $899 million. The decrease was driven by net charge offs outpacing loans migrating into nonaccrual status during the quarter. The net charge off ratio increased by 6 basis points during the quarter to 53 basis points. Of the 176 million in net charge offs during the quarter, 100 million was in the SVB segment, of which 56 million was previously reserved. For the SVB segment net charge offs were concentrated in investor dependent loans with charge offs totaling 88 million in the third quarter compared to 49 million last quarter. At quarter end, this portfolio totaled $5.7 billion or 10% of SVB segment loans with 1.7 billion in early stage companies, the highest risk category, representing 3% of SVBs segment loans. We are carrying an ACL on the investor dependent portfolio of $250 million or 4.42% of total loans and a purchase accounting discount of 288 million or 5.09%, equating to 538 million or 9.51% loss absorbing capacity on these loans. Within the commercial bank segment, net charge offs were concentrated in the general office and small ticket equipment leasing portfolios. As we have been signaling for a number of quarters, we continue to see stress in our general office portfolio in the commercial bank, which totaled $1.1 billion at the end of the third quarter. This portfolio is concentrated in Class B repositioned bridge loans and is where we have seen deterioration in the past dues, criticized assets and charge-offs. We are carrying an ACL on these loans of 7.12% compared to 4% on the overall general office portfolio. We have completed target reviews across our business segments to assess credits and are remaining vigilant on our entire portfolio to identify areas of risk early on. We have historically performed well in challenging economic cycles due to our thoughtful approach to managing risk, measured underwriting practices, customer selection and long term relationship development. We believe our disciplined credit and risk management approach will continue to support us as we navigate the most recent economic cycle. Our ACL increased three basis point to 1.26%, driven by modest deterioration in the macroeconomic forecast and in the large balanced commercial real estate portfolio, which includes general office. These increases were partially offset by lower specific reserves and lower loan balances in the SVB segment. The ACL provided 2 points down coverage of annualized quarterly net charge-offs and covered non-accrual loans 1.9 times. Moving to capital. Our CET1 ratio decreased by 15 basis points sequentially ending the quarter at 13.23%, well above our internal target range of 9% to 10%. Strong earnings generation added 50 basis points of capital during the quarter, offset by a decline in the loss share benefit of 63 basis point. We continue to operate at capital levels well above our target ranges on all of our risk based capital ratios. Before closing with our fourth quarter outlook, I want to comment on pending regulation specifically around capital and long term debt. We continue to assess the proposed regulations and the potential impacts on our operations. As I mentioned on the last call, we have established a team whose mandate is to develop plans to ensure operational readiness for these regulations. Although we don't have the precise impacts to our capital ratios at this time, we do know capital requirements will increase. On the long term debt front, we expect we will need to raise between $8 billion and $11 billion to satisfy these requirements. While we have not traditionally leveraged the debt capital markets to raise funding, we believe our strong and stable capital and liquidity positions will allow us to be flexible as we enter the market in 2024. As we mentioned last quarter, we will continue to pause share repurchases and we will consider reinstating them when we submit our capital plan in 2024 and better understand the full impacts of these proposed regulations. I will close on Page 34 by discussing our fourth quarter outlook. We anticipate further declines in the Global Fund Banking business from lower levels of venture capital investments, lower capital deployment and the final stages of intentional rundown of select portfolios that were located internationally at the time of the merger. We also anticipate a modest decline in our tech and life sciences business as marketing activity continues to be depressed. As a result, we expect SVB loan balances to be in the mid $50 billion range by year end down from $57 billion at the end of the third quarter. We expect that SVB declines will largely be offset by mid single digit percentage growth in the General Bank segment driven by continued momentum in our branch network, as well as growth in our equipment finance line of business. Despite clients feeling pressure from the elevated rate environment, we still have great momentum in our branch network where we continue to emphasize full banking relationships. We have invested significantly in our equipment finance sales platform and those efforts are continuing to pay off with increased efficiency and balance sheet growth. We do expect slight loan declines this quarter in our industry verticals mainly related to timing and some of the larger loans in our pipeline pull through in the third quarter, and we expect some payoff to be pushed through to the fourth quarter. On deposits, we expect a low to mid single digit percentage point decline and the fourth quarter primarily related to a decline in SVB deposits. We had sizable deposit growth in the second and third quarters and we're able to retire more costly short term FHLB borrowings, which coupled with low expected loan growth reduces our need to raise deposit balances at the same rates we did during the last quarters. While we're encouraged by the stabilization of SVB deposits since April, we anticipate that SVB clients will continue to experience a level of cash burn that exceeds funds sourced from fundraising. It's worth noting that we expect broader market DC funding to remain subdued in the range of 30 billion to 35 billion for the fourth quarter of 2023, which is significantly down from prior years and in line with the muted activity we've seen throughout the first three quarters of 2023. Consequently, we're projecting an approximate $5 billion decline in SVB deposits in the fourth quarter. This estimate could be conservative as the SVB team is laser focused on obtaining and winning back balances, which could partially offset some natural runoff. Our interest rate forecast follows the implied forward curve. We forecast one more quarter point rate hike in the fourth quarter with the Fed funds rate ending the year at 5.75%. While we expect the absolute level of margin and net interest income to remain elevated, we do expect them to begin to decline in the coming quarters. We expect this to occur as the accretion from some of the shorter portfolios we acquired, such as global fund banking, fully accrete and we experience continued pressure on deposit pricing. The impact of lower accretion and higher deposit costs will be partially offset by higher loan and investment yields. We anticipate our full cycle beta increasing to approximately 43%, up from our previous estimate of 39%, primarily due to the higher absolute betas at this point in the rate cycle, as well as the strong growth we've experienced in the direct bank. On adjusted non-interest income, after a strong third quarter, we see a slight retreat to the $430 million to $450 million range, primarily due to the lagged impact of lower SVB off balance sheet funds and less overall innovation economy market activity leading to lower client investment fees, international fees and other service charges, as well as slightly lower net rental total income on operating leases due to higher expected maintenance expense in the fourth quarter. We expect continued growth in our wealth and emergency income lines of business. On adjusted non-interest expense, we expect to be flat to slightly down compared to the third quarter. Continued acquisition synergies will be partially offset by slightly higher expected consulting and project costs related to strategic priorities, as well as our continued investment in large bank programs and initiatives. Some of these professional consulting and project costs were lower in the second and third quarters as we assessed and reprioritized areas of focus heading into 2024. We anticipate by year end that we will be more than halfway to our 25% to 30% synergies goal on SVB's $2.6 billion pre-merger expense base. We anticipate materially all synergies to be reflected in the run rate by the end of 2024. It's worth noting, we do expect a 1 time $30 million FDIC assessment to be recognized in the fourth quarter, but will be paid out over eight quarters, which is not included in the adjusted total. The timing of this will be dependent upon when the rule is finalized, meaning it could potentially move into 2024. We expect annualized net charge offs in the range of 50 to 60 basis points in the fourth quarter, at or above the level we saw in the third quarter. This would bring the full year net charge off ratio to the mid 40 basis points range. This is an upward revision to our previous estimate and is primarily the result of higher than expected charge offs in our investor dependent general office CRE in the commercial bank and small ticket equipment leasing portfolios. In closing, we are aware that we're in a time of change and dislocation in the banking industry. We believe we are well positioned to successfully navigate macroeconomic headwinds as well as the changing regulatory landscape just as we have done so many times before. These changes present us with opportunities and we are committed to serving our clients through all market conditions while continuing to deliver long term value to our shareholders. Our solid capital and liquidity levels not only position us well for changes resulting from the proposed changes and regulatory requirements but also provide us flexibility to be proactive instead of reactive during this uncertain backdrop. We are confident in the long term outlook for our business. Our business flows are good and our risk management practices are strong. We are focused on maintaining expense discipline while continuing to invest in the future. We have an established track record of successful integration efforts, which we look forward to continuing with SVB. I will now turn it over to the operator for instructions for the question-and-answer portion of the call.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today goes to Stephen Scouten of Piper Sandler.\nStephen Scouten: Craig, you gave some really good color, and Frank, you gave some good anecdotal thoughts around the SVB stabilization, but I am wondering how you guys think about that into 2024. Do you think we can start to see outright stability there as opposed to just the decline in the runoff, and how do you think about that book of business as we look into next year?\nCraig Nix: Mark, would you weigh in on that, please?\nUnidentified Company Representative: Certainly. This is a this is Mark [indiscernible]. And noting that we have not provided any preliminary guidance for 2024 in this call, they are I think reflective of the stabilization that you see. The hope, right, that that turns the corner in '24, at the same time, we need to recognize that we are still going through evaluation reset that Frank alluded to, and we expect that, that could continue into 2024 and continue to be a headwind. And so again, that's probably, in part, why we are not providing preliminary guidance yet beyond the fourth quarter. And so I will stop there and I hope that was responsive.\nStephen Scouten: And then you guys noted the elevated charge-off some of the small ticket leasing office, and appreciate all the detail around the reserves related to the SVB portfolio. But as you look forward, do you see things worsening at all or is it more -- I know you noted macroeconomic trends changing when you are CECL modeling. How is how's that going to potentially drive reserves moving forward into CECL today?\nCraig Nix: I think right now, we consider ourselves to be adequately reserved and actually our reserves are very strong on all three of those areas when you look at general office and particularly in the commercial bank, you look at the equipment finance and then you look at the innovation loans, the investor dependent loans, we feel like our reserves are strong there. We are close to 2 times covered if you look at those in the aggregate. So we we believe our reserves are strong. But we do think for a couple of quarters out that charge-offs will remain a little bit elevated in those areas. Andy, I don't know if you have anything you would like to add to any of that or Randy.\nAndy Giangrave: No, I think that's right. Certainly, we will continue to work through the office portfolio and that's going to take some time throughout 2024. And we would hope to see some improvement in the equipment finance portfolio. But to Craig's point, we will continue to see elevated charge-offs into 2024.\nCraig Nix: And that's why you see us raising our net charge-off guidance to 50 to 60 from 35 to 45.\nOperator: And the next question goes to Brady Gailey of KBW.\nBrady Gailey: I wanted to start with the possible share buyback in 2024. I know you mentioned you need to wait and submit your 2024 capital plan. Just remind us of the timing of that? I think in prior years that's been around July.\nFrank Holding: Yes, if we -- we certainly will consider a share repurchase plan as part of our capital plan in 2024 and if that should be included and approved, it would commence in the second half of 2024 consistent with prior plans.\nBrady Gailey: And then on the NII guidance, it's down around 7% linked quarters, so that would suggest there's some NIM decline as well in the fourth quarter. Is that more a function of accretable yield declining, which I think you hinted at a couple minutes ago, or is that more a function of the core net interest margin declining, or is it a little bit of both\u2026\nFrank Holding: Yes, if you isolate it, ex accretion in the fourth quarter, we expect NIM to decline by 1 basis point. So we have some stabilization there. With accretion we're expecting it to decline by 19 basis points. So it is an accretion issue, both on net interest income in dollars and on the margin.\nBrady Gailey: And then, I appreciate the 4Q expense guidance. Feels like you're going to get more cost saves out of [SVB] as we look into 2024. So how do you think about expenses next year? I mean, you'll have some cost saves, so you'll also have some legacy expense creep. Like could you potentially keep expenses flattish next year?\nFrank Holding: Right now, we're not providing 2024 guidance, but just directly, I think, flattish to low single digits percentage increase going into \u201824.\nOperator: And the next question goes to Steven Alexopoulos of JP Morgan.\nSteven Alexopoulos: To start on the SVB side and regarding the new campaign, the [SSVB]. So what's the feedback so far from customers, and could you address that maybe from the VC side, what you're hearing from VC firms then what you're hearing from the startups? And is this yet translating into you guys seeing net new operating account growth at the account level, not the balance level?\nFrank Holding: Mark, I'm going to let you handle that one. I know we have picked up some new clients.\nUnidentified Company Representative: We have indeed. Steve, good morning, it's Mark. And we had, in the quarter, I believe the stat was 600 plus new clients, which means starting with one solution or another and then I believe we're almost up to 50 new in the last couple quarters that what I would call broad based new wins, including their operating accounts operating business. So I think going back to your original point, the ad campaign but as much or more so, the very laser focused calling effort, reactivation effort, calling on new clients, et cetera, we think is ultimately turning around that perception that there's a void and very much reinforcing that SVB is here and open for business. And again, I think, part of your question was about feedback. And overall, the feedback including the ad campaign has been really very positive on the whole. And so I'll stop there.\nSteven Alexopoulos: Mark, I saw the news of Jennifer Goldstein rejoining the company. Congrats on that. She's a superstar in LifeSciences and healthcare space. But is that a one offer you guys starting to see former SVB employees re-engaging to come back to the company?\nFrank Holding: So I'll start on that, others may wish to comment. Jennifer was certainly a very high profile rehire, recognizing she was coming back from the SVB capital entity. And having said that, not the only former SVB-er to rejoin with the key point there being that, I believe the others that we've had in the new hire mix were SVB-ers legacy SVB-ers that had departed several years ago as opposed to since the events of March. And so that too is encouraging to see some of our former colleagues look at what we have going on here so far in our first two quarters of togetherness and vote where their feet to come join us, again, Jennifer being the most high profile of those, which we are so excited to see her return.\nSteven Alexopoulos: And Craig, maybe just one follow-up in your response to the question on expenses, maybe flat to low single digit increase for 2024. So how should we think about the efficiency ratio wherever you guys end up in the fourth quarter. Do you see that improving fairly materially in 2024?\nCraig Nix: Well, what's going to happen is the accretion is going to offset some of the decrease or stabilization in expense. So what I would say in the fourth quarter you might see it matriculate up to the high 40s, low 50s, and then next year, I think, you'd see it in that same range per quarter. So I would think high 40s, low 50s for the next five quarters, and that's really a function of just declining accretion income outpacing the expenses. We're really satisfied with efficiency ratio in the low 50 to high 40.\nOperator: And the next question goes to Christopher Marinac of I2BBA.\nChristopher Marinac: I wanted to ask a question about being able to raise your loan yields related to deposit balances, and if they were to sort of go below certain levels. Are you able to do that or is there still more push on loan yields as we move into the next few quarters?\nCraig Nix: Is your question around the yield or the balances? You're saying push on loan yields. I mean, we continue to price loans in excess of where we're pricing deposits. And are you talking about spreads?\nChristopher Marinac: Well, Craig, I'm talking more about, I guess, in your loan contracts with new loans that -- my impression is that there's the ability to kind of push yields higher if compensating balances go below certain levels. It's sort of a enforcement to get more deposits but also kind of have better pricing if customers start to pull funds.\nCraig Nix: I think what you're referring to is on the SVB side, and we have not pushed any on deposits to come back and to push those loan yields higher. I think, in general, there is obviously opportunities, it\u2019s that market rates can continue to increase, so we price loans higher. The main opportunity for us right now is obviously in the fixed rate loan book where we reprice approximately 20%, 25% a year up on an ongoing basis, and we expect to continue to see that momentum going into next year.\nChristopher Marinac: And then any other general thoughts about kind of where your adversely rated credits may go next year, would you think that they\u2019d change and deteriorate or would you see them kind of stable from here?\nUnidentified Company Representative: That's not termed in the adversely classified loans, however we expect that to go next year. So obviously with the inflation pressures and elevated interest rates, we are seeing migration. We would continue to see that to some degree. And obviously, the areas that are most challenged are the ones Craig is referenced, which is certainly office and the small ticket equipment finance.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question goes to Brian Foran of Autonomous.\nBrian Foran: I just wanted to clarify on the expenses recognizing it's not like a formal '24 guide, but just to make sure I am using the right base. When you say flat to low single digit as potentially an outcome, is that relative the full year at $4.12 billion to $4.15 billion or is that relative to 4Q annualized, which I guess would be about $4.5 billion?\nFrank Holding: Brian, the way I am looking at it since we were not merged in the first quarter, I am comparing the three quarters of '23 to the three quarters of '24 where we are comparable, and that's what I am saying is flat to low single digits up.\nBrian Foran: So the nine months where the two companies are together\u2026\nFrank Holding: Obviously, if you looked year-over-year, we're going to be up because the first quarter SVB we weren't merged. So you are going to see -- you could see a double digits percentage increase year-over-year given the first quarter.\nBrian Foran: I initially plugged in relative to the full year and had you guys making like $250 per share and maybe got a little too excited. So I appreciate the clarification. That was it.\nOperator: And our next question goes to Brody Preston of UBS.\nBrody Preston: I wanted to start just maybe on credit. I just wanted to better understand the charge-offs within the SVB book. I think last quarter you had one that you had called out and then you had a couple others that you kind of cleaned up. These seem to be clustered in the innovation portfolio. I guess I wanted to ask was this more of a cleanup quarter as well? And I say that just because the charge off rate on that portfolio seems to be or this quarter at least was running close to what SVB experienced back during the GFC. So I just assumed that there was some cleanup charge offs there that you had marks again.\nFrank Holding: No, I wouldn't characterize it that way. Again, approximately 56 million of the 100 was reserved for, so we did anticipate the charge offs. They were just -- we guided the 35 to 45, charge offs came in higher than we expected at 53 basis points for the quarter. But I would not characterize it as this was a cleanup quarter or that last quarter was. I think we expect the charge offs to remain elevated at least through the first half of next year and consistent with these numbers and then we'll see what happens in the second half. Again, we're not giving guidance today going forward. But no I would not characterize it as a cleanup..\nBrody Preston: Do you happen to know what the mark you have against the innovation book is?\nFrank Holding: We have a four -- we have -- our allowance on the innovation portfolio is 4.42%. We also have a purchase accounting discount of 5.09%. So that's a 9.51% loss absorbing capacity, which gives us 2.1 times coverage on that portfolio, which we believe is conservative and strong.\nBrody Preston: And then I just wanted to ask one last one on the non-interest bearing deposit trends. It looked like that this should be -- the book started to stabilize a bit but still came down, but the NIBs were quite a bit stronger than I guess I would've originally thought just relative to the guidance you'd given before. So I wanted to ask, was there good NIB growth -- was there NIB growth in the commercial or the consumer banks at all that kind of helped offset some of the cash flow -- the cash outflows from the [SVB] client base?\nFrank Holding: Well, if you look just from last quarter, non-interest bearing deposits actually declined but they did not decline at the rate we anticipated. So we did have a decline in those from -- and it was about $1.4 billion. But we had projected a decline that was a little larger, so that's why we would've -- we might have come up with a lower mix of non-interest bearing to total deposits. And we did drop from 30% to 28% in the quarter, 32% to 30% we expect to drop to that 28% in the fourth quarter if our deposit projections hold.\nBrody Preston: And do you think that 28% is getting close to a bottom?\nFrank Holding: I think we have -- there's more room for it to fall given that especially if rates are higher for longer potentially into the mid 20s. Tom, you want to emphasize that?\nTom Eklund: I was just going to mention, I mean, obviously, it's a priority as we go to market to gather these non-interest bearing deposits. I think as you look at the third quarter and in the core bank with actually really strong, if you sort of neutralize for the impact you typically see as corporates make cash tax payments in September. So overall, I think the underlying trends look pretty good.\nOperator: Thank you. I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to our host, Deanna Hart, for any closing remarks.\nDeanna Hart: Thank you. And thank everyone for joining our quarterly earnings call today. We appreciate your ongoing interest in our company. And if you have further questions or need additional information, please feel free to reach out to the Investor Relations team through our Web site. We hope you have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this includes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Thank you, Deanna, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Page 5. Despite a volatile external market, we've delivered another solid quarter of financial results marked by strong revenue growth and disciplined expense management. Our focus continues to be on growing our core lines of business, maintaining our safety and stability through strong capital, credit and liquidity risk management and delivering long term tangible book value growth to our shareholders. This morning, we reported earnings per share of $55.92 excluding items noted in the presentation on Page 52. This exceeded our expectations and represented a 6% increase over the sequential quarter. Return metrics were also strong improving over the sequential quarter despite an increase in credit reserves and capital levels. These return metrics were supported by net interest margin that remained over 4% and an adjusted efficiency ratio of 46%. Deposits continued to be a huge focus for us during the quarter with period end deposits up 14% on an annualized basis or 3% sequentially. In addition to deposit growth, our commercial and general bank segments posted solid loan growth. Our liquidity and capital positions remain strong and stable, driven by our focus on core deposit gathering and a conservatively managed investment portfolio. We also remain focused on managing credit risk prudently. We did experience an increase in net charge offs this quarter with the majority of the charge offs related to investor dependent loans in the SVB portfolio. While we continue to monitor this portfolio closely, given some of the macroeconomic headwinds facing the innovation economy, we remain encouraged by the resiliency of our clients in the face of elevated inflation and rising interest rates. On Page 6, we continue to make great progress in integrating SVB and our initial stabilization efforts are complete. As a result of our continued focus on an outreach to our clients, we continue to see stabilization in loan and deposit balances during the quarter. We have materially completed our strategic assessment work. Currently, we are leveraging the insights from this work to identify opportunities to grow our market position in an innovation economy. Finally, we remain focused on regulatory readiness through our large bank program and a dedicated team of leaders and associates are ensuring we have a framework to meet heightened regulatory expectations and ensure sound business practices for large financial institutions. On Page 7, our strategic priorities have not changed and are included here for your reference. On Page 8, we provided tangible examples of supporting our clients in the innovation economy. We remain excited by the green shoots we're seeing as new and returning business comes to SVB six months post-acquisition. For example, during the third quarter, global fund banking originations increased by 18% compared to the sequential quarter and its pipeline has grown over 70%. We are committed to building on and investing in the SVB business to preserve long term client relationships and to generate new business with founders, entrepreneurs, innovation leaders and venture capital and private equity clients. During the quarter, our commitment was exemplified when we launched a nationwide Yes, SVB campaign to increase awareness that SVB is open for business and that we remain dedicated to supporting the innovation economy. We are also investing in new capabilities, including the rollout, the continued rollout of [SVB Go], an online digital banking platform to support our clients' needs by facilitating easier interactions, simple, secure and intuitive. The platform is designed for how our founders and innovation leaders run their businesses rather than how banks operate. Looking forward, we acknowledge the headwinds facing the innovation economy. The muted fundraising and investment pace coupled with limited exit opportunities continues to put pressure on innovation companies across all sectors and stages of development. This is resulting in some bulky charge offs, which Craig will speak to in more detail during his comments. Historically, 12 to 18 months into a down cycle VC investment reaches a floor after which valuations normalize and VC firms come back into the market. While US VC firms investment levels may continue to fall in the near term, we believe the long term outlook remains positive, primarily related to tailwinds that remain intact despite the most recent dislocation. The innovation economy is stronger than in past cycles as it grew two at 2.4 times the rate of the overall US economy between 2000 and 2021, and the COVID-19 pandemic has only accelerated digital adoption. Further, the innovation economy was 3.5 times larger in 2020 than in 2000. While we do not believe we are likely to see 2021 levels of valuation and investment for some time, if ever, we know that there is substantial dry powder waiting to be invested, which gives us confidence in the long term prospects of the innovation economy. Now turning to Page 9. We have exciting news in our wealth division. Since 2013 we've focused on our wealth management capabilities and have made significant progress growing organically. As a result, our private banking, brokerage and trust services have become a significant revenue source for us and we've recently expanded our reach beyond our legacy markets in the Carolinas, to California and the northeast. The SVB acquisition provided complementary expansion in terms of geographic distribution and accelerated entrance into attractive market we were already targeting. The opportunities extend beyond our footprint, however, we are focused on maintaining the great client relationship fostered by SVB private and deepening those relationships with our registered branch associates and digital platforms serving institutional, mass affluent and high net worth clients. Moving forward, we believe these complementary capabilities will accelerate the growth of our wealth franchise. We remain focused on executing against our core strategic priorities, which are the building blocks for long term sustainable value generation and are at the core of everything we do. I would like to thank all of our associates for their strong commitment to serving our customers, clients and communities. Thanks to you, I am confident we are well positioned to continue delivering strong results and long term value to our shareholders and stakeholders. In conclusion, I would like to address the recent tragic and horrible attacks inflicted on the innocent people in Israel. We are saddened by these events and wish for peace in the region and for the future security of everyone and especially our clients, associates and their families. I will now turn it over to Craig to provide an update on our third quarter financial results. Craig? Yes, if we -- we certainly will consider a share repurchase plan as part of our capital plan in 2024 and if that should be included and approved, it would commence in the second half of 2024 consistent with prior plans. Yes, if you isolate it, ex accretion in the fourth quarter, we expect NIM to decline by 1 basis point. So we have some stabilization there. With accretion we're expecting it to decline by 19 basis points. So it is an accretion issue, both on net interest income in dollars and on the margin. Right now, we're not providing 2024 guidance, but just directly, I think, flattish to low single digits percentage increase going into \u201824. Mark, I'm going to let you handle that one. I know we have picked up some new clients. So I'll start on that, others may wish to comment. Jennifer was certainly a very high profile rehire, recognizing she was coming back from the SVB capital entity. And having said that, not the only former SVB-er to rejoin with the key point there being that, I believe the others that we've had in the new hire mix were SVB-ers legacy SVB-ers that had departed several years ago as opposed to since the events of March. And so that too is encouraging to see some of our former colleagues look at what we have going on here so far in our first two quarters of togetherness and vote where their feet to come join us, again, Jennifer being the most high profile of those, which we are so excited to see her return. Brian, the way I am looking at it since we were not merged in the first quarter, I am comparing the three quarters of '23 to the three quarters of '24 where we are comparable, and that's what I am saying is flat to low single digits up. Obviously, if you looked year-over-year, we're going to be up because the first quarter SVB we weren't merged. So you are going to see -- you could see a double digits percentage increase year-over-year given the first quarter. No, I wouldn't characterize it that way. Again, approximately 56 million of the 100 was reserved for, so we did anticipate the charge offs. They were just -- we guided the 35 to 45, charge offs came in higher than we expected at 53 basis points for the quarter. But I would not characterize it as this was a cleanup quarter or that last quarter was. I think we expect the charge offs to remain elevated at least through the first half of next year and consistent with these numbers and then we'll see what happens in the second half. Again, we're not giving guidance today going forward. But no I would not characterize it as a cleanup.. We have a four -- we have -- our allowance on the innovation portfolio is 4.42%. We also have a purchase accounting discount of 5.09%. So that's a 9.51% loss absorbing capacity, which gives us 2.1 times coverage on that portfolio, which we believe is conservative and strong. Well, if you look just from last quarter, non-interest bearing deposits actually declined but they did not decline at the rate we anticipated. So we did have a decline in those from -- and it was about $1.4 billion. But we had projected a decline that was a little larger, so that's why we would've -- we might have come up with a lower mix of non-interest bearing to total deposits. And we did drop from 30% to 28% in the quarter, 32% to 30% we expect to drop to that 28% in the fourth quarter if our deposit projections hold. I think we have -- there's more room for it to fall given that especially if rates are higher for longer potentially into the mid 20s. Tom, you want to emphasize that?"

            "name": "Craig Nix",
            "content": "Thank you, Frank, and thank all of you for joining us today. I am going to anchor my comments on our third quarter financial results to the takeaways outlined on Page 11. For your reference, Pages 12 through 32 provide more detail supporting those results. As Frank just said, our return metrics were once again strong in the third quarter. ROE and ROA adjusted for notable items were 16.77% and 1.55%, respectively, both exceeding our expectations. Our return metrics were supported by 1.5% sequential increase in net interest income and a 5.9% sequential decline in expenses. Net interest income performance was the result of increased accretion income as well as the impact of higher rates increasing our loan and investment at yield. The cost of deposits increased by 44 basis points over the prior quarter to 2.12%, representing a cycle-to-date data of 37%. Despite the rise in deposit costs, our quarterly NIM showed continued strength coming in at 407, down three basis points from the linked quarter but up 65 basis points from the same quarter a year ago. The modest decline in NIM during the quarter was driven by higher deposit balances as well as a higher rate paid on deposits and lower average loans, partially offset by higher yield on earning assets and the elimination of FHLB borrowings. With the sell off in the longer to intermediate part of the yield curve, we allocated $5 billion of our excess cash in the short duration US treasury and agency mortgage backed securities during the quarter to mitigate some of our sensitivity to falling rates. Given our excess cash position, we expect that to continue in the fourth quarter. We do not expect these purchases to have a material impact on baseline earnings as the investment rates are in line with interest we earn on cash reserves. Adjusted non-interest income increased modestly by 1% sequentially. Of note during the quarter was our real business, which turned in another strong quarter with utilization rates above 98% and positive repricing trends. We have a well diversified fleet with high capacity and efficiency, positioning our portfolio well for any future downturn in the economy. We're also focused on growing and expanding our fee based business in areas such as payments and wealth management as Frank alluded to just a moment ago. We have been working recently to expand SVB's real time payment network, which will allow our clients to send and receive payments instantly. We are also working to offer instant settlement for merchants using payment facilitators and instant loan funding and disbursements, including early wage access. We are excited about the opportunity to accelerate SVB's capability and billing payment functions and are happy to be in a position to invest in opportunities such as these. Adjusted non-interest expense declined by $71 million or by 5.9% sequentially over 85% of the reduction related to synergies arising from the SVB acquisition. We also saw declines in our marketing costs, which as you may recall from previous calls, had been primarily associated with growing deposits in the direct bank. We grew deposits in this channel by $6.4 billion during the quarter, while spending less in advertising with efficiency led by new clients from previous periods continuing to increase balances. Strong expense management and discipline will remain a significant focus for us moving forward. Putting all of this together, we achieved an adjusted efficiency ratio of 46%, which was an improvement of approximately 4% over the prior quarter. Our third quarter adjusted PPNR grew by 8.6% over the linked quarter, driven by the diversification and growth of our net revenue streams as well as disciplined expense management. Now moving to the balance sheet. Loans were up by $187 million over the second quarter. The general and commercial banking segments grew by approximately $1 billion each while the SVB segment experienced a decline of just under $2 billion. In the General Bank growth was concentrated in small business and commercial loans and our branch network. We were excited to continue to build long term customer relationships in the General Bank and are pleased to see our investments in digital, call center, and branch technology over the past several years payoff. Further, our product breadth has benefited from the CIT and SVB transactions providing us with better ability to fulfill products based on the preferences of our clients and customers. In the commercial bank segment, growth was driven by strong production in our industry verticals, including energy, healthcare and TMT, as well as seasonal increases in factoring as clients build out inventory ahead of the holiday season. While origination volumes remain strong in our industry verticals, they were down from the sequential quarter but the balance sheet benefited from a decline in prepayments. The decline in SVB segment lines was due to three major factors. First, approximately half of the decline was the result of the expected wind down of our foreign exposure. Recall that we did not purchase any foreign entities as part of the acquisition, so we have been in the process of exiting these markets. Second, lower new loan fundings as the private market investment landscape continues to face headwinds, resulting in a difficult exit environment, lower fundraising numbers and fewer deals. And third, expected repayments. While foreign exposure had a significant impact on our third quarter loan balances, we do not anticipate it being a meaningful issue going forward as the majority of the exposure has been unwound at this point. We are also encouraged by trends in the technology and healthcare banking business. This business saw client attrition early on as a result of the March crisis. However, we have been pleased to see both new and returning business come back to this group, resulting from the initiatives we have undertaken since the acquisition. Deposits increased by 5.1 billion over the linked quarter, driven by $6.4 billion of growth in our direct bank. The direct bank now accounts for 35 billion, 24% of our deposit base. While this channel is higher cost compared to the traditional branch network, 92% of the deposits are insured and the increase in imbalances allowed us to reduce our wholesale funding reliance as we were able to pay off more expensive FHLB debt in the third quarter. We are pleased that the deposit growth we have experienced allowed us to work our loan to deposit ratio down to 91% from almost 99% at the time of the acquisition.  Moving to credit quality. Our metrics remained within our risk appetite but we continued to see deterioration and a few portfolios that we are diligently monitoring to quickly identify and address problems that may arise. The non-accrual loan ratio decreased by 2 basis points to 0.68% with total non-accrual loans decreasing moderately to $899 million. The decrease was driven by net charge offs outpacing loans migrating into nonaccrual status during the quarter. The net charge off ratio increased by 6 basis points during the quarter to 53 basis points. Of the 176 million in net charge offs during the quarter, 100 million was in the SVB segment, of which 56 million was previously reserved. For the SVB segment net charge offs were concentrated in investor dependent loans with charge offs totaling 88 million in the third quarter compared to 49 million last quarter. At quarter end, this portfolio totaled $5.7 billion or 10% of SVB segment loans with 1.7 billion in early stage companies, the highest risk category, representing 3% of SVBs segment loans. We are carrying an ACL on the investor dependent portfolio of $250 million or 4.42% of total loans and a purchase accounting discount of 288 million or 5.09%, equating to 538 million or 9.51% loss absorbing capacity on these loans. Within the commercial bank segment, net charge offs were concentrated in the general office and small ticket equipment leasing portfolios. As we have been signaling for a number of quarters, we continue to see stress in our general office portfolio in the commercial bank, which totaled $1.1 billion at the end of the third quarter. This portfolio is concentrated in Class B repositioned bridge loans and is where we have seen deterioration in the past dues, criticized assets and charge-offs. We are carrying an ACL on these loans of 7.12% compared to 4% on the overall general office portfolio. We have completed target reviews across our business segments to assess credits and are remaining vigilant on our entire portfolio to identify areas of risk early on. We have historically performed well in challenging economic cycles due to our thoughtful approach to managing risk, measured underwriting practices, customer selection and long term relationship development. We believe our disciplined credit and risk management approach will continue to support us as we navigate the most recent economic cycle. Our ACL increased three basis point to 1.26%, driven by modest deterioration in the macroeconomic forecast and in the large balanced commercial real estate portfolio, which includes general office. These increases were partially offset by lower specific reserves and lower loan balances in the SVB segment. The ACL provided 2 points down coverage of annualized quarterly net charge-offs and covered non-accrual loans 1.9 times. Moving to capital. Our CET1 ratio decreased by 15 basis points sequentially ending the quarter at 13.23%, well above our internal target range of 9% to 10%. Strong earnings generation added 50 basis points of capital during the quarter, offset by a decline in the loss share benefit of 63 basis point. We continue to operate at capital levels well above our target ranges on all of our risk based capital ratios. Before closing with our fourth quarter outlook, I want to comment on pending regulation specifically around capital and long term debt. We continue to assess the proposed regulations and the potential impacts on our operations. As I mentioned on the last call, we have established a team whose mandate is to develop plans to ensure operational readiness for these regulations. Although we don't have the precise impacts to our capital ratios at this time, we do know capital requirements will increase. On the long term debt front, we expect we will need to raise between $8 billion and $11 billion to satisfy these requirements. While we have not traditionally leveraged the debt capital markets to raise funding, we believe our strong and stable capital and liquidity positions will allow us to be flexible as we enter the market in 2024. As we mentioned last quarter, we will continue to pause share repurchases and we will consider reinstating them when we submit our capital plan in 2024 and better understand the full impacts of these proposed regulations. I will close on Page 34 by discussing our fourth quarter outlook. We anticipate further declines in the Global Fund Banking business from lower levels of venture capital investments, lower capital deployment and the final stages of intentional rundown of select portfolios that were located internationally at the time of the merger. We also anticipate a modest decline in our tech and life sciences business as marketing activity continues to be depressed. As a result, we expect SVB loan balances to be in the mid $50 billion range by year end down from $57 billion at the end of the third quarter. We expect that SVB declines will largely be offset by mid single digit percentage growth in the General Bank segment driven by continued momentum in our branch network, as well as growth in our equipment finance line of business. Despite clients feeling pressure from the elevated rate environment, we still have great momentum in our branch network where we continue to emphasize full banking relationships. We have invested significantly in our equipment finance sales platform and those efforts are continuing to pay off with increased efficiency and balance sheet growth. We do expect slight loan declines this quarter in our industry verticals mainly related to timing and some of the larger loans in our pipeline pull through in the third quarter, and we expect some payoff to be pushed through to the fourth quarter. On deposits, we expect a low to mid single digit percentage point decline and the fourth quarter primarily related to a decline in SVB deposits. We had sizable deposit growth in the second and third quarters and we're able to retire more costly short term FHLB borrowings, which coupled with low expected loan growth reduces our need to raise deposit balances at the same rates we did during the last quarters. While we're encouraged by the stabilization of SVB deposits since April, we anticipate that SVB clients will continue to experience a level of cash burn that exceeds funds sourced from fundraising. It's worth noting that we expect broader market DC funding to remain subdued in the range of 30 billion to 35 billion for the fourth quarter of 2023, which is significantly down from prior years and in line with the muted activity we've seen throughout the first three quarters of 2023. Consequently, we're projecting an approximate $5 billion decline in SVB deposits in the fourth quarter. This estimate could be conservative as the SVB team is laser focused on obtaining and winning back balances, which could partially offset some natural runoff. Our interest rate forecast follows the implied forward curve. We forecast one more quarter point rate hike in the fourth quarter with the Fed funds rate ending the year at 5.75%. While we expect the absolute level of margin and net interest income to remain elevated, we do expect them to begin to decline in the coming quarters. We expect this to occur as the accretion from some of the shorter portfolios we acquired, such as global fund banking, fully accrete and we experience continued pressure on deposit pricing. The impact of lower accretion and higher deposit costs will be partially offset by higher loan and investment yields. We anticipate our full cycle beta increasing to approximately 43%, up from our previous estimate of 39%, primarily due to the higher absolute betas at this point in the rate cycle, as well as the strong growth we've experienced in the direct bank. On adjusted non-interest income, after a strong third quarter, we see a slight retreat to the $430 million to $450 million range, primarily due to the lagged impact of lower SVB off balance sheet funds and less overall innovation economy market activity leading to lower client investment fees, international fees and other service charges, as well as slightly lower net rental total income on operating leases due to higher expected maintenance expense in the fourth quarter. We expect continued growth in our wealth and emergency income lines of business. On adjusted non-interest expense, we expect to be flat to slightly down compared to the third quarter. Continued acquisition synergies will be partially offset by slightly higher expected consulting and project costs related to strategic priorities, as well as our continued investment in large bank programs and initiatives. Some of these professional consulting and project costs were lower in the second and third quarters as we assessed and reprioritized areas of focus heading into 2024. We anticipate by year end that we will be more than halfway to our 25% to 30% synergies goal on SVB's $2.6 billion pre-merger expense base. We anticipate materially all synergies to be reflected in the run rate by the end of 2024. It's worth noting, we do expect a 1 time $30 million FDIC assessment to be recognized in the fourth quarter, but will be paid out over eight quarters, which is not included in the adjusted total. The timing of this will be dependent upon when the rule is finalized, meaning it could potentially move into 2024. We expect annualized net charge offs in the range of 50 to 60 basis points in the fourth quarter, at or above the level we saw in the third quarter. This would bring the full year net charge off ratio to the mid 40 basis points range. This is an upward revision to our previous estimate and is primarily the result of higher than expected charge offs in our investor dependent general office CRE in the commercial bank and small ticket equipment leasing portfolios. In closing, we are aware that we're in a time of change and dislocation in the banking industry. We believe we are well positioned to successfully navigate macroeconomic headwinds as well as the changing regulatory landscape just as we have done so many times before. These changes present us with opportunities and we are committed to serving our clients through all market conditions while continuing to deliver long term value to our shareholders. Our solid capital and liquidity levels not only position us well for changes resulting from the proposed changes and regulatory requirements but also provide us flexibility to be proactive instead of reactive during this uncertain backdrop. We are confident in the long term outlook for our business. Our business flows are good and our risk management practices are strong. We are focused on maintaining expense discipline while continuing to invest in the future. We have an established track record of successful integration efforts, which we look forward to continuing with SVB. I will now turn it over to the operator for instructions for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Mark, would you weigh in on that, please? I think right now, we consider ourselves to be adequately reserved and actually our reserves are very strong on all three of those areas when you look at general office and particularly in the commercial bank, you look at the equipment finance and then you look at the innovation loans, the investor dependent loans, we feel like our reserves are strong there. We are close to 2 times covered if you look at those in the aggregate. So we we believe our reserves are strong. But we do think for a couple of quarters out that charge-offs will remain a little bit elevated in those areas. Andy, I don't know if you have anything you would like to add to any of that or Randy. And that's why you see us raising our net charge-off guidance to 50 to 60 from 35 to 45. Well, what's going to happen is the accretion is going to offset some of the decrease or stabilization in expense. So what I would say in the fourth quarter you might see it matriculate up to the high 40s, low 50s, and then next year, I think, you'd see it in that same range per quarter. So I would think high 40s, low 50s for the next five quarters, and that's really a function of just declining accretion income outpacing the expenses. We're really satisfied with efficiency ratio in the low 50 to high 40. Is your question around the yield or the balances? You're saying push on loan yields. I mean, we continue to price loans in excess of where we're pricing deposits. And are you talking about spreads? I think what you're referring to is on the SVB side, and we have not pushed any on deposits to come back and to push those loan yields higher. I think, in general, there is obviously opportunities, it's that market rates can continue to increase, so we price loans higher. The main opportunity for us right now is obviously in the fixed rate loan book where we reprice approximately 20%, 25% a year up on an ongoing basis, and we expect to continue to see that momentum going into next year."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for this conference call, Ms. Deanna Hart, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nDeanna Hart: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Frank Holding; President, Peter Bristow; and Chief Financial Officer, Craig Nix, will provide second quarter business and financial updates today. During the call, we will reference our investor presentation, which you can find on our website. Our comments will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. We assume no obligation to update such statements. These risks are outlined for you on Page 3. We will also reference non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures against the most directly comparable GAAP measures are found in Section 5 of the presentation. Finally, First Citizens is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of earnings transcripts provided by third parties. I will now turn it over to Frank.\nFrank Holding: Thank you, Deanna, and good morning, everyone. Before we get into second quarter results, I'd like to start by saying that the SVB acquisition is going very well, and we are pleased with our progress integrating SVB's clients and associates into First Citizens. I'm also pleased to announce that we've appointed Marc Cadieux, a 30-year veteran of SVB as President of SVB's Commercial Banking business. Based in the San Francisco Bay Area, Marc leads a team of more than 1,000 experienced and talented bankers nationwide who are dedicated to the innovation economy. And we are fortunate to have Marc as a part of the First Citizens senior leadership team. Starting on Page 5. We've announced another quarter of solid financial results which were amplified by the SVB acquisition. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $52.60, exceeding our expectations. We delivered top quartile return metrics, generating an adjusted return on equity of 16.5% and return on assets of 1.5%. Our net interest margin expanded 69 basis points to 4.1%, and our adjusted efficiency ratio came in below 50% for this quarter. Deposits continue to be a huge focus for us, generated for us growing by 3.2% on an annualized basis. In addition to deposit growth, our commercial and general bank segments posted solid loan growth. We finished the second quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.4%. Since year-end, we've accreted 228 basis points of capital from the SVB acquisition and 69 basis points from retained earnings. While we continue to build capital to support clients and drive organic growth, our goal is to operate with efficient levels of capital defined by our target ranges. At the present time, we are operating over the top end of our target ranges for all of our risk-based capital ratios. However, we will continue to pause share repurchases this year as we focus on SVB integration and get more clarity around the impacts of the new proposed capital rules. As for pending regulation, we are tracking the potential new requirements to ensure operational readiness. As part of this work, we've established a team whose mandate is to develop plans to expedite implementation once final rules are established. Thanks to these proactive actions and our strong risk management framework, we are well positioned to manage through any changes and address them exponentially or expediently, excuse me. In addition to capital, our liquidity position remains strong and stable, driven by our focus on core deposit gathering and a conservatively managed investment portfolio. We also remain focused on managing credit prudently. While we experienced an increase in net charge-offs this quarter, the majority of the increase related to the SVB portfolio that were anticipated and reserved for in day 1 acquisition accounting. We remain encouraged by the resiliency of our clients in the face of elevated inflation and rising interest rates and we look forward to continuing to supporting them. Turning to Page 6. We continue to make progress on SVB integration efforts and are excited by the early signs of collaboration and partnership we are seeing among our teams. Since we acquired SVB on March 27, our focus has been on stabilizing the business and as Peter Bristow will discuss shortly, we've made excellent progress on this front. We continue to focus on providing consistent and high-touch service to our clients and getting back to what SVB does best, lending to the innovation economy and bringing its participants together. Internally, we've been hyper focused on retaining SVB talent. An important step was in the naming of the SVB leadership team and ensuring that they have the tools to provide associates support and reiterate our commitment to the innovation economy. Externally, our stabilization efforts focused on client outreach. Our associates have dedicated countless hours to communicating to clients that they continue to expect what made SVB special to remain, including the high level of service, specialization, ability to anticipate challenges and the resources to provide meaningful solutions. This outreach has paid off as we've seen continued deposit stabilization in the SVB portfolio since April. Currently, we're moving forward with the remaining pillars of our integration process, and let me quickly run through these with you. First, we continue to advance our strategic assessment work. Having completed an initial round of strategic assessments led by the business lines, we are now leveraging those insights to identify strategic initiatives and key integration activities. In doing so, we're ensuring that the key processes and practices that have been instrumental to SVB's differentiated offering remain in place. These strategic assessments also inform our integration efforts, which we continue to make progress on. As a part of this work, we're developing and executing on detailed integration plans that prioritize maintaining SVB's unique leadership role and ongoing support for the innovation economy. And finally, we are ensuring regulatory readiness through our large bank program. After the CIT merger, we established a large bank program oversight team as centralized functions within our risk -- as a centralized function within our risk management organization. This team provides dedicated oversight of the work needed to meet heightened regulatory expectations and ensure sound business practice for large financial institutions. Post SVB, this team is working to identify potential gaps and implementing plans to remediate them. Turning to Page 7. We remain focused on executing against our core strategic priorities, which are the building blocks for long-term sustainable value generation and are at the core of everything we do. As a result, I'm confident that we are well positioned to support our clients and customers, grow our balance sheet profitably and deliver strong results. Before I turn it over to Peter, I want to thank all of our associates for their hard work and unwavering commitment to our shareholders, clients, customers and communities, and I'm proud of what we've accomplished and will accomplish moving forward. Now I'll turn it over to Peter Bristow to provide an SVB business update. Peter?\nPeter Bristow: Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Page 8, I want to reiterate what Frank said. I'm incredibly proud of the progress we have made in integrating SVB and reestablishing it as an undisputed leader in the innovation economy. Our team has done tremendous work on that front. I won't cover all the details outlined on this slide as many of the points echo comments Frank just made. But I do want to provide concrete examples on the progress we are making. Our bankers have reached out to a considerable number of clients over the past few months, and we are encouraged by the success we are seeing in reestablishing relationships with the clients who left in March. To support this effort, we've initiated a comprehensive outreach campaign to touch each of our approximately 30,000 clients. We've also embarked on a major print web campaign including full pages in the Wall Street Journal and New York Times to reinforce to our clients that we're fully committed to the innovation economy and ready to serve their needs with tailored product offerings. I want to highlight some numbers that demonstrate the success we've seen so far. We have approximately 1,500 clients whose funds dipped below 10% of their March 8 amount who have recommitted and now have some portion of their funds back at SVB. We also now have over 90% of our core borrowers, either meeting deposit requirements or working in good faith with us to meet them. These sales efforts have been noticeable on the balance sheet. Our deposits have largely remained steady since the end of April, maintaining in the $40 billion to $41 billion range despite the limited fundraising activity in the broader venture capital market and our clients' ongoing cash burn. And while our loan balances have declined, this is primarily related to the short-term nature of our global funds banking portfolio, which is down given reduced broader market activity as well as the lagged effect of being out of the market for a few months in early 2023. We are encouraged by the robust pipelines in this business, and we are back in the market for new production. While we see challenges in the broader market for the remainder of 2023, as venture capital investment is below the levels of the past few years. We are well poised to capture client funds once investment levels begin to increase likely in late 2024 and into 2025. Despite competitors who are actively entering the innovation space, competitive advantages, including our long-standing client relationships and our breadth and depth of offerings continue to differentiate us. Importantly, we are hearing positive client feedback around our reinforcement of SVB stability now backed by the strength of First Citizens and our unique tailored offering that our clients have come to know and love. Clients are eager to learn more about the vision for the First Citizens and SVB partnership. We also remain excited about the opportunities that SVB products and services provide for our legacy First Citizens clients and we believe there are opportunities to expand deposit and suite products to our CIT commercial clients. Complementing our early success in the SVB integration are our team's efforts in the broader commercial banking business. where strong momentum continued in the second quarter. The lending portfolio led by industry verticals in our Commercial Finance Group grew by $901 million to $13.8 billion with strong performance across the portfolio, including healthcare, tech media and telecom, energy and maritime, just to name a few. We were also pleased to welcome Jim Hudak back as the President of the Commercial Finance Group. Jim brings more than 20 years as a commercial finance executive including overseeing CIT's commercial finance business for over a decade. We are confident his leadership, insights and expertise will be invaluable as we continue to grow our commercial portfolio. We also continue to see strong performance in our middle market banking organization as we explore attractive market opportunities. And our rail business delivered another strong quarter with utilization remaining above 98%. And finally, on the wealth side, we are planning to leverage SVB's strong wealth footprint in the Northeast and California to expand our wealth coverage, building on our strong business and commercial relationships in Southern California and expanding services for our existing legacy CIT clients in the Northeast. On Page 9, we show the deposit and loan trends for the SVB segment starting on March 27 through June 30. Notably, we have not seen material declines in legacy SVB deposits since our first quarter disclosure using April 30 data. This is in spite of venture investment remaining subdued and more aligned with 2018/2019 levels. The stabilization that we've seen in our deposit balances is a testament to the client outreach and effort the team has put in to reassure them that despite the turmoil in March, SVB is not going anywhere and is more secure than ever. It also demonstrates that SVB's unique value proposition remains attractive to clients. Moving on to loans. As we noted on our first quarter call, we anticipated a drag on loan growth given more subdued lending activity in the innovation economy. The primary driver of the decline in our loans this quarter was a $6.8 billion reduction in Global Fund Banking, which was expected. Global Fund Banking has historically been one of the primary drivers of growth at SVB. However, starting in 2022 with what has been called the great reset, the pace of venture capital activity slowed considerably. Consequently, these venture capital firms are investing less, which reduces their needs to use our capital co-lending facilities. Now midway through 2023, private equity and venture capital investors faced a dynamic environment because of various macroeconomic factors, many of which are carryovers from 2022. Some such as inflation and a depressed public market appear to be resolving. Others, however, are persistent, such as high interest rates and low initial public offering activity. These challenges are having a direct impact on the private market investment landscape, resulting in a difficult exit environment, lower fundraising numbers and fewer deals. Nevertheless, we are continuing to focus on the areas we can control and believe that the rest will follow. We continue to focus on client engagement as we remain patient and continue to be there for our clients. And we believe in the fullness of time, we will successfully win back additional deposits and loans as clients restore faith and trust in the business and of course, us. Turning to Page 10. We provide additional information on SVB trends in terms of assets, all balance sheet client funds and assets under management. I won't spend much time on this today, but I wanted to provide this to you for reference. In closing, it's clear that there are a lot of opportunities for the combined company. I want to echo Frank's appreciation for all of our associates. Your continued dedication has put us in a strong position to continue growing the business, enhancing relationships and delivering best-in-class solutions and services to our clients. With that, I'll turn it over to Craig Nix.\nCraig Nix: Thank you, Peter, and thank all of you for joining us today. On Page 12, we summarize high level themes from our second quarter results. The power of the SVB combination was on full display during the quarter with return metrics exceeding our expectations. Meanwhile, the adjusted efficiency ratio significantly improved to sub-50%, thanks to strong net interest income growth and better-than-expected recognition of cost synergies. From an asset quality standpoint, overall credit performance continued to normalize, with net charge-offs increasing to 47 basis points, with most of the sequential increase related to SVB charge-offs that were expected and reserved for as of the merger date. Our exposure to office-related commercial real estate is limited, and our overall credit metrics remain resilient. Moving to the balance sheet, while loans declined sequentially due to an expected decline that Peter mentioned in Global Banking -- Global Fund Banking portfolio, the General and Commercial Bank segments grew loans at annualized rate of 12.6% and 10.5%, respectively. Our commercial and business clients continue to be resilient in the face of economic headwind. Deposits grew sequentially at an annualized rate of 3.2%, driven by core deposit growth in the direct bank. As Peter just mentioned, we are pleased to see stabilization in the SVB deposit base during the quarter. And finally, our balance sheet position remains strong. We continue to build capital through solid earnings in turn, supporting our clients to drive organic earning asset growth. As Frank mentioned in his comments, we anticipate operating above our target capital ranges, for the remainder of 2023 as we continue our pause of stock repurchases while we focus on SVB integration and gain clarity on the new proposed capital rules. Turning to Pages 13 and 14. Second quarter GAAP net income to common shareholders was $667 million or $45.87 per share. Our second quarter GAAP results were impacted by the full year impact of the SVB acquisition, a full quarter impact, sorry, as well as $55 million adjustment to the preliminary bargain purchase gain. On an adjusted basis, net income to common shareholders was $765 million or $52.60 per share yielding an annualized ROE of 16.46% and ROA of 1.49%. On Page 14, we provide 2 condensed income statements. The table at the top of the page represents our reported GAAP results and the table at the bottom supplements those results showing net income adjusted for notable items. The section in the middle of the page summarizes the impact of notable items to drive the adjusted results from the reported results. Page 15 provides detail with respect to notable items for the relevant quarterly and year-to-date periods. During the second quarter, these adjustments had the net impact of adding $6.73 to GAAP EPS. Turning to Page 16. Net interest income of $1.96 billion increased by $1.1 billion over the linked quarter, mostly due to the impact of the SVB acquisition. Net interest margin increased by 69 basis points due to the full quarter impact of accretion from the SVB combination, a higher yield on earning assets, partially offset by an increase in deposit costs. Our loan yield increased by 149 basis points, 64 basis points of which was related to accretion income. Meanwhile, deposit costs increased by 44 basis points, representing a cycle-to-date beta of 30%. Page 17 provides a roll forward of net interest margin from the sequential quarter and from the same quarter in the prior year for your reference. Moving to Page 18. We remained asset sensitive during the quarter, with a negative 100 basis points ramp in rates negatively impacting net interest income by 5.7%. We continue to prioritize liquidity risk management by intentionally keeping a larger cash balance due to the current macroeconomic environment. However, we have begun to put some of the excess cash to work in short duration U.S. treasuries to soften some of the asset sensitivity. On Page 19, we provide information on our actual and expected deposit betas. 54% of our deposits exhibit lower betas with the remainder exhibited moderate to higher betas. Our cumulative beta through the second quarter was 30%, which was higher than our previous forecast, driven by changes to interest rate environment as rates have stayed higher for longer. Given this and the competitive environment for deposits, we expect our cumulative beta to increase to 36% by the end of the third quarter as deposit costs catch up from recent rate increases, and we raise additional deposits in our more rate-sensitive direct bank channel. Over the interest rate hiking cycle, we forecast our cumulative beta will be approximately 39%, up 5% from our previous estimate, which is due in part to rates higher for longer as well as increasing our balances in the higher-cost direct bank to reduce our wholesale funding reliance. On Page 20, adjusted noninterest income increased by $153 million over the linked quarter due to the impact of the SVB acquisition and continued momentum in our legacy fee-generating business lines such as rail and card. The impact of SVB included a $50 million increase in client investment fees, earnings for managing off-balance sheet client funds and a $28 million increase in international fees related to customer foreign currency transactions. In addition, other service charges increased $22 million primarily due to unused line of credit fees in the SVB segment. Service charges on deposits and cardholder services income both increased $20 million from higher volume associated with the full quarter impact of the acquisition. These increases were partially offset by small declines in other noninterest income spread across several smaller line items and a decrease in BOLI income given our strategic early surrender of BOLI policies in the fourth quarter of 2022. On Page 21, adjusted noninterest expense totaled $1.2 billion, a $525 million increase over the linked quarter, representing the full quarter impact of the SVB acquisition. Our adjusted efficiency ratio showed significant improvement during the quarter, dropping from 57.55% to 49.65%. For your reference, Page 22 outlines our adjusted noninterest income and expense composition for the second quarter. Page 23 shows balance sheet highlights and key ratios. I'm not going to cover this in detail, but I would like to direct your attention to the fact that we drove TBV per share growth of $39 per share during the quarter while increasing our liquidity position by $8.5 billion. Turning to Page 24. Loans declined by $7.4 billion in the SVB segment, which drove down our total loan balances compared to the linked quarter. As Peter mentioned, our Global Fund Banking portfolio experienced elevated draws at the end of March and as a result, we anticipate a higher level of paydowns during the second quarter. Approximately 50% of the $7.4 billion decline was related to elevated draw repayments. The challenges facing the venture capital industry are having a direct impact on the private market investment landscape, resulting in a difficult exit environment, lower fundraising numbers and fewer deals. New draws on existing lines are muted in April and May, given uncertainty in the industry post March events. However, we did see commitment activity for existing clients pick up in the month of June, as Peter mentioned. Despite industry headwinds, our legacy First Citizens portfolio continued to experience solid growth, including $1.4 billion or 12.6% annualized percent growth in the General Bank and $749 million or 10.5% annualized growth in the commercial bank. Page 25 shows our loan composition by type and segment for your reference. Page 26 shows the deposits increased by $1.1 billion or 3.2% on an annualized basis from the linked quarter. We experienced $10.4 billion in growth in the direct bank, partially offset by a decline in SVB deposits. We have worked diligently to leverage the direct bank channel to increase balances to help fund loan growth in the general and commercial bank segments and to support legacy SVB. We do anticipate continued deposit growth in the direct bank through the end of 2023, albeit at a slower pace. While this channel is higher cost compared to the traditional branch network, enabled us to reduce more expensive FHLB borrowings by approximately $6.1 billion during the second quarter. Importantly, while SVB deposits declined $8.4 billion sequentially, the majority of this occurred in April. As Peter noted, we have worked to stabilize the franchise by performing outreach to key innovation economy partners and detailed market analysis to understand misconception so we can more quickly and effectively address them. We have also worked hard to keep client-facing team members and see and in front of our clients. As a result of these efforts, we have not seen a material change in deposit balances since we last reported, with SVB deposits remaining approximately $41 billion as of June 30. Our cost of deposits increased by 44 basis points during the quarter to 1.68%. The increase is representative of the impacts from the Fed rate hikes and our need to raise rates to stay competitive with our peers. The deposit composition by type, segment and insured uninsured breakdown are shown on Page 27. On Page 28, our balance sheet continues to be funded predominantly by deposits. We made progress this quarter rightsizing this as deposits increased to 78% of total funding, up from 75% last quarter. The FHLB borrowings we initiated in previous quarters had call features and we decreased those borrowings by approximately $6 billion this quarter, which is reflective of the deposit growth I just spoke to. Over the medium to long term, we plan to continue to drive the non-deposit concentration metrics lower by focusing on core deposit growth. On Page 29, credit quality metrics continued to normalize. Net charge-offs totaled $157 million or 47 basis points for the quarter, up from $50 million or 27 basis points in the first quarter. The increase in charge-offs were primarily the result of $97 million in net charge-offs in the SVB segment, $85 million of which were reserved for at the acquisition date. In the general and Commercial Bank segments, net charge-offs were fairly consistent with prior quarters with most occurring in the large office real estate and small ticket equipment leasing portfolio. We guided to a net charge-off range of 35 to 45 basis points on our last call as we identified a few large innovation credits that would be and were charged off during the quarter. While we do expect some continued stress in the innovation portfolio, given the depressed levels of market funding, we don't expect quarterly charge-offs to remain at these levels. However, some of these loans are large and the charge-offs can be lumpy. Moving to the bottom of the page, the nonaccrual loan ratio increased 10 basis points from the sequential quarter to 0.7%. The increase was primarily concentrated in real estate finance within the Commercial Bank segment. This is where our largest general office exposure is, which continues to be impacted by remote work dynamics, elevated interest rates, vacancy rates, lease rates, capital requirements and near-term maturities. Our allowance ratio increased by 7 basis points to 1.23% during the quarter. Page 30 provides a roll forward of our ACL from the linked quarter. The largest driver of the increase in the ACL was deterioration in macroeconomic forecasts related to declining CRE index values in both the baseline and downside scenarios. Other factors such as portfolio mix and credit quality also contributed to increases in reserves but on a much smaller scale. These increases were partially offset by lower loan balances in the SVB segment and adjustments to fair value discounts on loans acquired from SVB. As depicted on the bottom left-hand corner, the ACL provides 2.6x coverage of annualized quarterly net charge-offs and covered nonaccrual loans 1.8x. On Pages 31 and 32, we highlight our total nonowner-occupied CRE exposure which was 12.8% of total loans at quarter end with general office loans totaling $2.8 billion or 2.1% of total loans. Page 32 includes information on the general office portfolio, which is well diversified geographically with limited exposure to some of the hardest hit markets including San Francisco, Chicago and New York, which on a combined basis totaled $403 million or 14% of the total general office portfolio. As we shared on our last call of the $2.8 billion in general office loans, the most significant credit risk is in our commercial bank, which had general office loans totaling $1.1 billion at the end of the quarter representing less than 1% of total loans. This portfolio consists primarily of Class B repositioned and bridge loans and is where we have seen deterioration in past dues, criticized assets and charge-offs. We are carrying an ACL on those loans of 9.02% compared to an ACL on the overall general office portfolio of 4.44%. Reserves on both of these portfolios increased over the prior quarter due to increased specific reserves as well as deterioration in the CECL macro forecast. Most of the remaining general office exposure is in the general bank. This portfolio is more granular in nature from the smaller average loan size and some level of guarantor support or strong credit tenants under long-term leases. We have not seen material deterioration in this portfolio to date. On Page 33, our capital position remains strong with all ratios above or in the upper end of our target ranges. At the end of the second quarter, our CET1 ratio was 13.38%, and our total risk-based capital ratio was 15.84%. The 85 basis points increase in our CET1 ratio was primarily the result of continued net income growth. Before I discuss our outlook, Page 34 demonstrates that we continue to operate with a strong balance sheet and solid capital, liquidity and credit quality positions. I'll conclude with our 2023 outlook on Page 36. The second column lists our second quarter 2023 results for each metric. The numbers for noninterest income and expense are adjusted for notable items. Column 3 provides our guidance for the third quarter of 2023 and column 4 for the full year. Moving to loans. We expect that loans will remain essentially flat to the second quarter in the balances. We anticipate further declines in the global fund banking business from lower levels of venture capital investments, lower capital deployment and higher interest rates as well as the lagged impact of being out of the market for the early months of 2023. We do see flat to modest declines in our tech and life sciences business as market activity continues to be depressed. As a result, we expect SVB loan balances to be in the mid-$50 billion range by year-end down from $59 billion at the end of the second quarter. The declines in GFB will be largely offset by mid-single-digit percentage growth in the general commercial banking segment as we expect continued momentum in our branch network, industry verticals, middle market and equipment finance lines of business. Moving to deposits. We expect a low single-digit percentage decline. While we're encouraged by the stabilization of SVB deposits since April, we anticipate that SVB clients will continue to experience a level of cash burn that exceeds funds sourced from fundraising. It's worth noting that we expect broader market VC funding to remain subdued in the range of $30 billion to $40 billion per quarter for the remainder of 2023, which is significantly down from prior years. Consequently, we're projecting a $4 billion to $6 billion decline in the SVB deposit book through the end of the year. That said, we are laser-focused on actively partnering with our existing portfolio of clients and the SVB team is working diligently to obtain and win back balances, which we believe will partially offset some of this natural runoff. We are expecting the SVB decline to be partially offset by a $3 billion increase in direct bank deposits. Moving to interest rates. Our forecast follows the implied forward curve. We forecast that the Fed funds rate has peaked at 5.5%. From there, we anticipate the effective rate will remain unchanged for the rest of 2023 and into the beginning months of 2024. On to net interest income. While we expect the absolute level of margin and net interest income to remain elevated, we do expect them to begin to decline in the coming quarters compared to the second quarter. This will occur as the pace of accretion moderates, and we see continued pressure on deposit pricing. Accretion income had an approximate 50 basis point impact on our margin in the second quarter and absent the impact of accelerated loan repayments and due to the recognition of accretion on shorter duration loans, we expect this to moderate to the 30 to 35 basis points range in the coming quarters. The impact of lower accretion and higher deposit costs were partially -- will be partially offset by higher loan and investment yields. We anticipate our full-cycle beta increasing to 35% to 40%, up from our previous estimate of 30% to 35%, which is due to rates higher for longer, leading to increased competitive pressure on deposits as well as the sizable increase in our direct bank from what was close to $19 billion at the end of the first quarter to an expected mid-$30 billion range by year-end. We project net interest income in the third quarter in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. At the same time, we are raising full year net interest income to a range of $6.4 billion to $6.6 billion reflecting strong second quarter results as well as the margin dynamics I previously mentioned. On the net charge-offs, we expect third quarter annualized and full year net charge-offs to be in the 35 to 45 basis points range. Despite most of the portfolio performing well, we expect to see charge-offs concentrated in the commercial bank, general office real estate and small equipment leasing spaces. While we do expect some continued losses in the innovation portfolio, given the depressed levels of market funding, we don't expect the quarterly level of charge-offs to remain at second quarter levels. We expect SVB net charge-offs in the range of 30 to 40 basis points in the coming quarters. Given the size of the credits in both the legacy CIT and SVB portfolios, charging off 1 or 2 more large credit than anticipated can have a sizable impact on the overall quarterly net charge-off ratio and can ultimately take us to the higher end of our 35 to 45 basis points range. On to noninterest income. On an adjusted basis, we expect $420 million to $450 million in noninterest income in the third quarter. We were reassured on the level of SVB-related noninterest income in the second quarter and see this total contribution settling in at approximately $140 million to $150 million per quarter or roughly $560 million to $600 million on an annual basis. On an apples-to-apples basis of the SVB businesses that were acquired, this is closer to $300 million per quarter in 2022. So we are expecting the run rate to be slightly less than half of that given client attrition especially in some of the off-balance sheet suite products. With respect to legacy First Citizens, we still have momentum in our wealth and rail businesses. While maintenance expenses are expected to increase in rail, utilization increased to over 98%. And for the past 3 quarters, renewal rates have been at or above 120% of the previous quarter's rate. Moving to noninterest expense. We do not include expected acquisition expenses related to SVB estimated at $650 million with approximately 60% recognized in '23 and the remainder in '24. So approximately $380 million this year. For the remainder of 2023, we anticipate adjusted noninterest expense will move lower to the $1.15 billion to $1.2 billion range per quarter as we further recognize cost saves. We do expect a onetime $30 million FDIC assessment to be recognized in the third quarter. This expense will be considered notable and is not included in our adjusted noninterest income forecast -- expense forecast, sorry. We made meaningful progress on our path to achieving cost saves in the range of $650 million to $780 million by the end of '24 and pushed slightly ahead of the schedule this quarter primarily due to efficiency reductions in the back office. At this juncture, we expect to have taken over $400 million out of the expense run rate by the end of 2023, putting us slightly above 50% of the high end of our cost synergies estimate. As a reminder, most of the synergies will be driven by consolidation of redundant or duplicate back-office processes and systems as we remain focused on supporting the existing front lines of business and their clients. Moving forward, we expect to maintain our efficiency ratio in the low 50s, slightly higher than the second quarter as lower margin was partially offset by continued recognition of cost saves. On the income taxes, we expect our corporate tax rate to be in the 26.5% to 27.5% range, in line with our previous update as our revenue distribution is heavily weighted to higher tax jurisdictions such as California and New York, and our pre-existing tax benefits are spread amongst a higher -- amongst a larger pretax income base. As for 2023 EPS, we previously guided to an adjusted range of $150 to $161 per share. The range was derived from GAAP earnings but subtracted out the after-tax onetime impacts of the SVB acquisition including the preliminary bargain purchase gain, the day 2 CECL adjustment and estimated SVB-related acquisition expenses. Based upon our updated forecast, we would guide to a new adjusted range of $156 to $167 per share. The change from prior guidance is primarily related to higher net interest income projection given the absolute rate environment, partially offset by higher provision expense. Expenses are also slightly favorable to our previous forecast as we put slightly ahead on merger synergies. This forecast excludes the preliminary bargain purchase gain, the day 2 CECL impact and the expected $30 million FDIC assessment as well as approximately $380 million of expected acquisition expenses in 2023. To conclude, we are excited about our future prospects and believe that we are well positioned to continue delivering long-term value to our shareholders, clients, customers, associates and communities. With that, I will turn it over to the operator for instructions for the question-and-answer portion of the call.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Brady Gailey from KBW.\nBrady Gailey: I wanted to start with the share buyback. I understand the reasons why the buyback doesn't make sense for you guys for the back half of this year. But when do you feel like you'll have the clarity you needed to more seriously consider a share buyback? It doesn't sound like that will be until next year in 2024.\nCraig Nix: That's a correct assumption. We will be submitting a capital plan next year, and we will consider the potential impacts of these regulatory changes on our capital ratios. But we'll certainly be considering a share repurchase plan in that capital plan. But we would not resume repurchases in '23. We would anticipate all things go well that will resume in '24.\nBrady Gailey: Okay. And then I know we've talked about the lower risk weighting from the loss share assets from Silicon Valley being a benefit the common equity Tier 1 of about 200 basis points. How fast do you expect to see that? Like are we talking a matter of quarters? Or is this a longer-term matter of years where we see that slow increase in risk-weighted assets?\nCraig Nix: Yes. Brady, we are burning those over a 3-year period, which really approximates the life of the loans that are subject to loss share. So in our capital projections, we had it burning off straight line over 3 years.\nBrady Gailey: Okay. And just lastly for me, accretable yield was around $240 million in the second quarter. So a fairly large amount. How do you expect that to trend for the next few quarters?\nCraig Nix: We're expecting it to drop to $160 million range in the third quarter and the $150 million range in the fourth.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Stephen Scouten, Piper Sandler.\nStephen Scouten: Yes. I guess I missed a little bit of your response there, Craig, on the share repurchase. I guess my follow-up to that or question would be, is that kind of an internal decision as you evaluate those capital -- the new capital requirements? Or was there any sort of regulatory pushback on the desire to do a repurchase here in '23?\nCraig Nix: Yes, it was an internal decision.\nStephen Scouten: Got it. Okay. And then on the -- got it -- no, no, that's great. And on the large bank team that you guys have implemented in trying to find these gaps and so forth, has there been anything material identified to date that you can speak to? Or is that still pretty early stages as they look to identifying these gaps or planning remediation?\nCraig Nix: Yes. We really don't have any significant gaps. We have identified gaps, but they're not things that we can't overcome. So I think we are well on our way to meeting the requirements of the category 4 bank, and our risk management program meets the expectation for a large bank program and it is prepared to expand it to include the SVB businesses. So we feel like we're in really good shape there.\nStephen Scouten: Okay, great. And then really last thing for me is just if I look at the -- and the noninterest revenue guide within the slide deck, it implies a little bit of downside, I guess, from here, are there any specific categories where you expect to see some declines in the back half of the year? Or what's kind of embedded within that guidance there?\nCraig Nix: Well, if you look at just the PPR in general, as you start with net interest income, it's really the impact of that lower accretion going forward. So the headline margin will decline, although ex accretion, we still are seeing some within earning assets. So that's the most significant factor. We are guiding slightly down from the second quarter on noninterest income, and that's really FX fees and down due to lower global fund banking business and some off-balance sheet decline -- management fees for declines in off-balance sheet funds managed. Those 2 things are pretty much the factor there, lower PPNR. But we're really pleased where that's going to -- where we're going to turn out from a PPNR standpoint and a net income standpoint in the next 2 quarters.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Kevin Fitzsimmons from D.A. Davidson.\nKevin Fitzsimmons: I'm just curious, as you look longer term, obviously, the loan-to-deposit ratio got impacted by the deal. So now not appearing from a top level is quite as liquid as it once was. But how do you -- what do you aspire for that ratio to be longer term? How do you see it trending? Do you see it trending down into the 80s? Or are you very comfortable with it, where it is right here?\nCraig Nix: We don't really believe that a loan-to-deposit ratio of 95% higher is sustainable. So where we would target that would be sort of in the mid-80s, if I had to put a number on it. When you look at sort of our earnings asset mix we like where the percentage of loans is to earning assets. So it's really focusing in on the right-hand side of the balance sheet and replacing borrowings to core deposit growth. So that would be our goal. But right now, loans sitting at around 69% of earning assets is right where we like it. In fact, we get to be 70% to 74%. In conjunction though with an 85% loan-to-deposit ratio.\nKevin Fitzsimmons: Got it. And I apologize if I missed this before, but the mix shift that's going on the deposits, it looked like noninterest-bearing obviously came down at a good clip and probably a lot of that is due to SVB. Where do you -- where and when do you see that settling that percentage of noninterest-bearing?\nCraig Nix: Well, on the rate cycle turns, I think you're right. I mean, we entered the quarter 39% noninterest-bearing, we exited at 32%. I mean ultimately, in normal business cycle, we like to see our noninterest-bearing around 40%. So where it was coming into this transaction is a good spot for us. And then beyond that, we like to see core checking around 65%, which includes now accounts and noninterest bearing. And right now, we're around 50%, and that's totally due to the rate environment. So we see that optimizing as the interest rate environment moderates going forward.\nKevin Fitzsimmons: Got it. And 1 last one for me. What is the rough percentage of the direct bank right now of total deposits? And do you have any upper limit on what you want that to be? Or do you view that as just -- if that's better than borrowing, you're willing to take that up with no upper limit.\nCraig Nix: It's around 20% of our deposit base, the branch network remains overwhelmingly largest concentration around 40%. We do see those deposits as core. Obviously, they're a little bit more expensive, but they are at the margin, less expensive than FHLB borrowings. So -- and 91% of those deposits are insured. So we view those as core deposits, but acknowledge they're more expensive than branch network deposits.\nKevin Fitzsimmons: Right. And I guess as the rate environment evolves maybe over time, those would get replaced in a different rate environment by branch-based deposits, this sounds reasonable?\nCraig Nix: That sounds reasonable.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brian Foran from Autonomous Research.\nBrian Foran: Maybe on that loan-to-deposit point, I mean, what would be like a rough time line to get back to the mid-80s in your mind or a range? Are we talking multiple quarters or multiple years or somewhere in between?\nCraig Nix: Yes. It's multiple years and it sort of tethered to this note with the FDIC. So I would put it out 3 to 4 years to get that ratio into that range.\nBrian Foran: Okay. And then I know it's too early for 2024 outlooks and guidance. But just when you think about the 4Q NII, I think everything ties out to about $1.8 billion reported and $1.65 billion ex accretable yield, if I got all your comments right. Is that $1.65 billion kind of a base to work off of in your mind? Or are there still obvious puts or takes? I guess is that like a stabilized run rate that then maybe you could sustain or grow off of in your mind? Or is there still some pressure to think about in the first half of '24.\nCraig Nix: Well, in '24, if you look at the forward curve, there's 5 rate cuts projected next year, given our asset sensitivity, we would have both declining net interest income in absolute dollars and in margin if that was to occur, although I think our margin will be very respectable compared to peers even in that environment. But I would work off of the $1.8 billion to $1.9 base and then consider what 5 rate cuts might do on the back half of '24.\nOperator: Our next question is from Christopher Marinac from Janney Montgomery Scott.\nChristopher Marinac: I wanted to follow back up, Craig and team on the liquidity. If you look at the liquidity information you've given us, would you already be kind of at the full LCR if that's imposed on the new capital guidelines?\nCraig Nix: Yes, I think we would exceed it.\nChristopher Marinac: Okay. That's what I thought. I just wanted to verify that. Great. And then is there anything that you are doing or have done here in the last several months about sort of retaining staff? Is there anything kind of different that you've implemented now that you've had a full quarter to integrate SVB?\nCraig Nix: Are you speaking with respect to SVB or just in general?\nChristopher Marinac: Really SVB.\nCraig Nix: We have retention and severance payments promised in terms of our merger costs that I just mentioned. So we do have retention. Peter, I think you're doing -- I think we're doing a great job keeping our revenue producing bankers in place. So all of that sort of accrued and ends up in the run rate. So like we're doing really well with retention.\nChristopher Marinac: Great. Okay. And then just final thing for me is, did the unfunded commitment reserve change at all? Or was that stable in the quarter?\nCraig Nix: It was fairly stable. It declined like $12 million to $15 million range.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Brody Preston from UBS.\nBrody Preston: I think I'm last, which is good because I am with a handful of questions. wanted to ask if you have to go through CCAR in 2024 and how much more in expenses do you think you need to build for the enhanced regulation?\nCraig Nix: The expenses are baked in. We have the resources, although we're constantly hiring talent. So the numbers we talk about in terms of run rate include heightened expenses to meet the regulatory standards.\nBrody Preston: Okay. And do you have to go through CCAR in '24?\nCraig Nix: So '24, we have to submit a capital plan to the Fed. So we're subject to the capital plan rules. '25, we become CCAR -- a CCAR bank, but given our category 4 size, we will not submit CCAR until 2026.\nBrody Preston: Got it. On the loss share agreement, do you have a dollar amount on the estimated like total amount covered by the loss share? And then for the $97 million NCOs, do you recover any of that from the loss share?\nCraig Nix: It's -- Robert's telling me, it's $64 billion.\nRobert Hawley: Around $64 billion.\nCraig Nix: The first loss tranche is $5 billion and we don't anticipate losses nearing that. So we don't anticipate reimbursements from the FDIC for charge offs.\nBrody Preston: Got it. And what drove the extra $52 million of NCOs from SVB above the $45 million that you ID'd last quarter? Like was that even on the cusp of being okay, but you decided to move on from something?\nCraig Nix: In terms of our charge-offs, yes.\nBrody Preston: Yes, yes. Just the additional -- you called out $97 million of SVB related NCOs. Last quarter, you had flagged $45 million specifically in the deck. I was just wondering what drove you to move on from the other $52 million.\nCraig Nix: We didn't decompose the $11 million delta. So the SVB charge offs were $96 million, we reserved for $85 million. The other $11 million would be in the general reserve.\nBrody Preston: Yes. I was talking more to the -- you had called out $45 million specifically that you had reserved for last quarter that was planning on being charged off, but you charged off $85 million that you had reserved for this quarter. I was just wondering what the -- like if there was any reason for that.\nCraig Nix: $45 million was a large single charge-off. But we had $85 million reserved against the -- the $97 million that charged off during the quarter.\nBrody Preston: Got it. Okay. And then just on the SVB deposit base, the noninterest-bearing levels, I was wondering how those have how those changed since May you gave the [331] but the overall deposit balances were flattish since May. So I just wanted more insight on the mix since that May 5 date that you gave in the last quarter's deck.\nCraig Nix: Are you talking SVB?\nBrody Preston: Yes, specific to SVB.\nCraig Nix: The noninterest -- so I don't have that information sitting in front of me. But in terms of noninterest-bearing, we started at $35 billion on SVB. And at the end of the quarter, we were at $21 billion.\nBrody Preston: Got it. Okay. Do you even have the overall spot. Do you have the spot interest-bearing deposit costs at quarter end, Craig?\nCraig Nix: I'm looking it up. Well right now. We were -- our cost of deposits at the end of the second quarter was 1.68%.\nBrody Preston: I just -- I also wanted to ask on the off-balance sheet client funds. What drove the decline from the $79 billion that you had in April? And I guess how did that trend through June and now through July? And then also the fee rate looks a little bit lower than legacy SVB was. So I wanted to better understand what was driving that.\nCraig Nix: The balances we included in the presentation, so I'm flipping to those, off-balance sheet client funds came in at $88 billion, and ended the quarter at $70 billion.\nBrody Preston: Yes. I was just wondering if you had any insight as to what drove them lower from the April level.\nPeter Bristow: This is Peter. Again, this is sort of what I talked about, the overall sort of reflection of what's going on in the space in terms of venture capital investment. You're not seeing a lot of inflows there. We are -- the fact that we have the [60 or 70] of off balance sheet has been fairly consistent -- and I think it's a really good reflection of the fact that a lot of those clients are still here and still choosing us for their business. They're just moving more off balance sheet as opposed to end of the bank. So to me, it's a sign of strength.\nBrody Preston: Got it. Okay. And I just had 2 last ones. The previous guide on the -- when I kind of moved -- when I kind of took what your EPS guide was last quarter and then backed out the moving parts. You kind of indicated that you expected a [650-ish] core provision for the year. Is that still a good level to be thinking about for core provision, excluding the day 2 CECL.\nCraig Nix: Did you say 650?\nBrody Preston: Yes. That's what I kind of backed into.\nCraig Nix: I think it's about [400] for the year.\nBrody Preston: For the year. Okay. Cool. And then the last 1 was, Craig, you guys -- it's such a small portion of the loan portfolio now, that Class B office that you inherited from CIT. I think the $1.1 billion is what's for the commercial bank. And so it's less than 1% of loans. We saw another large bank in Capital One, just kind of move on from their Class B and C office portfolio and put it in held for sale. It took a big charge off on it this quarter. Is there any thought around doing something similar and just saying like it's a credit overhang, and we don't really want to deal with it. We've got plenty of capital, plenty of reserves. Let's just move on from it.\nCraig Nix: Yes. We don't have any plan to do that.\nOperator: This is all the questions we have today. I'd like to turn the call back to your host, Deanna Hart for any in closing remarks.\nDeanna Hart: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today on our quarterly earnings call. We appreciate your ongoing interest in our company. And if you have further questions or need additional information, please feel free to reach out to the Investor Relations team. We hope you have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you, everyone, for joining today's call. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a lovely day.",

            "name": "Frank Holding",
            "content": "Thank you, Deanna, and good morning, everyone. Before we get into second quarter results, I'd like to start by saying that the SVB acquisition is going very well, and we are pleased with our progress integrating SVB's clients and associates into First Citizens. I'm also pleased to announce that we've appointed Marc Cadieux, a 30-year veteran of SVB as President of SVB's Commercial Banking business. Based in the San Francisco Bay Area, Marc leads a team of more than 1,000 experienced and talented bankers nationwide who are dedicated to the innovation economy. And we are fortunate to have Marc as a part of the First Citizens senior leadership team. Starting on Page 5. We've announced another quarter of solid financial results which were amplified by the SVB acquisition. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $52.60, exceeding our expectations. We delivered top quartile return metrics, generating an adjusted return on equity of 16.5% and return on assets of 1.5%. Our net interest margin expanded 69 basis points to 4.1%, and our adjusted efficiency ratio came in below 50% for this quarter. Deposits continue to be a huge focus for us, generated for us growing by 3.2% on an annualized basis. In addition to deposit growth, our commercial and general bank segments posted solid loan growth. We finished the second quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.4%. Since year-end, we've accreted 228 basis points of capital from the SVB acquisition and 69 basis points from retained earnings. While we continue to build capital to support clients and drive organic growth, our goal is to operate with efficient levels of capital defined by our target ranges. At the present time, we are operating over the top end of our target ranges for all of our risk-based capital ratios. However, we will continue to pause share repurchases this year as we focus on SVB integration and get more clarity around the impacts of the new proposed capital rules. As for pending regulation, we are tracking the potential new requirements to ensure operational readiness. As part of this work, we've established a team whose mandate is to develop plans to expedite implementation once final rules are established. Thanks to these proactive actions and our strong risk management framework, we are well positioned to manage through any changes and address them exponentially or expediently, excuse me. In addition to capital, our liquidity position remains strong and stable, driven by our focus on core deposit gathering and a conservatively managed investment portfolio. We also remain focused on managing credit prudently. While we experienced an increase in net charge-offs this quarter, the majority of the increase related to the SVB portfolio that were anticipated and reserved for in day 1 acquisition accounting. We remain encouraged by the resiliency of our clients in the face of elevated inflation and rising interest rates and we look forward to continuing to supporting them. Turning to Page 6. We continue to make progress on SVB integration efforts and are excited by the early signs of collaboration and partnership we are seeing among our teams. Since we acquired SVB on March 27, our focus has been on stabilizing the business and as Peter Bristow will discuss shortly, we've made excellent progress on this front. We continue to focus on providing consistent and high-touch service to our clients and getting back to what SVB does best, lending to the innovation economy and bringing its participants together. Internally, we've been hyper focused on retaining SVB talent. An important step was in the naming of the SVB leadership team and ensuring that they have the tools to provide associates support and reiterate our commitment to the innovation economy. Externally, our stabilization efforts focused on client outreach. Our associates have dedicated countless hours to communicating to clients that they continue to expect what made SVB special to remain, including the high level of service, specialization, ability to anticipate challenges and the resources to provide meaningful solutions. This outreach has paid off as we've seen continued deposit stabilization in the SVB portfolio since April. Currently, we're moving forward with the remaining pillars of our integration process, and let me quickly run through these with you. First, we continue to advance our strategic assessment work. Having completed an initial round of strategic assessments led by the business lines, we are now leveraging those insights to identify strategic initiatives and key integration activities. In doing so, we're ensuring that the key processes and practices that have been instrumental to SVB's differentiated offering remain in place. These strategic assessments also inform our integration efforts, which we continue to make progress on. As a part of this work, we're developing and executing on detailed integration plans that prioritize maintaining SVB's unique leadership role and ongoing support for the innovation economy. And finally, we are ensuring regulatory readiness through our large bank program. After the CIT merger, we established a large bank program oversight team as centralized functions within our risk -- as a centralized function within our risk management organization. This team provides dedicated oversight of the work needed to meet heightened regulatory expectations and ensure sound business practice for large financial institutions. Post SVB, this team is working to identify potential gaps and implementing plans to remediate them. Turning to Page 7. We remain focused on executing against our core strategic priorities, which are the building blocks for long-term sustainable value generation and are at the core of everything we do. As a result, I'm confident that we are well positioned to support our clients and customers, grow our balance sheet profitably and deliver strong results. Before I turn it over to Peter, I want to thank all of our associates for their hard work and unwavering commitment to our shareholders, clients, customers and communities, and I'm proud of what we've accomplished and will accomplish moving forward. Now I'll turn it over to Peter Bristow to provide an SVB business update. Peter?"

            "name": "Craig Nix",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter, and thank all of you for joining us today. On Page 12, we summarize high level themes from our second quarter results. The power of the SVB combination was on full display during the quarter with return metrics exceeding our expectations. Meanwhile, the adjusted efficiency ratio significantly improved to sub-50%, thanks to strong net interest income growth and better-than-expected recognition of cost synergies. From an asset quality standpoint, overall credit performance continued to normalize, with net charge-offs increasing to 47 basis points, with most of the sequential increase related to SVB charge-offs that were expected and reserved for as of the merger date. Our exposure to office-related commercial real estate is limited, and our overall credit metrics remain resilient. Moving to the balance sheet, while loans declined sequentially due to an expected decline that Peter mentioned in Global Banking -- Global Fund Banking portfolio, the General and Commercial Bank segments grew loans at annualized rate of 12.6% and 10.5%, respectively. Our commercial and business clients continue to be resilient in the face of economic headwind. Deposits grew sequentially at an annualized rate of 3.2%, driven by core deposit growth in the direct bank. As Peter just mentioned, we are pleased to see stabilization in the SVB deposit base during the quarter. And finally, our balance sheet position remains strong. We continue to build capital through solid earnings in turn, supporting our clients to drive organic earning asset growth. As Frank mentioned in his comments, we anticipate operating above our target capital ranges, for the remainder of 2023 as we continue our pause of stock repurchases while we focus on SVB integration and gain clarity on the new proposed capital rules. Turning to Pages 13 and 14. Second quarter GAAP net income to common shareholders was $667 million or $45.87 per share. Our second quarter GAAP results were impacted by the full year impact of the SVB acquisition, a full quarter impact, sorry, as well as $55 million adjustment to the preliminary bargain purchase gain. On an adjusted basis, net income to common shareholders was $765 million or $52.60 per share yielding an annualized ROE of 16.46% and ROA of 1.49%. On Page 14, we provide 2 condensed income statements. The table at the top of the page represents our reported GAAP results and the table at the bottom supplements those results showing net income adjusted for notable items. The section in the middle of the page summarizes the impact of notable items to drive the adjusted results from the reported results. Page 15 provides detail with respect to notable items for the relevant quarterly and year-to-date periods. During the second quarter, these adjustments had the net impact of adding $6.73 to GAAP EPS. Turning to Page 16. Net interest income of $1.96 billion increased by $1.1 billion over the linked quarter, mostly due to the impact of the SVB acquisition. Net interest margin increased by 69 basis points due to the full quarter impact of accretion from the SVB combination, a higher yield on earning assets, partially offset by an increase in deposit costs. Our loan yield increased by 149 basis points, 64 basis points of which was related to accretion income. Meanwhile, deposit costs increased by 44 basis points, representing a cycle-to-date beta of 30%. Page 17 provides a roll forward of net interest margin from the sequential quarter and from the same quarter in the prior year for your reference. Moving to Page 18. We remained asset sensitive during the quarter, with a negative 100 basis points ramp in rates negatively impacting net interest income by 5.7%. We continue to prioritize liquidity risk management by intentionally keeping a larger cash balance due to the current macroeconomic environment. However, we have begun to put some of the excess cash to work in short duration U.S. treasuries to soften some of the asset sensitivity. On Page 19, we provide information on our actual and expected deposit betas. 54% of our deposits exhibit lower betas with the remainder exhibited moderate to higher betas. Our cumulative beta through the second quarter was 30%, which was higher than our previous forecast, driven by changes to interest rate environment as rates have stayed higher for longer. Given this and the competitive environment for deposits, we expect our cumulative beta to increase to 36% by the end of the third quarter as deposit costs catch up from recent rate increases, and we raise additional deposits in our more rate-sensitive direct bank channel. Over the interest rate hiking cycle, we forecast our cumulative beta will be approximately 39%, up 5% from our previous estimate, which is due in part to rates higher for longer as well as increasing our balances in the higher-cost direct bank to reduce our wholesale funding reliance. On Page 20, adjusted noninterest income increased by $153 million over the linked quarter due to the impact of the SVB acquisition and continued momentum in our legacy fee-generating business lines such as rail and card. The impact of SVB included a $50 million increase in client investment fees, earnings for managing off-balance sheet client funds and a $28 million increase in international fees related to customer foreign currency transactions. In addition, other service charges increased $22 million primarily due to unused line of credit fees in the SVB segment. Service charges on deposits and cardholder services income both increased $20 million from higher volume associated with the full quarter impact of the acquisition. These increases were partially offset by small declines in other noninterest income spread across several smaller line items and a decrease in BOLI income given our strategic early surrender of BOLI policies in the fourth quarter of 2022. On Page 21, adjusted noninterest expense totaled $1.2 billion, a $525 million increase over the linked quarter, representing the full quarter impact of the SVB acquisition. Our adjusted efficiency ratio showed significant improvement during the quarter, dropping from 57.55% to 49.65%. For your reference, Page 22 outlines our adjusted noninterest income and expense composition for the second quarter. Page 23 shows balance sheet highlights and key ratios. I'm not going to cover this in detail, but I would like to direct your attention to the fact that we drove TBV per share growth of $39 per share during the quarter while increasing our liquidity position by $8.5 billion. Turning to Page 24. Loans declined by $7.4 billion in the SVB segment, which drove down our total loan balances compared to the linked quarter. As Peter mentioned, our Global Fund Banking portfolio experienced elevated draws at the end of March and as a result, we anticipate a higher level of paydowns during the second quarter. Approximately 50% of the $7.4 billion decline was related to elevated draw repayments. The challenges facing the venture capital industry are having a direct impact on the private market investment landscape, resulting in a difficult exit environment, lower fundraising numbers and fewer deals. New draws on existing lines are muted in April and May, given uncertainty in the industry post March events. However, we did see commitment activity for existing clients pick up in the month of June, as Peter mentioned. Despite industry headwinds, our legacy First Citizens portfolio continued to experience solid growth, including $1.4 billion or 12.6% annualized percent growth in the General Bank and $749 million or 10.5% annualized growth in the commercial bank. Page 25 shows our loan composition by type and segment for your reference. Page 26 shows the deposits increased by $1.1 billion or 3.2% on an annualized basis from the linked quarter. We experienced $10.4 billion in growth in the direct bank, partially offset by a decline in SVB deposits. We have worked diligently to leverage the direct bank channel to increase balances to help fund loan growth in the general and commercial bank segments and to support legacy SVB. We do anticipate continued deposit growth in the direct bank through the end of 2023, albeit at a slower pace. While this channel is higher cost compared to the traditional branch network, enabled us to reduce more expensive FHLB borrowings by approximately $6.1 billion during the second quarter. Importantly, while SVB deposits declined $8.4 billion sequentially, the majority of this occurred in April. As Peter noted, we have worked to stabilize the franchise by performing outreach to key innovation economy partners and detailed market analysis to understand misconception so we can more quickly and effectively address them. We have also worked hard to keep client-facing team members and see and in front of our clients. As a result of these efforts, we have not seen a material change in deposit balances since we last reported, with SVB deposits remaining approximately $41 billion as of June 30. Our cost of deposits increased by 44 basis points during the quarter to 1.68%. The increase is representative of the impacts from the Fed rate hikes and our need to raise rates to stay competitive with our peers. The deposit composition by type, segment and insured uninsured breakdown are shown on Page 27. On Page 28, our balance sheet continues to be funded predominantly by deposits. We made progress this quarter rightsizing this as deposits increased to 78% of total funding, up from 75% last quarter. The FHLB borrowings we initiated in previous quarters had call features and we decreased those borrowings by approximately $6 billion this quarter, which is reflective of the deposit growth I just spoke to. Over the medium to long term, we plan to continue to drive the non-deposit concentration metrics lower by focusing on core deposit growth. On Page 29, credit quality metrics continued to normalize. Net charge-offs totaled $157 million or 47 basis points for the quarter, up from $50 million or 27 basis points in the first quarter. The increase in charge-offs were primarily the result of $97 million in net charge-offs in the SVB segment, $85 million of which were reserved for at the acquisition date. In the general and Commercial Bank segments, net charge-offs were fairly consistent with prior quarters with most occurring in the large office real estate and small ticket equipment leasing portfolio. We guided to a net charge-off range of 35 to 45 basis points on our last call as we identified a few large innovation credits that would be and were charged off during the quarter. While we do expect some continued stress in the innovation portfolio, given the depressed levels of market funding, we don't expect quarterly charge-offs to remain at these levels. However, some of these loans are large and the charge-offs can be lumpy. Moving to the bottom of the page, the nonaccrual loan ratio increased 10 basis points from the sequential quarter to 0.7%. The increase was primarily concentrated in real estate finance within the Commercial Bank segment. This is where our largest general office exposure is, which continues to be impacted by remote work dynamics, elevated interest rates, vacancy rates, lease rates, capital requirements and near-term maturities. Our allowance ratio increased by 7 basis points to 1.23% during the quarter. Page 30 provides a roll forward of our ACL from the linked quarter. The largest driver of the increase in the ACL was deterioration in macroeconomic forecasts related to declining CRE index values in both the baseline and downside scenarios. Other factors such as portfolio mix and credit quality also contributed to increases in reserves but on a much smaller scale. These increases were partially offset by lower loan balances in the SVB segment and adjustments to fair value discounts on loans acquired from SVB. As depicted on the bottom left-hand corner, the ACL provides 2.6x coverage of annualized quarterly net charge-offs and covered nonaccrual loans 1.8x. On Pages 31 and 32, we highlight our total nonowner-occupied CRE exposure which was 12.8% of total loans at quarter end with general office loans totaling $2.8 billion or 2.1% of total loans. Page 32 includes information on the general office portfolio, which is well diversified geographically with limited exposure to some of the hardest hit markets including San Francisco, Chicago and New York, which on a combined basis totaled $403 million or 14% of the total general office portfolio. As we shared on our last call of the $2.8 billion in general office loans, the most significant credit risk is in our commercial bank, which had general office loans totaling $1.1 billion at the end of the quarter representing less than 1% of total loans. This portfolio consists primarily of Class B repositioned and bridge loans and is where we have seen deterioration in past dues, criticized assets and charge-offs. We are carrying an ACL on those loans of 9.02% compared to an ACL on the overall general office portfolio of 4.44%. Reserves on both of these portfolios increased over the prior quarter due to increased specific reserves as well as deterioration in the CECL macro forecast. Most of the remaining general office exposure is in the general bank. This portfolio is more granular in nature from the smaller average loan size and some level of guarantor support or strong credit tenants under long-term leases. We have not seen material deterioration in this portfolio to date. On Page 33, our capital position remains strong with all ratios above or in the upper end of our target ranges. At the end of the second quarter, our CET1 ratio was 13.38%, and our total risk-based capital ratio was 15.84%. The 85 basis points increase in our CET1 ratio was primarily the result of continued net income growth. Before I discuss our outlook, Page 34 demonstrates that we continue to operate with a strong balance sheet and solid capital, liquidity and credit quality positions. I'll conclude with our 2023 outlook on Page 36. The second column lists our second quarter 2023 results for each metric. The numbers for noninterest income and expense are adjusted for notable items. Column 3 provides our guidance for the third quarter of 2023 and column 4 for the full year. Moving to loans. We expect that loans will remain essentially flat to the second quarter in the balances. We anticipate further declines in the global fund banking business from lower levels of venture capital investments, lower capital deployment and higher interest rates as well as the lagged impact of being out of the market for the early months of 2023. We do see flat to modest declines in our tech and life sciences business as market activity continues to be depressed. As a result, we expect SVB loan balances to be in the mid-$50 billion range by year-end down from $59 billion at the end of the second quarter. The declines in GFB will be largely offset by mid-single-digit percentage growth in the general commercial banking segment as we expect continued momentum in our branch network, industry verticals, middle market and equipment finance lines of business. Moving to deposits. We expect a low single-digit percentage decline. While we're encouraged by the stabilization of SVB deposits since April, we anticipate that SVB clients will continue to experience a level of cash burn that exceeds funds sourced from fundraising. It's worth noting that we expect broader market VC funding to remain subdued in the range of $30 billion to $40 billion per quarter for the remainder of 2023, which is significantly down from prior years. Consequently, we're projecting a $4 billion to $6 billion decline in the SVB deposit book through the end of the year. That said, we are laser-focused on actively partnering with our existing portfolio of clients and the SVB team is working diligently to obtain and win back balances, which we believe will partially offset some of this natural runoff. We are expecting the SVB decline to be partially offset by a $3 billion increase in direct bank deposits. Moving to interest rates. Our forecast follows the implied forward curve. We forecast that the Fed funds rate has peaked at 5.5%. From there, we anticipate the effective rate will remain unchanged for the rest of 2023 and into the beginning months of 2024. On to net interest income. While we expect the absolute level of margin and net interest income to remain elevated, we do expect them to begin to decline in the coming quarters compared to the second quarter. This will occur as the pace of accretion moderates, and we see continued pressure on deposit pricing. Accretion income had an approximate 50 basis point impact on our margin in the second quarter and absent the impact of accelerated loan repayments and due to the recognition of accretion on shorter duration loans, we expect this to moderate to the 30 to 35 basis points range in the coming quarters. The impact of lower accretion and higher deposit costs were partially -- will be partially offset by higher loan and investment yields. We anticipate our full-cycle beta increasing to 35% to 40%, up from our previous estimate of 30% to 35%, which is due to rates higher for longer, leading to increased competitive pressure on deposits as well as the sizable increase in our direct bank from what was close to $19 billion at the end of the first quarter to an expected mid-$30 billion range by year-end. We project net interest income in the third quarter in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. At the same time, we are raising full year net interest income to a range of $6.4 billion to $6.6 billion reflecting strong second quarter results as well as the margin dynamics I previously mentioned. On the net charge-offs, we expect third quarter annualized and full year net charge-offs to be in the 35 to 45 basis points range. Despite most of the portfolio performing well, we expect to see charge-offs concentrated in the commercial bank, general office real estate and small equipment leasing spaces. While we do expect some continued losses in the innovation portfolio, given the depressed levels of market funding, we don't expect the quarterly level of charge-offs to remain at second quarter levels. We expect SVB net charge-offs in the range of 30 to 40 basis points in the coming quarters. Given the size of the credits in both the legacy CIT and SVB portfolios, charging off 1 or 2 more large credit than anticipated can have a sizable impact on the overall quarterly net charge-off ratio and can ultimately take us to the higher end of our 35 to 45 basis points range. On to noninterest income. On an adjusted basis, we expect $420 million to $450 million in noninterest income in the third quarter. We were reassured on the level of SVB-related noninterest income in the second quarter and see this total contribution settling in at approximately $140 million to $150 million per quarter or roughly $560 million to $600 million on an annual basis. On an apples-to-apples basis of the SVB businesses that were acquired, this is closer to $300 million per quarter in 2022. So we are expecting the run rate to be slightly less than half of that given client attrition especially in some of the off-balance sheet suite products. With respect to legacy First Citizens, we still have momentum in our wealth and rail businesses. While maintenance expenses are expected to increase in rail, utilization increased to over 98%. And for the past 3 quarters, renewal rates have been at or above 120% of the previous quarter's rate. Moving to noninterest expense. We do not include expected acquisition expenses related to SVB estimated at $650 million with approximately 60% recognized in '23 and the remainder in '24. So approximately $380 million this year. For the remainder of 2023, we anticipate adjusted noninterest expense will move lower to the $1.15 billion to $1.2 billion range per quarter as we further recognize cost saves. We do expect a onetime $30 million FDIC assessment to be recognized in the third quarter. This expense will be considered notable and is not included in our adjusted noninterest income forecast -- expense forecast, sorry. We made meaningful progress on our path to achieving cost saves in the range of $650 million to $780 million by the end of '24 and pushed slightly ahead of the schedule this quarter primarily due to efficiency reductions in the back office. At this juncture, we expect to have taken over $400 million out of the expense run rate by the end of 2023, putting us slightly above 50% of the high end of our cost synergies estimate. As a reminder, most of the synergies will be driven by consolidation of redundant or duplicate back-office processes and systems as we remain focused on supporting the existing front lines of business and their clients. Moving forward, we expect to maintain our efficiency ratio in the low 50s, slightly higher than the second quarter as lower margin was partially offset by continued recognition of cost saves. On the income taxes, we expect our corporate tax rate to be in the 26.5% to 27.5% range, in line with our previous update as our revenue distribution is heavily weighted to higher tax jurisdictions such as California and New York, and our pre-existing tax benefits are spread amongst a higher -- amongst a larger pretax income base. As for 2023 EPS, we previously guided to an adjusted range of $150 to $161 per share. The range was derived from GAAP earnings but subtracted out the after-tax onetime impacts of the SVB acquisition including the preliminary bargain purchase gain, the day 2 CECL adjustment and estimated SVB-related acquisition expenses. Based upon our updated forecast, we would guide to a new adjusted range of $156 to $167 per share. The change from prior guidance is primarily related to higher net interest income projection given the absolute rate environment, partially offset by higher provision expense. Expenses are also slightly favorable to our previous forecast as we put slightly ahead on merger synergies. This forecast excludes the preliminary bargain purchase gain, the day 2 CECL impact and the expected $30 million FDIC assessment as well as approximately $380 million of expected acquisition expenses in 2023. To conclude, we are excited about our future prospects and believe that we are well positioned to continue delivering long-term value to our shareholders, clients, customers, associates and communities. With that, I will turn it over to the operator for instructions for the question-and-answer portion of the call. That's a correct assumption. We will be submitting a capital plan next year, and we will consider the potential impacts of these regulatory changes on our capital ratios. But we'll certainly be considering a share repurchase plan in that capital plan. But we would not resume repurchases in '23. We would anticipate all things go well that will resume in '24. Yes. Brady, we are burning those over a 3-year period, which really approximates the life of the loans that are subject to loss share. So in our capital projections, we had it burning off straight line over 3 years. We're expecting it to drop to $160 million range in the third quarter and the $150 million range in the fourth. Yes, it was an internal decision. Yes. We really don't have any significant gaps. We have identified gaps, but they're not things that we can't overcome. So I think we are well on our way to meeting the requirements of the category 4 bank, and our risk management program meets the expectation for a large bank program and it is prepared to expand it to include the SVB businesses. So we feel like we're in really good shape there. Well, if you look at just the PPR in general, as you start with net interest income, it's really the impact of that lower accretion going forward. So the headline margin will decline, although ex accretion, we still are seeing some within earning assets. So that's the most significant factor. We are guiding slightly down from the second quarter on noninterest income, and that's really FX fees and down due to lower global fund banking business and some off-balance sheet decline -- management fees for declines in off-balance sheet funds managed. Those 2 things are pretty much the factor there, lower PPNR. But we're really pleased where that's going to -- where we're going to turn out from a PPNR standpoint and a net income standpoint in the next 2 quarters. We don't really believe that a loan-to-deposit ratio of 95% higher is sustainable. So where we would target that would be sort of in the mid-80s, if I had to put a number on it. When you look at sort of our earnings asset mix we like where the percentage of loans is to earning assets. So it's really focusing in on the right-hand side of the balance sheet and replacing borrowings to core deposit growth. So that would be our goal. But right now, loans sitting at around 69% of earning assets is right where we like it. In fact, we get to be 70% to 74%. In conjunction though with an 85% loan-to-deposit ratio. Well, on the rate cycle turns, I think you're right. I mean, we entered the quarter 39% noninterest-bearing, we exited at 32%. I mean ultimately, in normal business cycle, we like to see our noninterest-bearing around 40%. So where it was coming into this transaction is a good spot for us. And then beyond that, we like to see core checking around 65%, which includes now accounts and noninterest bearing. And right now, we're around 50%, and that's totally due to the rate environment. So we see that optimizing as the interest rate environment moderates going forward. It's around 20% of our deposit base, the branch network remains overwhelmingly largest concentration around 40%. We do see those deposits as core. Obviously, they're a little bit more expensive, but they are at the margin, less expensive than FHLB borrowings. So -- and 91% of those deposits are insured. So we view those as core deposits, but acknowledge they're more expensive than branch network deposits. That sounds reasonable. Yes. It's multiple years and it sort of tethered to this note with the FDIC. So I would put it out 3 to 4 years to get that ratio into that range. Well, in '24, if you look at the forward curve, there's 5 rate cuts projected next year, given our asset sensitivity, we would have both declining net interest income in absolute dollars and in margin if that was to occur, although I think our margin will be very respectable compared to peers even in that environment. But I would work off of the $1.8 billion to $1.9 base and then consider what 5 rate cuts might do on the back half of '24. Yes, I think we would exceed it. Are you speaking with respect to SVB or just in general? We have retention and severance payments promised in terms of our merger costs that I just mentioned. So we do have retention. Peter, I think you're doing -- I think we're doing a great job keeping our revenue producing bankers in place. So all of that sort of accrued and ends up in the run rate. So like we're doing really well with retention. It was fairly stable. It declined like $12 million to $15 million range. The expenses are baked in. We have the resources, although we're constantly hiring talent. So the numbers we talk about in terms of run rate include heightened expenses to meet the regulatory standards. So '24, we have to submit a capital plan to the Fed. So we're subject to the capital plan rules. '25, we become CCAR -- a CCAR bank, but given our category 4 size, we will not submit CCAR until 2026. It's -- Robert's telling me, it's $64 billion. The first loss tranche is $5 billion and we don't anticipate losses nearing that. So we don't anticipate reimbursements from the FDIC for charge offs. In terms of our charge-offs, yes. We didn't decompose the $11 million delta. So the SVB charge offs were $96 million, we reserved for $85 million. The other $11 million would be in the general reserve. $45 million was a large single charge-off. But we had $85 million reserved against the -- the $97 million that charged off during the quarter. Are you talking SVB? The noninterest -- so I don't have that information sitting in front of me. But in terms of noninterest-bearing, we started at $35 billion on SVB. And at the end of the quarter, we were at $21 billion. I'm looking it up. Well right now. We were -- our cost of deposits at the end of the second quarter was 1.68%. The balances we included in the presentation, so I'm flipping to those, off-balance sheet client funds came in at $88 billion, and ended the quarter at $70 billion. Did you say 650? I think it's about [400] for the year. Yes. We don't have any plan to do that."

            "name": "Peter Bristow",
            "content": "Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Page 8, I want to reiterate what Frank said. I'm incredibly proud of the progress we have made in integrating SVB and reestablishing it as an undisputed leader in the innovation economy. Our team has done tremendous work on that front. I won't cover all the details outlined on this slide as many of the points echo comments Frank just made. But I do want to provide concrete examples on the progress we are making. Our bankers have reached out to a considerable number of clients over the past few months, and we are encouraged by the success we are seeing in reestablishing relationships with the clients who left in March. To support this effort, we've initiated a comprehensive outreach campaign to touch each of our approximately 30,000 clients. We've also embarked on a major print web campaign including full pages in the Wall Street Journal and New York Times to reinforce to our clients that we're fully committed to the innovation economy and ready to serve their needs with tailored product offerings. I want to highlight some numbers that demonstrate the success we've seen so far. We have approximately 1,500 clients whose funds dipped below 10% of their March 8 amount who have recommitted and now have some portion of their funds back at SVB. We also now have over 90% of our core borrowers, either meeting deposit requirements or working in good faith with us to meet them. These sales efforts have been noticeable on the balance sheet. Our deposits have largely remained steady since the end of April, maintaining in the $40 billion to $41 billion range despite the limited fundraising activity in the broader venture capital market and our clients' ongoing cash burn. And while our loan balances have declined, this is primarily related to the short-term nature of our global funds banking portfolio, which is down given reduced broader market activity as well as the lagged effect of being out of the market for a few months in early 2023. We are encouraged by the robust pipelines in this business, and we are back in the market for new production. While we see challenges in the broader market for the remainder of 2023, as venture capital investment is below the levels of the past few years. We are well poised to capture client funds once investment levels begin to increase likely in late 2024 and into 2025. Despite competitors who are actively entering the innovation space, competitive advantages, including our long-standing client relationships and our breadth and depth of offerings continue to differentiate us. Importantly, we are hearing positive client feedback around our reinforcement of SVB stability now backed by the strength of First Citizens and our unique tailored offering that our clients have come to know and love. Clients are eager to learn more about the vision for the First Citizens and SVB partnership. We also remain excited about the opportunities that SVB products and services provide for our legacy First Citizens clients and we believe there are opportunities to expand deposit and suite products to our CIT commercial clients. Complementing our early success in the SVB integration are our team's efforts in the broader commercial banking business. where strong momentum continued in the second quarter. The lending portfolio led by industry verticals in our Commercial Finance Group grew by $901 million to $13.8 billion with strong performance across the portfolio, including healthcare, tech media and telecom, energy and maritime, just to name a few. We were also pleased to welcome Jim Hudak back as the President of the Commercial Finance Group. Jim brings more than 20 years as a commercial finance executive including overseeing CIT's commercial finance business for over a decade. We are confident his leadership, insights and expertise will be invaluable as we continue to grow our commercial portfolio. We also continue to see strong performance in our middle market banking organization as we explore attractive market opportunities. And our rail business delivered another strong quarter with utilization remaining above 98%. And finally, on the wealth side, we are planning to leverage SVB's strong wealth footprint in the Northeast and California to expand our wealth coverage, building on our strong business and commercial relationships in Southern California and expanding services for our existing legacy CIT clients in the Northeast. On Page 9, we show the deposit and loan trends for the SVB segment starting on March 27 through June 30. Notably, we have not seen material declines in legacy SVB deposits since our first quarter disclosure using April 30 data. This is in spite of venture investment remaining subdued and more aligned with 2018/2019 levels. The stabilization that we've seen in our deposit balances is a testament to the client outreach and effort the team has put in to reassure them that despite the turmoil in March, SVB is not going anywhere and is more secure than ever. It also demonstrates that SVB's unique value proposition remains attractive to clients. Moving on to loans. As we noted on our first quarter call, we anticipated a drag on loan growth given more subdued lending activity in the innovation economy. The primary driver of the decline in our loans this quarter was a $6.8 billion reduction in Global Fund Banking, which was expected. Global Fund Banking has historically been one of the primary drivers of growth at SVB. However, starting in 2022 with what has been called the great reset, the pace of venture capital activity slowed considerably. Consequently, these venture capital firms are investing less, which reduces their needs to use our capital co-lending facilities. Now midway through 2023, private equity and venture capital investors faced a dynamic environment because of various macroeconomic factors, many of which are carryovers from 2022. Some such as inflation and a depressed public market appear to be resolving. Others, however, are persistent, such as high interest rates and low initial public offering activity. These challenges are having a direct impact on the private market investment landscape, resulting in a difficult exit environment, lower fundraising numbers and fewer deals. Nevertheless, we are continuing to focus on the areas we can control and believe that the rest will follow. We continue to focus on client engagement as we remain patient and continue to be there for our clients. And we believe in the fullness of time, we will successfully win back additional deposits and loans as clients restore faith and trust in the business and of course, us. Turning to Page 10. We provide additional information on SVB trends in terms of assets, all balance sheet client funds and assets under management. I won't spend much time on this today, but I wanted to provide this to you for reference. In closing, it's clear that there are a lot of opportunities for the combined company. I want to echo Frank's appreciation for all of our associates. Your continued dedication has put us in a strong position to continue growing the business, enhancing relationships and delivering best-in-class solutions and services to our clients. With that, I'll turn it over to Craig Nix. This is Peter. Again, this is sort of what I talked about, the overall sort of reflection of what's going on in the space in terms of venture capital investment. You're not seeing a lot of inflows there. We are -- the fact that we have the [60 or 70] of off balance sheet has been fairly consistent -- and I think it's a really good reflection of the fact that a lot of those clients are still here and still choosing us for their business. They're just moving more off balance sheet as opposed to end of the bank. So to me, it's a sign of strength."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce the host of this conference call, Ms. Deanna Hart, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nDeanna Hart: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our first quarter earnings call. Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Frank Holding; our President, Peter Bristow; and our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Nix will provide an update on the FCB acquisition, our first quarter and 2023 outlook. During the call, we will be referencing our investor presentation which you can find on our website. Our comments will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. We assume no obligation to update such statements. These risks are outlined for your review on Page 3. We will also be referencing non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures against the most directly comparable GAAP measures are found in Section 8 of the presentation. First Citizens is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by a third party. I will now turn it over to Frank.\nFrank Holding: Thank you, Deanna, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Page 5. We announced another quarter of solid financial results. As you know, we're our TBV focus company and we're pleased that the acquisition of SVB resulted in 112% TBV accretion on the acquisition date and 106% after the CECL adjustments. This transaction meaningfully boosted our capital base providing us with an even more solid foundation to continue growing profitably while delivering long-term value to our shareholders. Since the acquisition, we have had meaningful engagement with key SVB leaders and clients reinforcing that FCB and SVB have commonalities that guide us including deep commitments to our clients and people and to the communities we serve. The CIT merger included many unique businesses and we have successfully integrated those into our business model. So we are confident with this recent experience that we'll be able to -- they will enable us to incorporate SVB as well. We've long believed that direct communications with our clients and associates are essential. And to that end, I'd like to briefly touch on some recent departures that have been reported. As with any combination of discounts, some level of associate turnover in deposit and client churn is expected. However, we are confident that SVB has one of the deepest and most experienced benches of any financial institution serving the innovation economy. And we're committed to maintaining and growing SVB's market by leveraging this deep seeded talent and strength as we move forward. Importantly, the combined organization is very well-positioned financially and is operating from a position of strength, in addition to significant TBV accretion, our liquidity remains strong driven by our conservative asset-liability management, and was enhanced by this transaction with the creation of on-balance sheet funding and access to significant contingency funding. Turning to legacy First Citizens performance. We delivered another quarter of deposit and loan growth as positive momentum continued across all lines of business. The strong quality loan growth we've experienced this quarter in tandem with the positive asset repricing that we experienced throughout 2022 helped generate favorable operating leverage year-over-year. We, like most companies, faced some economic headwinds including the increasing possibility of recession, however, we have not seen meaningful increases of stress in our credit portfolio. Overall, we remain encouraged by the resiliency of our clients in the face of elevated inflation and rising interest rates and we look forward to continuing to support them. Turning to Page 6. We remain focused on the long-term sustainable shareholder value driven by our core strategic priorities which haven't changed other than the addition of a new strategic priority related to the acquisition of SVB. Long-term benefits can be achieved by harnessing SVB's legacy businesses and leveraging these to attract and retain new clients to our franchise. SVB continues to support its clients day in and day out. In fact, several clients recently announced new deals with SVB, that are supporting the growth of their businesses. In addition, SVB's premium line division currently has all-time high loan outstandings, SVB's Community Development Finance Group closed its largest-ever affordable housing facility and this week is celebrating the grand opening as the lead construction lender of new housing in San Francisco for formally unhoused military veterans. To successfully integrate SVB, we are focused on the following: the first, running SVB as SVB to maintain a competitive advantage it has in the innovation economy, while at the same time, infusing the cost discipline and risk management that is defined First Citizens for 125 years; secondly, continuing our high-touch approach, demonstrating the legacy SVB clients that we're committed to helping their businesses succeed; third, embracing our SVB colleagues to create synergies, then enhance our client relationships and further drive the innovation of our products and services; and lastly, continue to articulate our vision with SVB associates to proactively retain key revenue-generating employees and the staff to support them. While we are clearly in the early days of SVB acquisition, we already have begun to integrate our teams and we continue to actively prioritize our efforts to support SVB and its clients. As a combined team, we remain committed to our long-term strategic focus, our relationship client-focused model, delivering solid results while operating with strong liquidity, and capital positions, and effectively managing risk within our defined risk appetite. I would like to close my comments by recognizing all our associates at FCB and SVB for coming together over the past month to move us forward as a combined company. We still have work to do, but your hard work provides us the real opportunity to unlock the strategic and financial value of this partnership. And I'll turn it over now to our President, Peter Bristow to further discuss areas of focus on the SVB acquisition. Peter?\nPeter Bristow: Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. On Page 8, I want to touch on the potential growth opportunities the SVB combination unlocks for First Citizens. With the addition of approximately $100 million in total assets, SVB adds meaningful financial scale to First Citizens. While we did experience some level of deposit outflows since the acquisition day, about half of which was expected on day one. We have begun to see some signs of stabilization. This acquisition builds on First Citizens' solid foundation by adding significant scale, geographic diversity, exceptional talent, and most importantly valuable solutions for clients throughout their financial life cycle. First, the addition of SVB meaningfully advances our presence in the innovation and technology sectors. SVB's historic leadership position in these sectors and serves First Citizens is better positioned to serve venture-backed companies and tech start-ups in our backyard and across the nation. Second, it opens new business opportunities while driving incremental topline growth. By leveraging the existing offerings of First Citizens and SVB, we can better serve our combined client base. Third SVB Private has enormous potential to accelerate the growth of our wealth business, adding new digital capabilities, talent, and solutions to our already-growing franchise. Fourth, SVB increases our presence in attractive, high-growth markets on the West Coast and in the Northeast, positioning us to capture new clients while diversifying our footprint. Finally, as Frank mentioned, this acquisition is compelling financially both immediately and in the long term. On Page 9 we dive deeper into the entities we acquired, the SVB Commercial and Private banks. The Commercial arm of SVB is the banking leader in the innovation economy with a powerful network of relationships across entrepreneurs, investors, and influencers. Their focus on technology, life sciences, and healthcare and Global Fund Banking combined with their best-in-class model for delivering to those clients truly sets them apart from the rest of the industry. SVB provides tailored commercial banking solutions to clients at every life stage from start-up and early-stage companies to venture-backed growth companies on up to large corporate entities. These solutions include business banking, treasury services, card, digital banking, FX, liquidity management, and venture debt through the various stages as well as a comprehensive package of banking products to support venture capital and PE fund clients. SVB Private is an established wealth advisory franchise with private banking solutions tailored to the needs of innovation clients. SVB serves these clients both professionally and personally. SVB's private wealth capabilities include lending solutions to address equity compensation, concentrated stock positions, and non-liquid assets. SVB Private also works with premium line producers to provide working capital and vendor loans. I'm not going to cover Page 10 in detail, but we have included it for your reference to provide a snapshot of all of First Citizens Bank business segments along with on and off-balance sheet financial data as of March 31, 2023. Turning to Page 11. While we are in the early stages, our integration efforts are underway. Our approach is to seek out the best minds and most experienced people who can develop our go-forward business model. We are formalizing integration plans that we will share in the future. Meanwhile, we are diligently working to address our immediate priorities and goals which include: first, maintaining our position as a key partner in the innovation economy. We are committed to continuing to help innovators enterprises and investors move bold ideas forward. Despite the recent turmoil, we believe there are long-term secular tailwinds supporting the technology and healthcare sectors that will continue to drive future growth. Second, supporting clients and working to regain trust. Our goal is to maintain seamless functionality that SVB clients are accustomed to and have come to expect. We have already met with many key clients to hold initial discussions around the transition and reinforce our commitment to them. We plan to continue that communication and ensure that feedback can be received quickly and effectively to address. Third, retaining key revenue generating talent and staff to support them. One of the most important priorities has been the retention of key SVB talent. We have provided a budget for a meaningful amount of retention to retain this key talent. As Frank mentioned, we have had some attrition since this acquisition date. However, we have been pleased that our succession plans, internal talent pools, and external recruiting resources have allowed us to backfill key positions. On Page 12, we showed the composition of our loan portfolio at quarter end including the impact of the SVB acquisition. The transaction provides diversification across our loan portfolio. In this way, legacy SVB's commercially focused portfolio complements First Citizens' client strategy by bringing on strong private equity and venture capital relationships. Moving to Page 13. We provide an overview of the legacy SVB credit portfolios and they are divided into risk categories. The acquired portfolio has a low loss history which aligns well with First Citizens' credit culture and risk management strategy. As you can see, approximately 70% of SVB loans fall into the low-credit risk portfolios, including Global Fund Banking and the Private Bank. We will continue to manage these portfolios prudently and effectively while maintaining consistent and strong underwriting standards. The efforts already executed by the legacy SVB team in this area have positioned the bank well from a credit quality standpoint. On Page 14, we show our deposit composition at quarter-end, including the impact of the SVB acquisition. One of the most immediate benefits of the shift in deposit mix at 62% of SVB deposits are noninterest-bearing, bringing the consolidated noninterest-bearing ratio to 39% up 11% from what we reported in the fourth quarter. Further, the transaction provides a more geographically diverse deposit base, which we believe will help position us to compete in the current deposit rate environment by growing our core deposit base. We continue to focus on client outreach and I believe that some of the legacy SVB clients will move business that left back to us as depositors realizes their deposits are safe with First Citizens. In the meantime, we've successfully been leveraging our nationwide digital direct bank to quickly add balances to competitive product offerings. I will now turn it over to Craig Nix to discuss the preliminary purchase accounting and our first quarter financial results. Craig?\nCraig Nix: Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Page 17 provides a view of the acquired balance sheet prior and post purchase accounting impacts. After preliminary purchase accounting, we acquired approximately $107 billion in assets comprised of $35 billion in cash and $71 billion in loans. We have seen $56 billion in deposits and $35 billion in borrowings. The FDIC received a value appreciation instrument payable in cash of up to $500 million. On March 28, FDIC exercised its option and in April, we pay the FDIC $500 million. Page 18 shows that the acquisition resulted in significant TBV accretion. Starting with the standalone First Citizens tangible book value of $590 per share. Estimated Day 1 accretion was 112% or an increase of $9.6 billion to $1,250 per share. After the impacts of CDI and Day 2 CECL, estimated accretion was 106% or an increase of $9.1 billion to $1,214 per share assuming fully phased-in acquisition cost estimated at $650 million, TBV accretion was 100%. Continuing to Page 19, pre-tax purchase accounting adjustments for $2.8 billion. The most significant adjustment included a 3.9% credit and liquidity mark on loans. After consideration of other adjustments, including $253 million for commitments to lend and $230 million for CDI, the asset discount of $16.45 billion is reduced to $13.6 billion. After recognizing the $500 million paid to the FDIC, we recognized an after-tax gain of $9.8 billion on the acquisition. Our current estimate for the PCD ACL gross up is $200 million and our Day 2 CECL non-PCD provision, it's $462 million. In addition to Day 2 provision, we recorded $254 million in provision expense for commitments to lend, bringing the after-tax of Day 2 provision expense to $536 million. On Page 20, we present the estimated impact of preliminary purchase accounting marks on EPS, NIM, and income statement line items. Please note that the fair value adjustments presented exclude fair value adjustments that will not impact future earnings. The impact of the fair market value adjustments is estimated to be accretive to 2023 EPS by $28.95 and to 2023 NIM by 36 basis points. The Day 2 CECL adjustments for non-PCD loans and reserve for unfunded commitments will have a negative impact on estimated 2023 EPS of $26.97. Page 21 shows that of the $71.3 billion in loans acquired approximately $2.5 billion were determined to be PCD loans. After recording the ACL on PCD loans totaling $200 million, we estimate $2.6 billion of interest income accretion to be recognized over the remaining lives of the loans. The ACL ratio on the acquired SVB loans is 1%, resulting in a combined ACL of $1.6 billion or 1.16% of total loans at March 31, 2023. Next on Page 22, it was especially important to us that post-acquisition, we maintained a fortress balance sheet mark by strong liquidity. So it's on and off balance sheet managed with a low-risk appetite with respect to our investment portfolio, maintaining strong credit quality, and provide appropriate ACL coverage. All capital ratios are above our current target operating ranges, the CET1 at 12.53% when adjusting the CET1 ratio for AOCI unrealized losses on our securities portfolio, it drops to 12.1% and then further adding unrealized losses on the HTM portfolio, it drops to 11.4%. Both of these proforma ratios remain above regulatory well-capitalized limits and our internal target ranges. We have strong on and off-balance sheet liquidity positions totaling $51.4 billion in cash and high-quality liquid securities and $79.5 billion in contingent sources. Total liquidity covered uninsured deposits by 198% as of March 31 and by 219% as of April 30. Although net charge-offs increased in the first quarter, credit performance was strong and we remain well reserved. Now turning to first quarter results, I'm going to anchor my comments to the takeaways on Page 24. In the interest of time, I will not cover pages 25 to 41 in detail but have included them for your reference. We posted another quarter of strong reported and adjusted financial results, reported net income for the quarter was obviously boosted by a gain on acquisition but we were pleased with adjusted net income as well. Adjusted year-over-year PPNR increased by 35%, about 21% without the first quarter impact of SVB. Linked quarter net interest income grew and margin expanded by 5 basis points to 3.41%. Noninterest income held up well increasing over the linked quarter with and without SVB contribution. Our efficiency ratio improved on a year-over-year basis but was up slightly from the linked quarter due to higher seasonal personnel costs and the industry-wide increase in FDIC assessment rate. Overall, we feel good about where we are on expenses. Legacy FCB, loan, and deposit growth was strong during the quarter. Annualized loan and deposit growth was 7.7% and 6.3% respectively. Moving to credit, even though we are seeing an uptick in net charge-offs towards more historic levels, we are pleased with our credit quality and the strength of our clients outside of the general office and small ticket leasing -- equipment leasing, we have not seen new areas of stress in the portfolio. Our nonaccrual ratio declined by 26 basis points with the SVB acquisition and 5 basis points without it. As I mentioned earlier, our capital position remains strong. We are experiencing a burn down of AOCI losses as our securities portfolio matures and rates have come off recent highs. Starting on Page 43, I will highlight our financial areas of focus. First, we are focused on maintaining a solid base of core deposits to fund our balance sheet. General Bank deposits total $86 billion over 60% of our total deposit base consisting primarily by branch network and our nationwide Direct Bank. 80% of these deposits are insured are collateralized and the average account size is $36,000. The deposit noted below the General Bank and our commercial bank from legacy CIT and represents a much smaller portion of our total funding. Corporate segment deposits consist primarily of brokered deposits. SVB deposits of $49.3 billion represented 35% of our deposit base and have an average size of $360,000, 14% of these deposits are insured. Putting it all together 53% of our deposits were insured at March 31, 2023. Continuing to Page 44, we shared weekly deposit trends post-acquisition. On the FCB side, deposits have grown by $2.6 billion primarily in the Direct Bank. On the SVB side, after seeing initial outflows of $7 billion and a $5 billion outflow that was expected at the acquisition date related to a sweep repos product coming back online, deposit balances have begun to stabilize. We are monitoring deposit outflows at SVB closely and we'll continue to use our Direct Bank to offset future outflows of deposits at SVB. Page 45 shows that as of March 31 and April 30, liquidity covered our uninsured deposits by approximately two times. On Pages 46 and 47, we highlight our total CRE exposure which was under 12% of total loans at quarter-end. General office loans totaled $2.8 billion or 2.1% of total loans. Page 47 includes information on the general office portfolio which is well-diversified geographically with limited exposure to some of the hardest-hit markets including San Francisco, Chicago, and New York. As we shared on our last call, of the $2.8 billion in general office loans, our largest area of concern is in our commercial bank with general office loans, totaling $1.3 billion or less than 1% of total loans. This portfolio consists of Class B reposition and bridge loans and is where we are seeing deterioration in the past dues for the criticized assets and charge-offs. We are carrying an ACL on these loans of 5.23% versus an ACL on the overall general office portfolio of 2.67%. The general office loans in the Commercial Bank were originated with strong loan-to-values in the 60% to 65% range. We acknowledge that current market conditions could bring these higher depending on the location and specific property. As these loans approach maturity, we are working with our clients on an individual basis to assess potential concerns and ensure we are addressing them quickly. So while we expect some additional downward migration in this portfolio, we do believe the issues are manageable. Most of the remaining general office exposure is in the General Bank, this portfolio is much more granular in nature with a smaller average loan size, and we have to date, not seeing deterioration. To close the loop on this, we are not originating new loans in this space and are diversifying to other performing property types. On Pages 48 and 49, our investment portfolio strategy is to purchase stable cash flow and securities with act as a source of liquidity and do not take on significant duration risk. This is evidenced by the short duration of our portfolio of approximately 4.2 years. And importantly, extending into only 4.3 years and an up 100 basis points rate shock. 95% of the portfolio is directly or indirectly guaranteed by the U.S. government. Turning to Page 50. We expect to receive 22% of our investment portfolio cash flows over the next seven quarters. Over that same time horizon, we expect a 39% burndown of our investment portfolio-related AOCI losses. On Page 51, our interest rate sensitivity increased during the quarter due to the SVB acquisition. The primary drivers for the fixed rate Purchase Money Note increasing liability duration while variable rate loans and cash acquired shortened asset duration. We are prioritizing the management of liquidity risk and are keeping a larger cash balance as a percentage of assets due to the current uncertainty in the banking environment. The main drivers of our asset sensitivity are our variable rate loan portfolio, which represents approximately 65% of total loans and our cash position of $38 million equating to 20% of earning assets as of March 31, 2023. On Page 52, we provide information on our actual and expected deposit betas. 58% of our deposits exhibit lower betas and 42% exhibit moderate to higher betas. Our cumulative beta through the first quarter was 23% in line with our projection last quarter, we expect cumulative beta to increase to 28% by the end of the second quarter and deposits continue to catch up from recent rate increases. Over the interest rate hiking cycle, we forecast our cumulative beta will be in the 30% to 35% range. Turning to Page 54, I'll conclude with our outlook for the remainder of 2023. While we believe that our projections are achievable and reasonable as we prepared our outlook, we noted several sources of uncertainty surrounding it. Number one, we are a little over a month into the acquisition of SVB. So we still have a lot to digest there. Number two, we assume any recessionary impact will be mild. Number three, the impact of policy changes, including the path of the Fed funds rate and the pace of quantitative easing could impact our projections. And four, the impact of competition and client behavior could drive our deposit betas higher. The first column on the page list our first quarter 2023 results. The numbers for noninterest income and expenses are adjusted for notable items. Column two provides our guidance for the second quarter of 2023 and column three for the full year. On loans, we expect a low single-digit percentage decline in the second quarter as pay down and the Global Fund Banking business from slowed market activity are offset by annualized low to mid-single-digit percentage growth in legacy FCB. We expect the same trend to continue through year-end with the legacy FCB portfolio moderating to approximately $60 billion and legacy FCB achieving mid-single-digit percentage growth. For deposits, we expect a low to mid-single-digit percentage decline in the second quarter, while we are encouraged by the stabilization of SVB deposits since the first week of April, we are projecting an $8 billion decline through the end of the year. With lower absolute levels of funding in the marketplace, we anticipate that SVB clients will continue to experience some level of cash burn. We are expecting that to be offset by $10 billion in growth in our Direct Bank. With respect to SVB deposits and loans, we have engaged in an expansive calling effort to reach out to over 30,000 clients. While it is early, we are seeing initial positive results in the first clients we have contacted. We are cautiously optimistic that we will not see the level of loan or deposit runoff included in our projection. But this will depend on the extent to which clients return for the absolute funding in the marketplace returns. If this happens, we feel there could be upside to our projection. Our interest rate forecast follows the implied forward curve. We forecasted the Fed funds rate has peaked at the 5% to 5.25% range. From there, we anticipate 325 basis points rate cuts in the back half of the year. The SVB acquisition will be accretive, not only to net interest income given the sizable balance sheet but also to net interest margin. We expect an estimated purchase accounting impact to net interest income of $604 million in an accretive impact of NIM of 36 basis points in 2023. While we are not providing 2024 guidance at this time, we do expect the pace of appreciation to moderate in 2024 as detailed previously in the purchase accounting slides. If rate cuts materialize on the back half of the year, we do anticipate net interest income declining from current levels. We anticipate full cycle beta to be 31% up from our previous estimate of 30 -- 25% due primarily to decline in noninterest-bearing deposits as well as volume increases in the more expensive Direct Bank channel. We expect second quarter annualized net charge-offs to be in the 35 basis points to 45 basis points range. The uptick is primarily related to a $45 million charge-off in the SVB portfolio that was fully reserved for a Day 1 purchase accounting. We view that charge-off as idiosyncratic in nature. Absent that charge-off, we would expect net charge-offs to be in the mid-20s annualized. For the full year 2023, we expect net charge-offs in the 25 basis points to 35 point -- basis points range. On an adjusted basis, we expect $430 million to $460 million in noninterest income in the second quarter. We expect legacy SVB to generate close to $130 million to $150 million per quarter on an apples-to-apples basis of the SVB businesses that were acquired. This was closer to $300 million per quarter in 2022. So we are expecting the run rate to be slightly less than half of that given client attrition, especially in some of the off-balance sheet suite products. With respect to legacy First Citizens, we still have momentum in our wealth, merchant, card, and rail businesses. While maintenance expenses are expected to increase in rail, utilization is almost 98% and in the past two quarters renewal rates have been at or above 130% of the previous quarter's rate. Noninterest expense projections do not include expected acquisition expenses related to SVB estimated at $650 million with 50% recognized over the remainder of 2023 and the other half in 2024. We expect noninterest expense in the range of $1.25 billion to $1.3 billion in the second quarter. The SVB pre-merger annual run rate was approximately $2.6 billion for $650 million per quarter. We anticipate 25% to 30% cost synergies to be in the run rate by the end of 2024, equating to $650 million to $780 million. Most of the synergies will be driven by consolidation of redundant or duplicate back office processes in systems as we do remain focused on supporting the existing frontline of business and their clients. On an FCB standalone basis, we expect expenses to be down low single-digit percentage points compared to the first quarter due to elevated seasonal benefits, partially offset by merit increases as well as heightened marketing expenses related to the digital bank. We expect to maintain an efficiency ratio in the mid-50s with upside to the low-50s if rates remain higher for longer. If rates begin to decline as forecasted, we feel comfortable in our ability to maintain it in the mid-50s as decreases in net interest income are offset by recognition of cost synergies. And finally, we expect our corporate tax rate to be in the 26.5% to 27% range, an increase from the previous range of 24.5% to 25%. As our revenue distribution is more heavily weighted to higher tax jurisdictions such as California and our pre-existing tax benefits are spread amongst a larger pre-tax income base. Page 55 shows our EPS forecast for 2023 and significant EPS accretion from the SVB acquisition. The forecast does not include the impact of acquisition expenses. It assumes that 50% to 60% of the cost synergies are in the run rate by the end of 2023. Starting from the left side of the page, we began with FCB's estimated standalone 2023 EPS range of $85 to $90 per share. Moving to the gray bar on the right, the impact of the base combination with SVB prior to cost synergy as $21 -- $27 to $31 per share bringing the range for the base combination EPS to $112 to $121 per share. Continuing to the right, cost synergies in 2023 are estimated to add another $9 to $11 of EPS. Note that if we were to assume estimated fully phased-in cost synergies in this projection that would be accretive to EPS by $33 to $39 per share. The next two gray boxes to the right side of the purchase accounting impacts are accretive to EPS by $31 per share and the amortization of CDI reduces that impact by $2 per share. Actual results could differ materially, particularly with respect to accretion depending on loan prepayments. The $31 per share since loans pay pay-off based on contractual maturities. Thus we ended with an estimated range for EPS between $150 and $161 per share, representing 67% to 89% accretion with fully phased-in cost synergies accretion would be between 93% and 122%. Note that the EPS will includes estimated SVB operating results from the acquisition date through December 31, 2023. And with that, I will turn it back over to Frank for closing comments.\nFrank Holding: Well, now we've thrown a lot at you today. But, I'd like to sort of end with some takeaways, call it, sort of headlines of all the material that we've thrown at you this morning. First of all, the SVB acquisition was a home run financially in terms of immediate TBV accretion and future EPS accretion. Secondly, our fortress balance sheet enabled us to do the SVB deal and we intend to maintain their post-acquisition. Also, SVB clients should take great comfort in our safety and stability and we're hopeful that the recent reduction in runoff and deposit runoff is a sign of their confidence in us. Next, we are committed to SVB strategic approach to the technology and innovation sector and believe that it represents the opportunity for significant upside for First Citizens shareholders. And finally, moving forward, we are positioned to perform well in a broad range of economic scenarios given our capital and liquidity positions, talented associates, focused on our clients and increasingly diverse business mix, and our strong risk management culture. And with that, I will turn it over to the Operator for instructions for the question-and-answer portion of the call.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Stephen Scouten with Piper Sandler. You may proceed.\nStephen Scouten: Hi, good morning. Thanks, everyone. Appreciate all the colors. Frank, like you said, it's a lot, but it's all really positive. So we appreciate all the detail there. I guess one thing maybe I'd be curious about, it's around the migration of that $8 billion in deposit outflows you said you expect through year-end into the $10 billion in the Direct Bank. Kind of how we can think about that from a mix perspective and a cost perspective and how do you think about that longer-term?\nCraig Nix: You're talking about the $8 billion from where we are in May to the end of this year?\nStephen Scouten: Yes. I think you said you expect $8 billion to flow out from SVB and replace it with $10 billion from the Direct Bank, if I heard you correctly.\nCraig Nix: That's correct. And really, it's just it's more related to the nature of the SVB business, and the cash burn that we continue to expect now. If inflows come into the marketplace, we could be being very conservative there, but it's just really a continuation of cash burn throughout the remainder of the year. Elliot, he can provide some of the industrial logic we went through in developing that specific numbers. So we didn't just pull that number out of the air. So, Elliot, why don't you talk about how we built that projection?\nElliot Howard: Yes, absolutely. Few things, as far as cost base is related come embedded in our deposit beta slide there, so we talk about that. And if you look at kind of our offering rates and Direct Bank, really that marginal cost is coming in somewhere kind of a 4.75% type range to the overall Silicon Valley book right now when the kind of a noninterest bearing and interest bearing is around 1.50%, so certainly a delta there that we're replacing that kind of what we've got conservative $8 billion decline in the Silicon Valley book with kind of the incremental on the Direct Bank. As a -- Craig, this is kind of industrial logic. I think we've seen a stabilization here. I think when we look at the amount of -- we kind of new funding capture and absolute levels of that being lower right now in the economy, that's really kind of what's leaving us about $8 billion decline. I think what positive initial steps that we've seen in client outreach, the stabilization we've seen, we are hopeful that's the conservative number and optimism of the upside there.\nStephen Scouten: Okay, extremely helpful. And then..\nPeter Bristow: This is Peter Bristow. Let me make a quick comment about it as well. One of the things that could potentially impact that is, again because of the sort of the lack of transactional volume that's going on in the VC and the PE space that drives balances down in our Global Fund business. So that's sort of -- now as our cash burn continues, we think that -- which we think it well, but that could turn around quickly if there were some sort of change and sort of the tenor and the environment. So that's part of that as well.\nCraig Nix: So, the punch line here is that we could be being conservative as market dynamics change.\nStephen Scouten: Absolutely. Yes. I have no doubt. You are probably on the conservative end of that. So I appreciate that. Okay. I guess, obviously this is massively capital accretive as well as the CET1, you know, well north of your targeted range. I guess kind of two questions around that, one, where do we stand on potential for a buyback announcement later this year? Is anything changed there? And then even though your deposits are stabilizing from Silicon Valley, the market is clearly assuming that there's a lot more outflows to come and there some distressed bank kind of in your footprint, do you think about additional M&A with all your capital or do you kind of digest Silicon Valley and see where you're laying down the road.\nCraig Nix: Well, we always think about M&A but we didn't need to digest SVB as I mentioned in your second question first. But we certainly acknowledge that our capital ratios well above our target ranges right now and we projected that remain elevated in '23 and '24. One thing that everyone needs to keep in mind is that loss share coverage provided about a 2% benefit to all of our risk-based capital ratios. So without loss share, we'd be over our target CET1 range near the top on Tier1 and towards the bottom of total capital, now earnings will replenish those and continue to be growing well-above our target ratios going forward. So as we've stated previously, as part of our capital planning process to assess capital -- assess capital actions including share repurchases, which remain an important part of our toolkit to manage capital. We are currently slated to take a combined capital plan to our Board for approval in late July. And this plan will contemplate all of our capital actions after we have considered the external environment, the behavior, and capital needs of the SVB portfolio as well as the dynamics on risk-weighted assets of share of this loss share. So a lot going on there. So this setting given that our combined capital plan is under construction, it's too early to provide timing of an SRP.\nStephen Scouten: Got it, got it, okay. And then last one for me. is it -- around that $650 million in kind of merger charges you noted and you noted investments to try to retain the people from SVB. Is the cost of attempting to retain and incentivize those employees, is that kind of contained within that $650 million or could that be, I guess, incremental and how do you how do you think about those investments?\nCraig Nix: No, that is 60% of that $650 million is personnel related.\nStephen Scouten: Okay, perfect. Extremely helpful. Thanks so much for the color and congrats on the deal in the quarter.\nCraig Nix: Thank you, Steve.\nOperator: Thank you. Mr. Scouten. The next question comes from Brady Gailey with KBW. You may now proceed.\nBrady Gailey: Thank you. Good morning, guys. So I wanted to start with one more question on the common equity Tier 1. I think in the past you guys have talked about your internally at First Citizens are 9% to 10% target. It feels like the world is kind of changed over the last quarter. So what's the new range like how should we think about where your target is going to be like knowing that AOCI could eventually get embedded in common equity Tier 1. How do you think about that new range?\nCraig Nix: Well, we don't have any plans currently to change it. That obviously will be contemplated in the capital plan. Because, as the ratios set -- sat at the end of the first quarter even including HTM and AOCI losses -- unrealized losses in the ratio. We're over the target range by 1% with HTM and AFS losses and by 2% with just AFS losses included. So at this stage, we don't contemplate change in the range, but obviously, those types of things will be considered in our capital plan. But keep in mind too, the loss share coverage is providing a little bit of a boost to these ratios. So we're going to take all of that into consideration in developing our plan going forward. Tom, do you have any comments to add on that?\nTom Eklund: No. I mean, I think it's important to note that we're building this very similar to how other large banks do it. We go through sort of our internal stress test methodology, look at what potential capital burn to be -- could be, and sort of build up from there. So unless we see a material change in risk profile, we don't expect material changes to our overall capital ranges.\nBrady Gailey: Okay. And then just back to the buyback comment, I know, it's according to your plan and you got to go to the Board. What is your gut telling you? Do you think First Citizens will buy back stock in the back half of the year? I know you did about 1.5 million shares last year. I mean, do you think that's likely?\nCraig Nix: I can't comment on that at this time.\nBrady Gailey: Okay, all right. And then, so the loan-to-deposit ratio, historically it's been pretty low at First Citizens. I know with Silicon Valley, it's up near 100%. Do you work ticket that down overtime and what's the kind of longer-term target for loan deposit ratio?\nCraig Nix: We -- obviously, we don't believe that 100% is sustainable long-term. However, in the short term, given that we took a Purchase Money Note and have the FDIC LOC in place, we have time to get it back in line. Longer-term, Frank and I just talked about this morning. So it's a very relevant question. We'd like to see an eight-handle on the loan-to-deposit ratio. So, that sort of our -- that's sort of where we feel like it should be considering our earning assets, net of cash, et cetera on the balance sheet. So around -- having an eight-handle on this will be more comfortable over the long term.\nBrady Gailey: Okay. And then finally, probably, I know historically First Citizens has been asset-sensitive. Once you layer in Silicon Valley, can you just talk about the sensitivity to interest rates of the new company?\nCraig Nix: Yes, the addition of cash and variable rate loans on the asset side and the Purchase Money Note on the liability side, fairly significantly increased our asset sensitivity. But we are very accepting of a downside risk here, because number one, liquidity is our top priority in the current operating environment. And number two, the cost of hedging to mitigate downside risk makes cost effect -- cost-effective hedging difficult. So for example, if we tried them swap the Purchase Money Note the floating has cost us about 150 basis points. So we're comfortable where we sit. We're also comfortable where our margin lands after rate cuts. So as we sit here right now, we're pretty pleased where we are from an interest rate risk standpoint.\nBrady Gailey: Okay, thanks for the color.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Gailey. The next question comes from the line of Kevin Fitzsimmons with DA Davidson. You may now proceed.\nKevin Fitzsimmons: Hi, good morning, everyone.\nCraig Nix: Good morning.\nKevin Fitzsimmons: Well, was just wondering on Brady's -- just dovetailing on Brady's question there, if we look at the percentage net interest margin, Craig, any way to kind of best described whether you want to talk core ex-purchase accounting all-in versus the -- what was about 3.41% margin in this quarter where we're at a kind of think about the trajectory of that as it's baked into your guidance on NII.\nCraig Nix: Yes. Are you asking with and without accretion?\nKevin Fitzsimmons: I mean, yes, if you can give it both, but maybe all in when accretion like how you see that GAAP margin trending?\nCraig Nix: Got it. I got you. So if you look at -- if you just look at the -- and I'm going to -- when I talk about purchase accounting impact is still some residual impact from CIT out there, but it's fairly immaterial to the impact of the SVB. So if you look at our margin, that the end of the first quarter, we were at 3.41% and that was 14 basis points of our purchase accounting-related. So without it, it was 3.26%. We looked at the margin migrating upward in the second quarter. The 4%, 52 basis points of which is purchase accounting accretion. And then given that we have a rate cut starting in July, we have another one in September, one in December. Margin falls to 3.86% in the third quarter of '23 and then 3.70% in the fourth quarter. So we see a migration down as rates decline, which would be expected given our asset sensitivity, but still feel like the 3.80% margin for the year will be very strong.\nKevin Fitzsimmons: Okay, that - you're hedging that of off the -- you're hedging that off of that 3.26%, Craig? Are you off of the 3.41% going into 4%?\nCraig Nix: I'm taking it off of 3.40%.\nKevin Fitzsimmons: Got it, okay, very helpful. And then on that topic like I know, what the forward curve says. But if we -- I think you kind of alluded to it in your comments that we do have more of a higher for longer environment given the asset sensitivity you spoke up, then there's likely upside sort of that margin projection as well as NII. So is that the way to think of it?\nCraig Nix: Yes, there is. I think for this year..\nKevin Fitzsimmons: The rest perhaps don't happen or is that something else.\nCraig Nix: Yes. I think that's right. I mean, if we don't -- if we didn't get rate cuts this year, I think we'd have a 7 basis points higher margin. Obviously, it takes time for those impacts to fall through. So the impact of '24 will be higher, and about $6 on the EPS. So next year higher for long would be even more significant.\nKevin Fitzsimmons: Okay. One question on deposits, you mentioned the diversity by region that they -- the increased diversity by region, but how do you plan to curb or put guardrails in on the large lumpy deposits, larger customers that was a case that was evident at SVB. How do you -- I know you want a lot of their customers and a lot of their deposits coming in. But how do you prevent that from becoming an issue at the broader persistence?\nCraig Nix: Well, I mean, in terms of our large commercial depositors or large depositors, many of them have long-term relationships with us and when we break that down, some of them for decades. So we stay in touch with them and they know we're strong and stable as Frank mentioned. So, I don't anticipate that we're going to see an outflow there even with what's going on the external environment. We have seen some customers move money into secured suites or interest-bearing accounts for diversification and ease of mind, but it's not been widespread. And this is staying in the front of our customers and having long relationships with them. So we don't really see that as being a big issue for us.\nKevin Fitzsimmons: Okay, And one last one, just on the borrowing, the presence of the borrowing and your FDIC line, are the intentions to keep that in place for the foreseeable future just given the focus on maintaining a liquid fortress balance sheet?\nCraig Nix: We would certainly longer-term shift -- like to shift our funding mix to core deposits, but that's not going to happen rapidly. So what we are envisioning is replacing the Purchase Money Note with some level of long-term debt TLAC-type borrowings. And then a portion being paid off through increases in core deposits over that five-year period. So it would be -- we have a gradual burned down of the Purchase Money Note shifting to other wholesale sources of funding for deposits over time.\nPeter Bristow: No. I think that's all, Craig. I mean, we're really focusing on getting that on. And on the FDIC line that's, therefore, contingency purposes to support the transaction, it's obviously something we'll keep in place here in the intermediate future.\nKevin Fitzsimmons: Okay, thanks very much, guys.\nCraig Nix: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Fitzsimmons. The next question comes from the line of Christopher Marinac with Janney Montgomery Scott. You may now proceed.\nChristopher Marinac: Thanks, good morning, and thank you for all the disclosures today. I wanted to ask about the..\nCraig Nix: Good morning.\nChristopher Marinac: CIT Bank and the online channel. How is that been evolving and how do you see that playing out? Is there a different mix that can contribute therefore impact the funding base going forward?\nTom Eklund: Do you want me to hit it? Yes, I think we mentioned, we're obviously going to use that as a growth channel and continue to add core deposits. Obviously, it comes at a higher marginal cost, like, Elliot discussed earlier, but some of the benefits there is obviously it's a well-diversified deposit portfolio over 90% of it's insured. And it's truly sort of that retail deposit base that we found through this last week sort of I guess it's months now of sort of bank strength has been very stable and sort of a very solid funding source for us. So, plan there is to continue to augment growth with that before the acquisition, the Direct Bank made-up about 18% to 20% of our total deposits. And we sort of see that coming back to that in an aggregate level for the combined company.\nCraig Nix: Yes, we expect -- I think, Tom, we're spending increase by about 22% from that 18 then normalized in 24?\nTom Eklund: Yes. That's right.\nChristopher Marinac: Got it, thank you for that. And then, I just wanted to dig a little bit deeper on the office CRE and all the disclosures there. So the high level of criticized loans in the office, how much of that is your internal rating system just being an abundance of caution versus expectations that there are defaults out there?\nCraig Nix: Andy, can you take that one?\nUnidentified Company Representative: Sure. It is -- we do a deep dive on the portfolio monthly and so it is a combination of we believe our credit ratings are accurate and timely as well as individually evaluating each property type.\nChristopher Marinac: Great. And would you envision that at the same level of office exposure looking out a year or two would be the same? I know it's not high, but just curious if that will incrementally come down as we go forward.\nUnidentified Company Representative: In terms of criticized levels?\nChristopher Marinac: Really just a percentage of the bulk all together if the total loan com compensation?\nUnidentified Company Representative: Sorry, yes, we are not originating any new office. So, I would imagine in terms of absolute dollars in office exposure that would come down.\nChristopher Marinac: Great. And then any other just overall credit trends from the criticized perspective this quarter beyond the office information that you broke out?\nUnidentified Company Representative: As Craig noted, we did see some migration in our equipment finance small ticket leasing portfolio and then some migration in the Commercial Bank, but not much.\nChristopher Marinac: Great, thank you for that clarity. I appreciate the time this morning.\nCraig Nix: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Mr. Marinac. The next question comes from the line of Brody Preston with UBS. You may now proceed.\nBrody Preston: Hi, good morning, everyone.\nCraig Nix: Good morning.\nBrody Preston: Craig, I just wanted to follow up on the expenses. It sounded like the expense base that you're working off of is $2.6 billion for legacy SVB and then 25% to 30% cost savings. I think I heard you correctly you said by the year-end 2024. I guess, could you help us better understand the cadence of the cost savings? Where do you expect the exit run rate on non-interest expense to be for the fourth quarter of '23, and then how much is left for 2024?\nCraig Nix: Yes. We are projecting a range of $650 million to $780 million. So, that's 25% to 30% of the baseline coming into the acquisition and we would expect that of that $650 million and $780 million that roughly half of it would be in the run rate at the end of 2023 and then 100% of it would be in the run rate by the end of 2024.\nBrody Preston: Got it, okay. And could you help me -- could you give us what the loan yields and what the deposit costs were from SVB when they came over?\nCraig Nix: Okay. So one yield for this year, pre-purchase accounting would be 6.02, so that's the '23 projection. It was 5.49 in the first quarter. I mean, it was 6.57 for the first quarter. I'm sorry and, so for the year, it's 6.56 with-- in combined with 6.62, so we're pretty close on yields, First Citizens and SVB there. Deposit cost and I'm talking about interest-bearing -- the cost of interest-bearing deposits if I hand this to -- okay, cost of deposits. I don't have SVB broken out separately. But we were at 1.24 in the first quarter and kind of I think our call SVB like 1.06. So it's very similar to ours, and we have that escalating the 1.59. And 1.69 by the fourth quarter for 1.59 for the year. So, was SVB was flagged..\nBrody Preston: Got it. Okay.\nCraig Nix: So they were accretive to margin and slightly higher than us on loan yield and lower than us on cash deposits.\nBrody Preston: Got it. And do you happen to have what the mix of SVBs deposits were between noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing at April 30, and then with the projected run-off that you have with the mix of those deposits look like going forward?\nCraig Nix: Hold on one second. I think we have that as of March 31.\nFrank Holding: You asked for April 30, we would only talk about March 31.\nBrody Preston: Okay, okay.\nElliot Howard: Brody, this is Elliot Howard. So in kind of our assumptions at March 31 is roughly 62%. We see that kind of migrating down to kind of the mid to low 50s of noninterest-bearing in total.\nBrody Preston: All right, great. That's helpful. And then I did want to ask just on the capital ratios. I understand that from most of them, you're pretty well above your operating range. But I did notice that on the Tier 1 leverage, if you adjust for the day count, you're kind of right in the middle. And so, I did want to ask, just as we think about buybacks going forward. And I understand that you have your capital planning later in July. Which ratio should we view as more constraining from a buyback for - there should we focus on the CET1 or should we should it be all of them? And so -- with Tier 1 leverage play a role there as well?\nCraig Nix: Well, Tier 1 leverage certainly was the one that was -- 9% would be dead middle of our range, right. It's going to migrate up to over 10% and over 11%, '23 and '24, so it's going to be at the top of the range by the end of the year and then well over it. In terms of binding constrain, I'll let Tom talk a little bit about that.\nTom Eklund: What I'll say there too is, it's important to consider as you look at those ratios. You can see that the Tier 1 and total are more constraining than CET1 and that's obviously due to the bargain purchase gain boosting CET1, but no Tier 1 instruments or Tier 2 instruments coming over. As we look at capital planning and looking out into the future, those are obviously things that we will consider not in the short-term with ratios where they are, but add some of these loans roll-off or lost share. We would expect to maybe right size the slope in those ratios a little more through potential future capital raises, if that makes sense with Tier 1 subordinated debt.\nBrody Preston: Okay, great. I'll just try to rattle off a couple more quickly here. I did want to ask, just when we think about the size of the balance sheet now, and this is of couple part question. What spend -- I guess what additional expenses do you need to kind of have now that you're a larger bank? I thinking about it from a regulatory perspective. And then when you think about some of the things that have been stated by the regulators in the wake of some of the bank failures, it feels like some of the tailoring rules might be going away and line in the sand might be getting pushed back to a $100 billion in assets. and so have you contemplated, you know, what your needs will be from a total loss absorbing capacity perspective, TLAC? And then help us think about where you are in being prepared for LCR.\nCraig Nix: Yes. Tom has just briefly mentioned TLAC and capital stack. So we do contemplate if we were subject to those rules that we would expect some mix of preferred sub-debt and senior debt, and right now that range for us is probably somewhere in the $7 billion to $10 billion range with a heavy portion of that in senior debt and the smaller portion preferred stock and sub-debt. But we definitely are monitoring regulatory changes, the capital and liquidity tailoring rule, and areas that impact us. And I think we're going to have more stringent regulatory oversight obviously here and we're ready for that and we'll be prepared for it. I'll let Lorie talk a little bit about our investment in risk management. We think we're well-positioned to absorb SVB within our risk management framework.\nLorie Rupp: Thanks, Craig. What I would say is over the last year, we've built a risk management program as a result of the CIT integration to meet regulatory expectations from a large bank perspective. So that's in place today. And we have begun our alignment of the SVB businesses and processes into that risk management program and we'll expect to fully invest from a technology and a people perspective to ensure our risk management program aligned with our current size and it's scalable for any future growth.\nBrody Preston: Got it. Hi, Craig.\nCraig Nix: I was just going to make a comment on the liquidity side. I mean there's a lot of talk about LCR and liquidity buffers and everything. We believe we're coming in from a position of strength there, obviously, with a lower concentration in investment securities, higher concentration in cash. So we believe we're well-prepared from that perspective.\nBrody Preston: Yes, that's a fair point. I'll ask one more and then leave it -- leave it there. I did just want to ask, just on the loans, on managing the balance sheet. Couple of questions here within this. Could you give us a sense for what the loans from SVB that had run off following the acquisition were? And then within your projections right for 2023 and I know Craig, it will probably be a longer -- a longer-term kind of thing to get back-down to an eight-handle on the loan-to-deposit ratio, but where do you see kind of loan balances, you know, kind of going longer-term? And is there -- are there any portfolios that you've kind of circled as once that more likely have runoff capacity going forward through 2024, just given that the deposit environment is likely to remain challenging for a little bit for the industry.\nCraig Nix: Yes, I'll let Elliott talk about our forecast, but I'll make some broad comments just in terms of this year, we are expecting from the first quarter of this year for the loans that declined by 2% and that's an 8% decline in SVB and a 3% increase in the FCB portfolio. And within FCB, we think that the growth will be broad-based as it has been in the branch network in the industry verticals, but down from first quarter levels as we expect demand has softened the Fed tightening. And as customers become a lot more cautious given the potential for a recession. So we backed off of the current level growth which is 8% annualized in the first quarter. In terms of FCB, we are projecting an 8% decline which would settle loans now about $61 billion, and the expectation there is public and private markets will remain muted for the remainder of '23, as Peter mentioned, there could be some upside if that's not the case and we certainly hope so. And that's my comment. Do you have anything to add to that?\nElliot Howard: Yes, Brody. I would just like kind of add to what Craig said, I think when you look at the largest portion of the Silicon Valley Bank as the Global funds banking. And so that's the part of the -- we expect to decline a little bit here. And that's really a reflection not of kind of losing market share. It's really of the underlying, just market activity. And so that's the Private Bank, pretty stable. I think with taking out care.\nBrody Preston: Got it. Thank you very much for taking all my questions, everyone. I appreciate it.\nCraig Nix: Thank you, Brody.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Preston. I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to our host, Deanna Hart for any closing remarks.\nDeanna Hart: Thank you, everyone, for participating in our call today. We appreciate your ongoing interest in our Company and if you have any further questions or need additional information, please feel free to reach out to the Investor Relations team.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "No. I mean, I think it's important to note that we're building this very similar to how other large banks do it. We go through sort of our internal stress test methodology, look at what potential capital burn to be -- could be, and sort of build up from there. So unless we see a material change in risk profile, we don't expect material changes to our overall capital ranges. Do you want me to hit it? Yes, I think we mentioned, we're obviously going to use that as a growth channel and continue to add core deposits. Obviously, it comes at a higher marginal cost, like, Elliot discussed earlier, but some of the benefits there is obviously it's a well-diversified deposit portfolio over 90% of it's insured. And it's truly sort of that retail deposit base that we found through this last week sort of I guess it's months now of sort of bank strength has been very stable and sort of a very solid funding source for us. So, plan there is to continue to augment growth with that before the acquisition, the Direct Bank made-up about 18% to 20% of our total deposits. And we sort of see that coming back to that in an aggregate level for the combined company. Yes. That's right. What I'll say there too is, it's important to consider as you look at those ratios. You can see that the Tier 1 and total are more constraining than CET1 and that's obviously due to the bargain purchase gain boosting CET1, but no Tier 1 instruments or Tier 2 instruments coming over.

            "name": "Craig Nix",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Page 17 provides a view of the acquired balance sheet prior and post purchase accounting impacts. After preliminary purchase accounting, we acquired approximately $107 billion in assets comprised of $35 billion in cash and $71 billion in loans. We have seen $56 billion in deposits and $35 billion in borrowings. The FDIC received a value appreciation instrument payable in cash of up to $500 million. On March 28, FDIC exercised its option and in April, we pay the FDIC $500 million. Page 18 shows that the acquisition resulted in significant TBV accretion. Starting with the standalone First Citizens tangible book value of $590 per share. Estimated Day 1 accretion was 112% or an increase of $9.6 billion to $1,250 per share. After the impacts of CDI and Day 2 CECL, estimated accretion was 106% or an increase of $9.1 billion to $1,214 per share assuming fully phased-in acquisition cost estimated at $650 million, TBV accretion was 100%. Continuing to Page 19, pre-tax purchase accounting adjustments for $2.8 billion. The most significant adjustment included a 3.9% credit and liquidity mark on loans. After consideration of other adjustments, including $253 million for commitments to lend and $230 million for CDI, the asset discount of $16.45 billion is reduced to $13.6 billion. After recognizing the $500 million paid to the FDIC, we recognized an after-tax gain of $9.8 billion on the acquisition. Our current estimate for the PCD ACL gross up is $200 million and our Day 2 CECL non-PCD provision, it's $462 million. In addition to Day 2 provision, we recorded $254 million in provision expense for commitments to lend, bringing the after-tax of Day 2 provision expense to $536 million. On Page 20, we present the estimated impact of preliminary purchase accounting marks on EPS, NIM, and income statement line items. Please note that the fair value adjustments presented exclude fair value adjustments that will not impact future earnings. The impact of the fair market value adjustments is estimated to be accretive to 2023 EPS by $28.95 and to 2023 NIM by 36 basis points. The Day 2 CECL adjustments for non-PCD loans and reserve for unfunded commitments will have a negative impact on estimated 2023 EPS of $26.97. Page 21 shows that of the $71.3 billion in loans acquired approximately $2.5 billion were determined to be PCD loans. After recording the ACL on PCD loans totaling $200 million, we estimate $2.6 billion of interest income accretion to be recognized over the remaining lives of the loans. The ACL ratio on the acquired SVB loans is 1%, resulting in a combined ACL of $1.6 billion or 1.16% of total loans at March 31, 2023. Next on Page 22, it was especially important to us that post-acquisition, we maintained a fortress balance sheet mark by strong liquidity. So it's on and off balance sheet managed with a low-risk appetite with respect to our investment portfolio, maintaining strong credit quality, and provide appropriate ACL coverage. All capital ratios are above our current target operating ranges, the CET1 at 12.53% when adjusting the CET1 ratio for AOCI unrealized losses on our securities portfolio, it drops to 12.1% and then further adding unrealized losses on the HTM portfolio, it drops to 11.4%. Both of these proforma ratios remain above regulatory well-capitalized limits and our internal target ranges. We have strong on and off-balance sheet liquidity positions totaling $51.4 billion in cash and high-quality liquid securities and $79.5 billion in contingent sources. Total liquidity covered uninsured deposits by 198% as of March 31 and by 219% as of April 30. Although net charge-offs increased in the first quarter, credit performance was strong and we remain well reserved. Now turning to first quarter results, I'm going to anchor my comments to the takeaways on Page 24. In the interest of time, I will not cover pages 25 to 41 in detail but have included them for your reference. We posted another quarter of strong reported and adjusted financial results, reported net income for the quarter was obviously boosted by a gain on acquisition but we were pleased with adjusted net income as well. Adjusted year-over-year PPNR increased by 35%, about 21% without the first quarter impact of SVB. Linked quarter net interest income grew and margin expanded by 5 basis points to 3.41%. Noninterest income held up well increasing over the linked quarter with and without SVB contribution. Our efficiency ratio improved on a year-over-year basis but was up slightly from the linked quarter due to higher seasonal personnel costs and the industry-wide increase in FDIC assessment rate. Overall, we feel good about where we are on expenses. Legacy FCB, loan, and deposit growth was strong during the quarter. Annualized loan and deposit growth was 7.7% and 6.3% respectively. Moving to credit, even though we are seeing an uptick in net charge-offs towards more historic levels, we are pleased with our credit quality and the strength of our clients outside of the general office and small ticket leasing -- equipment leasing, we have not seen new areas of stress in the portfolio. Our nonaccrual ratio declined by 26 basis points with the SVB acquisition and 5 basis points without it. As I mentioned earlier, our capital position remains strong. We are experiencing a burn down of AOCI losses as our securities portfolio matures and rates have come off recent highs. Starting on Page 43, I will highlight our financial areas of focus. First, we are focused on maintaining a solid base of core deposits to fund our balance sheet. General Bank deposits total $86 billion over 60% of our total deposit base consisting primarily by branch network and our nationwide Direct Bank. 80% of these deposits are insured are collateralized and the average account size is $36,000. The deposit noted below the General Bank and our commercial bank from legacy CIT and represents a much smaller portion of our total funding. Corporate segment deposits consist primarily of brokered deposits. SVB deposits of $49.3 billion represented 35% of our deposit base and have an average size of $360,000, 14% of these deposits are insured. Putting it all together 53% of our deposits were insured at March 31, 2023. Continuing to Page 44, we shared weekly deposit trends post-acquisition. On the FCB side, deposits have grown by $2.6 billion primarily in the Direct Bank. On the SVB side, after seeing initial outflows of $7 billion and a $5 billion outflow that was expected at the acquisition date related to a sweep repos product coming back online, deposit balances have begun to stabilize. We are monitoring deposit outflows at SVB closely and we'll continue to use our Direct Bank to offset future outflows of deposits at SVB. Page 45 shows that as of March 31 and April 30, liquidity covered our uninsured deposits by approximately two times. On Pages 46 and 47, we highlight our total CRE exposure which was under 12% of total loans at quarter-end. General office loans totaled $2.8 billion or 2.1% of total loans. Page 47 includes information on the general office portfolio which is well-diversified geographically with limited exposure to some of the hardest-hit markets including San Francisco, Chicago, and New York. As we shared on our last call, of the $2.8 billion in general office loans, our largest area of concern is in our commercial bank with general office loans, totaling $1.3 billion or less than 1% of total loans. This portfolio consists of Class B reposition and bridge loans and is where we are seeing deterioration in the past dues for the criticized assets and charge-offs. We are carrying an ACL on these loans of 5.23% versus an ACL on the overall general office portfolio of 2.67%. The general office loans in the Commercial Bank were originated with strong loan-to-values in the 60% to 65% range. We acknowledge that current market conditions could bring these higher depending on the location and specific property. As these loans approach maturity, we are working with our clients on an individual basis to assess potential concerns and ensure we are addressing them quickly. So while we expect some additional downward migration in this portfolio, we do believe the issues are manageable. Most of the remaining general office exposure is in the General Bank, this portfolio is much more granular in nature with a smaller average loan size, and we have to date, not seeing deterioration. To close the loop on this, we are not originating new loans in this space and are diversifying to other performing property types. On Pages 48 and 49, our investment portfolio strategy is to purchase stable cash flow and securities with act as a source of liquidity and do not take on significant duration risk. This is evidenced by the short duration of our portfolio of approximately 4.2 years. And importantly, extending into only 4.3 years and an up 100 basis points rate shock. 95% of the portfolio is directly or indirectly guaranteed by the U.S. government. Turning to Page 50. We expect to receive 22% of our investment portfolio cash flows over the next seven quarters. Over that same time horizon, we expect a 39% burndown of our investment portfolio-related AOCI losses. On Page 51, our interest rate sensitivity increased during the quarter due to the SVB acquisition. The primary drivers for the fixed rate Purchase Money Note increasing liability duration while variable rate loans and cash acquired shortened asset duration. We are prioritizing the management of liquidity risk and are keeping a larger cash balance as a percentage of assets due to the current uncertainty in the banking environment. The main drivers of our asset sensitivity are our variable rate loan portfolio, which represents approximately 65% of total loans and our cash position of $38 million equating to 20% of earning assets as of March 31, 2023. On Page 52, we provide information on our actual and expected deposit betas. 58% of our deposits exhibit lower betas and 42% exhibit moderate to higher betas. Our cumulative beta through the first quarter was 23% in line with our projection last quarter, we expect cumulative beta to increase to 28% by the end of the second quarter and deposits continue to catch up from recent rate increases. Over the interest rate hiking cycle, we forecast our cumulative beta will be in the 30% to 35% range. Turning to Page 54, I'll conclude with our outlook for the remainder of 2023. While we believe that our projections are achievable and reasonable as we prepared our outlook, we noted several sources of uncertainty surrounding it. Number one, we are a little over a month into the acquisition of SVB. So we still have a lot to digest there. Number two, we assume any recessionary impact will be mild. Number three, the impact of policy changes, including the path of the Fed funds rate and the pace of quantitative easing could impact our projections. And four, the impact of competition and client behavior could drive our deposit betas higher. The first column on the page list our first quarter 2023 results. The numbers for noninterest income and expenses are adjusted for notable items. Column two provides our guidance for the second quarter of 2023 and column three for the full year. On loans, we expect a low single-digit percentage decline in the second quarter as pay down and the Global Fund Banking business from slowed market activity are offset by annualized low to mid-single-digit percentage growth in legacy FCB. We expect the same trend to continue through year-end with the legacy FCB portfolio moderating to approximately $60 billion and legacy FCB achieving mid-single-digit percentage growth. For deposits, we expect a low to mid-single-digit percentage decline in the second quarter, while we are encouraged by the stabilization of SVB deposits since the first week of April, we are projecting an $8 billion decline through the end of the year. With lower absolute levels of funding in the marketplace, we anticipate that SVB clients will continue to experience some level of cash burn. We are expecting that to be offset by $10 billion in growth in our Direct Bank. With respect to SVB deposits and loans, we have engaged in an expansive calling effort to reach out to over 30,000 clients. While it is early, we are seeing initial positive results in the first clients we have contacted. We are cautiously optimistic that we will not see the level of loan or deposit runoff included in our projection. But this will depend on the extent to which clients return for the absolute funding in the marketplace returns. If this happens, we feel there could be upside to our projection. Our interest rate forecast follows the implied forward curve. We forecasted the Fed funds rate has peaked at the 5% to 5.25% range. From there, we anticipate 325 basis points rate cuts in the back half of the year. The SVB acquisition will be accretive, not only to net interest income given the sizable balance sheet but also to net interest margin. We expect an estimated purchase accounting impact to net interest income of $604 million in an accretive impact of NIM of 36 basis points in 2023. While we are not providing 2024 guidance at this time, we do expect the pace of appreciation to moderate in 2024 as detailed previously in the purchase accounting slides. If rate cuts materialize on the back half of the year, we do anticipate net interest income declining from current levels. We anticipate full cycle beta to be 31% up from our previous estimate of 30 -- 25% due primarily to decline in noninterest-bearing deposits as well as volume increases in the more expensive Direct Bank channel. We expect second quarter annualized net charge-offs to be in the 35 basis points to 45 basis points range. The uptick is primarily related to a $45 million charge-off in the SVB portfolio that was fully reserved for a Day 1 purchase accounting. We view that charge-off as idiosyncratic in nature. Absent that charge-off, we would expect net charge-offs to be in the mid-20s annualized. For the full year 2023, we expect net charge-offs in the 25 basis points to 35 point -- basis points range. On an adjusted basis, we expect $430 million to $460 million in noninterest income in the second quarter. We expect legacy SVB to generate close to $130 million to $150 million per quarter on an apples-to-apples basis of the SVB businesses that were acquired. This was closer to $300 million per quarter in 2022. So we are expecting the run rate to be slightly less than half of that given client attrition, especially in some of the off-balance sheet suite products. With respect to legacy First Citizens, we still have momentum in our wealth, merchant, card, and rail businesses. While maintenance expenses are expected to increase in rail, utilization is almost 98% and in the past two quarters renewal rates have been at or above 130% of the previous quarter's rate. Noninterest expense projections do not include expected acquisition expenses related to SVB estimated at $650 million with 50% recognized over the remainder of 2023 and the other half in 2024. We expect noninterest expense in the range of $1.25 billion to $1.3 billion in the second quarter. The SVB pre-merger annual run rate was approximately $2.6 billion for $650 million per quarter. We anticipate 25% to 30% cost synergies to be in the run rate by the end of 2024, equating to $650 million to $780 million. Most of the synergies will be driven by consolidation of redundant or duplicate back office processes in systems as we do remain focused on supporting the existing frontline of business and their clients. On an FCB standalone basis, we expect expenses to be down low single-digit percentage points compared to the first quarter due to elevated seasonal benefits, partially offset by merit increases as well as heightened marketing expenses related to the digital bank. We expect to maintain an efficiency ratio in the mid-50s with upside to the low-50s if rates remain higher for longer. If rates begin to decline as forecasted, we feel comfortable in our ability to maintain it in the mid-50s as decreases in net interest income are offset by recognition of cost synergies. And finally, we expect our corporate tax rate to be in the 26.5% to 27% range, an increase from the previous range of 24.5% to 25%. As our revenue distribution is more heavily weighted to higher tax jurisdictions such as California and our pre-existing tax benefits are spread amongst a larger pre-tax income base. Page 55 shows our EPS forecast for 2023 and significant EPS accretion from the SVB acquisition. The forecast does not include the impact of acquisition expenses. It assumes that 50% to 60% of the cost synergies are in the run rate by the end of 2023. Starting from the left side of the page, we began with FCB's estimated standalone 2023 EPS range of $85 to $90 per share. Moving to the gray bar on the right, the impact of the base combination with SVB prior to cost synergy as $21 -- $27 to $31 per share bringing the range for the base combination EPS to $112 to $121 per share. Continuing to the right, cost synergies in 2023 are estimated to add another $9 to $11 of EPS. Note that if we were to assume estimated fully phased-in cost synergies in this projection that would be accretive to EPS by $33 to $39 per share. The next two gray boxes to the right side of the purchase accounting impacts are accretive to EPS by $31 per share and the amortization of CDI reduces that impact by $2 per share. Actual results could differ materially, particularly with respect to accretion depending on loan prepayments. The $31 per share since loans pay pay-off based on contractual maturities. Thus we ended with an estimated range for EPS between $150 and $161 per share, representing 67% to 89% accretion with fully phased-in cost synergies accretion would be between 93% and 122%. Note that the EPS will includes estimated SVB operating results from the acquisition date through December 31, 2023. And with that, I will turn it back over to Frank for closing comments. You're talking about the $8 billion from where we are in May to the end of this year? That's correct. And really, it's just it's more related to the nature of the SVB business, and the cash burn that we continue to expect now. If inflows come into the marketplace, we could be being very conservative there, but it's just really a continuation of cash burn throughout the remainder of the year. Elliot, he can provide some of the industrial logic we went through in developing that specific numbers. So we didn't just pull that number out of the air. So, Elliot, why don't you talk about how we built that projection? So, the punch line here is that we could be being conservative as market dynamics change. Well, we always think about M&A but we didn't need to digest SVB as I mentioned in your second question first. But we certainly acknowledge that our capital ratios well above our target ranges right now and we projected that remain elevated in '23 and '24. One thing that everyone needs to keep in mind is that loss share coverage provided about a 2% benefit to all of our risk-based capital ratios. So without loss share, we'd be over our target CET1 range near the top on Tier1 and towards the bottom of total capital, now earnings will replenish those and continue to be growing well-above our target ratios going forward. So as we've stated previously, as part of our capital planning process to assess capital -- assess capital actions including share repurchases, which remain an important part of our toolkit to manage capital. We are currently slated to take a combined capital plan to our Board for approval in late July. And this plan will contemplate all of our capital actions after we have considered the external environment, the behavior, and capital needs of the SVB portfolio as well as the dynamics on risk-weighted assets of share of this loss share. So a lot going on there. So this setting given that our combined capital plan is under construction, it's too early to provide timing of an SRP. No, that is 60% of that $650 million is personnel related. Thank you, Steve. Well, we don't have any plans currently to change it. That obviously will be contemplated in the capital plan. Because, as the ratios set -- sat at the end of the first quarter even including HTM and AOCI losses -- unrealized losses in the ratio. We're over the target range by 1% with HTM and AFS losses and by 2% with just AFS losses included. So at this stage, we don't contemplate change in the range, but obviously, those types of things will be considered in our capital plan. But keep in mind too, the loss share coverage is providing a little bit of a boost to these ratios. So we're going to take all of that into consideration in developing our plan going forward. Tom, do you have any comments to add on that? I can't comment on that at this time. We -- obviously, we don't believe that 100% is sustainable long-term. However, in the short term, given that we took a Purchase Money Note and have the FDIC LOC in place, we have time to get it back in line. Longer-term, Frank and I just talked about this morning. So it's a very relevant question. We'd like to see an eight-handle on the loan-to-deposit ratio. So, that sort of our -- that's sort of where we feel like it should be considering our earning assets, net of cash, et cetera on the balance sheet. So around -- having an eight-handle on this will be more comfortable over the long term. Yes, the addition of cash and variable rate loans on the asset side and the Purchase Money Note on the liability side, fairly significantly increased our asset sensitivity. But we are very accepting of a downside risk here, because number one, liquidity is our top priority in the current operating environment. And number two, the cost of hedging to mitigate downside risk makes cost effect -- cost-effective hedging difficult. So for example, if we tried them swap the Purchase Money Note the floating has cost us about 150 basis points. So we're comfortable where we sit. We're also comfortable where our margin lands after rate cuts. So as we sit here right now, we're pretty pleased where we are from an interest rate risk standpoint. Good morning. Yes. Are you asking with and without accretion? Got it. I got you. So if you look at -- if you just look at the -- and I'm going to -- when I talk about purchase accounting impact is still some residual impact from CIT out there, but it's fairly immaterial to the impact of the SVB. So if you look at our margin, that the end of the first quarter, we were at 3.41% and that was 14 basis points of our purchase accounting-related. So without it, it was 3.26%. We looked at the margin migrating upward in the second quarter. The 4%, 52 basis points of which is purchase accounting accretion. And then given that we have a rate cut starting in July, we have another one in September, one in December. Margin falls to 3.86% in the third quarter of '23 and then 3.70% in the fourth quarter. So we see a migration down as rates decline, which would be expected given our asset sensitivity, but still feel like the 3.80% margin for the year will be very strong. I'm taking it off of 3.40%. Yes, there is. I think for this year.. Yes. I think that's right. I mean, if we don't -- if we didn't get rate cuts this year, I think we'd have a 7 basis points higher margin. Obviously, it takes time for those impacts to fall through. So the impact of '24 will be higher, and about $6 on the EPS. So next year higher for long would be even more significant. Well, I mean, in terms of our large commercial depositors or large depositors, many of them have long-term relationships with us and when we break that down, some of them for decades. So we stay in touch with them and they know we're strong and stable as Frank mentioned. So, I don't anticipate that we're going to see an outflow there even with what's going on the external environment. We have seen some customers move money into secured suites or interest-bearing accounts for diversification and ease of mind, but it's not been widespread. And this is staying in the front of our customers and having long relationships with them. So we don't really see that as being a big issue for us. We would certainly longer-term shift -- like to shift our funding mix to core deposits, but that's not going to happen rapidly. So what we are envisioning is replacing the Purchase Money Note with some level of long-term debt TLAC-type borrowings. And then a portion being paid off through increases in core deposits over that five-year period. So it would be -- we have a gradual burned down of the Purchase Money Note shifting to other wholesale sources of funding for deposits over time. Thank you. Good morning. Yes, we expect -- I think, Tom, we're spending increase by about 22% from that 18 then normalized in 24? Andy, can you take that one? Thank you. Good morning. Yes. We are projecting a range of $650 million to $780 million. So, that's 25% to 30% of the baseline coming into the acquisition and we would expect that of that $650 million and $780 million that roughly half of it would be in the run rate at the end of 2023 and then 100% of it would be in the run rate by the end of 2024. Okay. So one yield for this year, pre-purchase accounting would be 6.02, so that's the '23 projection. It was 5.49 in the first quarter. I mean, it was 6.57 for the first quarter. I'm sorry and, so for the year, it's 6.56 with-- in combined with 6.62, so we're pretty close on yields, First Citizens and SVB there. Deposit cost and I'm talking about interest-bearing -- the cost of interest-bearing deposits if I hand this to -- okay, cost of deposits. I don't have SVB broken out separately. But we were at 1.24 in the first quarter and kind of I think our call SVB like 1.06. So it's very similar to ours, and we have that escalating the 1.59. And 1.69 by the fourth quarter for 1.59 for the year. So, was SVB was flagged.. So they were accretive to margin and slightly higher than us on loan yield and lower than us on cash deposits. Hold on one second. I think we have that as of March 31. Well, Tier 1 leverage certainly was the one that was -- 9% would be dead middle of our range, right. It's going to migrate up to over 10% and over 11%, '23 and '24, so it's going to be at the top of the range by the end of the year and then well over it. In terms of binding constrain, I'll let Tom talk a little bit about that. Yes. Tom has just briefly mentioned TLAC and capital stack. So we do contemplate if we were subject to those rules that we would expect some mix of preferred sub-debt and senior debt, and right now that range for us is probably somewhere in the $7 billion to $10 billion range with a heavy portion of that in senior debt and the smaller portion preferred stock and sub-debt. But we definitely are monitoring regulatory changes, the capital and liquidity tailoring rule, and areas that impact us. And I think we're going to have more stringent regulatory oversight obviously here and we're ready for that and we'll be prepared for it. I'll let Lorie talk a little bit about our investment in risk management. We think we're well-positioned to absorb SVB within our risk management framework. I was just going to make a comment on the liquidity side. I mean there's a lot of talk about LCR and liquidity buffers and everything. We believe we're coming in from a position of strength there, obviously, with a lower concentration in investment securities, higher concentration in cash. So we believe we're well-prepared from that perspective. Yes, I'll let Elliott talk about our forecast, but I'll make some broad comments just in terms of this year, we are expecting from the first quarter of this year for the loans that declined by 2% and that's an 8% decline in SVB and a 3% increase in the FCB portfolio. And within FCB, we think that the growth will be broad-based as it has been in the branch network in the industry verticals, but down from first quarter levels as we expect demand has softened the Fed tightening. And as customers become a lot more cautious given the potential for a recession. So we backed off of the current level growth which is 8% annualized in the first quarter. In terms of FCB, we are projecting an 8% decline which would settle loans now about $61 billion, and the expectation there is public and private markets will remain muted for the remainder of '23, as Peter mentioned, there could be some upside if that's not the case and we certainly hope so. And that's my comment. Do you have anything to add to that? Thank you, Brody."

            "name": "Elliot Howard",
            "content": "Yes, absolutely. Few things, as far as cost base is related come embedded in our deposit beta slide there, so we talk about that. And if you look at kind of our offering rates and Direct Bank, really that marginal cost is coming in somewhere kind of a 4.75% type range to the overall Silicon Valley book right now when the kind of a noninterest bearing and interest bearing is around 1.50%, so certainly a delta there that we're replacing that kind of what we've got conservative $8 billion decline in the Silicon Valley book with kind of the incremental on the Direct Bank. As a -- Craig, this is kind of industrial logic. I think we've seen a stabilization here. I think when we look at the amount of -- we kind of new funding capture and absolute levels of that being lower right now in the economy, that's really kind of what's leaving us about $8 billion decline. I think what positive initial steps that we've seen in client outreach, the stabilization we've seen, we are hopeful that's the conservative number and optimism of the upside there. Brody, this is Elliot Howard. So in kind of our assumptions at March 31 is roughly 62%. We see that kind of migrating down to kind of the mid to low 50s of noninterest-bearing in total. Yes, Brody. I would just like kind of add to what Craig said, I think when you look at the largest portion of the Silicon Valley Bank as the Global funds banking. And so that's the part of the -- we expect to decline a little bit here. And that's really a reflection not of kind of losing market share. It's really of the underlying, just market activity. And so that's the Private Bank, pretty stable. I think with taking out care."

            "content": "Thank you, Deanna, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Page 5. We announced another quarter of solid financial results. As you know, we're our TBV focus company and we're pleased that the acquisition of SVB resulted in 112% TBV accretion on the acquisition date and 106% after the CECL adjustments. This transaction meaningfully boosted our capital base providing us with an even more solid foundation to continue growing profitably while delivering long-term value to our shareholders. Since the acquisition, we have had meaningful engagement with key SVB leaders and clients reinforcing that FCB and SVB have commonalities that guide us including deep commitments to our clients and people and to the communities we serve. The CIT merger included many unique businesses and we have successfully integrated those into our business model. So we are confident with this recent experience that we'll be able to -- they will enable us to incorporate SVB as well. We've long believed that direct communications with our clients and associates are essential. And to that end, I'd like to briefly touch on some recent departures that have been reported. As with any combination of discounts, some level of associate turnover in deposit and client churn is expected. However, we are confident that SVB has one of the deepest and most experienced benches of any financial institution serving the innovation economy. And we're committed to maintaining and growing SVB's market by leveraging this deep seeded talent and strength as we move forward. Importantly, the combined organization is very well-positioned financially and is operating from a position of strength, in addition to significant TBV accretion, our liquidity remains strong driven by our conservative asset-liability management, and was enhanced by this transaction with the creation of on-balance sheet funding and access to significant contingency funding. Turning to legacy First Citizens performance. We delivered another quarter of deposit and loan growth as positive momentum continued across all lines of business. The strong quality loan growth we've experienced this quarter in tandem with the positive asset repricing that we experienced throughout 2022 helped generate favorable operating leverage year-over-year. We, like most companies, faced some economic headwinds including the increasing possibility of recession, however, we have not seen meaningful increases of stress in our credit portfolio. Overall, we remain encouraged by the resiliency of our clients in the face of elevated inflation and rising interest rates and we look forward to continuing to support them. Turning to Page 6. We remain focused on the long-term sustainable shareholder value driven by our core strategic priorities which haven't changed other than the addition of a new strategic priority related to the acquisition of SVB. Long-term benefits can be achieved by harnessing SVB's legacy businesses and leveraging these to attract and retain new clients to our franchise. SVB continues to support its clients day in and day out. In fact, several clients recently announced new deals with SVB, that are supporting the growth of their businesses. In addition, SVB's premium line division currently has all-time high loan outstandings, SVB's Community Development Finance Group closed its largest-ever affordable housing facility and this week is celebrating the grand opening as the lead construction lender of new housing in San Francisco for formally unhoused military veterans. To successfully integrate SVB, we are focused on the following: the first, running SVB as SVB to maintain a competitive advantage it has in the innovation economy, while at the same time, infusing the cost discipline and risk management that is defined First Citizens for 125 years; secondly, continuing our high-touch approach, demonstrating the legacy SVB clients that we're committed to helping their businesses succeed; third, embracing our SVB colleagues to create synergies, then enhance our client relationships and further drive the innovation of our products and services; and lastly, continue to articulate our vision with SVB associates to proactively retain key revenue-generating employees and the staff to support them. While we are clearly in the early days of SVB acquisition, we already have begun to integrate our teams and we continue to actively prioritize our efforts to support SVB and its clients. As a combined team, we remain committed to our long-term strategic focus, our relationship client-focused model, delivering solid results while operating with strong liquidity, and capital positions, and effectively managing risk within our defined risk appetite. I would like to close my comments by recognizing all our associates at FCB and SVB for coming together over the past month to move us forward as a combined company. We still have work to do, but your hard work provides us the real opportunity to unlock the strategic and financial value of this partnership. And I'll turn it over now to our President, Peter Bristow to further discuss areas of focus on the SVB acquisition. Peter? Well, now we've thrown a lot at you today. But, I'd like to sort of end with some takeaways, call it, sort of headlines of all the material that we've thrown at you this morning. First of all, the SVB acquisition was a home run financially in terms of immediate TBV accretion and future EPS accretion. Secondly, our fortress balance sheet enabled us to do the SVB deal and we intend to maintain their post-acquisition. Also, SVB clients should take great comfort in our safety and stability and we're hopeful that the recent reduction in runoff and deposit runoff is a sign of their confidence in us. Next, we are committed to SVB strategic approach to the technology and innovation sector and believe that it represents the opportunity for significant upside for First Citizens shareholders. And finally, moving forward, we are positioned to perform well in a broad range of economic scenarios given our capital and liquidity positions, talented associates, focused on our clients and increasingly diverse business mix, and our strong risk management culture. And with that, I will turn it over to the Operator for instructions for the question-and-answer portion of the call. You asked for April 30, we would only talk about March 31."

            "name": "Peter Bristow",
            "content": "Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. On Page 8, I want to touch on the potential growth opportunities the SVB combination unlocks for First Citizens. With the addition of approximately $100 million in total assets, SVB adds meaningful financial scale to First Citizens. While we did experience some level of deposit outflows since the acquisition day, about half of which was expected on day one. We have begun to see some signs of stabilization. This acquisition builds on First Citizens' solid foundation by adding significant scale, geographic diversity, exceptional talent, and most importantly valuable solutions for clients throughout their financial life cycle. First, the addition of SVB meaningfully advances our presence in the innovation and technology sectors. SVB's historic leadership position in these sectors and serves First Citizens is better positioned to serve venture-backed companies and tech start-ups in our backyard and across the nation. Second, it opens new business opportunities while driving incremental topline growth. By leveraging the existing offerings of First Citizens and SVB, we can better serve our combined client base. Third SVB Private has enormous potential to accelerate the growth of our wealth business, adding new digital capabilities, talent, and solutions to our already-growing franchise. Fourth, SVB increases our presence in attractive, high-growth markets on the West Coast and in the Northeast, positioning us to capture new clients while diversifying our footprint. Finally, as Frank mentioned, this acquisition is compelling financially both immediately and in the long term. On Page 9 we dive deeper into the entities we acquired, the SVB Commercial and Private banks. The Commercial arm of SVB is the banking leader in the innovation economy with a powerful network of relationships across entrepreneurs, investors, and influencers. Their focus on technology, life sciences, and healthcare and Global Fund Banking combined with their best-in-class model for delivering to those clients truly sets them apart from the rest of the industry. SVB provides tailored commercial banking solutions to clients at every life stage from start-up and early-stage companies to venture-backed growth companies on up to large corporate entities. These solutions include business banking, treasury services, card, digital banking, FX, liquidity management, and venture debt through the various stages as well as a comprehensive package of banking products to support venture capital and PE fund clients. SVB Private is an established wealth advisory franchise with private banking solutions tailored to the needs of innovation clients. SVB serves these clients both professionally and personally. SVB's private wealth capabilities include lending solutions to address equity compensation, concentrated stock positions, and non-liquid assets. SVB Private also works with premium line producers to provide working capital and vendor loans. I'm not going to cover Page 10 in detail, but we have included it for your reference to provide a snapshot of all of First Citizens Bank business segments along with on and off-balance sheet financial data as of March 31, 2023. Turning to Page 11. While we are in the early stages, our integration efforts are underway. Our approach is to seek out the best minds and most experienced people who can develop our go-forward business model. We are formalizing integration plans that we will share in the future. Meanwhile, we are diligently working to address our immediate priorities and goals which include: first, maintaining our position as a key partner in the innovation economy. We are committed to continuing to help innovators enterprises and investors move bold ideas forward. Despite the recent turmoil, we believe there are long-term secular tailwinds supporting the technology and healthcare sectors that will continue to drive future growth. Second, supporting clients and working to regain trust. Our goal is to maintain seamless functionality that SVB clients are accustomed to and have come to expect. We have already met with many key clients to hold initial discussions around the transition and reinforce our commitment to them. We plan to continue that communication and ensure that feedback can be received quickly and effectively to address. Third, retaining key revenue generating talent and staff to support them. One of the most important priorities has been the retention of key SVB talent. We have provided a budget for a meaningful amount of retention to retain this key talent. As Frank mentioned, we have had some attrition since this acquisition date. However, we have been pleased that our succession plans, internal talent pools, and external recruiting resources have allowed us to backfill key positions. On Page 12, we showed the composition of our loan portfolio at quarter end including the impact of the SVB acquisition. The transaction provides diversification across our loan portfolio. In this way, legacy SVB's commercially focused portfolio complements First Citizens' client strategy by bringing on strong private equity and venture capital relationships. Moving to Page 13. We provide an overview of the legacy SVB credit portfolios and they are divided into risk categories. The acquired portfolio has a low loss history which aligns well with First Citizens' credit culture and risk management strategy. As you can see, approximately 70% of SVB loans fall into the low-credit risk portfolios, including Global Fund Banking and the Private Bank. We will continue to manage these portfolios prudently and effectively while maintaining consistent and strong underwriting standards. The efforts already executed by the legacy SVB team in this area have positioned the bank well from a credit quality standpoint. On Page 14, we show our deposit composition at quarter-end, including the impact of the SVB acquisition. One of the most immediate benefits of the shift in deposit mix at 62% of SVB deposits are noninterest-bearing, bringing the consolidated noninterest-bearing ratio to 39% up 11% from what we reported in the fourth quarter. Further, the transaction provides a more geographically diverse deposit base, which we believe will help position us to compete in the current deposit rate environment by growing our core deposit base. We continue to focus on client outreach and I believe that some of the legacy SVB clients will move business that left back to us as depositors realizes their deposits are safe with First Citizens. In the meantime, we've successfully been leveraging our nationwide digital direct bank to quickly add balances to competitive product offerings. I will now turn it over to Craig Nix to discuss the preliminary purchase accounting and our first quarter financial results. Craig? This is Peter Bristow. Let me make a quick comment about it as well. One of the things that could potentially impact that is, again because of the sort of the lack of transactional volume that's going on in the VC and the PE space that drives balances down in our Global Fund business. So that's sort of -- now as our cash burn continues, we think that -- which we think it well, but that could turn around quickly if there were some sort of change and sort of the tenor and the environment. So that's part of that as well. No. I think that's all, Craig. I mean, we're really focusing on getting that on. And on the FDIC line that's, therefore, contingency purposes to support the transaction, it's obviously something we'll keep in place here in the intermediate future."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer section. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce the host of this conference call, Ms. Deanna Hart, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nDeanna Hart: Thank you and good morning. Welcome to First Citizens' third quarter earnings call.

I'll make some brief comments about our third quarter results, and then I'll turn it over, Craig, to review our results in more detail before we take your questions. Starting on page 6 of our investor presentation, we delivered another quarter of strong financial results with adjusted earnings per share of $45.87. Our net interest margin was resilient despite declines in accretion income, and we remain encouraged by the stability of deposit base. We saw continued deposit growth in the General Bank and SVB Commercial balances were up modestly over the prior quarter. We're pleased with the stability of the SVB Deposit franchise, demonstrating the competitive advantage we maintain in the innovation economy. Loans declined during the quarter, predominantly by reduction in the Global Fund Banking portfolio as repayment levels outpaced new loan origination and draw activity. However, the pipeline remains strong in this business, and average loan outstandings were up over the second quarter. The decline in GFB was partially offset by mid and upper single-digit annualized percentage growth in the general and commercial banks, respectively. While net charge-offs ticked up modestly over the second quarter, overall credit remains in good shape. Consistent with previous quarters, net charge-offs were mostly concentrated in the general office, investor-dependent, and small-ticket leasing portfolios. We continue to proactively review our portfolios to identify potential issues early on, and prudent credit risk management will remain a priority for us. Our capital and liquidity positions remain strong during the quarter and continue to be a source of strength. We're pleased with the progress we made under our share repurchase plan, and during the third quarter, we repurchased over 350,000 shares of Class A common stock for a total price of approximately $700 million. Craig will touch on this in more detail in his comments. In closing, our thoughts are with our associates, clients, and communities that have been affected and continue to be affected by Hurricanes Helene and Milton. Thanks to our dedicated associates, we quickly reopened operations to help our clients and communities in their rebuilding efforts during this difficult time. We're committed to continuing this support moving forward. I'll turn it over to Craig to review the financial results in more detail. Craig?\nCraig Nix : Thank you, Frank. We appreciate everyone joining us today. I will anchor my comments on the third quarter of key takeaways outlined on page 9. Pages 10 through 26 provide more details underlying our results. As Frank mentioned, we initiated our share repurchase program at the beginning of August. As of close of business on October 22nd, we repurchased 3.61% of Class A common shares and 3.36% of total common shares outstanding for a total purchase price of $969.4 million. This represents approximately 28% of our board approved $3.5 billion repurchase. Turning to third quarter financial results, ROE and ROA adjusted for notable items were 11.94% and 1.22% respectively. Our adjusted PP and ROA in efficiency ratio were 1.88% and 54% respectively. Headline NIM was 3.53% and ex accretion NIM was 3.33%. With respect to these earnings metrics, we remained at or amongst the top of our large financial institution peer group. Aligned with our guidance, Headline Net Interest Income was down slightly from the second quarter as lower accretion income and higher deposit costs offset increases in interest income on loans, ex accretion and investments. While modest, Net Interest Income ex accretion increased over the linked quarter given support from higher average loan balances. While the pace moderated, deposit costs were up predominantly due to growth in money market and savings accounts. We believe the cost of deposits reached its peak in the third quarter and we'll see a downward trend moving forward as down rate betas accelerate from the magnitude of rate cuts in September. Headline NIM contracted sequentially by 11 basis points and excluding accretion by three basis points. While NIM was down, the impacts from deposit re-pricing and interest bearing deposit growth have stabilized and we continued to benefit from a higher average loan balance. Adjusted noninterest income was down modestly, sequentially, but aligned with our guidance. The decline was primarily driven by changes in the fair value of customer derivative positions brought on by lower interest rates, partially offset by increased capital market fees due to higher loan syndication volume and an increase in real income on rail operating lease equipment. The profitability of our rail segment remains on track as we added to the number of railcars in the fleet this quarter and we continue to experience solid re-pricing trends and utilization rates. Adjusted noninterest expense came in slightly above our guidance range, increasing sequentially by approximately 5%, with the increase concentrated in personnel costs and professional fees. As you will recall, we identified the continued build-out of our risk organization and risk management framework to LFI standards as a strategic priority in 2024. During the third quarter, this constituted the most significant component of the increase impacting both personnel costs and professional fees. In addition to the risk management spend, incentive accruals increased related to 2024 performance and there was an additional working day in the quarter. Finally, but to a lesser extent, lower loan originations and thus lower deferred salaries and higher insurance expense contributed to the increase in expense during the quarter. While these expenses were expected, they pulled through at a slightly elevated level in the third quarter, giving accelerated hiring and increased project spend. We expect continued spend into 2025 as we further mature the organization and build platform for sustainable growth in the future. Despite investments in our business and infrastructure, we have continued to execute on cost savings initiatives and we are pleased to report that we achieve the low end of our cost savings goal from the SVB acquisition. Effectively managing expenses is a top priority for us given headwinds to net interest income and necessary spend for regulatory readiness. We will continue to be vigilant on overall expense management as we look to 2025. Moving to credit, our net charge-off ratio during the quarter was 42 basis points, up slightly from the sequential quarter but aligned with our guidance range. As Frank mentioned in his comments, net charge-offs were in the same portfolios discussed previously and we noted no emerging problems outside of those pressure points. Most of the increase in net charge-offs during the quarter were concentrated in the general office of portfolio within the Commercial Bank. We believe losses will remain elevated here due to high vacancy rates, continued pressure from interest rates and limited liquidity in the market for refinancing maturing loans. At quarter end, total loans in this portfolio were $825 million or approximately 0.6% of the total loan portfolio. We saw a modest increase in net charge-off in the small ticket leasing portfolio and experienced modest improvement in the investor dependent portfolio. Continued improvement here will be facilitated by a higher fundraising environment driven by both M&A and IPOs. At this time, an improved appetite for IPOs remains elusive and we expect continued stress in this portfolio in the near term, but remain optimistic that a declining rate environment will help generate more activity in the space. Nonaccrual loans increase sequentially driven by one loan that migrated to nonaccrual status in the SVB Commercial portfolio and appears to be an idiosyncratic event. Looking at the allowance, the ratio declined by one basis point to 1.21% with the most significant factor related to improvement in credit quality of our commercial loan portfolio, partially offset by changes in the macroeconomic forecast, higher specific reserves on individually evaluated loans and a $20 million reserve recorded related to Hurricane Helene. We feel good about our overall reserve coverage as well as coverage on the portfolios experiencing stress. Moving to the balance sheet, loans decreased by $646 million sequentially, a decline of 0.5%. The decline was driven by a $2.1 billion reduction in SVB Commercial loans, a majority of which was concentrated in period end loans with Global Fund Banking driven by lower loan draws and higher prepayments. Encouragingly, the GFB pipeline remained strong at approximately $8 billion and average loan balances were up during the quarter. These decreases were partially offset by growth in the General and Commercial Bank segments of $897 million and $573 million respectively. General Bank growth was primarily attributable to business and commercial loans while growth in the Commercial Bank continued in our industry verticals, including tech media and telecom and healthcare. Turning to the right hand side of the balance sheet, deposits grew sequentially by 0.3% or $495 million due to growth in the Branch Network. We were pleased with this growth giving that this has been a key focus area for us in 2024. In SVB Commercial, we saw modest deposit growth of $54 million. The stability of this franchise continues to demonstrate the competitive advantage we maintain in the innovation economy given our unique products, innovative and adaptive approach and the deep institutional knowledge of our associates. These increases were partially offset by $165 million decrease in direct bank deposits as we continue to allow expiring time deposits to run off and only partially replace them with savings products. Given recent Fed rate cuts, we are seeing some slowing in competition and pricing pressures across our channels. This coupled with continued General Bank core deposit growth, reduced the need for additional high cost direct bank deposits in the third quarter. We will continue to utilize this channel as needed to bolster liquidity, but given our excess liquidity position, we slowed growth in this channel during the quarter. Moving to Capital, our CET1 capital ratio decreased by nine basis points, sequentially ending the quarter at 13.24%. This was driven by a continued decline in the benefit provided by the shared loss agreement, which added approximately 73 basis points to the ratio this quarter down 12 basis points from the second quarter. CET1, excluding the benefits of the shared loss agreement, increased three basis points from the delinked quarter as earnings growth, outpaced risk-weighted asset growth, as well as the impact of share repurchases. We intend to manage CET1 x-loss share towards the 10.5% to 11% range by the end of 2025, which is the level it was following the acquisition of SVB. We intend to accomplish this through regular share repurchases in \u201824 and \u201925 as we continue to assess capital needs considering loan growth, earnings trajectories, and the economic and regulatory environments. I will close on page 28 with our 2024 fourth quarter and full year outlook. On loans, we move our expectations lower given the starting point at the beginning of the fourth quarter. While we remain guarded on growth, we do continue to see solid momentum in our pipelines. We anticipate flat to low single digit annualized percentage growth in the fourth quarter driven by the business and commercial loan portfolios in the General Bank and growth in the SVB Commercial segment. We expect SVB Commercial will benefit from growth in the Global Fund Banking business but do remain cautious on the absolute level of growth given the softness we experience in the third quarter. We do expect a modest increase in investment activity in the fourth quarter as the Fed's monetary easing cycle has potential to kickstart a market recovery which could drive loans higher in the segment. We expect loans to end the year in the $138 billion to $140 billion range representing mid-single digit percentage growth for the full year. We anticipate this growth will be concentrated across the same banking segments and for the same reasons previously discussed. We expect deposits to end the year in the $150 billion to $153 billion range representing a low to mid-single digits percentage growth rate for the full year. There is potential for a modest decline in deposits in the fourth quarter due to lower balances in the SVB Commercial segment driven by cash burn and a few large Global Fund Banking deposits that came in late in the third quarter before being distributed in October. Additionally, as previously discussed, we expect a continued decline in the direct bank as we are not replacing time deposit maturities. We anticipate these reductions to be partially offset by continued growth in the Branch Network as we benefit from increasing our customer base by building deposits through successful execution of our organic growth and relationship banking strategy. Our interest rate forecast for the fourth quarter covers a range of zero to 3.25 basis point rate cuts, with the effective fed funds rate declining from 5% currently to as low as 4.25% by the end of the year. Turning to fourth quarter headline net interest income, we expect a low to mid-single digits percentage points decline as lower accretion and slightly lower loan and investment yields are only partially offset by declining deposit costs. Our guidance does include the planned impact of share repurchase activity for the remainder of 2024. For the full year, we expect headline net interest income to be in the range of $7.1 billion to $7.2 billion down slightly from our previous guide of $7.2 billion to $7.3 billion, reflecting the full impact of the 50 basis points rate cut in September, as well as potential additional cuts in the updated forecast occurring in the fourth quarter. In either case, as expected, we project that loan accretion will be down over $200 million for the year, as loan discounts on the shorter portfolios continue to be recognized. While we realize that our asset sensitivity causes headwinds to net interest income and net interest margin and down cycles, it has allowed us to pull forward earnings in the higher for longer rate environment. In general, we believe that being asset sensitive provides greater optionality in multiple interest rate environments and allows for greater flexibility on our balance sheet. We will continue to employ strategies to appropriately navigate market fluctuations in line with our long-term focus on tangible book value growth. Moving to credit losses, while we remain within our risk appetite, we do anticipate fourth quarter net charge-offs near slightly above the level we experienced in the third quarter, driven by the continued stress in the same portfolio as we have been discussing this year. Commercial real estate rate cuts could ease some of the pressure on borrowers in the general office sector and over the long term help to reduce issues in this portfolio. However, we do believe losses will remain elevated for the remainder of \u201824 and into \u201825. We also anticipate continued stress in the investor dependent portfolio in the fourth quarter and into 2025. In addition to these factors, we are watching a couple of larger credits that could manifest in the losses in the fourth quarter, which are considered in the 40 to 50 basis points range for the quarter. We are increasing the lower end of our full year range slightly from 35 to 37 basis points with the high end of the range remaining at 40 basis points. Moving to adjusted noninterest income, we expect the fourth quarter to be in line to down low single digits percentage points from the third quarter. We expect full year adjusted noninterest income to be in the range of $1.89 billion to $1.91 billion, which is slightly higher than our previous guidance. This is driven by our rail outlook as we expect a continuation of healthy fundamentals in the near term from a supply driven recovery, which is generating strong demand for existing railcars resulting in a stronger for longer scenario. We are also expecting higher wealth management income due to continued organic growth and client acquisition. Moving to adjusted noninterest expense, we expect the fourth quarter to be flat compared to the third quarter. As discussed, we continue to invest in our risk and technology capabilities and have made strategic hires on these teams resulting in a higher run rate for salaries and benefits expense. We are additionally seeing higher project related expenses for strategic technology projects and increased marketing expenses in the direct bank as we try to hold on to deposits there. We will seek to partially offset these expenses through additional acquisition synergies, which I spoke to earlier. Our adjusted efficiency ratio is expected to remain in the mid to upper 50% range in 2024 as the impact of the Fed rate cut cycle puts downward pressure on net interest margin and we continue to make investments into areas that will help us scale to category three status when we cross that threshold. Looking at the full year, we anticipate adjusted noninterest expense to be in the range of $4.76 billion to $4.79 billion, representing mid-single digits percentage growth for the three comparable quarters we were merged with SVB in 2023. For both the fourth quarter and full year 2024, we expect our tax rate to be in the range of 27% to 28%, which is exclusive of any discrete items. In summary, we are pleased with our performance this quarter and encouraged by the performance of our business segments in the current economic cycle. We will continue to focus on growing in a prudent manner, appropriately allocating capital, and driving long-term growth for our shareholders. I will now turn it over to the operator for instructions for the question-and-answer portion of the call.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris McGratty from KBW.\nChris McGratty: Oh, great. Morning. Craig or Frank, the SVB decline in the quarter, obviously that's a very tough quarter-to-quarter balance to forecast. I'm interested in your thoughts of the next couple quarters. What would it take? I think you mentioned lower rates, but just maybe what might be at risk here in terms of near term loan growth before we start seeing that benefit as rates go down. Thanks.\nCraig Nix : Chris, this is Craig. I'll ask Marc or Frank to expand on this, but we anticipate as the market recovers that loans and deposits will grow at SVB. We do think that lower rates and the expectation for lower rates could be a catalyst for growth. We don't really see anything in the quarter structural. At SVB, that decline, it really was more related to payoffs towards the end of the quarter. Average loan balances were higher than last quarter. So again, nothing really structural there that we're seeing. I would like to give Marc an opportunity to address that as well if he's on the line, but that's kind of how we see it right now. And Marc, are you there?\nMarc Cadieux : I am here. Thank you, Craig. This is Marc Cadieux. And what you see in that capital call lending portfolio, then taking it back to the second quarter when it was up by a roughly similar amount, on a period end balance basis, that portfolio can move around again as second quarter and third quarter results indicate. Craig hit what I think is the most important point, and that is the average loan growth, which was continued to be positive in the quarter. And when it comes to a portfolio like this that can swing around on a period end basis, like we've witnessed, I think the average balances are really a better thing to focus on, as it gives a better indication of how that portfolio is trending. Recognizing that again, borrowing is a function of investment activity. Investment activity continue to be muted in the quarter. And so until we see a significant pickup in investment activity, we will presumably continue to see more muted activity in that portfolio segment.\nChris McGratty: That's great. Thank you for that. And then I guess, Craig, back to the net interest income guide, the range is wide and understandably because of the uncertainty with rates, can you maybe speak to the different ranges? And then also within the guide, accretion income came down. How do we think about the accretion piece going forward in the next few quarters? Thank you.\nCraig Nix : So accretion, we expect the pickup in NIM or the accretion to NIM to continue to dissipate as those shorter term loans are paid off and we recognize that income. For instance, during the third quarter, NIM benefited from accretion by 20 basis points. That was down eight basis points from the prior quarter, with accretion income dropping from $140 million to $101 million. That would continue to decline as we go forward. For instance, we think that the fourth quarter will be somewhere around $90 million. We will have about $1.3 billion remaining at the end of this year, which is roughly half of what we started with around $2.6 billion. So the accretion number, the contribution from accretion will continue to go down as we move forward. If we look at just trajectory of NIM and net interest income, we're looking at this in a range of possible outcomes with the high end of the range assuming no further rate cuts in the fourth quarter. So the 50 basis points in September are baked in, but no further rate cuts in the fourth quarter. And for next year, that would be the high end of the NIM and net interest income range. And for the low end of the range, three additional 25 basis point rate cuts in the fourth quarter \u201824 and four cuts in 2025. And I'm going to anchor my comments to net interest income, ex-accretion. We just talked about the accretion impact. If I look at third quarter actual compared to expected fourth quarter \u201824 exit net interest income in the low scenario, we would expect mid to high single digits percentage decline. And then the higher forecast low to mid-single digits decline. On the margin, in the high scenario, we would expect margin to drop ex-accretion from the 3.33 to the low 3.20s in the high and the low 3.10s in the low. If we, if we fast forward that trajectory and look at fourth quarter \u201825 exit for net interest income, ex-accretion in the high, we would anticipate being up low single digits percentage points, and in the low, we would anticipate being down low single digits. On NIM, we would expect in the highest scenario for the margin to move from the mid-3.20s to the high 3.10s, and then the low from the mid-3.10s to the high 2.90s. I know that's a lot, but that's where we see our exit fourth quarter \u201824 and fourth quarter \u201825 net interest income and margin ex- accretion lending given those rates and areas.\nOperator: The next question comes from Anthony Elion from HAV Walken.\nUnidentified Analyst : Hi, everyone. Following up on SVB, you saw deposits stable during the quarter and the decline -- you called out the decline in period and loans but Marc or Craig, I'm wondering if you can comment on the pace of client additions in that business and how that's trended in the third quarter?\nCraig Nix : Marc, will you take that one, please?\nMarc Cadieux : Yes, I will I will start. Yes, so it's Marc Cadieux and I do not in the moment have the new client statistic for the quarter though we do continue to add new clients. We continue to see clients return to us in the third quarter. And so continue to feel good directionally recognizing that our target markets are still experiencing a downturn and so that remains the headwind there, but we are encouraged by new client acquisition continuing to be positive.\nUnidentified Analyst : Thank you and then for my follow-up on the buyback so you told about 30% through October which was elevated pace compared to the total authorization you have outstanding. Should we continue to expect the buy -- the pace of the buyback to remain elevated until mid-next year? Thank you.\nTom Eklund : This is Tom Eklund, yes, I think through the end of the year you can assume a similar pace to what you've seen so far and then sort of slowing down a little bit in next year to get to that $3.5 billion in the third quarter of next year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Samuel Vaga from UBS.\nUnidentified Analyst : Good morning. Craig, could you just put a finer point on the floating rate loan exposures? The 60% to 65% of the fees, I believe, but can you just say what the exact percentage is and the split between what's floating and what's actually variable?\nCraig Nix : Yes, in the total loan portfolio, around 64% is variable, 36% fixed.\nUnidentified Analyst : Okay, any of the variable, can you share what's effective floating?\nCraig Nix : Could you repeat that? Oh, you broke up there.\nUnidentified Analyst : Yes, sorry, could, in the variable of the 64%, what part of that is actually effective floating today?\nCraig Nix : You were saying type of floating?\nUnidentified Analyst : Just effective floating. So today, what's effective floating?\nCraig Nix : Well, the majority of the loans are tied to SOFR and the spot maturity rate would be around 6.90 if that's what you're asking.\nUnidentified Analyst : Okay, and then in terms of the terminal deposit data that you had, you noted the 33% expecting next quarter. Can you give some color rounds and how high do you expect that to go by 2025?\nCraig Nix : So our terminal up betas is on loans was 53% and on deposits was 47%. We're anticipating in the fourth quarter down betas to be 23% on deposits, 32% on loans. And fast forwarding to next year, we would think the terminal betas in the down would be very similar to terminal betas up on loans and deposits. Tom, is that square up with what you're \u2013\nTom Eklund : Yes. I mean, there's obviously a little bit of a lag on the deposit side, so that's why we're expecting it to be a little lower going into the fourth quarter and then catch up during next year.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Long from Raymond James.\nDavid Long: Good morning, everyone. Marc, I know you talked a little bit about the loan side of SVB, and I'm just looking more at the deposit side, planned balances, quarter-to-quarter, had a nice improvement in the second quarter. What changed in the marketplace that drove that to be relatively flat in the third quarter?\nMarc Cadieux : So, it really starts with a diminished venture investment activity in the quarter, roughly $38 billion, and so fewer deposits to capture is how that translates. Similarly, as I think we've noted in past calls, many of our clients have multiple bank accounts today. And so some portion of that opportunity gets captured by others as a function of that. And then cash burn continues to be a factor which ticked up a little bit in the third quarter relative to the second. And so those are in effect the headwinds from a deposit gathering. And by virtue of that, what I think the flat deposits are up modestly, I think it was $54 million in the quarter reflects, I think that continued progress bringing back existing or bringing back former clients attracting new ones and continuing to reduce the number of clients that tripe. And so generally speaking, maybe stick to the lending on this, I think of the continued stability and deposits given all of these headwinds as great evidence that we're continuing to execute well and remain positioned for a better environment when investment inevitably picks back up.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ryan Nash from Goldman Sachs.\nRyan Nash: Hey, good morning, everyone. Maybe a follow up on some of the net interest income questions that were asked. So when you think about the two scenarios that you outlined, when would you expect net interest income and net interest margin to bottom and begin growing again? And then I guess related to that, last quarter you talked about further actions you've taken to reduce asset sensitivity. Can maybe just talk about updated thoughts on other actions that you've taken this quarter to reduce sensitivity? Thanks, and I have a follow up.\nCraig Nix : I will cover the trough question and let Tom cover the asset sensitivity question. In terms of and obviously, these troughs depend heavily on both timing and magnitude of rate cuts. Timing can be very important on that, and also on balance sheet growth. So just but all things being equal, if we look at net interest income, ex-accretion, we're looking second half of \u201825 regardless of the rate scenario, and net interest margin ex-accretion, we're also looking at second half of \u201825 regardless of scenario. And question that out is directly tied into our asset sensitivity. So obviously, rate cuts have a negative impact and pressure our net interest income and margin. So subject to revision going forward, but we would say second half of \u201825 is the trough. And I will let Tom hit the asset sensitivity question.\nTom Eklund : Yes, on the asset sensitivity side, as you're aware, we have that 3.5% purchase money note on the liability side, which is fixed rate. It's about 20% of our total funding. So we're -- we got a little bit of a kink in our asset sensitivity there right around that point. So during the third quarter with rates falling down, we moderated some of our actions to mitigate asset sensitivity to instead sort of set aside liquidity to get ready to repay the purchase money note. As rates have recovered now early in the fourth quarter, we've gone back to invest a little more, look at some swap options there, but it just hasn't been economic to put on, receive fixed at the same rate we're paying fixed on the liability side.\nRyan Nash: Got you. And maybe come back to the Global Fund Banking where you talked about the end of period being down, but to focus on the average where it was flat. I think you flagged lower draw activity, which is intuitive and higher repayments. And obviously capital call has been an area that a lot of banks have been investing in. Can you maybe just expand on the comments about higher repayments? Are you seeing competition picking up and loans are being refinanced away? And I know one quarter doesn't make a trend, but how are you just thinking broader about growth in this portfolio over the medium term?\nCraig Nix : Marc, can you take that one, please?\nMarc Cadieux : Sure, it's Marc again. Yes, so it's Marc. And so a couple of things, maybe just go back to the period end. Again, up by roughly a similar amount on a period end basis in the second quarter before coming down. And to just give a little bit of context on this capital call lending, these are tended to be short term loans that affect their revolving lines of credit. And they borrow when they make an investment, generally speaking, and repay when the capital calls from their limited partner investors show up. And in a higher rate environment that we've been in, on average borrowers tend to keep those advances out for a shorter duration. And so the combination of that factor coupled with, again, the more muted investment activity is I think what conspires there to cause those swings quarter-to-quarter on a period end basis. Again, the important point to note here is the average balance growth, which has continued to trend positive. And getting to, I think, the heart of your question, our competitiveness in the marketplace and what we're seeing from others. You are right, capital call lending, subscription lending continues to be attractive category. We have seen in recent years new entrants and we continue to feel very confident about our position in the market. We believe we have the longest lived fund banking practice anywhere. We've been at an awfully long time and a very long established and experienced team. And that team continues to win new business, notwithstanding the competitive environment. As I think Craig signaled earlier, we're encouraged by the pipeline we see there. And without going into the future, we remain optimistic when fundraising, or I'm sorry, when investment eventually picks back up. I hope that was responsive.\nRyan Nash: Yes, no, it wasn't. If I could squeeze in one last one, just on the SVB deposits, I know you said that there was some pay down early in the quarter, and then there's some cash burn. But if you think about it, Alts and advisors have been talking about a ramp and deal activity. You talked about lower rates being a catalyst. Like, do you see deposit flows picking up in this market as we exit the year and move into 2025, hopefully in a more conducive environment? Thank you.\nMarc Cadieux : So recognizing we're not providing preliminary guidance on \u201825 at this point, there continues to be a substantial amount of dry powder, capital that's been committed to venture capital, general partners that has yet to be invested. I think the stat for the third quarter is something like $328 billion or something like that. So a lot of money on the sidelines waiting to be invested. We've just seen the first 50 basis point rate cut with the expectation of potentially more. And that we believe that I think Craig said in his opening remarks, we hope we'll begin to unstick this market, right? That things will continue to thaw and given that we're now nine, 10 quarters in to what has been a very significant downturn in the innovation economy space. And so while I can't predict the future and nobody knows exactly when that investment activity will pick back up, I think again, we remain well positioned for that inevitability when it occurs.\nOperator: The next question comes from Christopher Marinac from Janney Montgomery Scott.\nChristopher Marinac: Hey, thanks. Craig, if you have less balance sheet growth that should have CET1 higher next year, I'm just curious how that could impact the buyback just thinking beyond what you've already authorized.\nCraig Nix : Yes, we certainly plan to utilize the entire $3.5 billion in approved buyback. We will be re-submitting our capital plan early next year, first quarter, in the first quarter. And if that's the case, if earnings continue to outstrip risk-weighted asset growth, we would contemplate tagging on another repurchase plan in the back half of 2025. So you're exactly right. If asset growth, if we do have a smaller balance sheet, certainly would support us continuing with our share repurchase plan. And right now, we certainly contemplate not necessarily a smaller balance sheet, but despite that, having the capacity to do a further plan in the second half of next year.\nChristopher Marinac: Great. Thank you for that. And just to follow up on liquidity. Is there any excess liquidity that you're carrying today that could be redeployed as some of the capital rules of the Fed are better understood in a few more quarters?\nTom Eklund : Yes, I think as we look at liquidity, obviously we're not subject to LCR, but run our internal stress tests and everything like that, just in line with what you see at other large financial institutions. We got give or take seven, $7 billion, $10 billion depending on how you count it in excess liquidity right now that we're carrying on the balance sheet that we could in theory redeploy whether we use that to pay down debt or invest in other earning assets. But it's the numbers keep shifting because it's obviously highly dependent on deposit mix, unfunded commitments and things like that. But we do have a little bit. We continue to manage liquidity conservatively and take advantage in the future.\nOperator: I'm not showing any further questions at this time. So I'd like to turn the call back over to our host, Deanna Hart, for any closing remarks.\nDeanna Hart: Thank you so much. And thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. We appreciate your ongoing interest in our company. And if you have further questions or need additional information, please feel free to reach out to our investor relations team. We hope everyone has a great rest of your day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Thank you, Deanna. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our earnings call. I'll make some brief comments about our third quarter results, and then I'll turn it over, Craig, to review our results in more detail before we take your questions. Starting on page 6 of our investor presentation, we delivered another quarter of strong financial results with adjusted earnings per share of $45.87. Our net interest margin was resilient despite declines in accretion income, and we remain encouraged by the stability of deposit base. We saw continued deposit growth in the General Bank and SVB Commercial balances were up modestly over the prior quarter. We're pleased with the stability of the SVB Deposit franchise, demonstrating the competitive advantage we maintain in the innovation economy. Loans declined during the quarter, predominantly by reduction in the Global Fund Banking portfolio as repayment levels outpaced new loan origination and draw activity. However, the pipeline remains strong in this business, and average loan outstandings were up over the second quarter. The decline in GFB was partially offset by mid and upper single-digit annualized percentage growth in the general and commercial banks, respectively. While net charge-offs ticked up modestly over the second quarter, overall credit remains in good shape. Consistent with previous quarters, net charge-offs were mostly concentrated in the general office, investor-dependent, and small-ticket leasing portfolios. We continue to proactively review our portfolios to identify potential issues early on, and prudent credit risk management will remain a priority for us. Our capital and liquidity positions remain strong during the quarter and continue to be a source of strength. We're pleased with the progress we made under our share repurchase plan, and during the third quarter, we repurchased over 350,000 shares of Class A common stock for a total price of approximately $700 million. Craig will touch on this in more detail in his comments. In closing, our thoughts are with our associates, clients, and communities that have been affected and continue to be affected by Hurricanes Helene and Milton. Thanks to our dedicated associates, we quickly reopened operations to help our clients and communities in their rebuilding efforts during this difficult time. We're committed to continuing this support moving forward. I'll turn it over to Craig to review the financial results in more detail. Craig?"

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Craig Nix",
            "content": "Thank you, Frank. We appreciate everyone joining us today. I will anchor my comments on the third quarter of key takeaways outlined on page 9. Pages 10 through 26 provide more details underlying our results. As Frank mentioned, we initiated our share repurchase program at the beginning of August. As of close of business on October 22nd, we repurchased 3.61% of Class A common shares and 3.36% of total common shares outstanding for a total purchase price of $969.4 million. This represents approximately 28% of our board approved $3.5 billion repurchase. Turning to third quarter financial results, ROE and ROA adjusted for notable items were 11.94% and 1.22% respectively. Our adjusted PP and ROA in efficiency ratio were 1.88% and 54% respectively. Headline NIM was 3.53% and ex accretion NIM was 3.33%. With respect to these earnings metrics, we remained at or amongst the top of our large financial institution peer group. Aligned with our guidance, Headline Net Interest Income was down slightly from the second quarter as lower accretion income and higher deposit costs offset increases in interest income on loans, ex accretion and investments. While modest, Net Interest Income ex accretion increased over the linked quarter given support from higher average loan balances. While the pace moderated, deposit costs were up predominantly due to growth in money market and savings accounts. We believe the cost of deposits reached its peak in the third quarter and we'll see a downward trend moving forward as down rate betas accelerate from the magnitude of rate cuts in September. Headline NIM contracted sequentially by 11 basis points and excluding accretion by three basis points. While NIM was down, the impacts from deposit re-pricing and interest bearing deposit growth have stabilized and we continued to benefit from a higher average loan balance. Adjusted noninterest income was down modestly, sequentially, but aligned with our guidance. The decline was primarily driven by changes in the fair value of customer derivative positions brought on by lower interest rates, partially offset by increased capital market fees due to higher loan syndication volume and an increase in real income on rail operating lease equipment. The profitability of our rail segment remains on track as we added to the number of railcars in the fleet this quarter and we continue to experience solid re-pricing trends and utilization rates. Adjusted noninterest expense came in slightly above our guidance range, increasing sequentially by approximately 5%, with the increase concentrated in personnel costs and professional fees. As you will recall, we identified the continued build-out of our risk organization and risk management framework to LFI standards as a strategic priority in 2024. During the third quarter, this constituted the most significant component of the increase impacting both personnel costs and professional fees. In addition to the risk management spend, incentive accruals increased related to 2024 performance and there was an additional working day in the quarter. Finally, but to a lesser extent, lower loan originations and thus lower deferred salaries and higher insurance expense contributed to the increase in expense during the quarter. While these expenses were expected, they pulled through at a slightly elevated level in the third quarter, giving accelerated hiring and increased project spend. We expect continued spend into 2025 as we further mature the organization and build platform for sustainable growth in the future. Despite investments in our business and infrastructure, we have continued to execute on cost savings initiatives and we are pleased to report that we achieve the low end of our cost savings goal from the SVB acquisition. Effectively managing expenses is a top priority for us given headwinds to net interest income and necessary spend for regulatory readiness. We will continue to be vigilant on overall expense management as we look to 2025. Moving to credit, our net charge-off ratio during the quarter was 42 basis points, up slightly from the sequential quarter but aligned with our guidance range. As Frank mentioned in his comments, net charge-offs were in the same portfolios discussed previously and we noted no emerging problems outside of those pressure points. Most of the increase in net charge-offs during the quarter were concentrated in the general office of portfolio within the Commercial Bank. We believe losses will remain elevated here due to high vacancy rates, continued pressure from interest rates and limited liquidity in the market for refinancing maturing loans. At quarter end, total loans in this portfolio were $825 million or approximately 0.6% of the total loan portfolio. We saw a modest increase in net charge-off in the small ticket leasing portfolio and experienced modest improvement in the investor dependent portfolio. Continued improvement here will be facilitated by a higher fundraising environment driven by both M&A and IPOs. At this time, an improved appetite for IPOs remains elusive and we expect continued stress in this portfolio in the near term, but remain optimistic that a declining rate environment will help generate more activity in the space. Nonaccrual loans increase sequentially driven by one loan that migrated to nonaccrual status in the SVB Commercial portfolio and appears to be an idiosyncratic event. Looking at the allowance, the ratio declined by one basis point to 1.21% with the most significant factor related to improvement in credit quality of our commercial loan portfolio, partially offset by changes in the macroeconomic forecast, higher specific reserves on individually evaluated loans and a $20 million reserve recorded related to Hurricane Helene. We feel good about our overall reserve coverage as well as coverage on the portfolios experiencing stress. Moving to the balance sheet, loans decreased by $646 million sequentially, a decline of 0.5%. The decline was driven by a $2.1 billion reduction in SVB Commercial loans, a majority of which was concentrated in period end loans with Global Fund Banking driven by lower loan draws and higher prepayments. Encouragingly, the GFB pipeline remained strong at approximately $8 billion and average loan balances were up during the quarter. These decreases were partially offset by growth in the General and Commercial Bank segments of $897 million and $573 million respectively. General Bank growth was primarily attributable to business and commercial loans while growth in the Commercial Bank continued in our industry verticals, including tech media and telecom and healthcare. Turning to the right hand side of the balance sheet, deposits grew sequentially by 0.3% or $495 million due to growth in the Branch Network. We were pleased with this growth giving that this has been a key focus area for us in 2024. In SVB Commercial, we saw modest deposit growth of $54 million. The stability of this franchise continues to demonstrate the competitive advantage we maintain in the innovation economy given our unique products, innovative and adaptive approach and the deep institutional knowledge of our associates. These increases were partially offset by $165 million decrease in direct bank deposits as we continue to allow expiring time deposits to run off and only partially replace them with savings products. Given recent Fed rate cuts, we are seeing some slowing in competition and pricing pressures across our channels. This coupled with continued General Bank core deposit growth, reduced the need for additional high cost direct bank deposits in the third quarter. We will continue to utilize this channel as needed to bolster liquidity, but given our excess liquidity position, we slowed growth in this channel during the quarter. Moving to Capital, our CET1 capital ratio decreased by nine basis points, sequentially ending the quarter at 13.24%. This was driven by a continued decline in the benefit provided by the shared loss agreement, which added approximately 73 basis points to the ratio this quarter down 12 basis points from the second quarter. CET1, excluding the benefits of the shared loss agreement, increased three basis points from the delinked quarter as earnings growth, outpaced risk-weighted asset growth, as well as the impact of share repurchases. We intend to manage CET1 x-loss share towards the 10.5% to 11% range by the end of 2025, which is the level it was following the acquisition of SVB. We intend to accomplish this through regular share repurchases in \u201824 and '25 as we continue to assess capital needs considering loan growth, earnings trajectories, and the economic and regulatory environments. I will close on page 28 with our 2024 fourth quarter and full year outlook. On loans, we move our expectations lower given the starting point at the beginning of the fourth quarter. While we remain guarded on growth, we do continue to see solid momentum in our pipelines. We anticipate flat to low single digit annualized percentage growth in the fourth quarter driven by the business and commercial loan portfolios in the General Bank and growth in the SVB Commercial segment. We expect SVB Commercial will benefit from growth in the Global Fund Banking business but do remain cautious on the absolute level of growth given the softness we experience in the third quarter. We do expect a modest increase in investment activity in the fourth quarter as the Fed's monetary easing cycle has potential to kickstart a market recovery which could drive loans higher in the segment. We expect loans to end the year in the $138 billion to $140 billion range representing mid-single digit percentage growth for the full year. We anticipate this growth will be concentrated across the same banking segments and for the same reasons previously discussed. We expect deposits to end the year in the $150 billion to $153 billion range representing a low to mid-single digits percentage growth rate for the full year. There is potential for a modest decline in deposits in the fourth quarter due to lower balances in the SVB Commercial segment driven by cash burn and a few large Global Fund Banking deposits that came in late in the third quarter before being distributed in October. Additionally, as previously discussed, we expect a continued decline in the direct bank as we are not replacing time deposit maturities. We anticipate these reductions to be partially offset by continued growth in the Branch Network as we benefit from increasing our customer base by building deposits through successful execution of our organic growth and relationship banking strategy. Our interest rate forecast for the fourth quarter covers a range of zero to 3.25 basis point rate cuts, with the effective fed funds rate declining from 5% currently to as low as 4.25% by the end of the year. Turning to fourth quarter headline net interest income, we expect a low to mid-single digits percentage points decline as lower accretion and slightly lower loan and investment yields are only partially offset by declining deposit costs. Our guidance does include the planned impact of share repurchase activity for the remainder of 2024. For the full year, we expect headline net interest income to be in the range of $7.1 billion to $7.2 billion down slightly from our previous guide of $7.2 billion to $7.3 billion, reflecting the full impact of the 50 basis points rate cut in September, as well as potential additional cuts in the updated forecast occurring in the fourth quarter. In either case, as expected, we project that loan accretion will be down over $200 million for the year, as loan discounts on the shorter portfolios continue to be recognized. While we realize that our asset sensitivity causes headwinds to net interest income and net interest margin and down cycles, it has allowed us to pull forward earnings in the higher for longer rate environment. In general, we believe that being asset sensitive provides greater optionality in multiple interest rate environments and allows for greater flexibility on our balance sheet. We will continue to employ strategies to appropriately navigate market fluctuations in line with our long-term focus on tangible book value growth. Moving to credit losses, while we remain within our risk appetite, we do anticipate fourth quarter net charge-offs near slightly above the level we experienced in the third quarter, driven by the continued stress in the same portfolio as we have been discussing this year. Commercial real estate rate cuts could ease some of the pressure on borrowers in the general office sector and over the long term help to reduce issues in this portfolio. However, we do believe losses will remain elevated for the remainder of \u201824 and into \u201825. We also anticipate continued stress in the investor dependent portfolio in the fourth quarter and into 2025. In addition to these factors, we are watching a couple of larger credits that could manifest in the losses in the fourth quarter, which are considered in the 40 to 50 basis points range for the quarter. We are increasing the lower end of our full year range slightly from 35 to 37 basis points with the high end of the range remaining at 40 basis points. Moving to adjusted noninterest income, we expect the fourth quarter to be in line to down low single digits percentage points from the third quarter. We expect full year adjusted noninterest income to be in the range of $1.89 billion to $1.91 billion, which is slightly higher than our previous guidance. This is driven by our rail outlook as we expect a continuation of healthy fundamentals in the near term from a supply driven recovery, which is generating strong demand for existing railcars resulting in a stronger for longer scenario. We are also expecting higher wealth management income due to continued organic growth and client acquisition. Moving to adjusted noninterest expense, we expect the fourth quarter to be flat compared to the third quarter. As discussed, we continue to invest in our risk and technology capabilities and have made strategic hires on these teams resulting in a higher run rate for salaries and benefits expense. We are additionally seeing higher project related expenses for strategic technology projects and increased marketing expenses in the direct bank as we try to hold on to deposits there. We will seek to partially offset these expenses through additional acquisition synergies, which I spoke to earlier. Our adjusted efficiency ratio is expected to remain in the mid to upper 50% range in 2024 as the impact of the Fed rate cut cycle puts downward pressure on net interest margin and we continue to make investments into areas that will help us scale to category three status when we cross that threshold. Looking at the full year, we anticipate adjusted noninterest expense to be in the range of $4.76 billion to $4.79 billion, representing mid-single digits percentage growth for the three comparable quarters we were merged with SVB in 2023. For both the fourth quarter and full year 2024, we expect our tax rate to be in the range of 27% to 28%, which is exclusive of any discrete items. In summary, we are pleased with our performance this quarter and encouraged by the performance of our business segments in the current economic cycle. We will continue to focus on growing in a prudent manner, appropriately allocating capital, and driving long-term growth for our shareholders. I will now turn it over to the operator for instructions for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Chris, this is Craig. I'll ask Marc or Frank to expand on this, but we anticipate as the market recovers that loans and deposits will grow at SVB. We do think that lower rates and the expectation for lower rates could be a catalyst for growth. We don't really see anything in the quarter structural. At SVB, that decline, it really was more related to payoffs towards the end of the quarter. Average loan balances were higher than last quarter. So again, nothing really structural there that we're seeing. I would like to give Marc an opportunity to address that as well if he's on the line, but that's kind of how we see it right now. And Marc, are you there? So accretion, we expect the pickup in NIM or the accretion to NIM to continue to dissipate as those shorter term loans are paid off and we recognize that income. For instance, during the third quarter, NIM benefited from accretion by 20 basis points. That was down eight basis points from the prior quarter, with accretion income dropping from $140 million to $101 million. That would continue to decline as we go forward. For instance, we think that the fourth quarter will be somewhere around $90 million. We will have about $1.3 billion remaining at the end of this year, which is roughly half of what we started with around $2.6 billion. So the accretion number, the contribution from accretion will continue to go down as we move forward. If we look at just trajectory of NIM and net interest income, we're looking at this in a range of possible outcomes with the high end of the range assuming no further rate cuts in the fourth quarter. So the 50 basis points in September are baked in, but no further rate cuts in the fourth quarter. And for next year, that would be the high end of the NIM and net interest income range. And for the low end of the range, three additional 25 basis point rate cuts in the fourth quarter \u201824 and four cuts in 2025. And I'm going to anchor my comments to net interest income, ex-accretion. We just talked about the accretion impact. If I look at third quarter actual compared to expected fourth quarter \u201824 exit net interest income in the low scenario, we would expect mid to high single digits percentage decline. And then the higher forecast low to mid-single digits decline. On the margin, in the high scenario, we would expect margin to drop ex-accretion from the 3.33 to the low 3.20s in the high and the low 3.10s in the low. If we, if we fast forward that trajectory and look at fourth quarter \u201825 exit for net interest income, ex-accretion in the high, we would anticipate being up low single digits percentage points, and in the low, we would anticipate being down low single digits. On NIM, we would expect in the highest scenario for the margin to move from the mid-3.20s to the high 3.10s, and then the low from the mid-3.10s to the high 2.90s. I know that's a lot, but that's where we see our exit fourth quarter \u201824 and fourth quarter \u201825 net interest income and margin ex- accretion lending given those rates and areas. Marc, will you take that one, please? Yes, in the total loan portfolio, around 64% is variable, 36% fixed. Could you repeat that? Oh, you broke up there. You were saying type of floating? Well, the majority of the loans are tied to SOFR and the spot maturity rate would be around 6.90 if that's what you're asking. So our terminal up betas is on loans was 53% and on deposits was 47%. We're anticipating in the fourth quarter down betas to be 23% on deposits, 32% on loans. And fast forwarding to next year, we would think the terminal betas in the down would be very similar to terminal betas up on loans and deposits. Tom, is that square up with what you're \u2013 I will cover the trough question and let Tom cover the asset sensitivity question. In terms of and obviously, these troughs depend heavily on both timing and magnitude of rate cuts. Timing can be very important on that, and also on balance sheet growth. So just but all things being equal, if we look at net interest income, ex-accretion, we're looking second half of \u201825 regardless of the rate scenario, and net interest margin ex-accretion, we're also looking at second half of \u201825 regardless of scenario. And question that out is directly tied into our asset sensitivity. So obviously, rate cuts have a negative impact and pressure our net interest income and margin. So subject to revision going forward, but we would say second half of \u201825 is the trough. And I will let Tom hit the asset sensitivity question. Marc, can you take that one, please? Yes, we certainly plan to utilize the entire $3.5 billion in approved buyback. We will be re-submitting our capital plan early next year, first quarter, in the first quarter. And if that's the case, if earnings continue to outstrip risk-weighted asset growth, we would contemplate tagging on another repurchase plan in the back half of 2025. So you're exactly right. If asset growth, if we do have a smaller balance sheet, certainly would support us continuing with our share repurchase plan. And right now, we certainly contemplate not necessarily a smaller balance sheet, but despite that, having the capacity to do a further plan in the second half of next year."

            "name": "Marc Cadieux",
            "content": "I am here. Thank you, Craig. This is Marc Cadieux. And what you see in that capital call lending portfolio, then taking it back to the second quarter when it was up by a roughly similar amount, on a period end balance basis, that portfolio can move around again as second quarter and third quarter results indicate. Craig hit what I think is the most important point, and that is the average loan growth, which was continued to be positive in the quarter. And when it comes to a portfolio like this that can swing around on a period end basis, like we've witnessed, I think the average balances are really a better thing to focus on, as it gives a better indication of how that portfolio is trending. Recognizing that again, borrowing is a function of investment activity. Investment activity continue to be muted in the quarter. And so until we see a significant pickup in investment activity, we will presumably continue to see more muted activity in that portfolio segment. Yes, I will I will start. Yes, so it's Marc Cadieux and I do not in the moment have the new client statistic for the quarter though we do continue to add new clients. We continue to see clients return to us in the third quarter. And so continue to feel good directionally recognizing that our target markets are still experiencing a downturn and so that remains the headwind there, but we are encouraged by new client acquisition continuing to be positive. So, it really starts with a diminished venture investment activity in the quarter, roughly $38 billion, and so fewer deposits to capture is how that translates. Similarly, as I think we've noted in past calls, many of our clients have multiple bank accounts today. And so some portion of that opportunity gets captured by others as a function of that. And then cash burn continues to be a factor which ticked up a little bit in the third quarter relative to the second. And so those are in effect the headwinds from a deposit gathering. And by virtue of that, what I think the flat deposits are up modestly, I think it was $54 million in the quarter reflects, I think that continued progress bringing back existing or bringing back former clients attracting new ones and continuing to reduce the number of clients that tripe. And so generally speaking, maybe stick to the lending on this, I think of the continued stability and deposits given all of these headwinds as great evidence that we're continuing to execute well and remain positioned for a better environment when investment inevitably picks back up. Sure, it's Marc again. Yes, so it's Marc. And so a couple of things, maybe just go back to the period end. Again, up by roughly a similar amount on a period end basis in the second quarter before coming down. And to just give a little bit of context on this capital call lending, these are tended to be short term loans that affect their revolving lines of credit. And they borrow when they make an investment, generally speaking, and repay when the capital calls from their limited partner investors show up. And in a higher rate environment that we've been in, on average borrowers tend to keep those advances out for a shorter duration. And so the combination of that factor coupled with, again, the more muted investment activity is I think what conspires there to cause those swings quarter-to-quarter on a period end basis. Again, the important point to note here is the average balance growth, which has continued to trend positive. And getting to, I think, the heart of your question, our competitiveness in the marketplace and what we're seeing from others. You are right, capital call lending, subscription lending continues to be attractive category. We have seen in recent years new entrants and we continue to feel very confident about our position in the market. We believe we have the longest lived fund banking practice anywhere. We've been at an awfully long time and a very long established and experienced team. And that team continues to win new business, notwithstanding the competitive environment. As I think Craig signaled earlier, we're encouraged by the pipeline we see there. And without going into the future, we remain optimistic when fundraising, or I'm sorry, when investment eventually picks back up. I hope that was responsive. So recognizing we're not providing preliminary guidance on \u201825 at this point, there continues to be a substantial amount of dry powder, capital that's been committed to venture capital, general partners that has yet to be invested. I think the stat for the third quarter is something like $328 billion or something like that. So a lot of money on the sidelines waiting to be invested. We've just seen the first 50 basis point rate cut with the expectation of potentially more. And that we believe that I think Craig said in his opening remarks, we hope we'll begin to unstick this market, right? That things will continue to thaw and given that we're now nine, 10 quarters in to what has been a very significant downturn in the innovation economy space. And so while I can't predict the future and nobody knows exactly when that investment activity will pick back up, I think again, we remain well positioned for that inevitability when it occurs."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer section. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce the host of this conference call, Ms. Deanna Hart, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nDeanna Hart: Good morning. Welcome to First Citizens' second quarter earnings call. Joining me on the call today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Frank Holding; and Chief Financial Officer, Craig Nix. They will provide second quarter business and financial updates, referencing our earnings call presentation, which you can find on our website. Our comments will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. We assume no obligation to update such statements. These risks are outlined on Page 3. We will also reference non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures against the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in section 5 of the presentation. Finally, First Citizens is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of earnings transcripts provided by third parties. I'll now turn it over to Frank.\nFrank Holding : Thank you, Deanna. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our earnings call. Starting on page six, and this is the second quarter snapshot slide. We delivered another quarter of solid financial results, including peer-leading return on assets, net interest margin, adjusted efficiency ratio, loan growth, CET 1 ratio and loan portfolio yield. Our board has approved a share repurchase plan allowing us to repurchase shares in an aggregate amount up to $3.5 billion. And Craig will speak to those details later. And I'd like to point out that we were recently included in the Fortune 500 list for the first time. Continuing on to Page 7, I'll take a look at well, I'll take a moment to focus on our business segment performance as well as their outlooks moving forward. Starting with the General Bank, we saw positive loan trends as growth remain particularly resilient in business and commercial loans within our branch network. We also experienced strong growth in our SBA, SVB private and wealth channels. Importantly, we have not made any significant changes in our risk appetite or client selection to chase growth as we feel our expertise and deep client relationships position us well to continue to grow prudently. Deposit growth in our branch network during the first half of the year exceeded our expectations. Looking forward, we see new production and client acquisition contributing to further balance sheet growth. We also see growth coming from deepening our relationships with existing customers, including SVB acquired customers. On the downside, we recognize that reductions in interest rates will cause margin compression. However, we are building strategies to mitigate the expected negative impact, including a focus on the mix of our deposits by targeting operating accounts, growing quality loans, and improving non-interest income from all sources. Our commercial bank segment continued to deliver strong loan growth driven by several of our specialized industry verticals, primarily in project financing for energy and data centers. CRE volume remains challenged, driven by the higher for longer interest rate environment, deal volume is expected to remain muted during the second half of the year. While portfolio stress is expected to remain above historic levels in equipment finance, we expect loss rates to decline in the second half of the year and into 2025. From a production standpoint, we expect this segment to continue to benefit. First from liquidity concerns, bringing the market rates on a greater number of transactions into our target range. And second, from a focus on originating larger, higher quality transactions. Funding for the commercial bank is aided by our nationwide online direct bank with more than 700,000 core deposit accounts. We plan to continue to use the direct bank as a lever to grow core deposits in the current environment where pricing, pressure and competition remain high. Turning to SVB commercial, we achieved quarter-over-quarter loan growth driven by high-quality loans in our global fund banking or capital call lending business. The uptick in loans reflects both the increased level of investment activity, driving up utilization and global fund banking's continued success in winning the fund banking business of active VC and PC investors. Encouragingly, we are, we also witnessed a quarter-over-quarter increase in SVB commercial total client funds for the first time, since the fourth quarter of 2021, SVB commercial deposits increased for the first time since the first quarter of 2022. These increases were driven by slight improvement in the macroeconomic environment and client acquisition. As we look ahead, it is too early to call an innovation economy turnaround, despite increasing deal counts and encouraging investment trends. We are encouraged that the rebound will be significant as high levels of BC dry powder remain a strong catalyst for future growth. We expect that positive trends, that the positive trends that we saw in the second quarter could continue to result in gradual improvement in the second half of this year, but remain guarded about the absolute levels of deposit growth given the continued headwinds in the environment. Our SVB team remains the bank of choice for the innovation economy. Moving on to Page 8, our strategic priorities have not changed. Given our growth over the past few years, we have been focused on maturing our risk management framework and overall regulatory environment. We have made significant enhancements not only to meet category four large financial institution requirements, but to develop those capabilities in ways that are scalable through category three expectations. To conclude, we're continuing to see positive momentum in our businesses, while we recognize uncertainty remains in the current macroeconomic environment. We are committed to deepening customer relationships, prudently growing core deposits and loans, and allocating capital. We remain in a position of strength, and I'm excited about the opportunities ahead of us in 2024 and beyond. Craig, I'll turn it over to you.\nCraig Nix: Thank you, Frank, and all of you joining us today. My comments will be anchored to the key takeaways found on page 10. Pages 11 through 28 provide more details underlying our second quarter results. I'll start with a $3.5 billion share repurchase plan that Frank just mentioned. Using capital to support organic growth remains our top priority, but strong earnings has led to an excess capital position. Share repurchases provides an opportunity for us to return capital to our shareholders into more efficient capital level over time. We manage capital ratios, excluding any benefit from the shared loss agreement, and all planned capital activities are assessed in this context. We intend to supplement organic capital use with methodical share repurchases with the ultimate goal of managing our adjusted CET-1 ratio down to the 10.5% range by the end of 2025. This repurchase plan puts us on that path. Moving forward, we will assess capital management strategies based on balance sheet growth expectations, earnings trajectories, and economic and regulatory environments. This will be reflected in our next capital plan, which will be completed in the first quarter of 2025. To the extent that capital increase from earnings continues to outpace organic growth, we expect share repurchases to continue beyond this plan. Turning to second quarter results, all of our return metrics exceeded our expectations. ROE and ROA adjusted for notable items for 14.05% and 1.391% respectively. Headline net interest income increased slightly over the late quarter -- higher interest income was partially offset by lower accretion and higher deposit costs. While modest, the increase in headline net interest income followed three quarters of sequential declines where interest expense on deposit was increasing at a faster pace than interest income. During the second quarter, while interest in expense on deposits increase, the pace slowed. Given the likelihood of fed rate cuts, we continued to mitigate a portion of our asset sensitivity profile by moving an additional $5 billion of cash into short duration securities in the investment portfolio. Headline, NIM contracted modestly by 3 basis points and 3.64%. ex accretion NIM increase by one basis point to 3.36% signaling that deposit pressures, while still present continue to stabilize and were more than offset by the benefit of strong loan origination. Before the second quarter, NIM ex accretion had declined in the previous three quarters. Adjusted non-interest income was slightly better than expected due to higher client investment fees, aided by increase in average balances in SVB commercial off-balance sheet client funds offsetting the expected decrease in net rental income on rail operated lease equipment. Rental income with negatively impacted by a return for more normalized maintenance expenses in line with expectations we laid out last quarter. Adjusted non-interest expense came in at the lower end of our guidance range increasing sequentially by approximately 1%. Expense growth was concentrated and equipment expenses related to accelerated depreciation on assets that will no longer be used following the SVB acquisition and favorable variances in prior periods related to reimbursement from third parties. Second quarter expenses also reflected higher marketing expense, as we increased focus on retaining clients and the direct bank channel to help offset expected maturity in their time deposits and in broker deposits. We continue to execute on cost savings from the acquisition and maintain vigilance on overall expense management. We are now close to achieving the lower end of our cost savings estimate and anticipate achieving it by the end of the year. Credit continues to stabilize during the quarter net charge offs at $132 million or 0.38% were on the low end of our guidance range, and non-performing loans remained relatively stable, while losses increased modestly over the link quarters, they were largely in the same portfolios as previous quarters, and we noted no emergent problems outside of those pressure points. Encouragingly, while we saw continued stress in the small ticket leasing portfolio and the investor dependent portfolios, we saw modest improvement in our general office portfolio. While this is a good sign given the continued focus on CRE, particularly CRE office, we do not believe this is indicative of any shift in current stress within that portfolio and really more of a function of one resolution timing. We continue to be well reserved with an allowance of 11.84% on the commercial bank office portfolio covering second quarter net charge offs 2 times. Overall, the allowance ratio decreased 6 basis points to 1.22% with the most significant factor related to a mixed shift from recent growth in the global fund banking portfolio, which carries a low reserve percentage. The decrease is also driven by lower specific reserves on individually evaluated loans, reasonably consistent credit quality trends and positive changes in macroeconomic forecast. All these factors were partially offset by an increase in loan volume, while the allowance did decline this quarter, we feel good about our overall reserve coverage as well as coverage on the portfolios experiencing stress. Moving to the balance sheet, loans grew about $4 billion over the link quarter, an annualized growth rate of 11.8%. Growth was led by a $2.1 billion increase in FCD commercial driven by the global fund banking capital call lending business. These increases were partially offset, I expected decline in technology and healthcare banking given continued payoff and increased competition. The general bank and commercial bank segments also grew loans by $1.5 billion and $386 million respectively. While the broader industry continues to experience tepid loan growth, we continue to see broad base expansion across our business segments, as Frank mentioned earlier. Turning to the right-hand side of the balance sheet, deposit grew in an annualized rate of 4% or by $1.4 billion -- $1.5 billion due to strong core deposit growth and SVB commercial and in the general bank. In SVB commercial, we saw deposit score by $1.9 million, a $329 million increase in the general bank was driven by our continuing emphasis on expanding relationships with current customers and attracting new ones. These increases were partially offset by expected declines in broker deposits and in direct bank deposit of $527 million and $145 million respectively. The decline in the direct bank was due to a $1.9 billion decrease in time deposit, partially offset by a $1.8 billion increase in savings account, giving the pricing on -- and the expectations that rates will decline in the second half. 2024. We made the strategic decision to let these roll off and will continue to grow core deposit to offset this decline. Moving to capital, our CET-1 ratio declined by 11 basis points sequentially, ending the quarter at 13.33%. This was driven by a continued decline and the benefit provided by the shared loss agreement, which added approximately 85 basis points to the ratio this quarter down 22 basis points from the first quarter. The CET-1 ratio excluding the benefits of the shared loss agreement, increased 11 basis points from the linked quarter and earnings growth, again, outpaced organic growth. I'll close on page 28 with our third quarter 2024 and full year outlook. On loans, we move our expectations higher given the starting point at the beginning of the third quarter and solid momentum in our pipelines. We anticipate high single-digit annualized percentage growth in the third quarter, driven broadly across our business segments. We anticipate SVB commercial will benefit from growth in the global fund banking business, where we see success in client outreach. While the second quarter benefit is from increased activity in commercial real estate funds, M&A and debt activity, the market continues to be challenged and remains somewhat unpredictable. While we do expect to see a modest increase in DC investment compared to 2023, we believe our growth will continue to be pressured by headwind in the private equity and venture capital markets. We also expect continued growth in our business and commercial loan portfolio within the General Bank. In the commercial bank, we anticipate our specialty vertical will be key contributors to continued loan growth. We also continue to expand our middle market banking business and expect to see positive momentum from the strategic moves. Looking at the full year, we expect loans to end in the $143 billion to $146 billion range for mid to high single digits percentage growth on a year-over-year basis. We anticipate this growth to be concentrated across all three banking segments for the reasons previously discussed. We expect deposits to be up slightly in the $152 billion to $154 billion range in the third quarter due to growth in the general bank. We expect relatively flat balances in SVB commercial due to continued cash burn in the still muted fundraising environment. We anticipate growth in the branch network as we benefit from increasing our customer base by building deposits through successful execution of our organic growth and relationship banking strategy. For the full year, we anticipate deposits in the $153 billion to $155 billion range, primarily related to growth in the General Bank previously discussed flat to modestly increases and increasing balances in SVB commercial supplemented by growth in the direct bank if needed. We anticipate the direct bank remaining flat to modestly higher through the end of the year as expiring time deposits are offset by money market and savings growth. This is in line with our strategy of reducing higher cost CDs and the direct bank, we have the option to bring down rates quicker. Should the fed cut cycle be more aggressive than anticipated, while providing a strong source of insured customer consumer deposit in our funding base. The current implied forward curve indicates a 98% probability of two rate cuts in the second half of this year. Our interest rate forecast covers a range of one to three rate cuts with the effective Fed funds rate declining from 5.50% currently to a range of 4.75% to 5.25% by the end of the year. These projections do include the impact of plan purchase activity in the back half of 2024. For the third quarter, if we get one rate cut, we expect headline net interest income to be relatively flat with the second quarter. Given that our forecast cost for the cut in September. We expect that lower accretion; slightly higher deposit cost and a slightly lower loan yield will be offset by higher investment securities yield. For the full year, we expect headline net interest income in the range of $7.2 billion to $7.3 billion up from our previous guide of $7.1 billion to $7.3 billion, reflecting the higher for longer rate environment, as well as potential rate cuts in the updated forecast occurring later in 2024. In either case, we continue to project loan accretion of just over $500 million for the year over a $200 million decline for 2023 as loan discount from the shorter portfolios will have been fully recognized. On credit losses, while we have experienced positive trends in recent quarters, we do anticipate continued elevated net charge off in the investor dependent general office and equipment finance portfolios. We anticipate third quarter net charge off in the 35 basis points to 45 basis points range, but are lowering the full year range to 35 basis points to 40 basis points given lower losses during the first half of the year. We do caution that many of our portfolios in the commercial bank and SVB commercial have large hold sizes and one or two of these ones curating unexpectedly could influence this range. In commercial real estate higher for longer rates continue to have effect on value being felt most heavily in the general office sector where market liquidity support refinancing remains scarce. We expect these market dynamics will continue to elevate losses within this portfolio for the remainder of 2024. We're seeing some green sheets in the investor-dependent portfolio and we believe that continued market optimism and a greater consensus on valuation is an encouraging sign that should help reduce some pressure. Still given the uncertainty of the innovation economy, we do expect continued stress throughout 2024. Moving to adjusted non-interest income, we expect the third quarter to be materially in line to down low single digits from the link quarter. We expect full year adjusted non-interest income to be in the range of $1.85 billion to $1.9 billion, which is slightly higher than our previous guidance. This is driven by a rail outlook as we expect a continuation of healthy fundamental trends in the near term from a supply driven recovery, which is generating strong demand for existing real cars, resulting in a stronger for longer scenario. We are also expecting higher fee income on service charges resulting from higher lending related fees as loan volume continue to be strong. Moving to expenses, we expect a modest increase from the second quarter due to marketing expenses to help replace time deposit runoff in the direct bank, as well as professional fees and temporary manpower as we ramp up project spend related to a few regulatory items. Furthermore, as Frank mentioned earlier, we continue to focus on building out our risk and technology capabilities and continue to make some strategic hires on these themes resulting in higher salaries and benefit expenses. All of this will be partially offset by continued acquisition synergy, which I spoke to earlier. We expect to achieve the lower 25% band of our cost base goal by the end of 2024. These savings will be offset by continued capability build out for regulatory capabilities as well as cost related to the strategic priorities to maximize growth and our core lines of business and optimize our systems and processes. Adjusted efficiency ratio is expected to remain in the low 50% range in 2024. Longer term, especially if we enter a set rate step cycle, we expect it to gravitate towards the mid-50s as our net interest margin compresses and we continue to make investments into areas that will help us scale efficiently in the future and be ready for category three status when we cross that threshold. Looking at the full year, we anticipate adjusted non-interest expense to be in the range of $4.65 billion to $4.7 billion in line with our previous guidance. For both the third quarter and full year 2024, we expect our tax rate to be in the range of 27% to 28%, which is exclusive of any discrete items. In summary, we are very pleased with our performance this quarter and will begin our share repurchase plan shortly. As Frank's comments earlier indicate, we will continue to grow in a prudent manner and allocate capital in alignment with our long-term focus and strong risk management framework. I will now turn it over to the operator for instructions for the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Steven Alexopoulos from JP Morgan. Steven please go ahead. Your line is open.\nSteven Alexopoulos : I want to start on the stock buyback, and I heard you that you want to get to the 10.5% CET-1 target by the end of \u201825. By our math $3.5 billion in 2025 -- through 2025 would leave you above 10.5%. Just curious by your math, is $3.5 billion of buybacks through the end of \u201825 get you to 10.5% CET-1?\nCraig Nix: Steve, this plan puts us on a path, the CET-1 in the 10.5% range by the end of 2025. And we anticipate the plan will be executed over the next four to five quarters, and we will be updating our capital plan in the first half of next year. So, you're right, and the ratios would be elevated, all things being equal right now, but to the extent that earnings accretion continues to outpace organic growth, we do contemplate another share repurchase plan in the back half of 2025. So, yes, they would be, if we stop here, they would be there. But we are giving ourselves room for organic growth. We will assess our capital plan and if we are again, creating earnings faster than organic growth, we would contemplate another plan to guide us down to that 10.5% range by the end of 2025.\nSteven Alexopoulos: Got it. Just given the valuation of the stock here, how do you think about front-loading the buybacks? Like do you think it'll be pretty even, I mean, I know you're the incentive system's, tangible book value growth based. What are your thoughts on that?\nFrank Holding : Well, we would obviously plan to front load obviously given that, especially if we anticipate stock price to continue to increase over time as our tangible book value increases. So, our plan is methodical but does have a heavier emphasis on the last half of \u201824. It's really not a straight line, but it is expected to occur over the next four to five quarters.\nSteven Alexopoulos: And then for my follow-up question, I'm curious, so the NII outlook and we know there's positives and negatives, and loan growth is helping. NII and you have purchase accounting accretion, and now we have rate cuts in the forecast. But if I look, so you're $1.8 billion NII for 2Q \u201824, basically implying the same for 3Q and 4Q. And Craig, if I look at consensus for 2025, it basically has the $1.8 billion sort of being the run rate for the next, call it six quarters or so. I'm just curious, given the strategies you're looking at, you talked about maybe mitigating some of the asset sensitivity, give it all of the puts and takes, do you see that as reasonable that NII sort of trends just flattish over the next several quarters? Just curious directly what you see, how you see this playing out. Thank you.\nFrank Holding: If we're looking at the exit margin in the fourth quarter, with zero rate cuts, we would be up and this is net income excretion, we would be up low to mid-single digits with zero rate cuts with one, we would be up low single digits, and with three we would be up low single digits. Fast forward to \u201825 exit with zero cuts, we would be up mid-high single digits with one cut and four next year we would be up low single digits. And then if we have three this year and four next year, we would be down low to mid-single digits in terms of net interest income.\nSteven Alexopoulos: Just so I understand, so if we get two follow the forward curve, which is two this year and four next year, where does that leave NII?\nFrank Holding: It leaves, NII downloads mid-single digits from the fourth quarter \u201824, exit to the fourth quarter \u201825 exit. And that's in presumable thing. With the accreting it would be down mid to mid-single digits.\nOperator: The next question comes from Christopher Marinac from Janney Montgomery. Chris your line is open. Please go ahead.\nChristopher Marinac: Just wanted to talk about the capital levels and kind of what the lower bound may be as the buyback gets executed and would you revisit that as next year unfolds?\nFrank Holding : So as if -- what we would anticipate if we just executed this plan CT 1 ratio in the mid 11x fall share. But we would intend to -- if that's the case and our capital plan holds, we would intend to execute another plan and manage those ratios down to the 10.5% level at the end of \u201825.\nChristopher Marinac: And the timing for now for today's authorization is to do this in the next 12 months, Craig, or would it be really 18?\nCraig Nix: We're looking at four to five quarters in our proformas. Tom, do you want to comment on that?\nTom Eklund: Craig mentioned we're slightly fronted in the plan, but still trying to space it out over sort of the next four to five quarters and wrap it up and really get on that large bank capital planning cycle and sort of reassess again, first half of next year and then hopefully come back with a new plan.\nChristopher Marinac: Thank you, and just a quick follow-up on, on the venture capital space and do you see any improvement there as you look through the next few quarters?\nCraig Nix: [Indiscernible] did you hear that question?\nUnidentified Company Representative: Sure. Happy to take that. This is Mark [Indiscernible], as we've alluded to it remains a bit mixed in terms of the outlook for venture investment. We saw a nice uptick this quarter to $55.6 billion, which was initially encouraging you peel that number apart. There were two very big ones, big investments in there that net of those makes for a quarter that looked a lot like \u201823 and in the first quarter of \u201824. And so, there's certainly a lot of optimism out there, have not yet seen it translate, and it's really unclear if we'll see that over the next couple of quarters at this time.\nOperator: Next question comes from Casey Haire from Jefferies. Casey your line is open. Please go ahead.\nCasey Haire : Great. Thanks. Good morning everyone. Wanted to touch on the loan to deposit ratio. It did tick up here a little bit in the quarter on some pretty nice loan growth. I know you guys have a long-term goal to drive that lower. If SVB kind of returned to form the 165% level currently, obviously that would go a long way. Just wondering, can you comment on how the SVB depositors, deposit are behaving like your ability to drive that loan to deposit ratio back to what was a very deposit rich vertical and help you achieve these targets?\nFrank Holding: I'll start, let Tom maybe amplified here. We started the acquisition around 99% -- loan deposit, it did pick up from 90% to 92%. So, we're making really good progress, getting it to our sort of mid-eighties target range. And we feel confident that over the next 3.5 years as we work down this purchase money net debt from the FDIC, that we can achieve that range. Tom, you have any comment on that?\nTom Eklund: Only thing I'd add on sort of the SVB side, I mean we're obviously encouraged, we saw deposit growth during the quarter, that being said, we're looking holistically at the client relationship there, making sure we put them in the right products, you see off balance sheet products when they're better suited for the clients. So, we're not binary narrowly focused on the deposit growth there. And also looking to, Craig mentioned earlier, general banks to drive, drop a portion of that the -- growth needed as well.\nFrank Holding: Keep in mind, given that SVB deposit can be sort of transitory, especially in this environment. The direct bank is a level we can pull as well.\nCasey Haire: Thank you. And then just my follow up on the, you guys mentioned that you've moved $5 billion into the bond portfolio to sort of dampen the asset sensitivity profile. Is there anything more that you can do on that front to mitigate the impact from Fed cuts?\nCraig Nix: Our asset sensitivity, we embarked on this four quarters ago. Our asset sensitivity was around 20% and a 200-basis point rate shop, we've got into that down to around 14% with these actions. That's about two thirds of the path to where we'd like to be, which is somewhere in the 10% to 12% range. So, we're very close to that as we sit here today, and that 10% to 12% range is where we were pre SVB. I think, we're making good progress there and we're TBD [ph] focused. So, what happens there? Rates go down 200 basis points about a billion-dollar shot to not manage this income. However, on the AOCI side, it would more than compensate with increased value of the investment portfolio to TBD where, where a balance sheet position would be neutral. Tom, is there anything else you'd like to add?\nTom Eklund : The only thing I'd add is, is tactically we did add some hedges during the quarter as well. We put on $2.5 billion for the cashflow hedging on the variable rates, moving some of that pricing out over the next 12\u2026.\nCraig Nix: Ranges to that to $4 billion.\nTom Eklund: Yes, total, and their interest rate hedges cashflow and fair value interest rate hedges.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Now, as we have no further questions, I'll hand the call back to Deanna Hart for any concluding remarks.\nDeanna Hart: Thank you, everyone for joining us today, and we hope you have a great day. Thanks.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you very much for your attendance. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Frank Holding",
            "content": "Thank you, Deanna. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our earnings call. Starting on page six, and this is the second quarter snapshot slide. We delivered another quarter of solid financial results, including peer-leading return on assets, net interest margin, adjusted efficiency ratio, loan growth, CET 1 ratio and loan portfolio yield. Our board has approved a share repurchase plan allowing us to repurchase shares in an aggregate amount up to $3.5 billion. And Craig will speak to those details later. And I'd like to point out that we were recently included in the Fortune 500 list for the first time. Continuing on to Page 7, I'll take a look at well, I'll take a moment to focus on our business segment performance as well as their outlooks moving forward. Starting with the General Bank, we saw positive loan trends as growth remain particularly resilient in business and commercial loans within our branch network. We also experienced strong growth in our SBA, SVB private and wealth channels. Importantly, we have not made any significant changes in our risk appetite or client selection to chase growth as we feel our expertise and deep client relationships position us well to continue to grow prudently. Deposit growth in our branch network during the first half of the year exceeded our expectations. Looking forward, we see new production and client acquisition contributing to further balance sheet growth. We also see growth coming from deepening our relationships with existing customers, including SVB acquired customers. On the downside, we recognize that reductions in interest rates will cause margin compression. However, we are building strategies to mitigate the expected negative impact, including a focus on the mix of our deposits by targeting operating accounts, growing quality loans, and improving non-interest income from all sources. Our commercial bank segment continued to deliver strong loan growth driven by several of our specialized industry verticals, primarily in project financing for energy and data centers. CRE volume remains challenged, driven by the higher for longer interest rate environment, deal volume is expected to remain muted during the second half of the year. While portfolio stress is expected to remain above historic levels in equipment finance, we expect loss rates to decline in the second half of the year and into 2025. From a production standpoint, we expect this segment to continue to benefit. First from liquidity concerns, bringing the market rates on a greater number of transactions into our target range. And second, from a focus on originating larger, higher quality transactions. Funding for the commercial bank is aided by our nationwide online direct bank with more than 700,000 core deposit accounts. We plan to continue to use the direct bank as a lever to grow core deposits in the current environment where pricing, pressure and competition remain high. Turning to SVB commercial, we achieved quarter-over-quarter loan growth driven by high-quality loans in our global fund banking or capital call lending business. The uptick in loans reflects both the increased level of investment activity, driving up utilization and global fund banking's continued success in winning the fund banking business of active VC and PC investors. Encouragingly, we are, we also witnessed a quarter-over-quarter increase in SVB commercial total client funds for the first time, since the fourth quarter of 2021, SVB commercial deposits increased for the first time since the first quarter of 2022. These increases were driven by slight improvement in the macroeconomic environment and client acquisition. As we look ahead, it is too early to call an innovation economy turnaround, despite increasing deal counts and encouraging investment trends. We are encouraged that the rebound will be significant as high levels of BC dry powder remain a strong catalyst for future growth. We expect that positive trends, that the positive trends that we saw in the second quarter could continue to result in gradual improvement in the second half of this year, but remain guarded about the absolute levels of deposit growth given the continued headwinds in the environment. Our SVB team remains the bank of choice for the innovation economy. Moving on to Page 8, our strategic priorities have not changed. Given our growth over the past few years, we have been focused on maturing our risk management framework and overall regulatory environment. We have made significant enhancements not only to meet category four large financial institution requirements, but to develop those capabilities in ways that are scalable through category three expectations. To conclude, we're continuing to see positive momentum in our businesses, while we recognize uncertainty remains in the current macroeconomic environment. We are committed to deepening customer relationships, prudently growing core deposits and loans, and allocating capital. We remain in a position of strength, and I'm excited about the opportunities ahead of us in 2024 and beyond. Craig, I'll turn it over to you. Well, we would obviously plan to front load obviously given that, especially if we anticipate stock price to continue to increase over time as our tangible book value increases. So, our plan is methodical but does have a heavier emphasis on the last half of \u201824. It's really not a straight line, but it is expected to occur over the next four to five quarters. If we're looking at the exit margin in the fourth quarter, with zero rate cuts, we would be up and this is net income excretion, we would be up low to mid-single digits with zero rate cuts with one, we would be up low single digits, and with three we would be up low single digits. Fast forward to \u201825 exit with zero cuts, we would be up mid-high single digits with one cut and four next year we would be up low single digits. And then if we have three this year and four next year, we would be down low to mid-single digits in terms of net interest income. It leaves, NII downloads mid-single digits from the fourth quarter \u201824, exit to the fourth quarter \u201825 exit. And that's in presumable thing. With the accreting it would be down mid to mid-single digits. So as if -- what we would anticipate if we just executed this plan CT 1 ratio in the mid 11x fall share. But we would intend to -- if that's the case and our capital plan holds, we would intend to execute another plan and manage those ratios down to the 10.5% level at the end of \u201825. I'll start, let Tom maybe amplified here. We started the acquisition around 99% -- loan deposit, it did pick up from 90% to 92%. So, we're making really good progress, getting it to our sort of mid-eighties target range. And we feel confident that over the next 3.5 years as we work down this purchase money net debt from the FDIC, that we can achieve that range. Tom, you have any comment on that?

            "name": "Craig Nix",
            "content": "Thank you, Frank, and all of you joining us today. My comments will be anchored to the key takeaways found on page 10. Pages 11 through 28 provide more details underlying our second quarter results. I'll start with a $3.5 billion share repurchase plan that Frank just mentioned. Using capital to support organic growth remains our top priority, but strong earnings has led to an excess capital position. Share repurchases provides an opportunity for us to return capital to our shareholders into more efficient capital level over time. We manage capital ratios, excluding any benefit from the shared loss agreement, and all planned capital activities are assessed in this context. We intend to supplement organic capital use with methodical share repurchases with the ultimate goal of managing our adjusted CET-1 ratio down to the 10.5% range by the end of 2025. This repurchase plan puts us on that path. Moving forward, we will assess capital management strategies based on balance sheet growth expectations, earnings trajectories, and economic and regulatory environments. This will be reflected in our next capital plan, which will be completed in the first quarter of 2025. To the extent that capital increase from earnings continues to outpace organic growth, we expect share repurchases to continue beyond this plan. Turning to second quarter results, all of our return metrics exceeded our expectations. ROE and ROA adjusted for notable items for 14.05% and 1.391% respectively. Headline net interest income increased slightly over the late quarter -- higher interest income was partially offset by lower accretion and higher deposit costs. While modest, the increase in headline net interest income followed three quarters of sequential declines where interest expense on deposit was increasing at a faster pace than interest income. During the second quarter, while interest in expense on deposits increase, the pace slowed. Given the likelihood of fed rate cuts, we continued to mitigate a portion of our asset sensitivity profile by moving an additional $5 billion of cash into short duration securities in the investment portfolio. Headline, NIM contracted modestly by 3 basis points and 3.64%. ex accretion NIM increase by one basis point to 3.36% signaling that deposit pressures, while still present continue to stabilize and were more than offset by the benefit of strong loan origination. Before the second quarter, NIM ex accretion had declined in the previous three quarters. Adjusted non-interest income was slightly better than expected due to higher client investment fees, aided by increase in average balances in SVB commercial off-balance sheet client funds offsetting the expected decrease in net rental income on rail operated lease equipment. Rental income with negatively impacted by a return for more normalized maintenance expenses in line with expectations we laid out last quarter. Adjusted non-interest expense came in at the lower end of our guidance range increasing sequentially by approximately 1%. Expense growth was concentrated and equipment expenses related to accelerated depreciation on assets that will no longer be used following the SVB acquisition and favorable variances in prior periods related to reimbursement from third parties. Second quarter expenses also reflected higher marketing expense, as we increased focus on retaining clients and the direct bank channel to help offset expected maturity in their time deposits and in broker deposits. We continue to execute on cost savings from the acquisition and maintain vigilance on overall expense management. We are now close to achieving the lower end of our cost savings estimate and anticipate achieving it by the end of the year. Credit continues to stabilize during the quarter net charge offs at $132 million or 0.38% were on the low end of our guidance range, and non-performing loans remained relatively stable, while losses increased modestly over the link quarters, they were largely in the same portfolios as previous quarters, and we noted no emergent problems outside of those pressure points. Encouragingly, while we saw continued stress in the small ticket leasing portfolio and the investor dependent portfolios, we saw modest improvement in our general office portfolio. While this is a good sign given the continued focus on CRE, particularly CRE office, we do not believe this is indicative of any shift in current stress within that portfolio and really more of a function of one resolution timing. We continue to be well reserved with an allowance of 11.84% on the commercial bank office portfolio covering second quarter net charge offs 2 times. Overall, the allowance ratio decreased 6 basis points to 1.22% with the most significant factor related to a mixed shift from recent growth in the global fund banking portfolio, which carries a low reserve percentage. The decrease is also driven by lower specific reserves on individually evaluated loans, reasonably consistent credit quality trends and positive changes in macroeconomic forecast. All these factors were partially offset by an increase in loan volume, while the allowance did decline this quarter, we feel good about our overall reserve coverage as well as coverage on the portfolios experiencing stress. Moving to the balance sheet, loans grew about $4 billion over the link quarter, an annualized growth rate of 11.8%. Growth was led by a $2.1 billion increase in FCD commercial driven by the global fund banking capital call lending business. These increases were partially offset, I expected decline in technology and healthcare banking given continued payoff and increased competition. The general bank and commercial bank segments also grew loans by $1.5 billion and $386 million respectively. While the broader industry continues to experience tepid loan growth, we continue to see broad base expansion across our business segments, as Frank mentioned earlier. Turning to the right-hand side of the balance sheet, deposit grew in an annualized rate of 4% or by $1.4 billion -- $1.5 billion due to strong core deposit growth and SVB commercial and in the general bank. In SVB commercial, we saw deposit score by $1.9 million, a $329 million increase in the general bank was driven by our continuing emphasis on expanding relationships with current customers and attracting new ones. These increases were partially offset by expected declines in broker deposits and in direct bank deposit of $527 million and $145 million respectively. The decline in the direct bank was due to a $1.9 billion decrease in time deposit, partially offset by a $1.8 billion increase in savings account, giving the pricing on -- and the expectations that rates will decline in the second half. 2024. We made the strategic decision to let these roll off and will continue to grow core deposit to offset this decline. Moving to capital, our CET-1 ratio declined by 11 basis points sequentially, ending the quarter at 13.33%. This was driven by a continued decline and the benefit provided by the shared loss agreement, which added approximately 85 basis points to the ratio this quarter down 22 basis points from the first quarter. The CET-1 ratio excluding the benefits of the shared loss agreement, increased 11 basis points from the linked quarter and earnings growth, again, outpaced organic growth. I'll close on page 28 with our third quarter 2024 and full year outlook. On loans, we move our expectations higher given the starting point at the beginning of the third quarter and solid momentum in our pipelines. We anticipate high single-digit annualized percentage growth in the third quarter, driven broadly across our business segments. We anticipate SVB commercial will benefit from growth in the global fund banking business, where we see success in client outreach. While the second quarter benefit is from increased activity in commercial real estate funds, M&A and debt activity, the market continues to be challenged and remains somewhat unpredictable. While we do expect to see a modest increase in DC investment compared to 2023, we believe our growth will continue to be pressured by headwind in the private equity and venture capital markets. We also expect continued growth in our business and commercial loan portfolio within the General Bank. In the commercial bank, we anticipate our specialty vertical will be key contributors to continued loan growth. We also continue to expand our middle market banking business and expect to see positive momentum from the strategic moves. Looking at the full year, we expect loans to end in the $143 billion to $146 billion range for mid to high single digits percentage growth on a year-over-year basis. We anticipate this growth to be concentrated across all three banking segments for the reasons previously discussed. We expect deposits to be up slightly in the $152 billion to $154 billion range in the third quarter due to growth in the general bank. We expect relatively flat balances in SVB commercial due to continued cash burn in the still muted fundraising environment. We anticipate growth in the branch network as we benefit from increasing our customer base by building deposits through successful execution of our organic growth and relationship banking strategy. For the full year, we anticipate deposits in the $153 billion to $155 billion range, primarily related to growth in the General Bank previously discussed flat to modestly increases and increasing balances in SVB commercial supplemented by growth in the direct bank if needed. We anticipate the direct bank remaining flat to modestly higher through the end of the year as expiring time deposits are offset by money market and savings growth. This is in line with our strategy of reducing higher cost CDs and the direct bank, we have the option to bring down rates quicker. Should the fed cut cycle be more aggressive than anticipated, while providing a strong source of insured customer consumer deposit in our funding base. The current implied forward curve indicates a 98% probability of two rate cuts in the second half of this year. Our interest rate forecast covers a range of one to three rate cuts with the effective Fed funds rate declining from 5.50% currently to a range of 4.75% to 5.25% by the end of the year. These projections do include the impact of plan purchase activity in the back half of 2024. For the third quarter, if we get one rate cut, we expect headline net interest income to be relatively flat with the second quarter. Given that our forecast cost for the cut in September. We expect that lower accretion; slightly higher deposit cost and a slightly lower loan yield will be offset by higher investment securities yield. For the full year, we expect headline net interest income in the range of $7.2 billion to $7.3 billion up from our previous guide of $7.1 billion to $7.3 billion, reflecting the higher for longer rate environment, as well as potential rate cuts in the updated forecast occurring later in 2024. In either case, we continue to project loan accretion of just over $500 million for the year over a $200 million decline for 2023 as loan discount from the shorter portfolios will have been fully recognized. On credit losses, while we have experienced positive trends in recent quarters, we do anticipate continued elevated net charge off in the investor dependent general office and equipment finance portfolios. We anticipate third quarter net charge off in the 35 basis points to 45 basis points range, but are lowering the full year range to 35 basis points to 40 basis points given lower losses during the first half of the year. We do caution that many of our portfolios in the commercial bank and SVB commercial have large hold sizes and one or two of these ones curating unexpectedly could influence this range. In commercial real estate higher for longer rates continue to have effect on value being felt most heavily in the general office sector where market liquidity support refinancing remains scarce. We expect these market dynamics will continue to elevate losses within this portfolio for the remainder of 2024. We're seeing some green sheets in the investor-dependent portfolio and we believe that continued market optimism and a greater consensus on valuation is an encouraging sign that should help reduce some pressure. Still given the uncertainty of the innovation economy, we do expect continued stress throughout 2024. Moving to adjusted non-interest income, we expect the third quarter to be materially in line to down low single digits from the link quarter. We expect full year adjusted non-interest income to be in the range of $1.85 billion to $1.9 billion, which is slightly higher than our previous guidance. This is driven by a rail outlook as we expect a continuation of healthy fundamental trends in the near term from a supply driven recovery, which is generating strong demand for existing real cars, resulting in a stronger for longer scenario. We are also expecting higher fee income on service charges resulting from higher lending related fees as loan volume continue to be strong. Moving to expenses, we expect a modest increase from the second quarter due to marketing expenses to help replace time deposit runoff in the direct bank, as well as professional fees and temporary manpower as we ramp up project spend related to a few regulatory items. Furthermore, as Frank mentioned earlier, we continue to focus on building out our risk and technology capabilities and continue to make some strategic hires on these themes resulting in higher salaries and benefit expenses. All of this will be partially offset by continued acquisition synergy, which I spoke to earlier. We expect to achieve the lower 25% band of our cost base goal by the end of 2024. These savings will be offset by continued capability build out for regulatory capabilities as well as cost related to the strategic priorities to maximize growth and our core lines of business and optimize our systems and processes. Adjusted efficiency ratio is expected to remain in the low 50% range in 2024. Longer term, especially if we enter a set rate step cycle, we expect it to gravitate towards the mid-50s as our net interest margin compresses and we continue to make investments into areas that will help us scale efficiently in the future and be ready for category three status when we cross that threshold. Looking at the full year, we anticipate adjusted non-interest expense to be in the range of $4.65 billion to $4.7 billion in line with our previous guidance. For both the third quarter and full year 2024, we expect our tax rate to be in the range of 27% to 28%, which is exclusive of any discrete items. In summary, we are very pleased with our performance this quarter and will begin our share repurchase plan shortly. As Frank's comments earlier indicate, we will continue to grow in a prudent manner and allocate capital in alignment with our long-term focus and strong risk management framework. I will now turn it over to the operator for instructions for the Q&A portion of the call. Steve, this plan puts us on a path, the CET-1 in the 10.5% range by the end of 2025. And we anticipate the plan will be executed over the next four to five quarters, and we will be updating our capital plan in the first half of next year. So, you're right, and the ratios would be elevated, all things being equal right now, but to the extent that earnings accretion continues to outpace organic growth, we do contemplate another share repurchase plan in the back half of 2025. So, yes, they would be, if we stop here, they would be there. But we are giving ourselves room for organic growth. We will assess our capital plan and if we are again, creating earnings faster than organic growth, we would contemplate another plan to guide us down to that 10.5% range by the end of 2025. We're looking at four to five quarters in our proformas. Tom, do you want to comment on that? [Indiscernible] did you hear that question? Our asset sensitivity, we embarked on this four quarters ago. Our asset sensitivity was around 20% and a 200-basis point rate shop, we've got into that down to around 14% with these actions. That's about two thirds of the path to where we'd like to be, which is somewhere in the 10% to 12% range. So, we're very close to that as we sit here today, and that 10% to 12% range is where we were pre SVB. I think, we're making good progress there and we're TBD [ph] focused. So, what happens there? Rates go down 200 basis points about a billion-dollar shot to not manage this income. However, on the AOCI side, it would more than compensate with increased value of the investment portfolio to TBD where, where a balance sheet position would be neutral. Tom, is there anything else you'd like to add? Ranges to that to $4 billion."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.\n I would now like to introduce the host of this conference call, Ms. Deanna Hart Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin. \nDeanna Hart: Good morning. Welcome to First Citizens first quarter earnings call.\n Joining me on the call today our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Frank Holding; and Chief Financial Officer, Craig Nix. They will provide first core business and financial update referencing our earnings call presentation, which you can find on our website. \n Our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. We assume no obligation to update such statements. These risks are outlined on Page 3.\n We will also reference non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures against the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in Section 5 of the prediction. Finally, First Citizens does not respond for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of earnings transcripts provided by third parties.\n I'll now turn it over to Frank. \nFrank Holding: Thank you, Deanna, and good morning, everyone. Let's start on Page 6. And I'll say that over the last 12 months, we've successfully focused on our SVB integration efforts, regulatory readiness, strategic priorities and financial performance. During the first quarter, we delivered earnings per share of $52.92 adjusting for notable items that are on Page 51.\n Return metrics were strong, reflecting a peer-leading net interest margin, an adjusted efficiency ratio of 50% and the lower net charge-offs. These results exceeded our expectations with earnings increasing approximately 14% over the sequential quarter. We're pleased that all our segments, including SVB Commercial, grew loans during the quarter and our liquidity and capital position strengthened due to core deposits and earnings growth.\n We successfully submitted our capital plan to the Federal Reserve on April the 5th. The process included a full stress test, including the acquired SVB portfolios. The mission of this plan was an important milestone in our regulatory journey, and I'd like to thank all our associates for their hard work in submitting a quality plan.\n Turning to Page 7. It's been a year since Silicon Valley Bank became part of First Citizens, which is -- which has introduced a lot of change, but most of all, opportunity. I want to thank our associates for their hard work over the past year, stabilizing the business and taking care of our clients. I also want to thank our clients for their confidence in us as we remain committed to them and the innovation economy.\n The SVB team continues to deliver exceptional service to our clients, and this is demonstrated by the fact that 80% of the VC firms on the Forbes\u2019 Midas list are served by our company, and our ability to onboard over 1,000 new clients in the first year of our acquisition. SVB also has more experience serving the innovation economy than any other financial services provider, thanks to our dedicated teams of sector experts.\n Their essential insights come from over 40 years of dedicated focus on innovators and investors on average leadership tenure of over 20 years with SVB and the deepest and most experienced bench of over 1,500 innovation bankers and relationship advisers. Our team is well positioned despite some of the continued economic headwinds facing the innovation economy.\n Last year, VC fundraising hit its lowest level since 2017. The drawback in fundraising we witnessed in 2023 continued into the first quarter, even though there remains plenty of dry powder to invest. Despite the current environment, we are encouraged by the number of exit-ready companies poised to exit once the IPO market fully reopens.\n In fact, there is a record backlog of companies ready to exit given current market conditions. There is fundamental demand from investors, but only at the right price and for companies with good stories. We are beginning to see activity improve and the signs that IPO activity may pick up this year.\n On Page 8, we showed that the SVB franchise has been stabilizing in terms of loans and client funds since the second quarter of last year, reflecting continued support of our innovation clients.\n Moving to Page 9. Our integration efforts helped us retain clients, stabilize deposit balances and develop strategic priorities for the combined organization. We continue to make meaningful progress on integration and remain committed to achieving our post-merger potential.\n While we have always focused on compliance with regulatory requirements, our growth has moved us to a significantly increased level of regulatory oversight, and we are investing and being proactive in enhancing our regulatory readiness. While there is more work to be done, we have made meaningful progress in maturing and refining our processes to support the change in our size and complexity.\n A few of these accomplishments include: First, implementing expanded risk management capabilities based on feedback from third-party GAAP assessment; second, creating a dedicated regulatory remediation oversight team to manage and enhance regulatory response as well as provide oversight, monitoring and reporting of remediation efforts; third, enhancing our dedicated regulatory affairs team to manage heightened regulatory activity and relationships with new examiners; and fourth, completing our first time large financial institution regulatory filings on time.\n In addition, with our strong risk management culture, we will continue to invest in our capabilities here and we're confident that over time we will effectively transform our program in accordance with new and changing regulatory requirements.\n Now let's look at Page 10. We continue to invest in our wealth business, one of our primary key income drivers. We believe there are significant opportunities and we've achieved remarkable organic growth here since 2013. In the third quarter, we announced the alignment of SVB Private and First Citizens Wealth under one leadership team to improve coordination and enhance services available to clients.\n Wealth is beginning to see the benefits of bringing our capabilities together under one umbrella, creating a premier private banking and wealth business. Most recently, we rebranded all of our wealth services to First Citizens Wealth. The combined First Citizens Wealth organization can help any client business or institution regardless of size or complexity.\n We remain focused on maintaining deep client relationships, providing a boutique experience with big bank capabilities. Moving forward, we believe our combined product set dedicated and experienced wealth professionals and client-centric engaged model. We'll continue to celebrate -- to accelerate the growth of our wealth franchise.\n And finally, turning to Page 11. We're happy to be recognized and honored as a top 20 financial institution on Forbes list of America's Best Banks and by other organizations and publications listed on the page. This recognition reflects our solid track record taking care of our clients and our customers.\n To conclude, the positive momentum we started in 2023 continues. Despite the uncertainty in the current environment, and the hard work ahead of us, we continue to protect and grow customer relationships, stabilize the SVB franchise, grow core deposits and loans and strengthen our balance sheet. Given our position of strength and dedicated associates, I'm excited about the opportunities ahead of it -- ahead of us.\n And with that, Craig, I'll turn it over to you. \nCraig Nix: Thank you, Frank. Appreciate everyone joining us today. I'm going to anchor my comments to the key themes outlined in the takeaways on Page 14. Pages 15 through 35 provides more detail supporting our first quarter results.\n As Frank mentioned, our return metrics were strong and above our expectations. ROE and ROA adjusted for notable items were 15.01% and 1.46%, respectively. Compared to the fourth quarter, these metrics benefited from a 13% increase in net income, driven by lower net charge-offs and higher noninterest income, partially offset by lower accretion income and higher deposit costs.\n While net interest income declined from the linked quarter by 5%, it was above our expectations. The decline was related to lower accretion income and higher deposit costs. These impacts were somewhat mitigated by securities and loan portfolio repricing to higher rates during the quarter.\n NIM contracted by 19 basis points to 3.67% mostly due to the same factors affecting the decline in net interest income. Ex accretion, NIM declined by 12 basis points to 3.35%. Adjusted noninterest income increased by 5% over the fourth quarter. A majority of the increase consisted of higher net rental income on rail operating lease equipment. Net rental income was aided by strong utilization rates that surpassed 99%, the highest level since the second quarter of 2015, also a positive repricing trends as well as lower maintenance costs.\n As you will recall, we pulled forward maintenance qualification activity during the fourth quarter, which positions us to handle the uptick in customer volume this quarter while front-loading some of the expenses. Maintenance costs also benefited from unanticipated delays in getting railcars to maintenance facilities. As a result, we model higher maintenance costs for the remainder of the year as service levels returned to normal.\n Noninterest income also benefited from an increase in the fair value of customer derivative positions due to higher interest rates. These increases were partially offset by lower capital markets income related to seasonality as well as increased competition as regional banks continue to return to normal activity following last year's pullback.\n Stripping out some of the seasonality and focusing on a year-over-year comparison, capital markets income was up roughly $5 million from syndicated deals. Adjusted noninterest expense slightly beat our expectation, increasing sequentially by less than 2%.\n Expense growth was concentrated in salaries and benefits and seasonal adjustments associated with our 401(k), higher payroll taxes and annual merit adjustments took effect. First quarter expenses also reflected higher FDIC insurance expense.\n Effectively managing expenses remains a top priority for us given headwinds to net interest income. We are on track to achieve the low end of our 25% to 30% synergies target for SVB by the end of this year. Focusing on credit, net charge-offs declined by $74 million from the sequential quarter to $103 million. This represents a charge-off -- net charge-off ratio of 0.31% below our previous guidance of 50 to 60 basis points.\n Losses were largely in the same portfolio as previous quarters, although at a lower rate. The largest decline was in the innovation portfolio, where net charge-offs were down $30 million sequentially led by a $19 million drop in the investor dependent portfolio. The remainder was spread between equipment finance, general office and other loan portfolios.\n At quarter end, the allowance plus purchase discount on the investor dependent portfolio was 8.2% covering first quarter annualized net charge-offs 2.9x and the last 4 quarters, 1.9x. Consistent with prior quarters, net charge-offs within the commercial bank were concentrated in the general office and small ticket equipment leasing portfolios.\n As a reminder, while our total general office portfolio was $2.8 billion at the end of the quarter, the portfolio where we have seen stress in charge-offs is in Class B, repositioned bridge loans within the commercial bank, which totaled $1 billion at quarter end.\n Portfolio net charge-offs were down sequentially, but we continue to monitor the risks here. The allowance on this portfolio was 11.1%, covering first quarter annualized net charge-offs 1.6x in the last 4 quarter net charge-offs 1.4x.\n Overall, the allowance decreased 3 basis points sequentially to 1.28% due to improvement in macroeconomic forecasts, a mix shift to higher credit quality segments and lower specific reserves, all partially offset by increased volume and mild credit quality deterioration.\n While the allowance did decline this quarter, we feel good about our overall reserve coverage on the portfolios where we continue to see stress. Our credit team continually monitors our loan portfolios by reviewing delinquency trends and grading migration by industry and/or geography to identify areas of potential stress. And at this time, we are not aware of other significant pockets of deterioration.\n Moving to the balance sheet. Loans grew by more than $2 billion over the linked quarter and annualized growth rate of 6.2%. The General and Commercial segments grew loans by $900 million and $794 million, respectively, and the SVB Commercial segment was up by $335 million. General Bank growth was concentrated in small business and commercial loans generated in our branch network.\n In the Commercial Bank, growth was driven by strong production in our industry verticals particularly in TMT, healthcare and energy. Growth in our TMT vertical continues to be driven by strong demand for new data centers, while our energy vertical is benefiting from the energy transition, which is driving activity in financing renewable energy projects.\n Finally, the increase in SVB commercial loans related to global fund banking growth. And despite increased competition in this space, we continue to win business. To that end, our team closed more than $5 billion in deals in the first quarter. While we are excited by the positive trends in global fund banking, we recognize that the macroeconomic environment still presents headwinds. In the first quarter, VC investment came in lower than expected amid macroeconomic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions.\n While VC dry powder remains elevated despite ongoing fundraising sluggishness, we expect it to take time to gradually deploy those investments. However, we remain well positioned to ramp up both loans and deposits quickly when the macroeconomic environment improves given, we have the largest fund finance team in the market.\n Within the SVB Commercial segment, growth in global fund banking was partially offset by expected declines in our technology and health care banking business as pay downs outpaced new fundings due to continued headwinds in the private investment landscape.\n While we've seen some encouraging activity in the IPO market, we do not expect an immediate reset given continued fundraising and valuation mismatches. We are well positioned to capture business as the pendulum swings back. Technology and healthcare banking team has a focused approach and our track record and expertise in the innovation economy will continue to help us win deals. We are encouraged by our progress in growing the new SVB commercial brand, winning new clients and bringing those back who left.\n Turning to the right-hand side of the balance sheet. Deposits grew at an annualized rate of 10.4% or by $3.8 billion in the first quarter due to strong core deposit growth in the General and Direct Banks.\n In the General Bank, we continue to focus on growing customer deposits, and we're pleased to see these grew by $2.4 billion due to our continued emphasis on expanding relationships with current customers and attracting new accounts. Direct bank deposits increased by over $2 billion, despite a decrease in marketing expense during the quarter.\n While the Direct Bank channel is higher cost and now accounts for 27% of our deposit base is an additional lever, we've used to remain resilient through a turbulent environment and is a strong source of insured consumer deposits funding our earnings base. Growth in this channel enabled us to continue to redeem some of our smaller subordinated debt issuances this quarter given our excess capital and liquidity positions.\n These increases were partially offset by expected declines in the SVB Commercial segment. Deposits were down $760 million from the linked quarter driven by continued client cash burn and muted fundraising activity.\n Moving to capital. Our CET1 ratio increased by 8 basis points sequentially, ending the quarter at 13.44%. Our shared loss agreement added approximately 107 basis points to the ratio down from approximately 120 basis points last quarter. We continue to use capital to support organic growth, but acknowledge that we are operating with elevated capital levels.\n In addition to supporting organic growth, share repurchases are part of our capital distribution strategy. We assessed share repurchase as part of our capital plan that was approved by our Board during the first quarter and was submitted to our regulators earlier this month.\n While we have not yet received feedback from our regulators on the plan, we remain confident that a share repurchase plan will be an option for us in the second half of this year. While we don't have an approved share repurchase plan at this time, I will share some general information about how we intend to manage capital moving forward.\n We managed our capital ratios, excluding any benefit from the loss share agreement, which we refer to internally as adjusted CET1. All planned activities and capital levels are assessed in this context as the RWA benefit continues to run off at a rate of $1 billion to $2 billion per quarter and is expected to be mostly gone by the end of 2025.\n In addition to supporting organic growth and paying dividends, we intend to supplement that capital use with methodical share repurchase over time to get our adjusted CET1 ratio down to the 10.5% range by the end of 2025, which is the level it was following the acquisition of SVB.\n We do not intend to immediately manage capital down to this level. Instead, we intend to do it methodically and continually assess capital needs based on balance sheet growth expectations, earnings trajectories and the economic and regulatory environments over the next couple of years. We will reassess our capital management priorities on a regular basis, including annual updates to our capital plan.\n [indiscernible] both on Page 35, discussing our second quarter and 2024 full year outlook. In summary, for the full year, we moved our net interest income forecast up on the higher first quarter starting point and a reduction from 3 to 6 rate cuts to 0 to 3 rate cuts. We also moved our credit loss guidance down from the lower first quarter starting point. We have not materially changed our noninterest income and expense guidance.\n On loans, we anticipate low single-digit percentage growth in the second quarter, driven by growth in the General Bank, Commercial Bank and SVB Commercial. We anticipate SVB Commercial will benefit from continued growth in the global fund banking business, where we continue to see success due to continued client outreach.\n This growth, however, will continue to be pressured by headwinds in the private equity and venture capital markets. We also anticipate a modest decline in technology and healthcare banking business as lower levels of funding and line draws result in loan portfolio contraction.\n Looking at the innovation economy more broadly, we found that, overtime, there is a correlation between public market valuations and VC investment volume. There have been some positive economic signals suggesting that capital deployment may rebound in 2024, driven by an improved IPO outlook. We, therefore, expect a modest increase in VC investment compared to 2023.\n Meanwhile, we anticipate growth in the Commercial Bank in our industry verticals and increased activities in middle market banking following seasonal declines in the first quarter.\n Looking at the full year, we continue to expect loans to end in the $139 million to $143 billion range or mid-single-digit percentage growth, which is essentially unchanged from our previous guidance. We anticipate this growth to be concentrated across all 3 banking segments for the reasons previously discussed.\n We expect deposits to be flat to slightly up in the second quarter as growth in the General Bank is offset by a decline in SVB commercial. Within the General Bank, we anticipate growth in the branch network as we benefit from our focus on increasing our customer base by building deposits through proactive sales, associate outreach, centralized marketing campaigns and increased community connectivity. This growth will be slightly offset by seasonal declines that we expect in April due to tax payments.\n With respect to SVB deposits, we expect the venture capital environment to remain challenging, particularly in the first half of 2024. Looking forward, we expect client funds, cash burn and losses to continue to normalize over time with gradual improvement expected in the second half of the year.\n In addition, we expect to improve our capture rate of private market fundraising, a large percentage of which flows into on-balance sheet deposit products. Bringing this all together, we expect SVB deposits to be relatively flat in the first half of the year before growing in the second half.\n While we continue to raise deposits in our direct bank in the first quarter, we anticipate these deposits will remain fairly stable in 2024, given the excess liquidity on our balance sheet and continued strong growth in other channels including the branch network.\n This, obviously, could change if we have unexpected deposit outflows occur elsewhere. For the full year, we anticipate mid-single-digit percentage growth, primarily related to growth in the general bank previously discussed and low to mid-single-digit percentage growth in SVB commercial deposits.\n Our interest rate forecast follows the implied forward curve, which includes 3 rate cuts in 2024 with the effective Fed funds rate declining from 5.50% to 4.75% by the end of the year. It is our belief that we will see closer to one or no rate cuts given the continued strength of the labor markets, and the lumpiness we've seen in the economy fueling speculation that inflation remains untamed.\n Therefore, for our net interest income guidance, we provided a range with the top end assuming no rate cuts and the low end assuming 3 rate cuts. It is important to note that these projections do not include the impact of planned share repurchase activity in the back half of 2024 as we await final sizing and approval as part of our capital planning process.\n For the second quarter, we expect headline net interest income to be down in the low to mid-single-digit percentage points range. The decline will be driven by the impact of lower accretion, higher deposit costs and lower loan yields, assuming one rate cut only partially offset by higher investment securities yield. With no rate cut, we expect headline net interest income to be fairly stable with or just slightly down compared to the first quarter.\n For the full year, we expect headline net interest income in the range of $7.1 billion to $7.3 billion. In either case, we project accretion income just under $500 million for the year, which is a decline from $725 million in the last 3 quarters of 2023, as loan discounts on the shorter portfolio will have fully been recognized.\n We previously guided to a range of $6.9 billion to $7.1 billion. The upward revision reflects the higher for longer rate environment and shifting the guidance range between 0 and 3 cuts for the remainder of 2024.\n On credit losses, we are reducing our net charge-off guidance as we now anticipate it will remain in the 35 to 50 basis points range for both the second quarter and full year 2024. We are benefiting from the decreased innovation economy stress.\n And while losses in this portfolio can still be lumpy, we believe the continued market optimism fueled by the revival of public markets for PE and VC backed companies with 2 large tech IPOs already out the door in 2024, is an encouraging sign for venture exit activity.\n Accordingly, we expect some of the pressure in the investor dependent portfolio to soften in the back half of this year. It is worth noting that hold sizes on some of our portfolios are large in the Commercial and SVB Commercial segment. And just as we had a favorable experience this quarter with less large charge-offs in the innovation portfolio, 1 or 2 unexpected larger charge-offs can result in blips in our net charge-off ratio.\n Therefore, while the decline in net charge-offs during the first quarter was positive, we think it's too early to call an inflection point on credit following 1 quarter of improvement. However, we believe that credit costs remain manageable and are appropriately incorporated into our guidance.\n Moving to adjusted noninterest income. We expect the second quarter to be down as net rental income on rail operating leases decreases due to expected maintenance costs that were deferred in the first quarter, as I previously mentioned.\n While we anticipate some normalization to historically high utilization levels during 2024, our outlook for rail remains positive, and we expect a continuation of healthy fundamental trends in the near-term from a supply-driven recovery, which is generating strong demand for existing railcars, resulting in a stronger for longer scenario.\n We also expect client investment fees to decrease due to anticipated lower rates. To the extent we do not receive 3 rate cuts in 2024, we could see some upside to our forecast here. Nonetheless, we continue to experience growth in wealth management fees and card income, reflecting the strong consumer acquisition and growth trends from our branch network.\n We expect full year adjusted noninterest income to be in the $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion range, which is in line with our previous guidance. As Frank mentioned in his comments, we are excited for the continued build-out of -- and momentum in our wealth platform and look forward to realizing the synergies of this combination.\n Moving to expenses. We expect a modest increase from the first quarter due to increased marketing as well as professional and third-party servicing fees, as we ramp up project spend related to a few regulatory items, such as ISO Payments and Dodd-Frank.\n Furthermore, as mentioned last quarter, a continued focus for us is to build out the product capabilities that will keep us the premier partner in the innovation economy, continuing to enhance our offerings in cash management, FX and payments.\n Additionally, we will continue the modernization of our platforms in consumer, equipment finance and factoring to ensure we are well equipped to scale in the future. As we fine-tune our regulatory capabilities, we will also continue to make strategic hires that will help reinforce the skills of the great teams we already have assembled. All of this will be partially offset by continued acquisition synergies, which I spoke too earlier.\n While we expect to achieve the lower 25% band of our cost saves goal by the end of 2024, these savings will be offset by continued capability build-out for heightened regulatory expectations as well as costs related to the strategic priorities I just mentioned. Our adjusted efficiency ratio is expected to be in the low 50% range in 2024, up slightly from 49% for the full year of 2023.\n Looking at the full year, we anticipate adjusted noninterest expense to be up -- low to mid-single-digit percentage points, which equates to a range of $4.6 billion to $4.7 billion, unchanged from our previous guidance.\n For both the second quarter and full year we expect our tax rate to be in the range of 27% to 28%, which is exclusive of any discrete items.\n In closing, we remain steadfast in our long-term approach, focused on our clients and customers and committed to maintaining a strong risk management environment. I believe we have tremendous opportunity ahead of us as demonstrated by the successful first quarter and that we are well positioned for the future, thanks to our solid financial condition.\n I will now turn it over to the operator for instructions for the question-and-answer portion of the call. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Chris McGratty with KBW. \nChristopher McGratty: Craig, maybe with the view -- the market is, obviously -- suggesting higher for longer. Can you talk about what you're doing with the cash levels and the security purchases as you've got likely a few more quarters. How do we think about the normalization process? Has anything changed since last quarter? \nCraig Nix: I would say that right now, we're a little -- and intentionally a little heavy on cash through the optimal level. We're around 15%. We'd like to see that normalize to 10% to 15% over time. We're sitting a little slightly light on investments, but you've seen us deploy cash into the investment portfolio over the last 3 quarters, and we would expect to continue to do that maybe to the tune of $3 million to $4 billion before the end of the year.\n So we're very close to optimization, high on cash, but again, a little bit of that intentional given our purchase money -- the FDIC . Tom, do you have anything to add or amplify there? \nTom Eklund: No, I think you hit it. I mean if you look at the last 3 quarters, we've grown in that $4-ish billion range. And I think you can expect that to continue in the short-term. And to Craig's point, as cash comes down, we will eventually normalize and sort of slowdown that investment portfolio. \nChristopher McGratty: Okay. Great. And then as my follow-up, the improvement in credit, totally understand not wanting to declare victory yet. But given the marks that you have on the acquired portfolios and how stable credit was, how do we think about the reserve level? I mean, you released about $10 million in the quarter. How do we think in light of the charge-off guidance where reserves are trending? \nCraig Nix: Are you referring to the overall reserve coverage, Chris?\n Okay. I'm going to answer it -- I'll answer it both ways in. In terms of just overall coverage, we feel really good about where our reserves are. We covered quarter-to-date net charge-offs 4x this quarter, about 2.5x last quarter.\n We covered -- the allowance is now covers 2023 charge-offs almost 2.9x and nonaccrual loans 1.6x. On nonaccrual loans, what gives us comfort here, too, with respect to reserves is that we have analyzed over 70% of those loans for impairment on an individual basis, and our reserve ratio sits at around 30% on those.\n In terms of our stress portfolios, which I alluded to, overall, we have -- we covered first quarter net charge-off 2.8x in the last quarter to 1.8x. And that portfolio represents about 8% of loans, with 61% charge-offs. So we're feeling like we're prudently and conservatively reserved both for the specific loan portfolios, exhibiting stress and on the overall ACL. \nOperator: The next question comes from Brian Foran with Autonomous. \nBrian Foran: Just on the NII outlook this quarter versus what you gave last. Is it just the move to 0 to 3 rate cuts that move the range up? Or was it -- I guess, is it just the move in rate cuts? And if it's not just the move in rate cuts, what else got better in that? \nCraig Nix: It is the shift in the rate cuts. \nBrian Foran: Okay. And on the capital commentary, and I apologize because at least my line cut slightly as you were talking; a, I just want to clarify the go-to capital ratio, did you say 10; and then b, I was trying to compare what you said now versus last time, was the spirit just kind of reiterating what you've said before? Or was there any more caution implied with the methodically comment and the ex FDIC as the core ratio you're managing? \nCraig Nix: No. I think we're just reinforcing what we've said previously for share repurchases. And I would point out that over this 2-year period, we would intend to manage the CET1 down to the 10.5% range. \nBrian Foran: Okay. And is 9% to 10% still kind of a longer-term target? Or given the shift in the world is kind of 10.5% now more kind of the -- beyond 2025 landing point? \nCraig Nix: Well, the 9% to 10% was our previous target. We have proposed a new target range that we're not going to disclose today in our capital plan. But I can tell you that you shouldn't expect it to significantly change from the previous one. I want to give our regulators time to give us feedback on our capital plan that we just submitted a couple of weeks ago. But I would not -- you should now expect... \nBrian Foran: Okay. Do you think it's sneaking one leg... \nCraig Nix: Change in there. \nBrian Foran: Not expect a significant change from 9% to 10% long-term or? \nCraig Nix: That's correct. \nBrian Foran: Okay. Great. The last one just very quickly. I'm looking at Page 44 in your deck. Definitely here, I appreciate all the commentary on the SVB credit. A lot of the decline in provision dollars really came from the commercial legacy CIT book, can you just kind of give us the next round of color? I know there's a couple of comments on the -- on slide as well. But what drove the provision expense on legacy CIT down so much? \nCraig Nix: Well, they had -- I mean, their charge-off ratio has declined is same as the other portfolio. It's really the biggest move and 80% of the variance in our charge-offs, we're in the investor dependent portfolio.\n And there are 4 major factors there. We had no real large dollar charge-offs during the quarter. We had -- the fact that charge-offs on smaller loans were down and the number of charge-offs were also down, we had a good recovery quarter.\n So most of the drop in at least the net charge-off guidance and consequently the provision really related to that investor dependent portfolio. \nOperator: The next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. \nSteven Alexopoulos: I don't know if Marc is on the line, but I want to start on the SVB side. The 1Q VC investment was very weak, and I bought tied to that, we would see deposits decline at SVB. And also, I thought capital calls might come down a bit. Could you give some color on how you're able to maintain stable balances just given this not great backdrop? \nCraig Nix: Well, I'll let Marc amplify, but I think it's -- Marc -- are you on the line, Marc? I hear you. \nMarc Cadieux: I heat you. Go ahead and start, Craig. I'll... \nCraig Nix: Yes. I was just going to set the backdrop, Marc, and let you amplify, but we were encouraged in the first quarter new money coming into SVB, did increase over the first quarter. And while cash burn and losses to competitors remain fairly consistent, new cash flows did come in, they went disproportionately off-balance sheet, but this was the first quarter since the acquisition where the cash position remained neutral. First time, it has not been negative since we merged last year.\n And Marc, I'll let you give some color around that of how we're doing that. But again, we're pretty encouraged by what we're seeing there. \nMarc Cadieux: Yes. So Steve, it's Marc. And we'll follow-on. I think that was a great overview. And I think, ultimately, to your point, the -- what sounds like better-than-expected deposits in the quarter compared to what you would have expected, is a function, I think, of our continued momentum in the marketplace, the continued success we're having both in winning new business and bringing back clients as well. And as you see, that is -- that's really helping, and I think bodes well for the future if we can keep it up. \nSteven Alexopoulos: Got it. That's good color. For a follow-up, there's a lot of excitement at your talk about the potential for you guys to buy back stock. But I'm curious, given that tangible book value growth is a key performance metric for you guys, how price sensitive are you as it relates to buybacks moving forward? Is there a certain valuation where you're unlikely to buy back stock? Or are you pretty much committed to get down to the 10.5% range? \nCraig Nix: We don't buy it back blindly. So we do approach it similar to an approach on an open market acquisition, although there are differences -- obvious differences there with respect to risk. So we don't just blindly buy.\n Right now, we do see the stock at an attractive price. So we would anticipate repurchasing at that price. I'm not going to share at what levels we would trigger where we wouldn't, but we do consider that in our internal model. And it is our goal to manage down to that 10.5% range over the next 2 years on CET1.\n Tom, do you want to say anything else about that? \nTom Eklund: No. I mean, obviously, from a buyback and capital perspective to keep in the stock even more sense it makes. But -- no, I mean, we -- to Craig's point, if you look at it similar to open market transactions, making sure we can get payback -- we can payback periods  and everything to line up for us. \nOperator: The next question comes from Stephen Scouten with Piper Sandler. \nStephen Scouten: And just a follow-up kind of around that repurchase. I just want to make sure I'm thinking about this excess capital correctly. So if I think about the 107 basis points, your kind of adjusting for the loss here. We're talking about like 12, 37, I guess, on CET1. So about 190... \nCraig Nix: That's correct. \nStephen Scouten: Basis points of excess today. Is that right? \nCraig Nix: That's correct. \nStephen Scouten: Okay. Great. Perfect. And then going back to SVB, I mean, it really does -- I think you used the word stability in the presentation a couple of times. It feels like you guys have really stabilized kind of that brand and that footprint. Is it now time for you guys to go even more on the offensive? Or how do you think about the longer-term push in those segments today? \nCraig Nix: Marc, why don't you take that one? \nMarc Cadieux: Yes. So I think the environment is the challenge here, right? As noted earlier in our discussion, our target markets remain challenged. We expect those challenges to continue through '24, allowing we have some optimism around IPOs coming back, and potentially deposits picking up in the second half as we've talked about.\n And so the trick, right, is as long as venture investment remains diminished, there is -- again, you can only step on it to such a degree, similarly on the lending side. And then tech, healthcare banking, in particular, we need to be -- continue to be careful and choosy and manage the loans we have diligently by virtue of the heightened asset quality concerns that you get from a market downturn like this where the investors aren't investing as much.\n And so with all of that for context, and I think following on my earlier answer to Steve, we are going to continue to focus on doing what we do, executing as best we can. And I think trying to accelerate, I think would be -- the kind of thing you might see when we have more confidence that our target markets are coming back and we see that pickup in venture investment. And until then, I think we're going to continue to compete effectively, but carefully at the same time. I'll stop there. \nOperator: The next question comes from Christopher Marinac with Janney Montgomery Scott. \nChristopher Marinac: I wanted to ask about originating loans kind of in the legacy for Citizens footprint from the perspective of possibly having lower charge-offs there. And therefore, the guide on charge-offs could even be better down the road. I mean, Craig, is that a plausible scenario that you may originate less in some of the CIT and SVB areas and more at the old for Citizens and that drives different charge-off outcomes? \nCraig Nix: No, I don't think that's the case. I'll let Elliot talk about our [indiscernible] forecast. The business segment. \nElliot Howard: Yes. We really see good growth really across the segments. I think for the General Bank, really the branch network driving it. We've continued to have good growth there. I mean I think it's a testament to kind of a good market strategy, the tenure of our sales team. So we've seen that up meaningfully this quarter.\n And I mean, you're right that that book has really got sub 15 basis points type charge-offs. So we see that seem to be a benefit. [ CFP ] as well, I think we can call it out some of our industry-leading verticals: TMT, energy, healthcare. So we see growth there.\n And then with SVB, I think Marc elaborated on that. As we look at GFB, that's the capital call business that has really no charge-off history. We see continued growth there for the rest of the year as some of the recent originations that we have pulled through. So I don't necessarily see us pulling back on any of those segments. But -- the extent that we keep that having good growth in the General Bank, that's certainly helpful to the charge-off ratio. \nChristopher Marinac: Got it. I appreciate it. And any other criticized trends for the General Bank outside of what was called out in the slides this morning? \nCraig Nix: No. \nChristopher Marinac: Would you see a criticized kind of rise slightly from here? Or what would be the outlook if there is any? \nCraig Nix: Are.\n You speaking to the General Bank? \nChristopher Marinac: Correct. And I'm just looking beyond what you called out on SVB in some of the other areas? \nCraig Nix: We don't see any rise there. We anticipate it will be fairly stable. \nOperator: The next question is from Zach Westerlind with UBS. \nZachary C. Westerlind: My question is just around the trajectory of loan yields. I saw that it ticked down quarter-over-quarter. Is that just a function of lower accretion income? Or is there another driver there? And any color you could provide on the trajectory going forward would be great. \nCraig Nix: Yes. There was a decline due to accretion declining in the quarter, we were down about $40 million on a sequential basis and accretion income. So that had an impact. As far as trajectory, it really depends on the rate cut scenarios. If we look at just no cuts, we would look at the -- sort of the headline yield remaining fairly stable in the first quarter.\n And at accretion actually bumping around the -- where it was at the first quarter. It was 3 cuts; we would start to see some decline in the yield to the low 7s in the second quarter and to the high-70 -- or mid 70s at the end of the fourth quarter.\n So we would certainly start to feel that impact going forward if we had 3 rate cuts and what our projection -- the way we projected this, we have one rate cut in the second quarter, one rate cut in the third and one in the fourth. So obviously, timing of those rate cuts could impact that as well.\n The accretion income added 45 basis points to the margin last year, and we expect that to be down 24% this year. So a fairly substantial reduction in accretion income. \nOperator: We have a follow-up question from Brian Foran with Autonomous. \nBrian Foran: Just two quick ones. Can you remind us where you want to get the loan-to-deposit ratio or range over time or on a normalized basis? \nTom Eklund: Yes. On a more normalized basis, we see that loan-to-deposit ratio getting back to the mid-80s. \nBrian Foran: Perfect. And then as we start thinking about '25 and maybe putting the rate cuts in '25 as opposed to '24, if the Fed is cutting a few times in '25, would kind of the sensitivities be similar to what we're seeing now?\n Like if you took 3 rate cuts out of the guide and then moved up $200 million, is the sensitivity -- if we put those rate cuts into '25, is the sensitivity kind of similar? Or is it different for any reason as the balance sheet moves around? \nCraig Nix: It would be similar, it would just push the trough out further. But yes, similar trends. We would expect similar trends at this setting. \nOperator: I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to you host Deanna Hart for any closing remarks. \nDeanna Hart: Great. Thank you. And thank you, everyone, for joining our earnings call today. We appreciate your ongoing interest in our company. And if you have further questions or need additional information, please feel free to reach out to our Investor Relations team. We hope you have a great rest of your day. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Craig Nix",
            "content": "Thank you, Frank. Appreciate everyone joining us today. I'm going to anchor my comments to the key themes outlined in the takeaways on Page 14. Pages 15 through 35 provides more detail supporting our first quarter results.\n As Frank mentioned, our return metrics were strong and above our expectations. ROE and ROA adjusted for notable items were 15.01% and 1.46%, respectively. Compared to the fourth quarter, these metrics benefited from a 13% increase in net income, driven by lower net charge-offs and higher noninterest income, partially offset by lower accretion income and higher deposit costs.\n While net interest income declined from the linked quarter by 5%, it was above our expectations. The decline was related to lower accretion income and higher deposit costs. These impacts were somewhat mitigated by securities and loan portfolio repricing to higher rates during the quarter.\n NIM contracted by 19 basis points to 3.67% mostly due to the same factors affecting the decline in net interest income. Ex accretion, NIM declined by 12 basis points to 3.35%. Adjusted noninterest income increased by 5% over the fourth quarter. A majority of the increase consisted of higher net rental income on rail operating lease equipment. Net rental income was aided by strong utilization rates that surpassed 99%, the highest level since the second quarter of 2015, also a positive repricing trends as well as lower maintenance costs.\n As you will recall, we pulled forward maintenance qualification activity during the fourth quarter, which positions us to handle the uptick in customer volume this quarter while front-loading some of the expenses. Maintenance costs also benefited from unanticipated delays in getting railcars to maintenance facilities. As a result, we model higher maintenance costs for the remainder of the year as service levels returned to normal.\n Noninterest income also benefited from an increase in the fair value of customer derivative positions due to higher interest rates. These increases were partially offset by lower capital markets income related to seasonality as well as increased competition as regional banks continue to return to normal activity following last year's pullback.\n Stripping out some of the seasonality and focusing on a year-over-year comparison, capital markets income was up roughly $5 million from syndicated deals. Adjusted noninterest expense slightly beat our expectation, increasing sequentially by less than 2%.\n Expense growth was concentrated in salaries and benefits and seasonal adjustments associated with our 401(k), higher payroll taxes and annual merit adjustments took effect. First quarter expenses also reflected higher FDIC insurance expense.\n Effectively managing expenses remains a top priority for us given headwinds to net interest income. We are on track to achieve the low end of our 25% to 30% synergies target for SVB by the end of this year. Focusing on credit, net charge-offs declined by $74 million from the sequential quarter to $103 million. This represents a charge-off -- net charge-off ratio of 0.31% below our previous guidance of 50 to 60 basis points.\n Losses were largely in the same portfolio as previous quarters, although at a lower rate. The largest decline was in the innovation portfolio, where net charge-offs were down $30 million sequentially led by a $19 million drop in the investor dependent portfolio. The remainder was spread between equipment finance, general office and other loan portfolios.\n At quarter end, the allowance plus purchase discount on the investor dependent portfolio was 8.2% covering first quarter annualized net charge-offs 2.9x and the last 4 quarters, 1.9x. Consistent with prior quarters, net charge-offs within the commercial bank were concentrated in the general office and small ticket equipment leasing portfolios.\n As a reminder, while our total general office portfolio was $2.8 billion at the end of the quarter, the portfolio where we have seen stress in charge-offs is in Class B, repositioned bridge loans within the commercial bank, which totaled $1 billion at quarter end.\n Portfolio net charge-offs were down sequentially, but we continue to monitor the risks here. The allowance on this portfolio was 11.1%, covering first quarter annualized net charge-offs 1.6x in the last 4 quarter net charge-offs 1.4x.\n Overall, the allowance decreased 3 basis points sequentially to 1.28% due to improvement in macroeconomic forecasts, a mix shift to higher credit quality segments and lower specific reserves, all partially offset by increased volume and mild credit quality deterioration.\n While the allowance did decline this quarter, we feel good about our overall reserve coverage on the portfolios where we continue to see stress. Our credit team continually monitors our loan portfolios by reviewing delinquency trends and grading migration by industry and/or geography to identify areas of potential stress. And at this time, we are not aware of other significant pockets of deterioration.\n Moving to the balance sheet. Loans grew by more than $2 billion over the linked quarter and annualized growth rate of 6.2%. The General and Commercial segments grew loans by $900 million and $794 million, respectively, and the SVB Commercial segment was up by $335 million. General Bank growth was concentrated in small business and commercial loans generated in our branch network.\n In the Commercial Bank, growth was driven by strong production in our industry verticals particularly in TMT, healthcare and energy. Growth in our TMT vertical continues to be driven by strong demand for new data centers, while our energy vertical is benefiting from the energy transition, which is driving activity in financing renewable energy projects.\n Finally, the increase in SVB commercial loans related to global fund banking growth. And despite increased competition in this space, we continue to win business. To that end, our team closed more than $5 billion in deals in the first quarter. While we are excited by the positive trends in global fund banking, we recognize that the macroeconomic environment still presents headwinds. In the first quarter, VC investment came in lower than expected amid macroeconomic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions.\n While VC dry powder remains elevated despite ongoing fundraising sluggishness, we expect it to take time to gradually deploy those investments. However, we remain well positioned to ramp up both loans and deposits quickly when the macroeconomic environment improves given, we have the largest fund finance team in the market.\n Within the SVB Commercial segment, growth in global fund banking was partially offset by expected declines in our technology and health care banking business as pay downs outpaced new fundings due to continued headwinds in the private investment landscape.\n While we've seen some encouraging activity in the IPO market, we do not expect an immediate reset given continued fundraising and valuation mismatches. We are well positioned to capture business as the pendulum swings back. Technology and healthcare banking team has a focused approach and our track record and expertise in the innovation economy will continue to help us win deals. We are encouraged by our progress in growing the new SVB commercial brand, winning new clients and bringing those back who left.\n Turning to the right-hand side of the balance sheet. Deposits grew at an annualized rate of 10.4% or by $3.8 billion in the first quarter due to strong core deposit growth in the General and Direct Banks.\n In the General Bank, we continue to focus on growing customer deposits, and we're pleased to see these grew by $2.4 billion due to our continued emphasis on expanding relationships with current customers and attracting new accounts. Direct bank deposits increased by over $2 billion, despite a decrease in marketing expense during the quarter.\n While the Direct Bank channel is higher cost and now accounts for 27% of our deposit base is an additional lever, we've used to remain resilient through a turbulent environment and is a strong source of insured consumer deposits funding our earnings base. Growth in this channel enabled us to continue to redeem some of our smaller subordinated debt issuances this quarter given our excess capital and liquidity positions.\n These increases were partially offset by expected declines in the SVB Commercial segment. Deposits were down $760 million from the linked quarter driven by continued client cash burn and muted fundraising activity.\n Moving to capital. Our CET1 ratio increased by 8 basis points sequentially, ending the quarter at 13.44%. Our shared loss agreement added approximately 107 basis points to the ratio down from approximately 120 basis points last quarter. We continue to use capital to support organic growth, but acknowledge that we are operating with elevated capital levels.\n In addition to supporting organic growth, share repurchases are part of our capital distribution strategy. We assessed share repurchase as part of our capital plan that was approved by our Board during the first quarter and was submitted to our regulators earlier this month.\n While we have not yet received feedback from our regulators on the plan, we remain confident that a share repurchase plan will be an option for us in the second half of this year. While we don't have an approved share repurchase plan at this time, I will share some general information about how we intend to manage capital moving forward.\n We managed our capital ratios, excluding any benefit from the loss share agreement, which we refer to internally as adjusted CET1. All planned activities and capital levels are assessed in this context as the RWA benefit continues to run off at a rate of $1 billion to $2 billion per quarter and is expected to be mostly gone by the end of 2025.\n In addition to supporting organic growth and paying dividends, we intend to supplement that capital use with methodical share repurchase over time to get our adjusted CET1 ratio down to the 10.5% range by the end of 2025, which is the level it was following the acquisition of SVB.\n We do not intend to immediately manage capital down to this level. Instead, we intend to do it methodically and continually assess capital needs based on balance sheet growth expectations, earnings trajectories and the economic and regulatory environments over the next couple of years. We will reassess our capital management priorities on a regular basis, including annual updates to our capital plan.\n [indiscernible] both on Page 35, discussing our second quarter and 2024 full year outlook. In summary, for the full year, we moved our net interest income forecast up on the higher first quarter starting point and a reduction from 3 to 6 rate cuts to 0 to 3 rate cuts. We also moved our credit loss guidance down from the lower first quarter starting point. We have not materially changed our noninterest income and expense guidance.\n On loans, we anticipate low single-digit percentage growth in the second quarter, driven by growth in the General Bank, Commercial Bank and SVB Commercial. We anticipate SVB Commercial will benefit from continued growth in the global fund banking business, where we continue to see success due to continued client outreach.\n This growth, however, will continue to be pressured by headwinds in the private equity and venture capital markets. We also anticipate a modest decline in technology and healthcare banking business as lower levels of funding and line draws result in loan portfolio contraction.\n Looking at the innovation economy more broadly, we found that, overtime, there is a correlation between public market valuations and VC investment volume. There have been some positive economic signals suggesting that capital deployment may rebound in 2024, driven by an improved IPO outlook. We, therefore, expect a modest increase in VC investment compared to 2023.\n Meanwhile, we anticipate growth in the Commercial Bank in our industry verticals and increased activities in middle market banking following seasonal declines in the first quarter.\n Looking at the full year, we continue to expect loans to end in the $139 million to $143 billion range or mid-single-digit percentage growth, which is essentially unchanged from our previous guidance. We anticipate this growth to be concentrated across all 3 banking segments for the reasons previously discussed.\n We expect deposits to be flat to slightly up in the second quarter as growth in the General Bank is offset by a decline in SVB commercial. Within the General Bank, we anticipate growth in the branch network as we benefit from our focus on increasing our customer base by building deposits through proactive sales, associate outreach, centralized marketing campaigns and increased community connectivity. This growth will be slightly offset by seasonal declines that we expect in April due to tax payments.\n With respect to SVB deposits, we expect the venture capital environment to remain challenging, particularly in the first half of 2024. Looking forward, we expect client funds, cash burn and losses to continue to normalize over time with gradual improvement expected in the second half of the year.\n In addition, we expect to improve our capture rate of private market fundraising, a large percentage of which flows into on-balance sheet deposit products. Bringing this all together, we expect SVB deposits to be relatively flat in the first half of the year before growing in the second half.\n While we continue to raise deposits in our direct bank in the first quarter, we anticipate these deposits will remain fairly stable in 2024, given the excess liquidity on our balance sheet and continued strong growth in other channels including the branch network.\n This, obviously, could change if we have unexpected deposit outflows occur elsewhere. For the full year, we anticipate mid-single-digit percentage growth, primarily related to growth in the general bank previously discussed and low to mid-single-digit percentage growth in SVB commercial deposits.\n Our interest rate forecast follows the implied forward curve, which includes 3 rate cuts in 2024 with the effective Fed funds rate declining from 5.50% to 4.75% by the end of the year. It is our belief that we will see closer to one or no rate cuts given the continued strength of the labor markets, and the lumpiness we've seen in the economy fueling speculation that inflation remains untamed.\n Therefore, for our net interest income guidance, we provided a range with the top end assuming no rate cuts and the low end assuming 3 rate cuts. It is important to note that these projections do not include the impact of planned share repurchase activity in the back half of 2024 as we await final sizing and approval as part of our capital planning process.\n For the second quarter, we expect headline net interest income to be down in the low to mid-single-digit percentage points range. The decline will be driven by the impact of lower accretion, higher deposit costs and lower loan yields, assuming one rate cut only partially offset by higher investment securities yield. With no rate cut, we expect headline net interest income to be fairly stable with or just slightly down compared to the first quarter.\n For the full year, we expect headline net interest income in the range of $7.1 billion to $7.3 billion. In either case, we project accretion income just under $500 million for the year, which is a decline from $725 million in the last 3 quarters of 2023, as loan discounts on the shorter portfolio will have fully been recognized.\n We previously guided to a range of $6.9 billion to $7.1 billion. The upward revision reflects the higher for longer rate environment and shifting the guidance range between 0 and 3 cuts for the remainder of 2024.\n On credit losses, we are reducing our net charge-off guidance as we now anticipate it will remain in the 35 to 50 basis points range for both the second quarter and full year 2024. We are benefiting from the decreased innovation economy stress.\n And while losses in this portfolio can still be lumpy, we believe the continued market optimism fueled by the revival of public markets for PE and VC backed companies with 2 large tech IPOs already out the door in 2024, is an encouraging sign for venture exit activity.\n Accordingly, we expect some of the pressure in the investor dependent portfolio to soften in the back half of this year. It is worth noting that hold sizes on some of our portfolios are large in the Commercial and SVB Commercial segment. And just as we had a favorable experience this quarter with less large charge-offs in the innovation portfolio, 1 or 2 unexpected larger charge-offs can result in blips in our net charge-off ratio.\n Therefore, while the decline in net charge-offs during the first quarter was positive, we think it's too early to call an inflection point on credit following 1 quarter of improvement. However, we believe that credit costs remain manageable and are appropriately incorporated into our guidance.\n Moving to adjusted noninterest income. We expect the second quarter to be down as net rental income on rail operating leases decreases due to expected maintenance costs that were deferred in the first quarter, as I previously mentioned.\n While we anticipate some normalization to historically high utilization levels during 2024, our outlook for rail remains positive, and we expect a continuation of healthy fundamental trends in the near-term from a supply-driven recovery, which is generating strong demand for existing railcars, resulting in a stronger for longer scenario.\n We also expect client investment fees to decrease due to anticipated lower rates. To the extent we do not receive 3 rate cuts in 2024, we could see some upside to our forecast here. Nonetheless, we continue to experience growth in wealth management fees and card income, reflecting the strong consumer acquisition and growth trends from our branch network.\n We expect full year adjusted noninterest income to be in the $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion range, which is in line with our previous guidance. As Frank mentioned in his comments, we are excited for the continued build-out of -- and momentum in our wealth platform and look forward to realizing the synergies of this combination.\n Moving to expenses. We expect a modest increase from the first quarter due to increased marketing as well as professional and third-party servicing fees, as we ramp up project spend related to a few regulatory items, such as ISO Payments and Dodd-Frank.\n Furthermore, as mentioned last quarter, a continued focus for us is to build out the product capabilities that will keep us the premier partner in the innovation economy, continuing to enhance our offerings in cash management, FX and payments.\n Additionally, we will continue the modernization of our platforms in consumer, equipment finance and factoring to ensure we are well equipped to scale in the future. As we fine-tune our regulatory capabilities, we will also continue to make strategic hires that will help reinforce the skills of the great teams we already have assembled. All of this will be partially offset by continued acquisition synergies, which I spoke too earlier.\n While we expect to achieve the lower 25% band of our cost saves goal by the end of 2024, these savings will be offset by continued capability build-out for heightened regulatory expectations as well as costs related to the strategic priorities I just mentioned. Our adjusted efficiency ratio is expected to be in the low 50% range in 2024, up slightly from 49% for the full year of 2023.\n Looking at the full year, we anticipate adjusted noninterest expense to be up -- low to mid-single-digit percentage points, which equates to a range of $4.6 billion to $4.7 billion, unchanged from our previous guidance.\n For both the second quarter and full year we expect our tax rate to be in the range of 27% to 28%, which is exclusive of any discrete items.\n In closing, we remain steadfast in our long-term approach, focused on our clients and customers and committed to maintaining a strong risk management environment. I believe we have tremendous opportunity ahead of us as demonstrated by the successful first quarter and that we are well positioned for the future, thanks to our solid financial condition.\n I will now turn it over to the operator for instructions for the question-and-answer portion of the call. I would say that right now, we're a little -- and intentionally a little heavy on cash through the optimal level. We're around 15%. We'd like to see that normalize to 10% to 15% over time. We're sitting a little slightly light on investments, but you've seen us deploy cash into the investment portfolio over the last 3 quarters, and we would expect to continue to do that maybe to the tune of $3 million to $4 billion before the end of the year.\n So we're very close to optimization, high on cash, but again, a little bit of that intentional given our purchase money -- the FDIC . Tom, do you have anything to add or amplify there? Are you referring to the overall reserve coverage, Chris?\n Okay. I'm going to answer it -- I'll answer it both ways in. In terms of just overall coverage, we feel really good about where our reserves are. We covered quarter-to-date net charge-offs 4x this quarter, about 2.5x last quarter.\n We covered -- the allowance is now covers 2023 charge-offs almost 2.9x and nonaccrual loans 1.6x. On nonaccrual loans, what gives us comfort here, too, with respect to reserves is that we have analyzed over 70% of those loans for impairment on an individual basis, and our reserve ratio sits at around 30% on those.\n In terms of our stress portfolios, which I alluded to, overall, we have -- we covered first quarter net charge-off 2.8x in the last quarter to 1.8x. And that portfolio represents about 8% of loans, with 61% charge-offs. So we're feeling like we're prudently and conservatively reserved both for the specific loan portfolios, exhibiting stress and on the overall ACL. It is the shift in the rate cuts. No. I think we're just reinforcing what we've said previously for share repurchases. And I would point out that over this 2-year period, we would intend to manage the CET1 down to the 10.5% range. Well, the 9% to 10% was our previous target. We have proposed a new target range that we're not going to disclose today in our capital plan. But I can tell you that you shouldn't expect it to significantly change from the previous one. I want to give our regulators time to give us feedback on our capital plan that we just submitted a couple of weeks ago. But I would not -- you should now expect... Change in there. That's correct. Well, they had -- I mean, their charge-off ratio has declined is same as the other portfolio. It's really the biggest move and 80% of the variance in our charge-offs, we're in the investor dependent portfolio.\n And there are 4 major factors there. We had no real large dollar charge-offs during the quarter. We had -- the fact that charge-offs on smaller loans were down and the number of charge-offs were also down, we had a good recovery quarter.\n So most of the drop in at least the net charge-off guidance and consequently the provision really related to that investor dependent portfolio. Well, I'll let Marc amplify, but I think it's -- Marc -- are you on the line, Marc? I hear you. Yes. I was just going to set the backdrop, Marc, and let you amplify, but we were encouraged in the first quarter new money coming into SVB, did increase over the first quarter. And while cash burn and losses to competitors remain fairly consistent, new cash flows did come in, they went disproportionately off-balance sheet, but this was the first quarter since the acquisition where the cash position remained neutral. First time, it has not been negative since we merged last year.\n And Marc, I'll let you give some color around that of how we're doing that. But again, we're pretty encouraged by what we're seeing there. We don't buy it back blindly. So we do approach it similar to an approach on an open market acquisition, although there are differences -- obvious differences there with respect to risk. So we don't just blindly buy.\n Right now, we do see the stock at an attractive price. So we would anticipate repurchasing at that price. I'm not going to share at what levels we would trigger where we wouldn't, but we do consider that in our internal model. And it is our goal to manage down to that 10.5% range over the next 2 years on CET1.\n Tom, do you want to say anything else about that? That's correct. That's correct. Marc, why don't you take that one? No, I don't think that's the case. I'll let Elliot talk about our [indiscernible] forecast. The business segment. No. Are.\n You speaking to the General Bank? We don't see any rise there. We anticipate it will be fairly stable. Yes. There was a decline due to accretion declining in the quarter, we were down about $40 million on a sequential basis and accretion income. So that had an impact. As far as trajectory, it really depends on the rate cut scenarios. If we look at just no cuts, we would look at the -- sort of the headline yield remaining fairly stable in the first quarter.\n And at accretion actually bumping around the -- where it was at the first quarter. It was 3 cuts; we would start to see some decline in the yield to the low 7s in the second quarter and to the high-70 -- or mid 70s at the end of the fourth quarter.\n So we would certainly start to feel that impact going forward if we had 3 rate cuts and what our projection -- the way we projected this, we have one rate cut in the second quarter, one rate cut in the third and one in the fourth. So obviously, timing of those rate cuts could impact that as well.\n The accretion income added 45 basis points to the margin last year, and we expect that to be down 24% this year. So a fairly substantial reduction in accretion income. It would be similar, it would just push the trough out further. But yes, similar trends. We would expect similar trends at this setting."

And I think, ultimately, to your point, the -- what sounds like better-than-expected deposits in the quarter compared to what you would have expected, is a function, I think, of our continued momentum in the marketplace, the continued success we're having both in winning new business and bringing back clients as well. And as you see, that is -- that's really helping, and I think bodes well for the future if we can keep it up. Yes. So I think the environment is the challenge here, right? As noted earlier in our discussion, our target markets remain challenged. We expect those challenges to continue through '24, allowing we have some optimism around IPOs coming back, and potentially deposits picking up in the second half as we've talked about.\n And so the trick, right, is as long as venture investment remains diminished, there is -- again, you can only step on it to such a degree, similarly on the lending side. And then tech, healthcare banking, in particular, we need to be -- continue to be careful and choosy and manage the loans we have diligently by virtue of the heightened asset quality concerns that you get from a market downturn like this where the investors aren't investing as much.\n And so with all of that for context, and I think following on my earlier answer to Steve, we are going to continue to focus on doing what we do, executing as best we can. And I think trying to accelerate, I think would be -- the kind of thing you might see when we have more confidence that our target markets are coming back and we see that pickup in venture investment. And until then, I think we're going to continue to compete effectively, but carefully at the same time. I'll stop there."

            "content": "Yes. We really see good growth really across the segments. I think for the General Bank, really the branch network driving it. We've continued to have good growth there. I mean I think it's a testament to kind of a good market strategy, the tenure of our sales team. So we've seen that up meaningfully this quarter.\n And I mean, you're right that that book has really got sub 15 basis points type charge-offs. So we see that seem to be a benefit. [ CFP ] as well, I think we can call it out some of our industry-leading verticals: TMT, energy, healthcare. So we see growth there.\n And then with SVB, I think Marc elaborated on that. As we look at GFB, that's the capital call business that has really no charge-off history. We see continued growth there for the rest of the year as some of the recent originations that we have pulled through. So I don't necessarily see us pulling back on any of those segments. But -- the extent that we keep that having good growth in the General Bank, that's certainly helpful to the charge-off ratio."

            "content": "Thank you, Deanna, and good morning, everyone. Let's start on Page 6. And I'll say that over the last 12 months, we've successfully focused on our SVB integration efforts, regulatory readiness, strategic priorities and financial performance. During the first quarter, we delivered earnings per share of $52.92 adjusting for notable items that are on Page 51.\n Return metrics were strong, reflecting a peer-leading net interest margin, an adjusted efficiency ratio of 50% and the lower net charge-offs. These results exceeded our expectations with earnings increasing approximately 14% over the sequential quarter. We're pleased that all our segments, including SVB Commercial, grew loans during the quarter and our liquidity and capital position strengthened due to core deposits and earnings growth.\n We successfully submitted our capital plan to the Federal Reserve on April the 5th. The process included a full stress test, including the acquired SVB portfolios. The mission of this plan was an important milestone in our regulatory journey, and I'd like to thank all our associates for their hard work in submitting a quality plan.\n Turning to Page 7. It's been a year since Silicon Valley Bank became part of First Citizens, which is -- which has introduced a lot of change, but most of all, opportunity. I want to thank our associates for their hard work over the past year, stabilizing the business and taking care of our clients. I also want to thank our clients for their confidence in us as we remain committed to them and the innovation economy.\n The SVB team continues to deliver exceptional service to our clients, and this is demonstrated by the fact that 80% of the VC firms on the Forbes' Midas list are served by our company, and our ability to onboard over 1,000 new clients in the first year of our acquisition. SVB also has more experience serving the innovation economy than any other financial services provider, thanks to our dedicated teams of sector experts.\n Their essential insights come from over 40 years of dedicated focus on innovators and investors on average leadership tenure of over 20 years with SVB and the deepest and most experienced bench of over 1,500 innovation bankers and relationship advisers. Our team is well positioned despite some of the continued economic headwinds facing the innovation economy.\n Last year, VC fundraising hit its lowest level since 2017. The drawback in fundraising we witnessed in 2023 continued into the first quarter, even though there remains plenty of dry powder to invest. Despite the current environment, we are encouraged by the number of exit-ready companies poised to exit once the IPO market fully reopens.\n In fact, there is a record backlog of companies ready to exit given current market conditions. There is fundamental demand from investors, but only at the right price and for companies with good stories. We are beginning to see activity improve and the signs that IPO activity may pick up this year.\n On Page 8, we showed that the SVB franchise has been stabilizing in terms of loans and client funds since the second quarter of last year, reflecting continued support of our innovation clients.\n Moving to Page 9. Our integration efforts helped us retain clients, stabilize deposit balances and develop strategic priorities for the combined organization. We continue to make meaningful progress on integration and remain committed to achieving our post-merger potential.\n While we have always focused on compliance with regulatory requirements, our growth has moved us to a significantly increased level of regulatory oversight, and we are investing and being proactive in enhancing our regulatory readiness. While there is more work to be done, we have made meaningful progress in maturing and refining our processes to support the change in our size and complexity.\n A few of these accomplishments include: First, implementing expanded risk management capabilities based on feedback from third-party GAAP assessment; second, creating a dedicated regulatory remediation oversight team to manage and enhance regulatory response as well as provide oversight, monitoring and reporting of remediation efforts; third, enhancing our dedicated regulatory affairs team to manage heightened regulatory activity and relationships with new examiners; and fourth, completing our first time large financial institution regulatory filings on time.\n In addition, with our strong risk management culture, we will continue to invest in our capabilities here and we're confident that over time we will effectively transform our program in accordance with new and changing regulatory requirements.\n Now let's look at Page 10. We continue to invest in our wealth business, one of our primary key income drivers. We believe there are significant opportunities and we've achieved remarkable organic growth here since 2013. In the third quarter, we announced the alignment of SVB Private and First Citizens Wealth under one leadership team to improve coordination and enhance services available to clients.\n Wealth is beginning to see the benefits of bringing our capabilities together under one umbrella, creating a premier private banking and wealth business. Most recently, we rebranded all of our wealth services to First Citizens Wealth. The combined First Citizens Wealth organization can help any client business or institution regardless of size or complexity.\n We remain focused on maintaining deep client relationships, providing a boutique experience with big bank capabilities. Moving forward, we believe our combined product set dedicated and experienced wealth professionals and client-centric engaged model. We'll continue to celebrate -- to accelerate the growth of our wealth franchise.\n And finally, turning to Page 11. We're happy to be recognized and honored as a top 20 financial institution on Forbes list of America's Best Banks and by other organizations and publications listed on the page. This recognition reflects our solid track record taking care of our clients and our customers.\n To conclude, the positive momentum we started in 2023 continues. Despite the uncertainty in the current environment, and the hard work ahead of us, we continue to protect and grow customer relationships, stabilize the SVB franchise, grow core deposits and loans and strengthen our balance sheet. Given our position of strength and dedicated associates, I'm excited about the opportunities ahead of it -- ahead of us.\n And with that, Craig, I'll turn it over to you."
