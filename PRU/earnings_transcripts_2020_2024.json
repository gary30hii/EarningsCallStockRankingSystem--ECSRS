Later, we will conduct the question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Head of Investor Relations, Mr. Darin Arita. Please go ahead.\nDarin Arita: Good morning and thank you for joining our call. Representing Prudential on today\u2019s call are Charlie Lowrey, Chairman and CEO; Rob Falzon, Vice Chairman; Andy Sullivan, Head of U.S. Businesses; Scott Sleyster, Head of International Businesses; Ken Tanji, Chief Financial Officer; and Rob Axel, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer. We will start with prepared comments by Charlie, Rob and Ken, and then we will take your questions. Today\u2019s presentation may include forward-looking statements. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions we make today. In addition, this presentation may include references to non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of such measures to the comparable GAAP measures and the discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, please see the slide titled Forward-Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measures in the appendix to today\u2019s presentation and the quarterly financial supplement, both of which can be found on our website at investor.prudential.com. With that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Charlie.\nCharlie Lowrey: Thank you, Darin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As we approach the one year mark of the global pandemic, I hope that you, your families and colleagues remain safe and healthy in this continuing difficult environment. As before, we remain deeply focused on the well-being of our employees, customers, communities and other stakeholders, and on addressing their evolving needs and challenges. Amid the extraordinary events of 2020, we continue to take steps to evolve our business for the future while living up to our purpose. Turning to slide 2. We successfully executed on a number of our strategic initiatives in 2020 to reduce our market sensitivity and increase our growth potential, including the expansion of our cost savings program, while further solidifying our already robust financial position. We\u2019re now focused on building upon our achievements over the past year to further accelerate our strategy. I\u2019ll speak to this next phase of our transformation in more detail momentarily, but will start by recapping our accomplishments in 2020. Turning to slide 3. We realized $215 million in cost savings during the year, exceeding our $140 million target. Recall that last quarter, we increased our cost savings target to $750 million to be realized by the end of 2023. We also began to rotate our international earnings mix towards higher growth markets. During the year, we completed the sale of our Korea business and announced the sale of our Taiwan business. We also took significant steps to address the low interest rate environment with derisking actions such as repricing products and pivoting to less interest rate sensitive solutions. This pivot included discontinuing sales of variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits and launching a buffered annuity product, FlexGuard, which is less sensitive to market fluctuations while continuing to serve our customer needs. Turning to slide 4. As we look ahead, we\u2019re building upon the actions we\u2019ve already taken, as well as our competitive strengths to significantly transform the Company over the medium term. To achieve this transformation, we expect to deliver on our cost savings program and to reallocate $5 billion to $10 billion in capital over the next three years, as we pivot towards higher growth and less market-sensitive businesses. In parallel to this capital reallocation, we anticipate returning $10 billion of capital to shareholders over the next three years. This includes dividends as well as share repurchases that are returning -- that are resuming in the first quarter, under our new $1.5 billion authorization. As a result of these efforts, Prudential should emerge as a higher growth, less market-sensitive, and more nimble business that is positioned not only to deliver growth for shareholders. But also to make a more meaningful difference in the financial lives of more people around the world. Turning to slide 5. As we transform to become a higher growth, less market-sensitive business, we expect to double our growth businesses to more than 30% of earnings and have our Individual Annuities business to 10% or less of earnings. We will change our business mix primarily through organic growth and programmatic acquisitions for both our global asset manager, PGIM, and in emerging markets within our international businesses. PGIM manages $1.5 trillion of assets, which we have grown both, organically and through acquisitions of talent and capabilities. In emerging markets, we have expanded with joint ventures and acquisitions in regions with large markets and favorable demographic tailwinds, such as Asia, Latin America and Africa. We benefit from strong relationships with companies that have a large footprint and a significant local market expertise. In addition, we will remain focused on investing in our other businesses to expand our addressable market as well as continue to improve expense and capital efficiency. Additional actions to change our business mix include derisking and other transactions in conjunction with running off certain blocks of business. The $1.6 billion of capital generated from the sale of Korea business is included in the $5 billion to $10 billion we plan to reallocate into our growth businesses. Our change in business mix will obviously not be a straight line. But, as we reallocate capital, we\u2019ll provide you with information to help you both understand and measure our progress. Turning to slide 6. We are well-positioned to execute this strategic plan with a rock solid balance sheet. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had $5.6 billion in highly liquid assets. And our operating subsidiaries continue to hold capital to support AA financial strength ratings. Finally, let\u2019s turn to slide 7. During this time of change in transformation, our commitment to our Company purpose and to supporting all our stakeholders remains as fundamental as ever. The importance of this work is reflected in the multiple environmental, social and governance initiatives that we advanced over the course of this quarter and throughout 2020. Here are some of the noteworthy accomplishments. We became the first U.S. insurer to insure a green bond aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. We furthered our commitment to environmental transparency and accountability by disclosing our environmental impact through CDP, the world\u2019s leading environmental disclosure platform. Prudential scored an A minus on CDP\u2019s 2020 Climate Change Survey. We introduced nine commitments to advance further the work we\u2019ve been doing on racial equity, spanning our talent practices, our design and delivery of products, our investments and public policy works and our support of community institutions working to remove persistent obstacles to black economic empowerment. I\u2019m also pleased that we\u2019ll continue to tie inclusion and diversity with executive compensation. Three years ago, we added an inclusion and diversity performance modifier that factored into our 2020 compensation plan. Over this period, diverse representation amongst senior management has increased. We\u2019re including this type of modifier again to drive us to improve further our inclusion and diversity over the next three years. Before closing, I\u2019d like to say thank you to all our employees around the world. It\u2019s through your hard work and dedication that we\u2019ve been able to successfully help our customers and advance our transformation. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Rob for more specific details on our business performance. Thank you all for your time this morning.\nRob Axel: Thank you, Charlie. I\u2019ll provide an overview of our financial results, and update on our strategic progress and highlights of our outlook for our U.S., PGIM and international businesses. Turning to slide 8, I\u2019ll begin with our financial results for the year. On a pretax, adjusted operating income for 2020 was $5.1 billion or $10.21 per share on an after-tax basis. In the fourth quarter, our pretax adjusted operating income was $1.5 billion or $2.93 a share. Earnings exceeded the year-ago quarter as increases in our PGIM and international businesses as well as our Corporate & Other operations, offset a decline in our U.S. businesses. Results of our U.S. businesses reflected heightened COVID-19-related mortality experience as well as lower fee income in our Individual Annuities business, primarily due to outflows. This was partially offset by higher net investment spread results, driven by higher variable investment income and lower expenses. In addition, we made a change in our Individual Life procedures that provides policyholders information to better manage their policies and premiums for certain flexible premium policies. Due to this change, we have revised the estimated premiums to be paid for these policies, resulting in an adjustment to reserves. We also established and incurred, but not reported, our IBNR reserve in our group insurance business for the expected increase in disability claims as a result of the lag effect from higher unemployment. PGIM, our global asset manager, reported record assets under management of $1.5 trillion, up 13% from a year ago, as well as higher net asset management fees and record high other related revenues. And, earnings in our international businesses increased 6%, reflecting business growth, lower expenses and more favorable underwriting results, partially offset by lower net investment spread. Turning to slide 9. Our U.S. businesses produce a diversified source of earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income, which includes the benefits from netting longevity and mortality experience. We continued to make progress this quarter, executing on our priorities, including implementing pricing and product actions to derisk our business mix while protecting profitability and expanding our addressable market. Our product pivot has worked well with sales of our buffered annuity, FlexGuard, doubling to $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter from $600 million in the third quarter. And the pandemic has increased awareness of the value of our broad set of life insurance and financial solutions as we continue to enhance our capabilities to reach people when, where and how they want. These capabilities include traditional agents and financial advisors, the workplace. [Technical Difficulty] million people have access to our financial [Technical Difficulty] With respect to Assurance, we launched our Medicare business a little more than a year ago. As a result of investments in our distribution capacity, marketing capabilities and development of new technology, we nearly tripled our fourth quarter Medicare revenues versus the year ago quarter. We expect to continue to grow these revenues as we further expand distribution, utilize newly developed tools for data-driven consumer product recommendations and broaden our marketing. In addition, this gives us further confidence as we develop and launch additional product lines. Customer interest for our simply term life insurance product through Assurance has been strong, although sales have been lower than expected. We continue to modify our underwriting processes to allow for more instant decisions. As we streamline this process and improve the customer experience, we expect our life revenues to grow. Total revenues are primary financial metric for Assurance as we concentrate on scaling the business, doubled versus the year ago quarter. We\u2019re adding more carriers in all of our existing markets and expanding into new product lines. To execute this expansion, we have increased our investments in marketing, distribution and infrastructure. We expect operating losses in the near-term and earnings to emerge as we reach scale. Now, turning to slide 10. PGIM continues to demonstrate the strength and resilience of its diversified platform as a top 10 active global investment manager. PGIM\u2019s strong investment performance and diversified global investment capabilities in both, public and private asset classes across fixed income, alternatives, real estate and equities, position us favorably to capture flows. PGIM\u2019s investment performance demonstrated resiliency with more than 90% of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last 3, 5 and 10-year periods. This investment performance contributed $6.3 billion of third-party net flows during the fourth quarter, including $3.8 billion of retail and $2.5 billion of institutional flows, resulting in $20 billion of net flows for the year. Of note, PGIM investments achieved the highest U.S. mutual fund franchise ranking, based on net flows in 2020. PGIM\u2019s strong overall flows were driven by continued investor appetite for fixed income strategies, particularly higher-yielding strategies and for real estate. PGIM\u2019s asset management fees increased 12% compared to the year ago quarter, reflecting growth in average assets under management. In addition, record high agency loan production and the effect of strong investment performance on incentive fees as well as co-investment and seed investment earnings, drove significant growth in other related revenues. These results contributed to an increase in PGIM\u2019s operating margin, which was in excess of 36% for the quarter. While PGIM\u2019s operating margin will vary with market conditions, we expect to sustain a margin of approximately 30% across the cycle. Turning to slide 11. Our International Businesses include our Japanese life insurance operation, where we have a differentiated multichannel distribution model as well as other operations focused on high-growth markets. As anticipated, Life Planner sales in the quarter were reduced by the accelerated sales in Japan last quarter, following the U.S. dollar-denominated product repricing in August. For the year, we were pleased that sales were about flat as our high-quality distribution overcame the effect of the pandemic-related shutdown. Similar to Life Planner, Gibraltar sales were reduced in the current quarter, and sales for the full year were about even with the prior year. While we do not report separately on our emerging markets businesses, we would note that Brazil\u2019s life insurance in force grew by 10% from a year ago, and our Chilean pension business held its number one ranking for market share benefiting from continued favorable investment performance. On slide 17 in the appendix, we listed some of the emerging markets that we\u2019re in and our local relationships that have significant market leadership positions. And with that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Ken.\nKen Tanji: Thanks, Rob. I\u2019ll begin on slide 12, which provides insight into earnings for the first quarter of 2021 relative to our fourth quarter results. Pretax adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter was $1.5 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $2.93 on an after-tax basis. Then, we adjust for the following items. First, variable investment income outperformed expectations in the fourth quarter, which is worth $360 million. Second, we adjust underwriting experience by a net $65 million. This includes a placeholder for COVID-19 claims experienced across our businesses of $170 million, based on 250,000 COVID-19-related fatalities in the U.S. during the first quarter. Third, we expect expenses to be $165 million lower in the first quarter, primarily due to seasonal items in the fourth quarter. Fourth, there are other items that may be $40 million more favorable in the first quarter. As Rob discussed, in the fourth quarter, we recorded a charge for the change in our Individual Life business practice, which was partially offset by strong other related revenues in PGIM. Fifth, we anticipate net investment income will be reduced by $15 million, reflecting the difference between new money rates and disposition yields of our investment portfolio. And last, we expect the first quarter effective tax rate to normalize. These items combined gets us to a of $2.54 per share for the first quarter. I\u2019ll note that if you exclude items specific to the first quarter, earnings per share would be $2.90 per share. The key takeaway is that this is roughly in line with the prior quarter. While we have provided these items to consider, please note that there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the first quarter. As we look forward, I\u2019d like to bring your attention to a few other items in the appendix. In addition to the seasonal considerations on slide 25, we have included other considerations for 2021 on slide 26. Notably, we expect to realize an increase in cost savings from $250 million in 2020 to $400 million in 2021. We also provided the expected net cost for Corporate & Other, the yen foreign exchange rate and the effective tax rate for 2021. On slide 13, we\u2019ve provided an update on the potential impact of the pandemic. The estimated sensitivity of operating income for $100,000 incremental U.S. deaths due to the pandemic is $85 million based on our updated outlook. This is up slightly from our prior sensitivity as the virus more broadly spreads across demographics and geographies, including the insured population. As I noted earlier, our first quarter baseline includes a net mortality impact of $170 million, due to COVID-19. The actual impact will depend on a variety of factors, such as infection and fatality rates, geographic considerations, and the speed and effectiveness of the vaccine rollout. Turning to slide 14. We maintain a robust capital position and adequate sources of funding. Our capital position continues to support a AA financial strength rating, and we have substantial sources of funding. Our cash and liquid assets at the parent Company were $5.6 billion at the end of the quarter, which is greater than 3 times annual fixed charges. And other sources of funds include free cash flow from our businesses and other contingent capital facilities. Turning to slide 15 and in summary. We successfully executed our 2020 initiatives, and we are building on those initiatives to transform Prudential into a higher growth, less market-sensitive and more nimble business. And we continue to benefit from the strength of our rock solid balance sheet. Now, I\u2019ll turn it to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath with Citi. Please go ahead.\nSuneet Kamath: Thanks. I wanted to start high level, if I could. Charlie, at the 2019 Investor Day, I think, you guys laid out a strategy around financial wellness. And that initiative was supposed to get you to double-digit EPS growth and a 12% to 14% ROE kind of over the long term. Based on what you\u2019re talking about today, do you need to take these additional capital reallocation steps to get there, or should we think about these initiatives as potentially pushing you above what you guided to?\nRob Axel: Suneet, it\u2019s Rob. I\u2019ll jump in on that, if you don\u2019t mind. So, a couple of thoughts. One, since our Investor Day, obviously, rates have declined quite materially. And, given our current business mix, a low interest rate environment with a 10-year hovering around one, one, one, one five, [ph] presents headwinds to an improving ROE. I would note, nonetheless, that in a challenging year for the industry, 2020, we achieved an ROE of just under 11%. And I think that speaks to the strength and earnings potential of the mix of businesses that we have. I\u2019d also add that our focus, Suneet, is on not just ROE, but also on cost of equity, and importantly, the spread between the two. And the strategies and initiatives that Charlie outlined, I think, around derisking, simplifying and reducing market sensitivity and changing the business mix, I would look at as very much geared toward expanding that spread between our return on equity and our cost of equity.\nSuneet Kamath: Okay. And then, as we think about that $5 billion to $10 billion of capital that you\u2019re going to reallocate, is it fair to think about most of that coming from life and annuities? And, can you give us the amount of capital that\u2019s currently being consumed by those two businesses?\nCharlie Lowrey: Yes. Let me jump in on that, Suneet. As we\u2019ve said in the past, I think, everything is on the table, right? But, what we\u2019ve also said in this call is that we\u2019re really focused on annuities. And one of our priorities is annuities and shrinking annuities to 10% or less of earnings. But, in addition to that, what we\u2019re doing is that we\u2019re looking at all market sensitive, low-growth businesses or blocks of businesses in terms of runoff, reinsurance or sales. So, we\u2019re going to continue to look at those. Life will be one of the businesses we look at in addition to annuities, but not necessarily the only one.\nKen Tanji: Hey Suneet, it\u2019s Ken. I\u2019ll just -- you asked about the amount of capital. Our annuities business is predominantly within one company and one statutory company called Prudential Life Assurance Company and its statutory capital is a little bit more than $6 billion. Our Life business is well capitalized, but it\u2019s across a number of companies. And I don\u2019t have that aggregate number handy here.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nYaron Kinar: I guess, my first question is around the reduction of earnings coming from Individual Annuities. Can you achieve that without a block transfer or reinsurance deal? And, the reason I ask that is, I would think that there may be a bit more of a challenge to dispose of that given that it is more of a GLWB variable annuity block? And, we haven\u2019t seen a lot of appetite for that in the market to date. So, maybe you could address those questions?\nRob Axel: Yes. Yaron, it\u2019s Rob. I\u2019ll jump in first and then maybe Ken or Andy might want to jump in after me. But, just with respect to the first part of your question, as we think about our objective of getting our annuities business into -- to represent 10% or less of our overall earnings, I think as we indicated in our slides, not inconsequential component of that comes from the runoff of the existing legacy block, to the tune of about -- that legacy block runs off at about $3 billion a quarter. And so, that gets us to a range of 40% to 45% of our objective, just with respect to runoff. Why don\u2019t I ask to -- defer to Ken and Andy to talk a little bit about the multiples and deployment of capital in the market?\nKen Tanji: Yes, sure. Yaron, our variable annuity business is, as we\u2019ve said in the past, very well capitalized. It has a good profitability, cash flow and risk profile. And we don\u2019t see the fact that it\u2019s a GMWB book to present any unique or difficult challenges.\nYaron Kinar: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, I guess, on the flip side of that in terms of growth into the double growth markets. I\u2019m assuming there is this large inorganic component there, just considering the $5 billion to $10 billion that you\u2019re looking to deploy. In those markets, I would think the valuations there may be a little bit higher. So, how do you go about determining the use of -- prioritization of capital between buybacks, inorganic growth and organic growth in those emerging markets, asset management and the like?\nRob Axel: Yarun, it\u2019s Rob. I\u2019ll start out with that, and then I\u2019ll turn it over to others to answer the second part of your question. Just in terms of the amount of inorganic versus organic. As you think about the businesses that are grouped together in that sort of area that we\u2019re trying to grow to in excess of 30% or more of our earnings, those are higher growth businesses. They\u2019re dominated by PIGM. And PGIM, as we\u2019ve said before, is a business that is growing in the mid to high single digits on an organic basis. And so, as we think about that combined with the emerging markets and Assurance, which we think have the potential for quite high-growth rates, we think that in excess of a third of our objective can be accomplished, simply by organic growth. So, let me stop there and turn it over to others to answer the second part of your question.\nAndy Sullivan: So, Yaron, it\u2019s Andy. Maybe I\u2019ll jump in. This is a good spot to talk about PGIM and our plans around PGIM and how to accelerate into programmatic M&A. But first, I\u2019d reemphasize what Rob said. We\u2019ve had great growth in that business, and we expect that great growth to continue. When we look at our M&A opportunities in PGIM, we\u2019re looking to do, as we\u2019ve termed programmatic, which we would frame as methodical and planful, specifically leaning into new product and investment strategy capabilities. We feel very confident that when we do that, we can gain leverage from our distribution, might and strength. Obviously, anything we do have to fit with our multi-manager model because we don\u2019t want to be disruptive to that multi-manager model. And particular areas of interest are areas that are higher growth parts of the asset management business. So I would name alternatives as a key area as well as international.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erik Bass with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nErik Bass: How are you evaluating potential acquisitions in the growth markets that you\u2019ve highlighted? Are you focused on near-term earnings accretion, or is the bigger priority finding scalable properties with large addressable markets that you can grow over time?\nScott Sleyster: This is Scott. Why don\u2019t I start with that on the emerging markets front. First of all, we expect to remain focused on Latin America, emerging Asia and Africa, and primarily on those markets where we already have established operations and partners. And in some cases, I think that would include expansion into adjacent markets. For the most part, we\u2019ve been looking at, if you will, expanding into the markets that we\u2019re already in. And so, we might be adding a capability or a little bit of scale. I think, in those situations, the valuations have been relatively attractive. But going back to Charlie\u2019s opening remarks, we\u2019re going to be a disciplined buyer and make sure that we\u2019re earning an attractive return over our cost of capital before we deploy any funds, over a reasonable amount of time. Thanks.\nErik Bass: And then, maybe another one is on a similar topic, but as you consider annuity reinsurance transactions, how do you think about the challenge of replacing the lost earnings and potential for EPS dilution, if you\u2019re selling with a relatively low multiple business to potentially buy higher multiple businesses?\nKen Tanji: Erik, it\u2019s Ken. We are reallocating capital, as you suggest, to achieve better growth, to lower our market sensitivity and improve our quality of earnings. And, the combination, again, will deliver higher growth and less market sensitivity. And that we will believe will get recognized in terms of a lower cost of capital and expanded valuation that would offset the dilution.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nJimmy Bhullar: First, I just had a question on the Assurance IQ results. It was a good quarter on revenues, but you generated loss. And it seems like, at least from the outside, the business has done significantly worse than would have been expected when you announced the deal. So, what are your impressions of how that transaction has gone, now that you\u2019ve had it for about a year, a little bit over a year?\nAndy Sullivan: Yes. Jimmy, it\u2019s Andy. So, I\u2019ll handle your question. And you\u2019re correct, we now have four full quarters of operating the business under our belt. And we are very encouraged and glad that we have Assurance as part of our business mix, and see it as an expansion extension of our business model. Pretty early on in 2020, we made an explicit decision because we saw market opportunity to both expand and broaden the Assurance platform. And we did that from both the product and a distribution perspective. So, if you think of -- from a product perspective, we began to add additional product lines, product categories, like Medicare and like Property and Casualty. On the distribution side, we determined that we would be more successful over the long-term, if we add it on to the on-demand agent model. So, we now have an external BPO agent component and we\u2019re building out a Prudential W-2 agent component. That leaning in to organically growing the business and expanding the business has led to a pretty significant increase in OpEx, as you would expect. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re so focused on revenues because now it\u2019s about scaling up the platform. And we\u2019re very confident over the long term about the growth potential, both from a revenue perspective, but also expanding margins over time. As we said in previous quarters, we don\u2019t intend to provide or update any Assurance specific guidance other than what Rob sort of said at the top of the section about, in the near term, given our organic investment that I spoke to, we expect operating losses.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then, just on your annuity business, sequentially, you saw an improvement in variable annuity sales. And I wanted to get an idea -- and a lot of that I think is being driven by the FlexGuard product. I just wanted to get an idea on, is that fully rolled out to your distribution, or is there sort of still ramp-up potential for sales in that product? And relatedly, should we assume that sales in 1Q and through the first half of this year would be weak, because you\u2019re withdrawing the living benefit -- traditional living benefit products?\nAndy Sullivan: So, Jimmy, it\u2019s Andy. I\u2019ll take the question. And let me start with FlexGuard. Yes, we\u2019ve been very, very pleased with the success that we\u2019ve had of the FlexGuard buffered annuity product. In essence, we rolled it out in May. And through the -- May through December, we almost crossed $2 billion in sales. We think it\u2019s one of the most successful launches probably in the industry. And, the strength there is really coming from the strength of our business, the fact that our brand is so strong, our distribution and our relationships are so strong and we came out with a very good product. To your question of around momentum, we still are rolling it out to additional third-party intermediary. So, we have some additional work to go there. And, we also have a couple of states left that haven\u2019t rolled out. So, we\u2019re seeing great momentum and expect that momentum to continue. To the second part of your question, given the pivot that we\u2019re doing in that business, it was a pretty assertive and material change to see selling of our highest daily income and Prudential-defined income products. They were a big part of our sales in the past. So, that will have an impact on our overall sales and flows. And, I think, you could expect that we will see outflows from the business, due to that change.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nElyse Greenspan: My first question, I guess, is going back to some of the transactions you\u2019ve been talking about on the annuity side. So, depending upon, obviously, structure, you could potentially -- and how the sales or transaction takes place, there could potentially be some hit that I imagine you could potentially take the equity. So, how do we think about the leverage within your capital plan? Can you just update us on where you would see leverage going? And, I\u2019m assuming as you think through kind of freeing up capital that you\u2019ve taken into account and that you could probably absorb some hits and still keep your leverage within target, so the capital freed up, like you said, be used for some of this M&A within the growth market?\nKen Tanji: Yes. Elyse, it\u2019s Ken. As we look at these transactions, we\u2019ll be looking at a number of key metrics in making sure we keep them all in balance. That\u2019s whether it\u2019s potential charges or gains to our equity, depending upon the transaction terms, what it would do to our cash flow going forward, our earnings and our risk profile. And, very importantly, we\u2019ll be focused and disciplined on looking at fair value as we conduct these things. So, we\u2019ve managed our leverage ratio over time within our objectives to maintain our AA credit rating, and we\u2019ll continue to keep that a priority.\nElyse Greenspan: So, how high could it go? How high could the debt [Technical Difficulty] go?\nKen Tanji: We have some room and some flexibility. I don\u2019t want to pinpoint a number, and we\u2019ll -- but we manage to make sure we keep our objectives with our credit rating.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. And then, my second question, on your slide deck, you guys talk about growth market, doubling that to the greater than 30%. That does include -- you do mention that your growth markets do include Assurance IQ. So, I guess following up on one of the earlier questions. So, they\u2019re obviously embedded within the three-year outlook. There is some assumption for the Assurance contribution to earnings, because it sounds like your margins improve as the business scales. So, if you can give us a sense as you put this plan together over this three-year time period, what you\u2019re kind of assuming Assurance does ultimately add to earnings over time?\nKen Tanji: Yes. Elyse, it\u2019s Ken. As Andy mentioned, we are very-focused on growing this business, and that includes expanding distribution, expanding product lines, and that\u2019s requiring that we make some investments to realize the growth potential that\u2019s in the business that will lead to a modest loss in the near term. But, as that business scales and gains efficiency, we would see that gaining profitability. That\u2019s what I\u2019d add.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger, please go ahead, with KBW.\nRyan Krueger: In terms of the $5 billion to $10 billion of capital reallocation, given that your higher growth businesses are generally not -- wouldn\u2019t be very capital consumptive, is it fair to assume that $5 billion to $10 billion would also equate to the rough amount of programmatic M&A that you\u2019re anticipating to do?\nCharlie Lowrey: Yes. Ryan, it\u2019s Charlie. I think, that\u2019s a fair assumption. In other words, as we think about reallocating capital, we\u2019re reallocating capital from the lower growth, less market-sensitive businesses into the opposite, right, higher growth, higher market-sensitive businesses. So, it really is a reallocation of that capital, if you will, between the businesses.\nRyan Krueger: Got it. And then, on the Individual Annuities business, can you give us a rough sense of what percentage of those earnings are generated from the blocks that you\u2019ve now discontinued that have living benefit guarantees?\nCharlie Lowrey: Right now our current earnings are driven largely by our legacy business. We\u2019re new in the FlexGuard space. We\u2019re gaining great traction, and it\u2019s going well. But, the majority of our current earnings are from our legacy business.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Kligerman: So, another question on your M&A approach. You\u2019ve mentioned asset management, emerging markets. I haven\u2019t heard anything about Retirement and Group. And I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s -- I think, these are growth businesses. And I\u2019m wondering whether full-service and record-keeping and various group and voluntary businesses might be attractive M&As as well.\nCharlie Lowrey: Hey Andrew, it\u2019s Charlie. Let me start, and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Andy and Scott to elaborate some. But, I think, it\u2019s important to start with what we\u2019re not interested in, right? So, we\u2019re not interested in doing a mega transaction that expands over multiple businesses. What we\u2019ve said and what we\u2019re going to stick to is really looking at our less market sensitive, higher growth businesses, in this case, emphasizing asset management and emerging markets. And so, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. And we\u2019re going to do it in terms of programmatic M&A that really emphasizes a multi-manager model in PGIM and certain specific markets in emerging markets. But, I\u2019ll turn it over to Andy and to Scott to elaborate on that.\nAndy Sullivan: Yes. Andrew, it\u2019s Andy. I would just add, you specifically mentioned our institutional businesses. I\u2019ll frame it that way in full-service and in Group Insurance. We\u2019ve seen very good success in -- in particular with our financial wellness strategy at strengthening our institutional value prop in general. And that has led to good growth in both of those businesses. So, I would say, our focus in those businesses is to lean into that organic growth and to continue to see net revenue growth that flows from the investment in financial wellness.\nAndrew Kligerman: Got it. Very helpful. And then, in the Individual Life segment, I saw a line item, $130 million from reserve refinement. And, I think as I kind of very generally understand it, it was providing customers with information around options that they could have maybe in their UL policies. I\u2019m wondering what are those options, what exactly was offered to the customers, and just how did that $130 million reserves impact evolve?\nAndy Sullivan: So, Andrew, it\u2019s Andy again. I\u2019ll take your question. So, this was a business practice change, where in essence, we\u2019re giving more detailed communications to certain of our flexible premium product holders. The intention of that information is to help them proactively manage their policies and premiums. And, we believe that it will lead to less premiums coming in over time, thus, the financial charge. It does not have a material impact from a go-forward perspective on earnings.\nAndrew Kligerman: I\u2019m just trying to understand what would it mean that they don\u2019t have to pay premiums, they could use their cash value and that might prompt them to think, well, I shouldn\u2019t have been putting cash into the product. I just would like to understand what behaviors will change as a function of that, because $130 million is a significant charge.\nAndy Sullivan: Yes. So, Andrew, it\u2019s Andy again. So, in essence, on their annual statements and their payment notices, we\u2019re giving them more details around their premium flexibility, their requested premium amounts and their guarantees against lapsation. And we think that the customers working with their advisors, that will lead to less premiums coming in over time.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we go to the line of Tracy Benguigui with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nTracy Benguigui: As you\u2019re in the market speaking with potential buyers of close block sales, wondering if PGIM third-party investors, maybe consortium, has expressed any interest or appetite? I mean, that does not preclude other buyers. Just want to get a sense of PGIM\u2019s familiarity crew can reduce the bid-ask spread at all.\nAndy Sullivan: So, Tracy, it\u2019s Andy. Thank you very much for your question. We absolutely think PGIM clearly is a net positive to this overall process. We see more and more capital that sees value in the types of things that we do. And, we think that does enhance our opportunity in many different ways. We feel advantaged in that we own world-class origination capabilities, very strong asset liability matching capabilities and PGIM as a world-class investment manager, in particular, being very strong in alternatives. And as I said earlier is that being one of the areas that we look to strengthen even further. So, I do think that that\u2019s a positive for us. And we\u2019re excited for the possibilities that could create over time.\nTracy Benguigui: Okay, great. And then, besides your motivation of reducing market sensitivity, is part of the motivation to complete a block sale from the upcoming accounting changes from LBTI? Another insurers divesting their own life and annuity business and said that the reduction to equity under LDTI would have been worse than the book value loss from the sale. Now, I\u2019m not asking you to comment on that specific transaction, but just to get a sense of your willingness to sell at a law and how LDTI may be a motivating factor.\nKen Tanji: Hey Tracy, it\u2019s Ken. First, TI is a few years away, and I don\u2019t want to comment on someone else\u2019s deal or nor do I have a specific transaction for us to comment on. But, with respect to deals, like I said, we\u2019re going to evaluate things through a number of metrics. One will be its impact on book value, earnings, cash flow, capital risk, we\u2019ll take that all into consideration. And so, I can\u2019t comment beyond there because it would be being too general.\nCharlie Lowrey: Well, Ken, maybe I\u2019ll just add, Tracy. Recall, our accounting that we use for our annuities is different than most others that are in the industry are using for their accounting. And under TI, there actually is not a significant change to the accounting of the living benefit in our book, vis-\u00e0-vis the way in which we currently account for it. So, that may be part of the explanation to your question as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners.\nHumphrey Lee: Just to follow back on Assurance IQ. I understand that you don\u2019t want to provide any kind of updated guidance in terms of revenue or margin since the original announcement, but basically, suggesting it will be in operating losses in the near term. Given the, I guess, where it has been trending, do you feel like you could turn to be profitable by 2022? And then also, how should we think about the impact on the additional earn-out? Looking at it right now, it doesn\u2019t look like that may be achievable. So, could there be any impact to the key person retention issues, given the changes -- the challenges on the earn-out?\nAndy Sullivan: So Humphrey, it\u2019s Andy. As we talked about, we are seeing progress as we launch product lines, the process we basically go through is we need to become more efficient at marketing those products. And then, obviously, as we build out the distribution end of things, we need to get to a place where we\u2019re getting better and better at conversion. We have seen quarter-over-quarter throughout 2020 our conversion rates get better. We have seen, and we won\u2019t get into specifics, but product lines that we\u2019ve started to see start to get towards the levels of profitability that we would expect. We\u2019re still not going to comment on specific timing, but we do like the trajectory that we\u2019re on and we intend to continue to investing. The operating losses near-term have everything to do with the decision we made to really accelerate our investment and now we have the job in front of us that we\u2019re confident in of scaling up the revenue.\nKen Tanji: And Humphrey, it\u2019s Ken. On the earn-out, it\u2019s based upon variable profits, and it\u2019s over a three-year period. So, it\u2019s still in place until the 2022. And it was designed to incent them to outperform our expectations. And right now, it\u2019s still -- it has two years to go, and it\u2019s still in place.\nHumphrey Lee: Okay. Shifting gear, as you shrink the annuity business, how should we think about the overhead or kind of potential stranded costs related to shrinking that book of business? Especially given two years ago, when you talked about the financial wellness, part of the cost synergy was having all of the different businesses sharing the call center and the back office support. And now, you have a major part of that potentially shrinking and reducing your overall earnings contribution. So, how should we think about the potential kind of overheads related to that side of the business? And how are you going to address that?\nCharlie Lowrey: Yes. First, as we indicated with our progress in 2020, we\u2019re making a really good progress when we accelerated our progress and increased our objectives with our transformation program. And it\u2019s also given us capabilities that we\u2019ll be able to apply should, as we reallocate capital, we need to deal with stranded costs. Also keep in mind, we\u2019re reallocating that capital. So, as we may shift it from annuities, we\u2019ll be redeploying it into new earnings opportunities as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Barnidge with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nJohn Barnidge: Does it seem reasonable to think that there will be elevated administrative expenses and group disability to process COVID claims as long as the pandemic remains? I asked that in light of the 2-point increase for the year.\nAndy Sullivan: Yes. John, it\u2019s Andy. I\u2019ll take your question. Yes, your assumption is absolutely reasonable. One of the most important things during a period of time like this as a disability carrier is properly investing in the disability claims staff. So, some of what you saw in our admin ratio in the fourth quarter was us adding to staff. That\u2019s claims managers, that\u2019s nursers, that\u2019s folk specialists, to make sure that our claims personnel have the adequate time and space to properly help our customers and help them return to work. So, it is reasonable to assume as incidence goes up, which typically happens during the recession, we have not yet seen that on the LTD side, but we are expecting to see it, that we would continue to invest and maintain the right level of claims teams, and that would be a higher level of investment.\nJohn Barnidge: Great. And then, unrelated to that, Israel has been the country that has enacted the most aggressive vaccination program globally. Are there any markers that you\u2019ve seen out of the country in the weeks since they began this that provides maybe some insight around timing of maybe COVID tapering off a little bit?\nCharlie Lowrey: So, John, this is Charlie. I think, we are encouraged by what we see in terms of the -- both the introduction of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, but also the potential of Johnson & Johnson coming with a completely different kind of vaccine, right? It\u2019s a one-shot vaccine, it doesn\u2019t need cold chain storage. And we think that could have a large effect on the ability of this country to get vaccinations, if you will. So, over the course of the next three to six months, we\u2019re not going to say it\u2019s going to happen overnight, but we think there\u2019s going to be a material change in the ability to vaccinate people as we go forward. And that can only enure to the Company -- to the country\u2019s benefit and to the reduction in the transmission of the virus.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we go to the line of Tom Gallagher with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nTom Gallagher: Hi. First question is, you mentioned that one-third of the $5 billion to $10 billion of capital deployment will come through organic growth. I guess, that seems like a high number, considering PGIM and Assurance IQ shouldn\u2019t have much capital intensity. So, is that largely coming from the OEM [ph] side?\nCharlie Lowrey: Yes. Let me clarify what I said, Tom. Apologies if I wasn\u2019t clear. What I was saying is that in excess of a third of the earnings growth that gets us from 18% of our total earnings to 30% of our total earnings comes from organic growth, not that in excess of a third of the capital is organic. So, I hope that clarifies that point.\nTom Gallagher: That does. The other question I had is just a follow-up on the broader M&A strategy. I get, like group benefits and retirement aren\u2019t high growth businesses, but they\u2019re capital efficient. And so, just curious, why these wouldn\u2019t be M&A areas?\nCharlie Lowrey: So, let me start with that. And Andy, you may want to join in afterwards. But, the way we look at those businesses, and I think consistent with what Andy said before is, it is not that we are not investing in those businesses. We will continue to invest in them for purposes of organic growth. But, when you think about the areas in which we want to reallocate capital, if you will, to higher growth businesses with less market sensitivity, those are -- our priorities are certainly PGIM and emerging markets. And Andy, I don\u2019t know if you want to expand on that, but...\nAndy Sullivan: No, nothing to add, Charlie.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Josh Shanker with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\nJosh Shanker: If we go back to the Investor Day that we keep bringing up, I guess, the big difference is the parting ways of the annuities or at least certainly the high capital consumptive annuities. If I want to, like -- are there other strategic changes that really come out? Just put numbers to things that were already in motion, or are there other strategic changes embedded in those numbers that we really should focus on?\nCharlie Lowrey: So, I\u2019ll take a first stab at that, and then Rob, maybe you want to join in. But, I think when you look at our strategy, we still have the wellness strategy. That still exists. It\u2019s still a very much part of what was our Investor Day presentation back then and is -- continues to be there. What we\u2019ve done with a much lower interest rate environment and with a strategic review is, again, say, where we want to reallocate capital. And that\u2019s new, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve come out with this quarter, in terms of thinking where we want to be in three years with the higher growth businesses. So, if I were to articulate a difference, it would be there. And Rob, I don\u2019t know if you have other things you can elaborate on?\nRob Axel: Yes, Josh, so thank you for the question. Just to elaborate a little bit on what Charlie\u2019s saying. I think, Josh, if you think about what we said in Investor Day, all of that is largely intact, as we described it around our organic growth opportunities. We have said that it\u2019s -- that our near-term aspirations around some of that are -- we\u2019re facing headwinds with regard to a much lower interest rate environment than we were in at the point in time in which we articulated that. But, I think it\u2019s not just the pivot away from annuities, but as Charlie said, it\u2019s also as contrasted to what we described at Investor Day, the reallocation of -- the active reallocation of capital more broadly and into those growth businesses. So, I would call -- not just call out -- not just the emphasis of annuities because of its -- not because we don\u2019t think incidentally, it\u2019s a very good business. We think it produces tremendous cash flows. It\u2019s well capitalized. It\u2019s well hedged. We just happen to believe that it\u2019s a business that will get better value in private markets than how we\u2019re getting rewarded in the public market for that today. And that gives us an opportunity to arbitrage capital and to reinvest it into areas in which we can be rewarded in the public market. And those would be the growth areas that we\u2019ve articulated.\nJosh Shanker: So in presenting the plan to the Board, where we\u2019re going to -- it\u2019s going to be probably earnings dilutive, but we\u2019re going to get higher multiple earnings out of it and less market sensitivity. Is there any frame for the magnitude of the dilution that was presented in order to make this change?\nCharlie Lowrey: So let me take a stab at that. And, what we really -- what we present to the Board and what we present externally is it\u2019s really a balance, right? It\u2019s a balance between the reallocation of capital into these higher growth businesses, but also a redeployment of capital. And in this case, we\u2019ve articulated $10 billion to shareholders in terms of share repurchases and dividends. And so, what we\u2019ve attempted to do is balance the two, right? Say, we\u2019re going into higher growth markets. And so therefore, hopefully, we will have a higher multiple as we go forward, and yet return a significant amount of capital to shareholders as we have done in the past and will continue to do in the future.\nJosh Shanker: Okay. Well, I\u2019ll try and do some math, and maybe Darin will help me out down the line. I appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Now, we will turn it back to Charlie Lowrey, for closing comments.\nCharlie Lowrey: Okay. Thank you very much. In closing today, I\u2019d just like to reinforce our commitment to creating a new and more nimble Prudential, one that remains deeply focused on its customers, that will have a higher growth potential and will be less market-sensitive in the future. We\u2019re excited and we\u2019re optimistic about this next phase of our transformation. And we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress. So, thanks again for joining us today.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Conferencing Service. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Charlie Lowrey",
            "content": "Thank you, Darin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As we approach the one year mark of the global pandemic, I hope that you, your families and colleagues remain safe and healthy in this continuing difficult environment. As before, we remain deeply focused on the well-being of our employees, customers, communities and other stakeholders, and on addressing their evolving needs and challenges. Amid the extraordinary events of 2020, we continue to take steps to evolve our business for the future while living up to our purpose. Turning to slide 2. We successfully executed on a number of our strategic initiatives in 2020 to reduce our market sensitivity and increase our growth potential, including the expansion of our cost savings program, while further solidifying our already robust financial position. We're now focused on building upon our achievements over the past year to further accelerate our strategy. I'll speak to this next phase of our transformation in more detail momentarily, but will start by recapping our accomplishments in 2020. Turning to slide 3. We realized $215 million in cost savings during the year, exceeding our $140 million target. Recall that last quarter, we increased our cost savings target to $750 million to be realized by the end of 2023. We also began to rotate our international earnings mix towards higher growth markets. During the year, we completed the sale of our Korea business and announced the sale of our Taiwan business. We also took significant steps to address the low interest rate environment with derisking actions such as repricing products and pivoting to less interest rate sensitive solutions. This pivot included discontinuing sales of variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits and launching a buffered annuity product, FlexGuard, which is less sensitive to market fluctuations while continuing to serve our customer needs. Turning to slide 4. As we look ahead, we're building upon the actions we've already taken, as well as our competitive strengths to significantly transform the Company over the medium term. To achieve this transformation, we expect to deliver on our cost savings program and to reallocate $5 billion to $10 billion in capital over the next three years, as we pivot towards higher growth and less market-sensitive businesses. In parallel to this capital reallocation, we anticipate returning $10 billion of capital to shareholders over the next three years. This includes dividends as well as share repurchases that are returning -- that are resuming in the first quarter, under our new $1.5 billion authorization. As a result of these efforts, Prudential should emerge as a higher growth, less market-sensitive, and more nimble business that is positioned not only to deliver growth for shareholders. But also to make a more meaningful difference in the financial lives of more people around the world. Turning to slide 5. As we transform to become a higher growth, less market-sensitive business, we expect to double our growth businesses to more than 30% of earnings and have our Individual Annuities business to 10% or less of earnings. We will change our business mix primarily through organic growth and programmatic acquisitions for both our global asset manager, PGIM, and in emerging markets within our international businesses. PGIM manages $1.5 trillion of assets, which we have grown both, organically and through acquisitions of talent and capabilities. In emerging markets, we have expanded with joint ventures and acquisitions in regions with large markets and favorable demographic tailwinds, such as Asia, Latin America and Africa. We benefit from strong relationships with companies that have a large footprint and a significant local market expertise. In addition, we will remain focused on investing in our other businesses to expand our addressable market as well as continue to improve expense and capital efficiency. Additional actions to change our business mix include derisking and other transactions in conjunction with running off certain blocks of business. The $1.6 billion of capital generated from the sale of Korea business is included in the $5 billion to $10 billion we plan to reallocate into our growth businesses. Our change in business mix will obviously not be a straight line. But, as we reallocate capital, we'll provide you with information to help you both understand and measure our progress. Turning to slide 6. We are well-positioned to execute this strategic plan with a rock solid balance sheet. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had $5.6 billion in highly liquid assets. And our operating subsidiaries continue to hold capital to support AA financial strength ratings. Finally, let's turn to slide 7. During this time of change in transformation, our commitment to our Company purpose and to supporting all our stakeholders remains as fundamental as ever. The importance of this work is reflected in the multiple environmental, social and governance initiatives that we advanced over the course of this quarter and throughout 2020. Here are some of the noteworthy accomplishments. We became the first U.S. insurer to insure a green bond aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. We furthered our commitment to environmental transparency and accountability by disclosing our environmental impact through CDP, the world's leading environmental disclosure platform. Prudential scored an A minus on CDP's 2020 Climate Change Survey. We introduced nine commitments to advance further the work we've been doing on racial equity, spanning our talent practices, our design and delivery of products, our investments and public policy works and our support of community institutions working to remove persistent obstacles to black economic empowerment. I'm also pleased that we'll continue to tie inclusion and diversity with executive compensation. Three years ago, we added an inclusion and diversity performance modifier that factored into our 2020 compensation plan. Over this period, diverse representation amongst senior management has increased. We're including this type of modifier again to drive us to improve further our inclusion and diversity over the next three years. Before closing, I'd like to say thank you to all our employees around the world. It's through your hard work and dedication that we've been able to successfully help our customers and advance our transformation. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob for more specific details on our business performance. Thank you all for your time this morning. Yes. Let me jump in on that, Suneet. As we've said in the past, I think, everything is on the table, right? But, what we've also said in this call is that we're really focused on annuities. And one of our priorities is annuities and shrinking annuities to 10% or less of earnings. But, in addition to that, what we're doing is that we're looking at all market sensitive, low-growth businesses or blocks of businesses in terms of runoff, reinsurance or sales. So, we're going to continue to look at those. Life will be one of the businesses we look at in addition to annuities, but not necessarily the only one. Yes. Ryan, it's Charlie. I think, that's a fair assumption. In other words, as we think about reallocating capital, we're reallocating capital from the lower growth, less market-sensitive businesses into the opposite, right, higher growth, higher market-sensitive businesses. So, it really is a reallocation of that capital, if you will, between the businesses. Right now our current earnings are driven largely by our legacy business. We're new in the FlexGuard space. We're gaining great traction, and it's going well. But, the majority of our current earnings are from our legacy business. Hey Andrew, it's Charlie. Let me start, and then I'll turn it over to Andy and Scott to elaborate some. But, I think, it's important to start with what we're not interested in, right? So, we're not interested in doing a mega transaction that expands over multiple businesses. What we've said and what we're going to stick to is really looking at our less market sensitive, higher growth businesses, in this case, emphasizing asset management and emerging markets. And so, that's what we're going to do. And we're going to do it in terms of programmatic M&A that really emphasizes a multi-manager model in PGIM and certain specific markets in emerging markets. But, I'll turn it over to Andy and to Scott to elaborate on that. Well, Ken, maybe I'll just add, Tracy. Recall, our accounting that we use for our annuities is different than most others that are in the industry are using for their accounting. And under TI, there actually is not a significant change to the accounting of the living benefit in our book, vis-a\u0300-vis the way in which we currently account for it. So, that may be part of the explanation to your question as well. Yes. First, as we indicated with our progress in 2020, we're making a really good progress when we accelerated our progress and increased our objectives with our transformation program. And it's also given us capabilities that we'll be able to apply should, as we reallocate capital, we need to deal with stranded costs. Also keep in mind, we're reallocating that capital. So, as we may shift it from annuities, we'll be redeploying it into new earnings opportunities as well. So, John, this is Charlie. I think, we are encouraged by what we see in terms of the -- both the introduction of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, but also the potential of Johnson & Johnson coming with a completely different kind of vaccine, right? It's a one-shot vaccine, it doesn't need cold chain storage. And we think that could have a large effect on the ability of this country to get vaccinations, if you will. So, over the course of the next three to six months, we're not going to say it's going to happen overnight, but we think there's going to be a material change in the ability to vaccinate people as we go forward. And that can only enure to the Company -- to the country's benefit and to the reduction in the transmission of the virus. Yes. Let me clarify what I said, Tom. Apologies if I wasn't clear. What I was saying is that in excess of a third of the earnings growth that gets us from 18% of our total earnings to 30% of our total earnings comes from organic growth, not that in excess of a third of the capital is organic. So, I hope that clarifies that point. So, let me start with that. And Andy, you may want to join in afterwards. But, the way we look at those businesses, and I think consistent with what Andy said before is, it is not that we are not investing in those businesses.

And in this case, we've articulated $10 billion to shareholders in terms of share repurchases and dividends. And so, what we've attempted to do is balance the two, right? Say, we're going into higher growth markets. And so therefore, hopefully, we will have a higher multiple as we go forward, and yet return a significant amount of capital to shareholders as we have done in the past and will continue to do in the future. Okay. Thank you very much. In closing today, I'd just like to reinforce our commitment to creating a new and more nimble Prudential, one that remains deeply focused on its customers, that will have a higher growth potential and will be less market-sensitive in the future. We're excited and we're optimistic about this next phase of our transformation. And we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress. So, thanks again for joining us today."

            "content": "Thanks, Rob. I'll begin on slide 12, which provides insight into earnings for the first quarter of 2021 relative to our fourth quarter results. Pretax adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter was $1.5 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $2.93 on an after-tax basis. Then, we adjust for the following items. First, variable investment income outperformed expectations in the fourth quarter, which is worth $360 million. Second, we adjust underwriting experience by a net $65 million. This includes a placeholder for COVID-19 claims experienced across our businesses of $170 million, based on 250,000 COVID-19-related fatalities in the U.S. during the first quarter. Third, we expect expenses to be $165 million lower in the first quarter, primarily due to seasonal items in the fourth quarter. Fourth, there are other items that may be $40 million more favorable in the first quarter. As Rob discussed, in the fourth quarter, we recorded a charge for the change in our Individual Life business practice, which was partially offset by strong other related revenues in PGIM. Fifth, we anticipate net investment income will be reduced by $15 million, reflecting the difference between new money rates and disposition yields of our investment portfolio. And last, we expect the first quarter effective tax rate to normalize. These items combined gets us to a of $2.54 per share for the first quarter. I'll note that if you exclude items specific to the first quarter, earnings per share would be $2.90 per share. The key takeaway is that this is roughly in line with the prior quarter. While we have provided these items to consider, please note that there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the first quarter. As we look forward, I'd like to bring your attention to a few other items in the appendix. In addition to the seasonal considerations on slide 25, we have included other considerations for 2021 on slide 26. Notably, we expect to realize an increase in cost savings from $250 million in 2020 to $400 million in 2021. We also provided the expected net cost for Corporate & Other, the yen foreign exchange rate and the effective tax rate for 2021. On slide 13, we've provided an update on the potential impact of the pandemic. The estimated sensitivity of operating income for $100,000 incremental U.S. deaths due to the pandemic is $85 million based on our updated outlook. This is up slightly from our prior sensitivity as the virus more broadly spreads across demographics and geographies, including the insured population. As I noted earlier, our first quarter baseline includes a net mortality impact of $170 million, due to COVID-19. The actual impact will depend on a variety of factors, such as infection and fatality rates, geographic considerations, and the speed and effectiveness of the vaccine rollout. Turning to slide 14. We maintain a robust capital position and adequate sources of funding. Our capital position continues to support a AA financial strength rating, and we have substantial sources of funding. Our cash and liquid assets at the parent Company were $5.6 billion at the end of the quarter, which is greater than 3 times annual fixed charges. And other sources of funds include free cash flow from our businesses and other contingent capital facilities. Turning to slide 15 and in summary. We successfully executed our 2020 initiatives, and we are building on those initiatives to transform Prudential into a higher growth, less market-sensitive and more nimble business. And we continue to benefit from the strength of our rock solid balance sheet. Now, I'll turn it to the operator for your questions. Hey Suneet, it's Ken. I'll just -- you asked about the amount of capital. Our annuities business is predominantly within one company and one statutory company called Prudential Life Assurance Company and its statutory capital is a little bit more than $6 billion. Our Life business is well capitalized, but it's across a number of companies. And I don't have that aggregate number handy here. Yes, sure. Yaron, our variable annuity business is, as we've said in the past, very well capitalized. It has a good profitability, cash flow and risk profile. And we don't see the fact that it's a GMWB book to present any unique or difficult challenges. Erik, it's Ken. We are reallocating capital, as you suggest, to achieve better growth, to lower our market sensitivity and improve our quality of earnings. And, the combination, again, will deliver higher growth and less market sensitivity. And that we will believe will get recognized in terms of a lower cost of capital and expanded valuation that would offset the dilution. Yes. Elyse, it's Ken. As we look at these transactions, we'll be looking at a number of key metrics in making sure we keep them all in balance. That's whether it's potential charges or gains to our equity, depending upon the transaction terms, what it would do to our cash flow going forward, our earnings and our risk profile. And, very importantly, we'll be focused and disciplined on looking at fair value as we conduct these things. So, we've managed our leverage ratio over time within our objectives to maintain our AA credit rating, and we'll continue to keep that a priority. We have some room and some flexibility. I don't want to pinpoint a number, and we'll -- but we manage to make sure we keep our objectives with our credit rating. Yes. Elyse, it's Ken. As Andy mentioned, we are very-focused on growing this business, and that includes expanding distribution, expanding product lines, and that's requiring that we make some investments to realize the growth potential that's in the business that will lead to a modest loss in the near term. But, as that business scales and gains efficiency, we would see that gaining profitability. That's what I'd add. Hey Tracy, it's Ken. First, TI is a few years away, and I don't want to comment on someone else's deal or nor do I have a specific transaction for us to comment on. But, with respect to deals, like I said, we're going to evaluate things through a number of metrics. One will be its impact on book value, earnings, cash flow, capital risk, we'll take that all into consideration. And so, I can't comment beyond there because it would be being too general. And Humphrey, it's Ken. On the earn-out, it's based upon variable profits, and it's over a three-year period. So, it's still in place until the 2022. And it was designed to incent them to outperform our expectations. And right now, it's still -- it has two years to go, and it's still in place."

            "name": "Rob Axel",
            "content": "Thank you, Charlie. I'll provide an overview of our financial results, and update on our strategic progress and highlights of our outlook for our U.S., PGIM and international businesses. Turning to slide 8, I'll begin with our financial results for the year. On a pretax, adjusted operating income for 2020 was $5.1 billion or $10.21 per share on an after-tax basis. In the fourth quarter, our pretax adjusted operating income was $1.5 billion or $2.93 a share. Earnings exceeded the year-ago quarter as increases in our PGIM and international businesses as well as our Corporate & Other operations, offset a decline in our U.S. businesses. Results of our U.S. businesses reflected heightened COVID-19-related mortality experience as well as lower fee income in our Individual Annuities business, primarily due to outflows. This was partially offset by higher net investment spread results, driven by higher variable investment income and lower expenses. In addition, we made a change in our Individual Life procedures that provides policyholders information to better manage their policies and premiums for certain flexible premium policies. Due to this change, we have revised the estimated premiums to be paid for these policies, resulting in an adjustment to reserves. We also established and incurred, but not reported, our IBNR reserve in our group insurance business for the expected increase in disability claims as a result of the lag effect from higher unemployment. PGIM, our global asset manager, reported record assets under management of $1.5 trillion, up 13% from a year ago, as well as higher net asset management fees and record high other related revenues. And, earnings in our international businesses increased 6%, reflecting business growth, lower expenses and more favorable underwriting results, partially offset by lower net investment spread. Turning to slide 9. Our U.S. businesses produce a diversified source of earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income, which includes the benefits from netting longevity and mortality experience. We continued to make progress this quarter, executing on our priorities, including implementing pricing and product actions to derisk our business mix while protecting profitability and expanding our addressable market. Our product pivot has worked well with sales of our buffered annuity, FlexGuard, doubling to $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter from $600 million in the third quarter. And the pandemic has increased awareness of the value of our broad set of life insurance and financial solutions as we continue to enhance our capabilities to reach people when, where and how they want. These capabilities include traditional agents and financial advisors, the workplace. [Technical Difficulty] million people have access to our financial [Technical Difficulty] With respect to Assurance, we launched our Medicare business a little more than a year ago. As a result of investments in our distribution capacity, marketing capabilities and development of new technology, we nearly tripled our fourth quarter Medicare revenues versus the year ago quarter. We expect to continue to grow these revenues as we further expand distribution, utilize newly developed tools for data-driven consumer product recommendations and broaden our marketing. In addition, this gives us further confidence as we develop and launch additional product lines. Customer interest for our simply term life insurance product through Assurance has been strong, although sales have been lower than expected. We continue to modify our underwriting processes to allow for more instant decisions. As we streamline this process and improve the customer experience, we expect our life revenues to grow. Total revenues are primary financial metric for Assurance as we concentrate on scaling the business, doubled versus the year ago quarter. We're adding more carriers in all of our existing markets and expanding into new product lines. To execute this expansion, we have increased our investments in marketing, distribution and infrastructure. We expect operating losses in the near-term and earnings to emerge as we reach scale. Now, turning to slide 10. PGIM continues to demonstrate the strength and resilience of its diversified platform as a top 10 active global investment manager. PGIM's strong investment performance and diversified global investment capabilities in both, public and private asset classes across fixed income, alternatives, real estate and equities, position us favorably to capture flows. PGIM's investment performance demonstrated resiliency with more than 90% of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last 3, 5 and 10-year periods. This investment performance contributed $6.3 billion of third-party net flows during the fourth quarter, including $3.8 billion of retail and $2.5 billion of institutional flows, resulting in $20 billion of net flows for the year. Of note, PGIM investments achieved the highest U.S. mutual fund franchise ranking, based on net flows in 2020. PGIM's strong overall flows were driven by continued investor appetite for fixed income strategies, particularly higher-yielding strategies and for real estate. PGIM's asset management fees increased 12% compared to the year ago quarter, reflecting growth in average assets under management. In addition, record high agency loan production and the effect of strong investment performance on incentive fees as well as co-investment and seed investment earnings, drove significant growth in other related revenues. These results contributed to an increase in PGIM's operating margin, which was in excess of 36% for the quarter. While PGIM's operating margin will vary with market conditions, we expect to sustain a margin of approximately 30% across the cycle. Turning to slide 11. Our International Businesses include our Japanese life insurance operation, where we have a differentiated multichannel distribution model as well as other operations focused on high-growth markets. As anticipated, Life Planner sales in the quarter were reduced by the accelerated sales in Japan last quarter, following the U.S. dollar-denominated product repricing in August. For the year, we were pleased that sales were about flat as our high-quality distribution overcame the effect of the pandemic-related shutdown. Similar to Life Planner, Gibraltar sales were reduced in the current quarter, and sales for the full year were about even with the prior year. While we do not report separately on our emerging markets businesses, we would note that Brazil's life insurance in force grew by 10% from a year ago, and our Chilean pension business held its number one ranking for market share benefiting from continued favorable investment performance. On slide 17 in the appendix, we listed some of the emerging markets that we're in and our local relationships that have significant market leadership positions. And with that, I'll hand it over to Ken. Suneet, it's Rob. I'll jump in on that, if you don't mind. So, a couple of thoughts. One, since our Investor Day, obviously, rates have declined quite materially. And, given our current business mix, a low interest rate environment with a 10-year hovering around one, one, one, one five, [ph] presents headwinds to an improving ROE. I would note, nonetheless, that in a challenging year for the industry, 2020, we achieved an ROE of just under 11%. And I think that speaks to the strength and earnings potential of the mix of businesses that we have. I'd also add that our focus, Suneet, is on not just ROE, but also on cost of equity, and importantly, the spread between the two. And the strategies and initiatives that Charlie outlined, I think, around derisking, simplifying and reducing market sensitivity and changing the business mix, I would look at as very much geared toward expanding that spread between our return on equity and our cost of equity. Yes. Yaron, it's Rob. I'll jump in first and then maybe Ken or Andy might want to jump in after me. But, just with respect to the first part of your question, as we think about our objective of getting our annuities business into -- to represent 10% or less of our overall earnings, I think as we indicated in our slides, not inconsequential component of that comes from the runoff of the existing legacy block, to the tune of about -- that legacy block runs off at about $3 billion a quarter. And so, that gets us to a range of 40% to 45% of our objective, just with respect to runoff. Why don't I ask to -- defer to Ken and Andy to talk a little bit about the multiples and deployment of capital in the market? Yarun, it's Rob. I'll start out with that, and then I'll turn it over to others to answer the second part of your question. Just in terms of the amount of inorganic versus organic. As you think about the businesses that are grouped together in that sort of area that we're trying to grow to in excess of 30% or more of our earnings, those are higher growth businesses. They're dominated by PIGM. And PGIM, as we've said before, is a business that is growing in the mid to high single digits on an organic basis. And so, as we think about that combined with the emerging markets and Assurance, which we think have the potential for quite high-growth rates, we think that in excess of a third of our objective can be accomplished, simply by organic growth. So, let me stop there and turn it over to others to answer the second part of your question. Yes, Josh, so thank you for the question. Just to elaborate a little bit on what Charlie's saying. I think, Josh, if you think about what we said in Investor Day, all of that is largely intact, as we described it around our organic growth opportunities. We have said that it's -- that our near-term aspirations around some of that are -- we're facing headwinds with regard to a much lower interest rate environment than we were in at the point in time in which we articulated that. But, I think it's not just the pivot away from annuities, but as Charlie said, it's also as contrasted to what we described at Investor Day, the reallocation of -- the active reallocation of capital more broadly and into those growth businesses. So, I would call -- not just call out -- not just the emphasis of annuities because of its -- not because we don't think incidentally, it's a very good business. We think it produces tremendous cash flows. It's well capitalized. It's well hedged. We just happen to believe that it's a business that will get better value in private markets than how we're getting rewarded in the public market for that today. And that gives us an opportunity to arbitrage capital and to reinvest it into areas in which we can be rewarded in the public market. And those would be the growth areas that we've articulated."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Andy Sullivan",
            "content": "So, Yaron, it's Andy. Maybe I'll jump in. This is a good spot to talk about PGIM and our plans around PGIM and how to accelerate into programmatic M&A. But first, I'd reemphasize what Rob said. We've had great growth in that business, and we expect that great growth to continue. When we look at our M&A opportunities in PGIM, we're looking to do, as we've termed programmatic, which we would frame as methodical and planful, specifically leaning into new product and investment strategy capabilities. We feel very confident that when we do that, we can gain leverage from our distribution, might and strength. Obviously, anything we do have to fit with our multi-manager model because we don't want to be disruptive to that multi-manager model. And particular areas of interest are areas that are higher growth parts of the asset management business. So I would name alternatives as a key area as well as international. Yes. Jimmy, it's Andy. So, I'll handle your question. And you're correct, we now have four full quarters of operating the business under our belt. And we are very encouraged and glad that we have Assurance as part of our business mix, and see it as an expansion extension of our business model. Pretty early on in 2020, we made an explicit decision because we saw market opportunity to both expand and broaden the Assurance platform. And we did that from both the product and a distribution perspective. So, if you think of -- from a product perspective, we began to add additional product lines, product categories, like Medicare and like Property and Casualty. On the distribution side, we determined that we would be more successful over the long-term, if we add it on to the on-demand agent model. So, we now have an external BPO agent component and we're building out a Prudential W-2 agent component. That leaning in to organically growing the business and expanding the business has led to a pretty significant increase in OpEx, as you would expect. And that's why we're so focused on revenues because now it's about scaling up the platform. And we're very confident over the long term about the growth potential, both from a revenue perspective, but also expanding margins over time. As we said in previous quarters, we don't intend to provide or update any Assurance specific guidance other than what Rob sort of said at the top of the section about, in the near term, given our organic investment that I spoke to, we expect operating losses. So, Jimmy, it's Andy. I'll take the question. And let me start with FlexGuard. Yes, we've been very, very pleased with the success that we've had of the FlexGuard buffered annuity product. In essence, we rolled it out in May. And through the -- May through December, we almost crossed $2 billion in sales. We think it's one of the most successful launches probably in the industry. And, the strength there is really coming from the strength of our business, the fact that our brand is so strong, our distribution and our relationships are so strong and we came out with a very good product. To your question of around momentum, we still are rolling it out to additional third-party intermediary. So, we have some additional work to go there. And, we also have a couple of states left that haven't rolled out. So, we're seeing great momentum and expect that momentum to continue. To the second part of your question, given the pivot that we're doing in that business, it was a pretty assertive and material change to see selling of our highest daily income and Prudential-defined income products. They were a big part of our sales in the past. So, that will have an impact on our overall sales and flows. And, I think, you could expect that we will see outflows from the business, due to that change. Yes. Andrew, it's Andy. I would just add, you specifically mentioned our institutional businesses. I'll frame it that way in full-service and in Group Insurance. We've seen very good success in -- in particular with our financial wellness strategy at strengthening our institutional value prop in general. And that has led to good growth in both of those businesses. So, I would say, our focus in those businesses is to lean into that organic growth and to continue to see net revenue growth that flows from the investment in financial wellness. So, Andrew, it's Andy again. I'll take your question. So, this was a business practice change, where in essence, we're giving more detailed communications to certain of our flexible premium product holders. The intention of that information is to help them proactively manage their policies and premiums. And, we believe that it will lead to less premiums coming in over time, thus, the financial charge. It does not have a material impact from a go-forward perspective on earnings. Yes. So, Andrew, it's Andy again. So, in essence, on their annual statements and their payment notices, we're giving them more details around their premium flexibility, their requested premium amounts and their guarantees against lapsation. And we think that the customers working with their advisors, that will lead to less premiums coming in over time. So, Tracy, it's Andy. Thank you very much for your question. We absolutely think PGIM clearly is a net positive to this overall process. We see more and more capital that sees value in the types of things that we do. And, we think that does enhance our opportunity in many different ways. We feel advantaged in that we own world-class origination capabilities, very strong asset liability matching capabilities and PGIM as a world-class investment manager, in particular, being very strong in alternatives. And as I said earlier is that being one of the areas that we look to strengthen even further. So, I do think that that's a positive for us. And we're excited for the possibilities that could create over time. So Humphrey, it's Andy. As we talked about, we are seeing progress as we launch product lines, the process we basically go through is we need to become more efficient at marketing those products. And then, obviously, as we build out the distribution end of things, we need to get to a place where we're getting better and better at conversion. We have seen quarter-over-quarter throughout 2020 our conversion rates get better. We have seen, and we won't get into specifics, but product lines that we've started to see start to get towards the levels of profitability that we would expect. We're still not going to comment on specific timing, but we do like the trajectory that we're on and we intend to continue to investing. The operating losses near-term have everything to do with the decision we made to really accelerate our investment and now we have the job in front of us that we're confident in of scaling up the revenue. Yes. John, it's Andy. I'll take your question. Yes, your assumption is absolutely reasonable. One of the most important things during a period of time like this as a disability carrier is properly investing in the disability claims staff. So, some of what you saw in our admin ratio in the fourth quarter was us adding to staff. That's claims managers, that's nursers, that's folk specialists, to make sure that our claims personnel have the adequate time and space to properly help our customers and help them return to work. So, it is reasonable to assume as incidence goes up, which typically happens during the recession, we have not yet seen that on the LTD side, but we are expecting to see it, that we would continue to invest and maintain the right level of claims teams, and that would be a higher level of investment. No, nothing to add, Charlie."

First of all, we expect to remain focused on Latin America, emerging Asia and Africa, and primarily on those markets where we already have established operations and partners. And in some cases, I think that would include expansion into adjacent markets. For the most part, we've been looking at, if you will, expanding into the markets that we're already in. And so, we might be adding a capability or a little bit of scale. I think, in those situations, the valuations have been relatively attractive. But going back to Charlie's opening remarks, we're going to be a disciplined buyer and make sure that we're earning an attractive return over our cost of capital before we deploy any funds, over a reasonable amount of time.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Darin Arita. Please go ahead.\nDarin Arita: Good morning and thank you for joining our call.

With that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Charlie.\nCharlie Lowrey: Thank you, Darin. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. To begin, I hope that you, your families and colleagues remain safe and healthy. As the global health pandemic continues, we remain intently focused as a company on caring for our employees and the communities in which we live and work, as well as serving the evolving needs of our customers and other stakeholders in the current environment. We are also incredibly proud and grateful for the continued dedication and commitment that our employees have shown in fulfilling our company purpose of making lives better by solving the financial challenges of our changing world. I\u2019d like to highlight a few of the ways in which we\u2019re serving the unique and evolving needs of our customers, who now more than ever are relying on Prudential to address their financial challenges. Since the beginning of the pandemic, PGIM has focused on providing clients with timely portfolio updates and asset allocation ideas. Our operational resilience, diversified global business model and strong performance has allowed us to support our clients. One example of the success is the growth of our U.S. mutual funds, where we are one of the top ranked companies based on net flows this year. In our U.S. businesses, we continue to pivot within annuities to our FlexGuard buffered annuity product, which offers downside protection and upside opportunity, at a time when customers face new challenges in protecting and growing their retirement assets. Following its accelerated launch to market in the second quarter, FlexGuard continues to gain momentum, accounting for 38% of our annuity sales this quarter. And in Japan, our Life Planner model with its highly personalized and customized approach to engaging customers continues to be resilient as demonstrated by our strong sales this quarter. During the third quarter, we continue to successfully execute on our strategic priorities for 2020, despite the challenging macroeconomic backdrop, including taking additional steps to expand our cost savings program. We also continue to benefit from the strength of our rock solid balance sheet, which places us on sound financial footing to navigate changes in the current environment. Turning now to 2020 priorities on Slide 3. On last quarter\u2019s call, we mentioned that we were exploring the potential to generate additional cost savings on top of our 2022 plan. Through the third quarter of this year, we realized approximately $135 million of our $500 million cost savings program. Based on our progress of accelerating the savings realized and creating new ways of working, we now expect to generate an incremental $250 million in efficiencies by the end of 2023, bringing our total cost savings program to $750 million. With respect to rotating the international earnings mix, during the quarter we announced an agreement to sell Prudential of Taiwan to Taishin Financial Holding, and expect the transaction to close in 2021 subject to all regulatory approvals. And we also closed on our transaction to divest Prudential of Korea and received proceeds of $1.6 billion. And finally, we continue to take additional steps across the company to reduce our exposure to changes in markets and rates by shifting sales momentum to less interest rate sensitive solutions, while aggressively repricing certain existing products. As an example in annuities, we are focusing on our efforts on delivering protected outcome solutions, like our FlexGuard product, and we\u2019re discontinuing all sales of our traditional variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits. We will also explore strategic opportunities for blocks of business, including reinsurance and other transactions. Turning to Slide 4. As we continue to execute against our strategic priorities, we remain grounded by our rock solid balance sheet, including highly liquid assets of $6.1 billion at the end of the third quarter. Prudential Financial and its subsidiaries continue to hold capital that exceeds the AA financial strength level. The financial strength gives us the confidence and the flexibility to manage our business for long-term growth, while navigating the current and future market environment. We also continue to closely monitor conditions in the credit markets, while they have been developing better than previously expected, we don\u2019t intend to restate buybacks this year. We believe this is prudent as the duration and severity of the pandemic and its effect on the economy remain highly uncertain. We\u2019ll provide more details on our 2021 capital deployment plans once they have been finalized and approved by the Board. Turning to Slide 5. I\u2019ll now take a moment to highlight our financial results for the third quarter. Pre-tax adjusted operating income was $1.6 billion in the quarter and after-tax adjusted earnings per share was $3.21, which benefited in part from strong variable investment income across our businesses. Our U.S. businesses reported adjusted operating income of $873 million due to higher net investment spread offset by lower net fee income in our individual annuities business, and less favorable underwriting driven by COVID-19 related net mortality experience. PGIM reported record adjusted operating income of $370 million, driven by record assets under management of $1.4 trillion and higher other related revenues. The 11% growth in assets under management reflects strong flows, robust investment performance and market appreciation. Our international businesses reported adjusted operating income of $775 million, as business growth, lower expenses and more favorable underwriting results were partially offset by lower earnings from joint venture investments and lower net investment spread. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Rob for more specific details on our business performance during the third quarter. Thank you all for your time this morning.\nRob Axel: Thank you, Charlie. I\u2019ll provide an update on how we are executing on our strategy within our U.S. PGIM and international businesses, the outlook for these businesses and a brief update on our investment portfolio. Turning to Slide 6. Our U.S. businesses produce a diversified source of earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income. We made progress in the quarter executing on three key priorities. First, we continue to implement pricing and product actions to simplify and de-risk our business mix, while protecting profitability. For example, we were further pivoting to less interest rate sensitive solutions in individual annuities by discontinuing sales of traditional variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits, including both our Highest Daily Income and Prudential Defined Income products. In our Individual Life business, we are repricing products to mitigate the impact of low rates. In addition to suspending sales of our single life guaranteed universal life product in July. As a result of these actions, we expect individual annuities and individual life sales to continue to move lower in the near-term. In addition, we continue to adjust crediting rates in our retirement business. Second, as the needs of our customers change, including in response to COVID and its economic impact, we\u2019re evolving the way we work. We continue to adapt to develop new ways of working effectively in remote locations and expect to recognize additional cost savings as we expand the use of technology, optimize our real estate footprint and benefit from a more efficient workforce. As Charlie mentioned, these and another opportunities to further efficiencies and improve our customer experience have resulted in a 50% increase in our originally planned $500 million earnings improvement target. And third, we remain committed to expanding our addressable market. For example, we continue to see strong interest in our Assurance IQ platform from customers in the health care, life and P&C lines of business. And preparation for the Medicare annual enrollment period in the fourth quarter, we accelerate our agent onboarding and training processes. While we were only three weeks into the annual enrollment period, we were pleased with the customer demand that we\u2019re seeing, which is driving considerable sales growth. Now turning to Slide 7, PGIM is a top 10 global investment manager that continues to demonstrate the strength and resilience of its multi-manager business model. PGIM\u2019s strong investment performance and diversified global investment capabilities across public and private asset classes, especially higher returning and income generating strategies across fixed income, alternatives, real estate and equities, position us favorably to continue to capture flows amidst industry-wide dislocation. Our assets under management reached a record level of over $1.4 trillion up 11% from the year ago quarter, driven by strong flows, robust investment performance, as well as market appreciation. PGIM\u2019s long-term investment performance remained strong with more than 90% of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks. This strong investment performance coupled with diversified investment capabilities across asset classes, regions and client segments has led to continued growth. We generated over $7 billion of third-party net flows during the quarter, including $5.3 billion of retail flows and $2 billion of institutional flows driven by a continued appetite for fixed income strategies, partially offset by moderating equity outflows. Our public fixed income platform generated flows of $11.6 billion, as it continues to benefit from our broad suite of strategies and the leading position of our franchise. And the combination of customer demand, fund performance and investments in product development and distribution over the past several years has resulted in PGIM\u2019s investments being ranked the second highest U.S. mutual fund franchise based on year-to-date net flows. PGIM\u2019s asset management fees were up 11% compared to the year ago quarter, driven by the growth in average assets under management. In addition, an increase in other-related revenues was driven by an increase in co-investment and seed investment earnings, record high agency loan production and higher incentive fees. PGIM\u2019s operating margin exceeded 37% for the quarter aided by the strong other-related revenues. As we continue to focus on generating efficiencies to fund growth investments and on delivering margin increases from operating leverage. While PGIM\u2019s operating margin will vary with market conditions, we expect margins to remain in the 30% range across the cycle. Turning to Slide 8, our international business includes our Japanese life insurance operation, where we have a differentiated multi-channel distribution model, as well as other operations focused on high growth markets. Our sales this quarter demonstrated the strength of our distribution channels and the continuing customer demand for the protection and retirement products we offer. Our distribution channels are also employing more virtual tools for non face-to-face sales and have benefited from the easing of pandemic related restrictions. Life Planner sales increased 57% compared to the year ago quarter, reflecting the resilience of a Life Planner model, easing of COVID restrictions in Japan, and higher sales ahead of U.S. dollar denominated product repricing in August. Life Planner headcount increased 3% compared to a year ago, due to stable recruitment and lower resignations. Similar to Life Planner, sales across Gibraltar\u2019s life consultant, independent agent and bank channels also increased in total by 30%. We believe a degree of sales were pulled forward into the current quarter due to repricing actions. And therefore we expect a lower level of sales in the fourth quarter with sales returning to more normal levels over time beginning in 2021. Current quarter adjusted operating income continued to be impacted by low interest rates. And we anticipate this trend to continue given Gibraltar\u2019s higher exposure to U.S. dollar products. We have taken pricing actions and we\u2019ll continue to identify opportunities to become more efficient. In addition, we had $15 million of COVID response costs primarily to support our life consultants in Gibraltar, which we expect will moderate in future quarters. Now turning to Slide 9, we have a conservative high quality investment portfolio that reflects our robust asset liability management practices, commitment to broad diversification and a disciplined interest rate risk management framework. We also leverage PGIM\u2019s expertise across multiple asset classes, including its deep and longstanding experience in private placements and real estate. There has been a slowdown in the pace of credit migration and impairments since the first quarter of this year, with year-to-date, credit migration and losses below our expectations. For the third quarter, credit losses were just $12 million. We remain confident that we were well capitalized to weather, whatever might emerge in the future. And with that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Ken.\nKen Tanji: Thanks, Rob. I\u2019ll begin on Slide 10, which provides insight into earnings for the fourth quarter, relative to our third quarter results. Pretax adjusted operating income in the third quarter was $1.63 million and resulted in earnings per share of $3.21 cents on an after-tax basis. We then adjust for the following items: first, variable investment income outperformed expectations in the third quarter, which is worth $215 million. Second, we adjust underwriting experience by a net $35 million. This includes seasonally lower reserve gains and retirement, and an estimate of $60 million for COVID-19 claims experience in the fourth quarter. Third, we expect expenses and other items to be $70 million higher in the fourth quarter, primarily due to seasonal expenses and implementation costs. Fourth, we expect the net operating costs due to COVID-19 to be $5 million lower in the fourth quarter. Fifth, we anticipate net investment income will be reduced by $15 million reflecting the difference between new money rates and disposition yields of our investment portfolio. And last, we expect the fourth quarter effective tax rate to normalize for third quarter items. These items combined to get us to a baseline of $2.48 per share for the fourth quarter. All note that, if you exclude items specific to the fourth quarter, earnings per share would be $2.93. The key takeaway is that our underlying earnings power increased slightly from last quarter, including the benefit from higher equity markets as of quarter-end. While we have provided these items to consider, please note that, there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the fourth quarter. In addition, as we look forward, we have increased the expected benefits from our cost savings program by $250 million by the end of 2023. We expect these benefits will be largely self-funded with incremental net savings emerging in 2022 and 2023. We will provide additional details about this program on our earnings call in February. On Slide 11, we provided an update on the potential impact of the pandemic. The estimated sensitivity of operating income for a 100,000 of incremental U.S. deaths due to the pandemic remains unchanged at $70 million. Based on our updated outlook, our fourth quarter baseline includes a net mortality impact of $60 million due to COVID-19. The actual impact will depend on a variety of factors, such as infection and fatality rates, geographic considerations, and progress in testing and medical treatments. Also, we continue to expect incremental operating costs through the COVID-19 to be $5 million in the fourth quarter. This includes additional operating costs of $25 million, partially offset by $20 million of lower travel and entertainment expenses. Turning to Slide 12, we continue to maintain a robust capital position and adequate sources of funding. Our capital position exceeds our AA financial strength targets. And we have liquid assets at the parent company that are greater than three times annual fixed charges. And we have substantial sources of funding. Our cash and liquid assets at the parent company were $6.1 billion at the end of the quarter, which includes the proceeds from the sale of Prudential of Korea, and other sources of funds include free cash flow from our businesses and other continuing capital facilities. Turning to Slide 13 and in summary, during the third quarter, we continue to successfully execute on our strategic priorities for 2020. We have taken additional steps to expand our cost savings program, and we continue to benefit from the strength of our rock solid balance sheet, which includes \u2013 which gives us the confidence and flexibility to navigate the changes in this economic environment. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Erik Bass of Autonomous Research. And your line is open.\nErik Bass: Thank you. Can you provide some more details on where you expect the additional expense savings to come from? And how much of the cuts are efficiency initiatives and how much are sort of reflecting reappraisal of business volumes in the revenue environment?\nKen Tanji: Eric, this is Ken. I\u2019ll start. And just by way of background, earlier this year, we put in place a transformation office and it\u2019s led by one of our senior business leaders, Phil Waldeck, and it\u2019s given us the capabilities to identify, prioritize and implement with a continuous improvement mindset. It involves all of our U.S. businesses and all of our functions. And so we\u2019re finding efficiencies through combining client service centers, process engineering, automation, through procurement strategies, and so it\u2019s a culmination of transformation across the company. So that\u2019s generally, what\u2019s driving that.\nAndy Sullivan: And Eric, it\u2019s Andy. I would just add, it\u2019s really not related to business volumes or revenues. It is core efficiency improvement, where we\u2019re applying process and technology and able to hit a number of costs reduction levers. So it\u2019s becoming more efficient at the business that we have.\nErik Bass: Got it. Thank you. And then you\u2019ve talked about sort of all options being on the table for your in-force individual life and annuities blocks. And we\u2019ve started to see an increase in transaction activity across the industry. So hoping you can talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing in terms of buyer interest for liabilities like yours, and maybe the current bid-ask spread in the market?\nCharlie Lowrey: Sure. This is Charlie. Let me take it kind of at a high level and then turn it over to Andy. But you know, Eric, over the past couple of years, we\u2019ve been really active in beginning to change our business mix. So as you know, we\u2019ve sold our operations in Poland, Italy, and Korea, and now have agreement in Taiwan and we continue to focus on rotating our earnings mix to higher growth markets internationally. Now looking at the U.S., in terms of changing the focus within the business, we\u2019re on a path to de-risking and it have made major pivots to less interest rate sensitive and more capital light solutions in our individual annuities and in our life business. And specifically, you\u2019ve seen us pivot away from a VAs with lifetime income guarantees to less market sensitive products. And at the same time, you\u2019ve seen us in our life business pivot to simpler non-guaranteed products. But what we\u2019ve also said is that we want to accelerate the transformation. And I\u2019ve said that we\u2019ll explore reinsurance and potentially the sale of certain blocks. But I\u2019d add the caveat that these types of transactions are complex and they take time and as we explore our options, we want to make sure that we\u2019re making good economic decisions that are in the best interest of shareholders. So we\u2019re going to take all these things into account as we go forward. Andy, I don\u2019t know if you want to add on to that?\nAndy Sullivan: Yes, maybe I would just add Eric, you also \u2013 I think asked about what\u2019s the marketplace for these types of transactions and we will not quote on any specific deals that are going on. I think there are two important takeaways that we should discuss. One is, I think we\u2019ve generally believe that a number of these blocks of business and our block of business, its value is not fully appreciated in the marketplace. And I think if you look at the recent transactions that certainly has been, I think proven out. The other thing is that there is capital moving towards, these types of deals, and that there\u2019s capacity. So we\u2019ve \u2013 as Charlie said, we\u2019ve begun to work on these alternatives and when we have something more to report we\u2019ll certainly do so.\nErik Bass: Great. Thanks for the comments.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners. Your line is open.\nHumphrey Lee: Good morning and thank you for taking our questions. I\u2019m just trying to bridge the comments, all just kind of sentiment towards that decision to not reinstate your share repurchase this year, given the credit concern, and your \u2013 at the same time, yours confidence about your balance sheet, I guess, what kind of \u2013 what do you need to see in order to make you feel comfortable to resume buyback?\nCharlie Lowrey: So Humphrey, it\u2019s Charlie. Let me take a stab at that one. In line with the risk framework that we have in place, we paused share repurchases in the second quarter. But it\u2019s really about this, until we have better visibility into the depth and the duration of the pandemic, a possible recession and the credit cycle, which still may be before us we\u2019re going to maintain our financial flexibility and the resiliency. And when we get clarity into those issues that I just mentioned, we\u2019ll share the timing with you of our plan to resume share buybacks, and by how much. But until then, we\u2019re going to focus on maintaining our financial strength with many of the unknowns still in front of us.\nHumphrey Lee: I guess just for a quick clarification. So you suggest \u2013 you do not intend to reinstate buyback this year. But does it preclude you from using some of your capital strength for acquisitions?\nCharlie Lowrey: Not necessarily, but again, we\u2019re going to take \u2013 we\u2019re going to take a very measured approach to that, because we want to maintain our financial flexibility. So we\u2019re not going to comment about any business or specific transaction. But if I can take this step back for a moment again, and just make a more general comment on how we think about capital allocation in particular optimization, as we look across our businesses, both domestically and internationally we want to ensure that we\u2019re optimizing capital employment. And you\u2019ve seen us do that with, some of the sales we\u2019ve done internationally, but we\u2019re going to continue to look for ways optimize capital and capital deployment to maximize outcomes for shareholders. But at the same time, we\u2019re going to take a hard look at the environment in which we\u2019re operating and make sure that again, we maintain our financial strength and our financial flexibility and our resiliency as we go forward.\nHumphrey Lee: That makes sense. And then my next question is related to Assurance IQ. So I think, in the prepare remarks, you talked about, you\u2019re excited with the activities so far in the quarter, granted, it\u2019s still very early in terms of the customer demand. I think last year that the challenge was, you see \u2013 you saw a similar \u2013 you saw strong demand, but then you were not able to [cutoff] [ph] the processing of those kind of incoming demand. So maybe can you talk about like how \u2013 like, in terms of demand relative to your kind of capacity where you stand so far for the enrollment period?\nAndy Sullivan: Yes, Humphrey, it\u2019s Andy. So I\u2019ll take your question. And as we discussed sort of from a lessons learned perspective from last year, we\u2019ve done a lot this year to make sure with that we were better prepared for the annual enrollment period. We direct contracted with the health carriers, which gives us a lot more flexibility and agility. We invested much more heavily in agent recruiting, licensing and training. And we began to bring on agents this year in the month of July, which was much earlier than last year. So we\u2019re repeating what Rob said, we\u2019re only about three weeks into the season. But we certainly see evidence that our investments are paying off and that we\u2019re having stronger performance than we had in 2019. Having said that about 50% of industry-wide Medicare advantage transactions occur in the last two weeks of the annual enrollment period and that\u2019s the first two weeks of December. So while we like what we see from a growth perspective in these early days, it certainly, too early to draw definitive conclusions.\nHumphrey Lee: Do you feel like given the activities that you\u2019re seeing and then some of the preparedness you\u2019re already in place, do you think Assurance IQ could turn positive for the fourth quarter?\nAndy Sullivan: Yes. I think in our materials we had given a walk to about $25 million for the fourth quarter.\nHumphrey Lee: Got it. Thank you.\nAndy Sullivan: Actually I had that number wrong. It was $15 million, Humphrey. Sorry, I was off, looked at the wrong line.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher with Evercore. Your line is open.\nTom Gallagher: Charlie just wanted to circle back on capital deployment as my first question, if we think about 2021 at this point, do you have a preference of buybacks or M&A and I ask in particular, because if you do free up capital from risk transfer deal there also happens to be, we\u2019ll say more activity, more things on the market now than there were recently. So curious, what your view is, if you\u2019re more likely to want to do M&A or buybacks at this point?\nCharlie Lowrey: Yes, Tom. Thanks for the question. I guess a couple of things. One, again, I would caution the people in thinking we\u2019re going to free up capital immediately. These transactions take a long time, and therefore we have to think through that. Secondly, I think it depends on the deal. What we have said before, is given where our stock price is, there\u2019s a fairly high hurdle, right? On the other hand to your point, there could be some very interesting things on the market. So we\u2019re going to have to balance if you will short-term accretion from stock buybacks, and long-term growth. And we\u2019ll have to weigh those two against the opportunity set that\u2019s out there. And the stock repurchase price at the time.\nTom Gallagher: That\u2019s helpful. And what would define contribution be on the wish list of M&A interest from your perspective? Because I know you\u2019ve done more international and then you did it Assurance IQ in recent times.\nAndy Sullivan: So Tom, it\u2019s Andy. I\u2019ll take your question. We\u2019ve been very focused on strengthening out our value proposition in our full service retirement business. We\u2019ve talked a lot about over the last couple of years, the work that we\u2019ve done in financial wellness we\u2019ve pretty heavily invested in digital and mobile, and that has resulted in very good organic growth on that platform. If you look at our net flows over time, it\u2019s been very positive. We\u2019re completing our third year of record sales. We had our largest corporate client ever in the quarter. So we\u2019ve seen great success, even though, we certainly pay attention to the consolidation of this space. We\u2019ve seen great success organically growing the business, and that maintains our focus.\nTom Gallagher: Okay. Thanks. And then just as a quick follow-up, the elevated level of non-blockable expenses at Gibraltar. Is that like, and I guess for the guide for 4Q, is that likely to continue into 2021? Or is there something that\u2019s more, I would say temporary regarding the lower earnings and higher expenses at Gibraltar?\nScott Sleyster: Tom, this is Scott. The Gibraltar run rate base has been impacted by really two factors. And one here, this first one is more permanent. We adjusted our compensation structure for life consultants to better balance policy holding \u2013 policyholder servicing things like customer visits, persistency, and so forth. With new business production and then this led to a lower level of deferrable commissions. Overall, the commissions have not actually changed, but our immediate run rate was impacted by roughly $10 million a quarter. And we view this as permanent. Now we recapture that over the life of the products, but that takes a quite a while to pick up. By the way, we do not expect this to have any impact on Gibraltar\u2019s cash flow. Second Gibraltar does have a large block of U.S. dollar business, which is experiencing spread erosion due to declines in U.S. dollar interest rates. So it\u2019s really those two factors combined with the biggest thing the first.\nTom Gallagher: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Suneet Kamath with Citi. Your line is open.\nSuneet Kamath: Thanks. I wanted to circle back to Assurance IQ, if we assume your placeholder of $15 million for the fourth quarters, right. I think it would still put you at a loss for the year versus your original guidance EPS accretion in 2020. So just curious, what\u2019s driving that, and then, should we \u2013 do you think we can get back on track to your \u2013 I think you had got it to $0.30 to $0.35 in 2021. Should we assume that you can kind of get back on track there? Or do you think it\u2019s sort of a more of a challenge to get this back to profitability for the full year or a full-year thing.\nAndy Sullivan: So Suneet, it\u2019s Andy. I\u2019ll take your question. And let me maybe raise it up a level, so we\u2019re very pleased that we bought this business model and set of capabilities a model that\u2019s not sensitive to interest rates or equity markets. Obviously, with what happened in the March timeframe, we\u2019re even more pleased to have this as part of the fold. We immediately got very focused on building out and expanding the business model. So that we could care for more needs in the mass market and middle market consumer set. So as we\u2019ve really worked on the business internally, success for us is not about near-term AOI. Success for us is very much about continuing to expand the reach and breadth of the platform and is very much measured in how we grow our revenues, is very much measured in the products that we have on the platform. So we began with life, you saw us immediately lean into Medicare advantage. And then more recently, we\u2019ve leaned into property and casualty. And again, I always remind this is from a distribution perspective, not from a manufacturing perspective. And these bring fee-based earnings that are very capitally efficient. So our focus is really expanding this out as rapidly as we can.\nSuneet Kamath: Okay. And then I guess a bigger picture question on your financial wellness initiative, when you guys talked about this at your latest Investor Day, we spent a lot of time talking about marketing at the work site, reaching the employees of your corporate customers. So if we assume that we\u2019re going to be in this work at home environment for longer, how are you modulating that initiative to make sure that you\u2019re still capturing the growth opportunity that you guys talked about when you can\u2019t do these group meetings that you guys discussed at the Investor Day? Thanks.\nAndy Sullivan: Yes. Suneet, its Andy. And I guess, right up front, I\u2019ll draw a very sharp distinction in our financial wellness work from what I would call worksite marketing, which I know a number of voluntary products are more worksite marketing with feet on the street in the employer. Ours was very much about building a set of capabilities that could really reach people when, where and how they want it. So there was a real digital focus to what we built. We\u2019ve had accelerating success, if you remember, there were sort of a couple of stages to what we were trying to accomplish. At this point we\u2019ve had a large portion of our employers adopt our capabilities, we\u2019ve 20 million individuals that have access to the platform that\u2019s ahead of our goals for 2020. We\u2019ve \u2013 in my words, permissioned 12 million individuals that they can access \u2013 we get access to market, our retail solutions that is also ahead of our goals. And at this point we\u2019ve put 15,000 retail customers into Prudential through the platform. As COVID came in the base capabilities were such that we were able to pretty quickly even expand upon as an example, our Prudential Pathways program and make it purely digital with webinars capabilities. And at this point, that\u2019s now reaching about 8.5 million folks. So we don\u2019t see the current environment actually hindering us at all. And it\u2019s really about how we built the whole platform.\nSuneet Kamath: Okay. Thanks, Andy.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW. Your line is open.\nRyan Krueger: Good morning. I had a couple annuity questions. One, in recent year you\u2019ve been sending dividends up to the holding company from the annuity and subsidiary, seems like in kind of the roughly $1 billion range give or take. I guess, so first question is to what extent was that negatively impacted by new business associated with writings [indiscernible] I guess, should we see some improvements there? And do you view the roughly $1 billion per year as sustainable in the current interest rate environment?\nKen Tanji: Ryan, this is Ken. Our annuity business, as we\u2019ve mentioned in the past has been very well hedged and very well capitalized and as you mentioned, providing a regular source of dividends to the holding company. Now that has moderated over time as our sales have been below our outflows, the business has been getting smaller. And although we\u2019re quite happy with the launch of our FlexGuard product, it won\u2019t be in the near-term sufficient to outpace the outflows that we have on our in-force blocks. So, over time that will decrease our level of earnings and cash flow and you could see that as a moderating trend.\nRyan Krueger: Got it. And I guess, from a legal entity standpoint, I know you\u2019re probably \u2013 sounds like you\u2019re more likely to pursue reinsurance. But just in general, is there any tied legally between the Prudential annuity subsidiary in PICA or other life insurance subsidiaries, or is it really separate?\nKen Tanji: Our annuity business, is actually involves a couple major legal entities. One would be our Pruco Life of Arizona company, which is a subsidiary of PICA that had been \u2013 historically been the legal entity that we use to underwrite annuity business. But you may recall, many years ago we acquired an annuity company from American Skandia, that\u2019s what we call Prudential Assurance Life Assurance Company or PALAC. And that also has a variable annuity business in it. And so it\u2019s in a couple of different legal entities that are involved.\nRyan Krueger: Okay. Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of John Barnidge with Piper Sandler. And your line is open.\nJohn Barnidge: Thank you. You didn\u2019t really address this in the commentary on cost cutting. But when adding $250 million and pushing out the 2023, is this real estate savings that is far out enough that it could address leasing.\nAndy Sullivan: So John, its Andy. This is really just an expansion of our program, as Ken said earlier, every business and every function. So it is \u2013 real estate is part of it, but there are a number of different buckets. It really is across real estate, it\u2019s across better vendor management and procurement, more efficiency from a travel perspective. So it really goes across a number of areas. We learned a lot in the first 12 to 18 months of this program. We saw a lot of what was possible and feasible, and we basically expanded to every corner of the organization. So it\u2019s not one particular category, it\u2019s just from the success of the overarching program and accelerating it.\nJohn Barnidge: Okay. Thank you very much. And my follow-up would be the products within annuities and life that you\u2019ve suspended this year. Can you talk about the amount of assets associated with that that were suspended respectfully? Thank you for the answers.\nAndy Sullivan: So from an annuities perspective, I\u2019m not going to get this exactly right, but I think it\u2019s in the $110 billion and $120 billion range. And I don\u2019t have the guaranteed universal life in front of me.\nJohn Barnidge: Thanks for the answers.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. And your line is open.\nJimmy Bhullar: Hi. Thanks. So first, I just had a question on your disability loss ratio. It\u2019s actually margins in the business have been pretty good. Are you starting to see or expecting to see any impact from sort of higher unemployment and just a weaker economy on your benefits ratio in the disability business?\nAndy Sullivan: Hi. It\u2019s Andy, I\u2019ll take your question. So, we\u2019ve actually been very pleased. We have not seen an uptick in incidents in either our short-term disability business or our long-term disability business. That being said though, obviously we\u2019ve operated this business for many, many decades, and we know that in recessionary environments, there\u2019s generally somewhere in the neighborhood of a year lag from when that incident shows up. So we have invested to make sure that our claims teams have low, what we call desk loads, so that if and when that incident starts to tick up, we\u2019re well prepared for it. But we have not seen evidence of that yet.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then on \u2013 just on Japan sales, obviously you benefited this quarter from sort of front ending prior to the price increase. So I\u2019m assuming you expect sales to decline a decent amount next quarter. And then also, if you could just talk about how the conditions are in that market in terms of agents\u2019 ability to meet with prospects, and like given social distancing and everything else that\u2019s going on.\nScott Sleyster: Sure. Thanks Jimmy. This is Scott. Well, as Rob noted in his remarks with the significant decline in U.S. interest rates, we implemented pricing changes in August across all of our U.S. dollar products in Japan. As you know, it\u2019s common for salespeople to use such a pricing change to stimulate client contact. And that tends to accelerate sales from maybe the quarter ahead prior to such a change. Sales in 3Q also did benefit from the relaxation of social distancing requirements in Japan that were implemented in the beginning of June. And I think you also ask on that question. We expect that such enhanced demand will taper off in the following quarter, but then we are expecting things really to normalize as we head into 2021. Overall, our distribution in Japan is largely operating in kind of a back to normal mode. And I think that really reflects the strength of our differentiated business model.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJosh Shanker: Yes. Thank you. If we go back in time maybe three years ago, I think that you would have said that, individual variable annuities is the core competency of the company that a lot of your competitors don\u2019t understand and are backing away from the market. Many of them pivoted to buffer annuities and whatnot. With you discontinuing sales of variable annuities with living benefits. Can you talk about what\u2019s the return characteristics of that product have been over the past three years where they stand today and what it means for the back book?\nAndy Sullivan: Josh, its Andy, I\u2019ll take that. So, our HDI and PDI block of business is a very high returning block of business as Ken talked about earlier. It\u2019s a well capitalized block and well hedged block and creates good cash flows. It\u2019s more of a go-forward perspective, if you think about the decision making around our product pivot, we\u2019re working towards more of what I would frame as an all weather portfolio, where we\u2019re taking less fully on ourselves, the interest rate and equity market risk. The HDI is our most sensitive product in that regard. So, we think from a go-forward perspective, as you noted, we are very, very good in the annuity space, we believe there still is a deep sea that need to help people with accumulation, and to help them with decumulation from a longevity insurance perspective. And we think our go-forward product portfolio does that well, but does it in a way that\u2019s more shareholder friendly.\nJosh Shanker: Do the financial advisors who work with you need a product like that in their silo from you, for you to remain competitive with them?\nAndy Sullivan: No. If you\u2019re asking about, do they need the sort of the HDI/PDI types of product? No, we\u2019ve actually \u2013 we benefit from our brand and our strength of our distribution. And I think that\u2019s really why you see such a strong start to our FlexGuard buffered annuity. It was 38% of our sales here in the third quarter, and we recently went through $1 billion in sales, and we haven\u2019t even finished fully rolling it out to all states and all advisers. So, we think our product portfolio will meet the needs of the advisors and we\u2019ll see good growth in it.\nJosh Shanker: Thank you for the answers.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question is going back to the capital conversation. You guys mentioned you have over $6 billion of capital at the holding company. That\u2019s around 3x your fixed charges. So can you remind us what you typically like under normal times to keep as a holding company? And then as we think about 2021, and you mentioned, reevaluating capital return, once we kind of get out of COVID, will you go back to what you view as kind of that normal level of fixed charges at the holding company? Or do you think that you\u2019re going after this, we\u2019ll look to hold onto an extra buffer as well.\nKen Tanji: Elyse, it\u2019s Ken. Our target for highly liquid assets in typical times is $3 billion to $5 billion. And we think that\u2019s a good level to carry to have the flexibility that a company like ours needs. So we are above that. We think these are different than typical times. And as Charlie mentioned, that\u2019s a prudent thing to do, and we\u2019ll continue to evaluate a number of factors, including the credit markets as we go forward. But again, our target is typically $3 billion to $5 billion that gives us ample flexibility in ordinary times, and we think now\u2019s a good time to be above that.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. And then, I was hoping to get more color on the PRT environment. We obviously with rates lower, deal activity slow in the third quarter. Typically volume does pick up in the fourth quarter as we close years out. Could you just give us some color on the pipeline there and thoughts about transactions that we could potentially see in the fourth quarter?\nAndy Sullivan: Yes. Elyse, it\u2019s Andy, I\u2019ll take your question. So you\u2019re absolutely right. If we look at sort of 2020, the marketplace \u2013 size of the marketplace versus 2019, 2020 is definitely going to be down. We think it\u2019s going to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 20%-ish or so. Third quarter was relatively quiet. We are seeing a building pipeline in 4Q, but I would point out that, with a lower overall market size, we also have talked about in the past that we\u2019re now probably up to five plus competitors that can do deals of $1 billion plus. So we think it\u2019s going to be a very competitive environment in the fourth quarter. We\u2019re going to be very disciplined about how we approach the marketplace and we\u2019re going to pick our spots.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn it back over to Mr. Charles Lowrey for any closing comments.\nCharlie Lowrey: Thank you very much. So in closing today, I hope today that we\u2019ve demonstrated our commitment towards and the ongoing momentum we have to transforming our business and financial performance in ways that deliver meaningful outcomes to our customers, as well as to our investors and other stakeholders. We continue to move with urgency and conviction to execute on and be true to our purpose of solving the financial challenges for more people. So, thanks again for joining us today. We appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive TeleConference Service. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Charlie Lowrey",
            "content": "Thank you, Darin. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. To begin, I hope that you, your families and colleagues remain safe and healthy. As the global health pandemic continues, we remain intently focused as a company on caring for our employees and the communities in which we live and work, as well as serving the evolving needs of our customers and other stakeholders in the current environment. We are also incredibly proud and grateful for the continued dedication and commitment that our employees have shown in fulfilling our company purpose of making lives better by solving the financial challenges of our changing world. I'd like to highlight a few of the ways in which we're serving the unique and evolving needs of our customers, who now more than ever are relying on Prudential to address their financial challenges. Since the beginning of the pandemic, PGIM has focused on providing clients with timely portfolio updates and asset allocation ideas. Our operational resilience, diversified global business model and strong performance has allowed us to support our clients. One example of the success is the growth of our U.S. mutual funds, where we are one of the top ranked companies based on net flows this year. In our U.S. businesses, we continue to pivot within annuities to our FlexGuard buffered annuity product, which offers downside protection and upside opportunity, at a time when customers face new challenges in protecting and growing their retirement assets. Following its accelerated launch to market in the second quarter, FlexGuard continues to gain momentum, accounting for 38% of our annuity sales this quarter. And in Japan, our Life Planner model with its highly personalized and customized approach to engaging customers continues to be resilient as demonstrated by our strong sales this quarter. During the third quarter, we continue to successfully execute on our strategic priorities for 2020, despite the challenging macroeconomic backdrop, including taking additional steps to expand our cost savings program. We also continue to benefit from the strength of our rock solid balance sheet, which places us on sound financial footing to navigate changes in the current environment. Turning now to 2020 priorities on Slide 3. On last quarter's call, we mentioned that we were exploring the potential to generate additional cost savings on top of our 2022 plan. Through the third quarter of this year, we realized approximately $135 million of our $500 million cost savings program. Based on our progress of accelerating the savings realized and creating new ways of working, we now expect to generate an incremental $250 million in efficiencies by the end of 2023, bringing our total cost savings program to $750 million. With respect to rotating the international earnings mix, during the quarter we announced an agreement to sell Prudential of Taiwan to Taishin Financial Holding, and expect the transaction to close in 2021 subject to all regulatory approvals. And we also closed on our transaction to divest Prudential of Korea and received proceeds of $1.6 billion. And finally, we continue to take additional steps across the company to reduce our exposure to changes in markets and rates by shifting sales momentum to less interest rate sensitive solutions, while aggressively repricing certain existing products. As an example in annuities, we are focusing on our efforts on delivering protected outcome solutions, like our FlexGuard product, and we're discontinuing all sales of our traditional variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits. We will also explore strategic opportunities for blocks of business, including reinsurance and other transactions. Turning to Slide 4. As we continue to execute against our strategic priorities, we remain grounded by our rock solid balance sheet, including highly liquid assets of $6.1 billion at the end of the third quarter. Prudential Financial and its subsidiaries continue to hold capital that exceeds the AA financial strength level. The financial strength gives us the confidence and the flexibility to manage our business for long-term growth, while navigating the current and future market environment. We also continue to closely monitor conditions in the credit markets, while they have been developing better than previously expected, we don't intend to restate buybacks this year. We believe this is prudent as the duration and severity of the pandemic and its effect on the economy remain highly uncertain. We'll provide more details on our 2021 capital deployment plans once they have been finalized and approved by the Board. Turning to Slide 5. I'll now take a moment to highlight our financial results for the third quarter. Pre-tax adjusted operating income was $1.6 billion in the quarter and after-tax adjusted earnings per share was $3.21, which benefited in part from strong variable investment income across our businesses. Our U.S. businesses reported adjusted operating income of $873 million due to higher net investment spread offset by lower net fee income in our individual annuities business, and less favorable underwriting driven by COVID-19 related net mortality experience. PGIM reported record adjusted operating income of $370 million, driven by record assets under management of $1.4 trillion and higher other related revenues. The 11% growth in assets under management reflects strong flows, robust investment performance and market appreciation. Our international businesses reported adjusted operating income of $775 million, as business growth, lower expenses and more favorable underwriting results were partially offset by lower earnings from joint venture investments and lower net investment spread. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob for more specific details on our business performance during the third quarter. Thank you all for your time this morning. Sure. This is Charlie. Let me take it kind of at a high level and then turn it over to Andy. But you know, Eric, over the past couple of years, we've been really active in beginning to change our business mix. So as you know, we've sold our operations in Poland, Italy, and Korea, and now have agreement in Taiwan and we continue to focus on rotating our earnings mix to higher growth markets internationally. Now looking at the U.S., in terms of changing the focus within the business, we're on a path to de-risking and it have made major pivots to less interest rate sensitive and more capital light solutions in our individual annuities and in our life business. And specifically, you've seen us pivot away from a VAs with lifetime income guarantees to less market sensitive products. And at the same time, you've seen us in our life business pivot to simpler non-guaranteed products. But what we've also said is that we want to accelerate the transformation. And I've said that we'll explore reinsurance and potentially the sale of certain blocks. But I'd add the caveat that these types of transactions are complex and they take time and as we explore our options, we want to make sure that we're making good economic decisions that are in the best interest of shareholders. So we're going to take all these things into account as we go forward. Andy, I don't know if you want to add on to that? So Humphrey, it's Charlie. Let me take a stab at that one. In line with the risk framework that we have in place, we paused share repurchases in the second quarter. But it's really about this, until we have better visibility into the depth and the duration of the pandemic, a possible recession and the credit cycle, which still may be before us we're going to maintain our financial flexibility and the resiliency. And when we get clarity into those issues that I just mentioned, we'll share the timing with you of our plan to resume share buybacks, and by how much. But until then, we're going to focus on maintaining our financial strength with many of the unknowns still in front of us. Not necessarily, but again, we're going to take \u2013 we're going to take a very measured approach to that, because we want to maintain our financial flexibility. So we're not going to comment about any business or specific transaction. But if I can take this step back for a moment again, and just make a more general comment on how we think about capital allocation in particular optimization, as we look across our businesses, both domestically and internationally we want to ensure that we're optimizing capital employment. And you've seen us do that with, some of the sales we've done internationally, but we're going to continue to look for ways optimize capital and capital deployment to maximize outcomes for shareholders. But at the same time, we're going to take a hard look at the environment in which we're operating and make sure that again, we maintain our financial strength and our financial flexibility and our resiliency as we go forward. Yes, Tom. Thanks for the question. I guess a couple of things. One, again, I would caution the people in thinking we're going to free up capital immediately. These transactions take a long time, and therefore we have to think through that. Secondly, I think it depends on the deal. What we have said before, is given where our stock price is, there's a fairly high hurdle, right? On the other hand to your point, there could be some very interesting things on the market. So we're going to have to balance if you will short-term accretion from stock buybacks, and long-term growth. And we'll have to weigh those two against the opportunity set that's out there. And the stock repurchase price at the time. Thank you very much. So in closing today, I hope today that we've demonstrated our commitment towards and the ongoing momentum we have to transforming our business and financial performance in ways that deliver meaningful outcomes to our customers, as well as to our investors and other stakeholders. We continue to move with urgency and conviction to execute on and be true to our purpose of solving the financial challenges for more people. So, thanks again for joining us today. We appreciate it."

            "name": "Ken Tanji",
            "content": "Thanks, Rob. I'll begin on Slide 10, which provides insight into earnings for the fourth quarter, relative to our third quarter results. Pretax adjusted operating income in the third quarter was $1.63 million and resulted in earnings per share of $3.21 cents on an after-tax basis. We then adjust for the following items: first, variable investment income outperformed expectations in the third quarter, which is worth $215 million. Second, we adjust underwriting experience by a net $35 million. This includes seasonally lower reserve gains and retirement, and an estimate of $60 million for COVID-19 claims experience in the fourth quarter. Third, we expect expenses and other items to be $70 million higher in the fourth quarter, primarily due to seasonal expenses and implementation costs. Fourth, we expect the net operating costs due to COVID-19 to be $5 million lower in the fourth quarter. Fifth, we anticipate net investment income will be reduced by $15 million reflecting the difference between new money rates and disposition yields of our investment portfolio. And last, we expect the fourth quarter effective tax rate to normalize for third quarter items. These items combined to get us to a baseline of $2.48 per share for the fourth quarter. All note that, if you exclude items specific to the fourth quarter, earnings per share would be $2.93. The key takeaway is that our underlying earnings power increased slightly from last quarter, including the benefit from higher equity markets as of quarter-end. While we have provided these items to consider, please note that, there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the fourth quarter. In addition, as we look forward, we have increased the expected benefits from our cost savings program by $250 million by the end of 2023. We expect these benefits will be largely self-funded with incremental net savings emerging in 2022 and 2023. We will provide additional details about this program on our earnings call in February. On Slide 11, we provided an update on the potential impact of the pandemic. The estimated sensitivity of operating income for a 100,000 of incremental U.S. deaths due to the pandemic remains unchanged at $70 million. Based on our updated outlook, our fourth quarter baseline includes a net mortality impact of $60 million due to COVID-19. The actual impact will depend on a variety of factors, such as infection and fatality rates, geographic considerations, and progress in testing and medical treatments. Also, we continue to expect incremental operating costs through the COVID-19 to be $5 million in the fourth quarter. This includes additional operating costs of $25 million, partially offset by $20 million of lower travel and entertainment expenses. Turning to Slide 12, we continue to maintain a robust capital position and adequate sources of funding. Our capital position exceeds our AA financial strength targets. And we have liquid assets at the parent company that are greater than three times annual fixed charges. And we have substantial sources of funding. Our cash and liquid assets at the parent company were $6.1 billion at the end of the quarter, which includes the proceeds from the sale of Prudential of Korea, and other sources of funds include free cash flow from our businesses and other continuing capital facilities. Turning to Slide 13 and in summary, during the third quarter, we continue to successfully execute on our strategic priorities for 2020. We have taken additional steps to expand our cost savings program, and we continue to benefit from the strength of our rock solid balance sheet, which includes \u2013 which gives us the confidence and flexibility to navigate the changes in this economic environment. Now I'll turn it over to the operator for your questions. Eric, this is Ken. I'll start. And just by way of background, earlier this year, we put in place a transformation office and it's led by one of our senior business leaders, Phil Waldeck, and it's given us the capabilities to identify, prioritize and implement with a continuous improvement mindset. It involves all of our U.S. businesses and all of our functions. And so we're finding efficiencies through combining client service centers, process engineering, automation, through procurement strategies, and so it's a culmination of transformation across the company. So that's generally, what's driving that. Ryan, this is Ken. Our annuity business, as we've mentioned in the past has been very well hedged and very well capitalized and as you mentioned, providing a regular source of dividends to the holding company. Now that has moderated over time as our sales have been below our outflows, the business has been getting smaller. And although we're quite happy with the launch of our FlexGuard product, it won't be in the near-term sufficient to outpace the outflows that we have on our in-force blocks. So, over time that will decrease our level of earnings and cash flow and you could see that as a moderating trend. Our annuity business, is actually involves a couple major legal entities. One would be our Pruco Life of Arizona company, which is a subsidiary of PICA that had been \u2013 historically been the legal entity that we use to underwrite annuity business. But you may recall, many years ago we acquired an annuity company from American Skandia, that's what we call Prudential Assurance Life Assurance Company or PALAC. And that also has a variable annuity business in it. And so it's in a couple of different legal entities that are involved. Elyse, it's Ken. Our target for highly liquid assets in typical times is $3 billion to $5 billion. And we think that's a good level to carry to have the flexibility that a company like ours needs. So we are above that. We think these are different than typical times. And as Charlie mentioned, that's a prudent thing to do, and we'll continue to evaluate a number of factors, including the credit markets as we go forward. But again, our target is typically $3 billion to $5 billion that gives us ample flexibility in ordinary times, and we think now's a good time to be above that."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Rob Axel",
            "content": "Thank you, Charlie. I'll provide an update on how we are executing on our strategy within our U.S. PGIM and international businesses, the outlook for these businesses and a brief update on our investment portfolio. Turning to Slide 6. Our U.S. businesses produce a diversified source of earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income. We made progress in the quarter executing on three key priorities. First, we continue to implement pricing and product actions to simplify and de-risk our business mix, while protecting profitability. For example, we were further pivoting to less interest rate sensitive solutions in individual annuities by discontinuing sales of traditional variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits, including both our Highest Daily Income and Prudential Defined Income products. In our Individual Life business, we are repricing products to mitigate the impact of low rates. In addition to suspending sales of our single life guaranteed universal life product in July. As a result of these actions, we expect individual annuities and individual life sales to continue to move lower in the near-term. In addition, we continue to adjust crediting rates in our retirement business. Second, as the needs of our customers change, including in response to COVID and its economic impact, we're evolving the way we work. We continue to adapt to develop new ways of working effectively in remote locations and expect to recognize additional cost savings as we expand the use of technology, optimize our real estate footprint and benefit from a more efficient workforce. As Charlie mentioned, these and another opportunities to further efficiencies and improve our customer experience have resulted in a 50% increase in our originally planned $500 million earnings improvement target. And third, we remain committed to expanding our addressable market. For example, we continue to see strong interest in our Assurance IQ platform from customers in the health care, life and P&C lines of business. And preparation for the Medicare annual enrollment period in the fourth quarter, we accelerate our agent onboarding and training processes. While we were only three weeks into the annual enrollment period, we were pleased with the customer demand that we're seeing, which is driving considerable sales growth. Now turning to Slide 7, PGIM is a top 10 global investment manager that continues to demonstrate the strength and resilience of its multi-manager business model. PGIM's strong investment performance and diversified global investment capabilities across public and private asset classes, especially higher returning and income generating strategies across fixed income, alternatives, real estate and equities, position us favorably to continue to capture flows amidst industry-wide dislocation. Our assets under management reached a record level of over $1.4 trillion up 11% from the year ago quarter, driven by strong flows, robust investment performance, as well as market appreciation. PGIM's long-term investment performance remained strong with more than 90% of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks. This strong investment performance coupled with diversified investment capabilities across asset classes, regions and client segments has led to continued growth. We generated over $7 billion of third-party net flows during the quarter, including $5.3 billion of retail flows and $2 billion of institutional flows driven by a continued appetite for fixed income strategies, partially offset by moderating equity outflows. Our public fixed income platform generated flows of $11.6 billion, as it continues to benefit from our broad suite of strategies and the leading position of our franchise. And the combination of customer demand, fund performance and investments in product development and distribution over the past several years has resulted in PGIM's investments being ranked the second highest U.S. mutual fund franchise based on year-to-date net flows. PGIM's asset management fees were up 11% compared to the year ago quarter, driven by the growth in average assets under management. In addition, an increase in other-related revenues was driven by an increase in co-investment and seed investment earnings, record high agency loan production and higher incentive fees. PGIM's operating margin exceeded 37% for the quarter aided by the strong other-related revenues. As we continue to focus on generating efficiencies to fund growth investments and on delivering margin increases from operating leverage. While PGIM's operating margin will vary with market conditions, we expect margins to remain in the 30% range across the cycle. Turning to Slide 8, our international business includes our Japanese life insurance operation, where we have a differentiated multi-channel distribution model, as well as other operations focused on high growth markets. Our sales this quarter demonstrated the strength of our distribution channels and the continuing customer demand for the protection and retirement products we offer. Our distribution channels are also employing more virtual tools for non face-to-face sales and have benefited from the easing of pandemic related restrictions. Life Planner sales increased 57% compared to the year ago quarter, reflecting the resilience of a Life Planner model, easing of COVID restrictions in Japan, and higher sales ahead of U.S. dollar denominated product repricing in August. Life Planner headcount increased 3% compared to a year ago, due to stable recruitment and lower resignations. Similar to Life Planner, sales across Gibraltar's life consultant, independent agent and bank channels also increased in total by 30%. We believe a degree of sales were pulled forward into the current quarter due to repricing actions. And therefore we expect a lower level of sales in the fourth quarter with sales returning to more normal levels over time beginning in 2021. Current quarter adjusted operating income continued to be impacted by low interest rates. And we anticipate this trend to continue given Gibraltar's higher exposure to U.S. dollar products. We have taken pricing actions and we'll continue to identify opportunities to become more efficient. In addition, we had $15 million of COVID response costs primarily to support our life consultants in Gibraltar, which we expect will moderate in future quarters. Now turning to Slide 9, we have a conservative high quality investment portfolio that reflects our robust asset liability management practices, commitment to broad diversification and a disciplined interest rate risk management framework. We also leverage PGIM's expertise across multiple asset classes, including its deep and longstanding experience in private placements and real estate. There has been a slowdown in the pace of credit migration and impairments since the first quarter of this year, with year-to-date, credit migration and losses below our expectations. For the third quarter, credit losses were just $12 million. We remain confident that we were well capitalized to weather, whatever might emerge in the future. And with that, I'll hand it over to Ken."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Andy Sullivan",
            "content": "And Eric, it's Andy. I would just add, it's really not related to business volumes or revenues. It is core efficiency improvement, where we're applying process and technology and able to hit a number of costs reduction levers. So it's becoming more efficient at the business that we have. Yes, maybe I would just add Eric, you also \u2013 I think asked about what's the marketplace for these types of transactions and we will not quote on any specific deals that are going on. I think there are two important takeaways that we should discuss. One is, I think we've generally believe that a number of these blocks of business and our block of business, its value is not fully appreciated in the marketplace. And I think if you look at the recent transactions that certainly has been, I think proven out. The other thing is that there is capital moving towards, these types of deals, and that there's capacity. So we've \u2013 as Charlie said, we've begun to work on these alternatives and when we have something more to report we'll certainly do so. Yes, Humphrey, it's Andy. So I'll take your question. And as we discussed sort of from a lessons learned perspective from last year, we've done a lot this year to make sure with that we were better prepared for the annual enrollment period. We direct contracted with the health carriers, which gives us a lot more flexibility and agility. We invested much more heavily in agent recruiting, licensing and training. And we began to bring on agents this year in the month of July, which was much earlier than last year. So we're repeating what Rob said, we're only about three weeks into the season. But we certainly see evidence that our investments are paying off and that we're having stronger performance than we had in 2019. Having said that about 50% of industry-wide Medicare advantage transactions occur in the last two weeks of the annual enrollment period and that's the first two weeks of December. So while we like what we see from a growth perspective in these early days, it certainly, too early to draw definitive conclusions. Yes. I think in our materials we had given a walk to about $25 million for the fourth quarter. Actually I had that number wrong. It was $15 million, Humphrey. Sorry, I was off, looked at the wrong line. So Tom, it's Andy. I'll take your question. We've been very focused on strengthening out our value proposition in our full service retirement business. We've talked a lot about over the last couple of years, the work that we've done in financial wellness we've pretty heavily invested in digital and mobile, and that has resulted in very good organic growth on that platform. If you look at our net flows over time, it's been very positive. We're completing our third year of record sales. We had our largest corporate client ever in the quarter. So we've seen great success, even though, we certainly pay attention to the consolidation of this space. We've seen great success organically growing the business, and that maintains our focus. So Suneet, it's Andy. I'll take your question. And let me maybe raise it up a level, so we're very pleased that we bought this business model and set of capabilities a model that's not sensitive to interest rates or equity markets. Obviously, with what happened in the March timeframe, we're even more pleased to have this as part of the fold. We immediately got very focused on building out and expanding the business model. So that we could care for more needs in the mass market and middle market consumer set. So as we've really worked on the business internally, success for us is not about near-term AOI. Success for us is very much about continuing to expand the reach and breadth of the platform and is very much measured in how we grow our revenues, is very much measured in the products that we have on the platform. So we began with life, you saw us immediately lean into Medicare advantage. And then more recently, we've leaned into property and casualty. And again, I always remind this is from a distribution perspective, not from a manufacturing perspective. And these bring fee-based earnings that are very capitally efficient. So our focus is really expanding this out as rapidly as we can. Yes. Suneet, its Andy. And I guess, right up front, I'll draw a very sharp distinction in our financial wellness work from what I would call worksite marketing, which I know a number of voluntary products are more worksite marketing with feet on the street in the employer. Ours was very much about building a set of capabilities that could really reach people when, where and how they want it. So there was a real digital focus to what we built. We've had accelerating success, if you remember, there were sort of a couple of stages to what we were trying to accomplish. At this point we've had a large portion of our employers adopt our capabilities, we've 20 million individuals that have access to the platform that's ahead of our goals for 2020. We've \u2013 in my words, permissioned 12 million individuals that they can access \u2013 we get access to market, our retail solutions that is also ahead of our goals. And at this point we've put 15,000 retail customers into Prudential through the platform. As COVID came in the base capabilities were such that we were able to pretty quickly even expand upon as an example, our Prudential Pathways program and make it purely digital with webinars capabilities. And at this point, that's now reaching about 8.5 million folks. So we don't see the current environment actually hindering us at all. And it's really about how we built the whole platform. So John, its Andy. This is really just an expansion of our program, as Ken said earlier, every business and every function. So it is \u2013 real estate is part of it, but there are a number of different buckets. It really is across real estate, it's across better vendor management and procurement, more efficiency from a travel perspective. So it really goes across a number of areas. We learned a lot in the first 12 to 18 months of this program. We saw a lot of what was possible and feasible, and we basically expanded to every corner of the organization. So it's not one particular category, it's just from the success of the overarching program and accelerating it. So from an annuities perspective, I'm not going to get this exactly right, but I think it's in the $110 billion and $120 billion range. And I don't have the guaranteed universal life in front of me. Hi. It's Andy, I'll take your question. So, we've actually been very pleased. We have not seen an uptick in incidents in either our short-term disability business or our long-term disability business. That being said though, obviously we've operated this business for many, many decades, and we know that in recessionary environments, there's generally somewhere in the neighborhood of a year lag from when that incident shows up. So we have invested to make sure that our claims teams have low, what we call desk loads, so that if and when that incident starts to tick up, we're well prepared for it. But we have not seen evidence of that yet. Josh, its Andy, I'll take that. So, our HDI and PDI block of business is a very high returning block of business as Ken talked about earlier. It's a well capitalized block and well hedged block and creates good cash flows. It's more of a go-forward perspective, if you think about the decision making around our product pivot, we're working towards more of what I would frame as an all weather portfolio, where we're taking less fully on ourselves, the interest rate and equity market risk. The HDI is our most sensitive product in that regard. So, we think from a go-forward perspective, as you noted, we are very, very good in the annuity space, we believe there still is a deep sea that need to help people with accumulation, and to help them with decumulation from a longevity insurance perspective. And we think our go-forward product portfolio does that well, but does it in a way that's more shareholder friendly. No. If you're asking about, do they need the sort of the HDI/PDI types of product? No, we've actually \u2013 we benefit from our brand and our strength of our distribution. And I think that's really why you see such a strong start to our FlexGuard buffered annuity. It was 38% of our sales here in the third quarter, and we recently went through $1 billion in sales, and we haven't even finished fully rolling it out to all states and all advisers. So, we think our product portfolio will meet the needs of the advisors and we'll see good growth in it. Yes. Elyse, it's Andy, I'll take your question. So you're absolutely right. If we look at sort of 2020, the marketplace \u2013 size of the marketplace versus 2019, 2020 is definitely going to be down. We think it's going to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 20%-ish or so. Third quarter was relatively quiet. We are seeing a building pipeline in 4Q, but I would point out that, with a lower overall market size, we also have talked about in the past that we're now probably up to five plus competitors that can do deals of $1 billion plus. So we think it's going to be a very competitive environment in the fourth quarter. We're going to be very disciplined about how we approach the marketplace and we're going to pick our spots."

            "name": "Scott Sleyster",
            "content": "Tom, this is Scott. The Gibraltar run rate base has been impacted by really two factors. And one here, this first one is more permanent. We adjusted our compensation structure for life consultants to better balance policy holding \u2013 policyholder servicing things like customer visits, persistency, and so forth. With new business production and then this led to a lower level of deferrable commissions. Overall, the commissions have not actually changed, but our immediate run rate was impacted by roughly $10 million a quarter. And we view this as permanent. Now we recapture that over the life of the products, but that takes a quite a while to pick up. By the way, we do not expect this to have any impact on Gibraltar's cash flow. Second Gibraltar does have a large block of U.S. dollar business, which is experiencing spread erosion due to declines in U.S. dollar interest rates. So it's really those two factors combined with the biggest thing the first. Sure. Thanks Jimmy. This is Scott. Well, as Rob noted in his remarks with the significant decline in U.S. interest rates, we implemented pricing changes in August across all of our U.S. dollar products in Japan. As you know, it's common for salespeople to use such a pricing change to stimulate client contact. And that tends to accelerate sales from maybe the quarter ahead prior to such a change. Sales in 3Q also did benefit from the relaxation of social distancing requirements in Japan that were implemented in the beginning of June. And I think you also ask on that question. We expect that such enhanced demand will taper off in the following quarter, but then we are expecting things really to normalize as we head into 2021. Overall, our distribution in Japan is largely operating in kind of a back to normal mode. And I think that really reflects the strength of our differentiated business model."

At this point, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I'll turn the call now to Mr. Darin Arita. Please go ahead, sir.\nDarin Arita:\n, : Today\u2019s presentation may include forward-looking statements. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions we make today. In addition, this presentation may include references to non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of such measures to the comparable GAAP measures and the discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, please see the slide titled Forward-Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measures in the appendix to today\u2019s presentation, which can be found on our website at investor.prudential.com. With that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Charlie.\nCharlie Lowrey: Thank you, Darin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I\u2019ll start by saying we hope that you, your families and colleagues remain safe and healthy during these extraordinary times. The events of the past several months have created unforeseen new difficulties for people around the world, while further exposing the deep-seated problem of an equity in our society. It's in times like these that we believe our company's purpose of solving the financial challenges of our changing world and standing by our employees, customers and communities is most important. After transitioning over 95% of our US employees and most of our international employees to remote work in March, we continue to seamlessly serve customers, while the vast majority of our employees around the world continue to work in that fashion. This allows us to exercise utmost caution as we evaluate how and when to return to the workplace. In the meantime, I am so proud of our people and how they've continued to focus on meeting the evolving needs of our customers, many of whom face new challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impact. We\u2019ll continue to innovate the ways we serve our customers during and after the pandemic. During the second quarter, we maintained a clear focus on executing against our 2020 initiative, despite the challenging macroeconomic backdrop. By delivering on progress on our cost savings targets, aggressively repricing and pivoting products to mitigate the impact of low rates on our performance and rotating our international earnings mix. We\u2019re also focused on identifying opportunities for further action, particularly as we look to continue to reduce our sensitivity to market. And we\u2019re exploring the potential to generate additional cost savings on top our existing 2020 targets. Throughout this period, we benefited from the strength of our rock-solid balance sheet, which gives us the confidence and the flexibility to navigate changes to the economic environment. I\u2019ll touch on each of these points in greater detail before turning it over to Rob and Ken for a look at our second quarter results. Turning now to our 2020 priorities on slide three. We remain on track to achieve our $143 million cost savings target for the whole years, and have achieved $75 million in savings year-to-date, with $45 million in the second quarter. We also continued to make progress in shifting our international earnings mix to higher growth markets. We remained on track to close on the sale of Prudential of Korea in the second half of 2020, and are advancing our review of strategic options for Prudential of Taiwan, which may include a sale. As I mentioned earlier, we are aggressively modifying our product mix, while exercising a highly disciplined approach to pricing in this low interest rate environment. Turning to slide four. While we are encouraged by the progress we\u2019re making to position our businesses and operations for the future, we continue to look at ways to work smarter and more efficiently in order to achieve cost savings on top of our target of $500 million by 2022. This includes using technology and automation, and leveraging the learnings from operating in a remote work environment to optimize how and where we work. In addition, we are looking at other ways to build upon our repricing and product shift to further mitigate the impact of market sensitivity. On slide five, we note how we're embarking on these initiatives, with the foundational strength provided by our balance sheet and robust capital position, including highly liquid assets of $4.5 billion at the end of the second quarter. Prudential Financial and its subsidiaries continue to exceed AA financial strength rating. Our second quarter assumption update had a modest effect on our financial results, even as we reduced our US long term interest rate by 50 basis points to 3.4%. Lastly, we anticipate receiving the US$1.7 billion of proceeds from sales Korea, our Korea business by the end of the year. In terms of capital deployment plans, we\u2019ll continue to monitor developments in the credit markets and the economy to determine our strategy. Slide six shows our second quarter financial results. This quarter exemplified the benefits of our thoughtful approach to risk management and our complementary business mix. We aim to balance mortality and longevity risk, so we don\u2019t have a one-sided exposure. In the quarter, we had net favorable underwriting experience. Our adjusted operating income was $931 million in the quarter. While we recorded a net GAAP loss, driven primarily by the non-cash effect of non-economic market impacts, which have no effect on our regulatory capital position. Our US businesses reported adjusted operating income of $455 million, due to more favorable underwriting, offset by the unfavorable impact of the assumption update and lower fee and spread income. PGIM reported record adjusted operating income of $324 million, as well as record assets under management of $1.4 trillion, a 9% increase from the year earlier period. This growth reflected strong flows into fixed income, as well as market appreciation. Our International businesses reported adjusted operating income of $693 million, as more favorable underwriting, higher earnings from joint ventures and business growth were offset by the unfavorable impact of the assumption update and lower spread income and higher expenses. Before turning it over to Rob, I\u2019d like to address the recent disturbing incidence of racial injustice and how we as an organization, are responding to the deep-seated and persistent problem of racism and inequity in society. Last month, we announced commitments to advance racial equity, as highlighted on slide seven. These commitments were borne out of the courageous candor of our employees, who have shared their experiences and their expectations, and the listening that is taking place all across Prudential. Taking a bottom-up approach, we developed concrete and measurable actions spanning our talent practices to how we design and deliver products, to the investments we make and how we foster social and racial equity in the communities where we work and do business. We already had a substantive set of programs underway and a body of work that reflects our long-standing commitment to racial equity, including investing over $1 billion in our hometown of Newark. We recognized that this moment calls for us to amplify what Prudential has already been doing to drive change within our company and within society. It is a moral and it is a business imperative that aligns directly with our company's purpose to solve the financial challenges of our changing world, as well as our multi-stakeholder commitments to employees, customers, shareholders and society. We stand by the promises we make, and we are prepared to be judged for our actions to support our colleagues, customers and communities today and over the long term. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Rob.\nRob Falzon: Thank you, Charlie. And I want to reemphasize your comment about our commitment as a management team to supporting racial equity. This is an issue that is aligned to our purpose, it's part of the fabric of our culture and critical to our success as an organization. I'll now provide an update on how we are executing on our strategy within our US, PGIM and International businesses, as well as on the outlook for these businesses, and we\u2019ll also provide an update on our investment portfolio. Turning to slide eight. Our US businesses produced a diversified source of earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income. We continue to execute on three key priorities. First, we\u2019ve implemented pricing and product actions to simplify and derisk our business mix, while protecting profitability. For example, we took aggressive pricing actions aligned with intention to significantly reduce sales of HDI, our legacy flagship VA product and launched FlexGuard, our buffered annuity product, which has been well received by the market, supporting our product mix shift to less sensitive, less interest sensitive solutions. And in our Individual Life business, we suspended sales of our single life guaranteed universal life product in July. This will result in the continued shift to variable life and other less interest rate-sensitive products. We will continue to take product and pricing actions, including steps to diversify our mix of business, to maintain profitability in this interest rate environment. As a result, we expect individual annuities and individual life sales to continue to move lower in the near term. Second, as the needs of our customers rapidly evolve, including in response to COVID-19 and its economic impact, we are increasingly leveraging technology to enhance customer engagement and efficiency. For example, we've expanded our process to electronically deliver policies from application submission to policy issuance, and have increased the use of our fast-track automated underwriting process. And we have expanded the use of electronic signatures and self-service customer capabilities across our businesses. And third, we remain committed to expanding our addressable market. The pandemic has amplified the financial wellness challenges that many US households face, and has highlighted the importance of our financial wellness platform and our life insurance, retirement, and financial planning solutions. We also continue to see increasing interest in our Assurance IQ platform from customers in the healthcare, life and P&C lines of business. In preparation for the Medicare annual enrollment period in the fourth quarter, we\u2019ve been progressing well with our agent onboarding and training process. Now turning to slide nine. PGIM is a top 10 global investment manager that continues to demonstrate the strength and resilience of its multi-manager business model. Our assets under management reached a record level of $1.4 trillion, up 9% from the year ago quarter, driven by net flows, as well as the positive impact from equity and credit markets. PGIM's long-term investment performance remains strong and has rebounded from the temporary downturn in the first quarter, more than 85% of assets under management have outperformed their benchmarks over the last three, five- and 10-year periods. This strong investment performance, coupled with diversified investment capabilities across asset classes, regions, and client segments, has led to continued growth. We generated nearly $4 billion of net third-party flows during the second quarter, driven by record retail flows of $9 billion. Institutional outflows were driven by a single passive equity client redemption. Our public fixed income platform generated flows of $10 billion, as it continues to benefit from our broad suite of strategies and the leading position of our franchise. And PGIM investments was the number one ranked US mutual fund franchise across active and passive asset managers based on net year-to-date sales. PGIM's asset management fees were up 3% compared to the year ago quarter, driven by the growth in average assets under management. In addition, other related revenues increased primarily due to higher strategic investment earnings as a result of strong investment performance and the effect of credit spreads tightening, reversing the widening that had occurred in the first quarter. We also continue to focus on cost discipline to fund growth and further increase our operating leverage. Turning to slide 10. Our international businesses, including our Japanese life insurance operation, where we have a differentiated multichannel distribution model, as well as other operations focused on high growth markets. As expected, Life planner sales decreased 30% compared to the year ago quarter, primarily reflecting lower sales in Japan due to COVID-19-related restrictions on sales activities. Life planner headcount, however, increased 5% compared to a year ago. Similar to Life planner, sales for Gibraltar were 34% lower, but the number of life consultants has declined as we continue to focus on quality distribution. In Chile, market returns in the quarter were higher than average and that contributed to an operating income benefit of approximately $25 million, reversing the impact we experienced in the first quarter. With respect to expenses across international, we provided appropriate sales support to protect and care for our captive distribution, as we noted last quarter. This contributed $55 million to expenses, which we expect to trend lower in the second half of the year. We have seen some recovery in Japan sales beginning in June as the state of emergency was lifted, and over time, we expect sales to normalize. In addition, to mitigate the impacts of reduced face-to-face sales, our agents have adapted to increased usage of virtual tools to connect with customers, and we have seen early signs of success. We believe that our needs-based selling approach and death protection product focus continue to provide important value to our customers. With respect to interest rates, we\u2019ve successfully managed through decades of low interest rates and other market challenges in Japan. As you have seen us do in the past, we adjust our product offering quickly to meet the needs and preferences of our customers, while also achieving our return expectations. We have already taken actions and will continue to do so as needed as we move forward. Now turning to slide 11. We have a conservative, quality-focused investment portfolio that reflects our robust asset liability management practices, commitment to broad diversification and a disciplined interest rate risk management framework. We also leveraged PGIM's expertise across multiple asset classes, including its deep and long-standing experience in private placements and real estate. Year-to-date credit migration and losses have trended below our expectations. For the second quarter credit losses were $139 million, driven by energy and consumer cyclical sectors. While we expect credit losses to be a multiple quarter story, we feel comfortable that our exposure is manageable and that we are well capitalized to weather whatever emerges. And with that, I'll hand it over to Ken.\nKen Tanji: Thanks, Rob. I will begin on slide 12, which provides insight into earnings for the third quarter relative to our second quarter results. The key point is that our underlying earnings power increased slightly from last quarter, primarily reflecting higher equity markets. To help you see this, I\u2019ll start with pretax adjusted operating income in the second quarter, which was $931 million and resulted in earnings per share of $1.85 on an after-tax basis. Then, we adjust for the following items. First, the annual review of assumptions and other refinements resulted in a net charge of $334 million in the second quarter, primarily driven by a reduction of our long-term interest rate assumption by 50 basis points in the US. Next, we adjusted variable income to a normalized level, which is worth $130 million. Please note that while we have not included an adjustment for variable investment income for the third quarter, the potential exists for continued revaluation of private equity and real estate investments due to the current adverse economic conditions. While returns of our alternative investment portfolio are currently lower than our target returns, and will vary period-to-period, over time, this portfolio has generated income above our target returns. Third, we adjusted underwriting experience by $155 million. This reflects $100 million of favorable experience in the second quarter, primarily driven by reserve gains in retirement. We estimate claims experience in the third quarter will include $55 million for COVID-19. Next, there are other items that combined may be $75 million more favorable in the third quarter, primarily related to expenses and markets. We expect expenses, including implementation costs to be $130 million lower in the third quarter, this is primarily due to legal expenses in the second quarter. In addition, due to favorable markets in the second quarter, other related revenues in PGIM benefited by $45 million. And in [indiscernible] income in our Gibraltar segment also benefited by $25 million. We expect operating cost due to COVID-19 to be $25 million in the third quarter. And last, we anticipate net investment income will be reduced by $15 million, reflecting the difference between new money rates and disposition yields of our investment portfolio. These items combined get us to a baseline of $2.63 per share for the third quarter. Please note that this baseline includes items specific to the third quarter that reduced EPS by approximately $0.19 per share. While we have provided these items to consider, to meet [ph] the other factors that affect earnings per share in the third quarter. On Slide 13, we provided an update on the potential impact of the pandemic. We have included a sensitivity for operating income based on the US population experiencing 100,000 of incremental deaths due to the pandemic. We estimate that this may lower operating income by $70 million. And this is less than the sensitivity we provided on our last earnings call, as we have seen a lower fatality rate due to COVID-19 in our US insurance businesses than previously estimated. Our third quarter baseline includes a net impact for mortality due to COVID-19 of approximately $55 million. The actual impact will depend on a variety of factors, such as infection and fatality rates, geographic considerations and progress in testing and medical treatments. We have also reduced our estimate for incremental operating costs due to COVID-19 and have estimated the potential reduction in other operating costs, such as for travel and entertainment. In the second half of 2020, we expect to incur incremental operating costs of $60 million due to COVID-19, with $40 million in the third quarter and $20 million in the fourth quarter. The estimate of these costs is lower than what we provided on our last call, primarily due to lower health benefit costs of our US employees and lower cost to support our sales professionals in Japan, as their productivity is improving faster than previously estimated. We also expect to have $30 million of lower travel and entertainment expenses in the second half of 2020. Turning to Slide 14, we continue to maintain a robust capital position and adequate sources of funding. Our capital position exceeds our AA financial strength targets, and we maintain liquid assets at the parent company that are greater than 3 times annual fixed charges. We have substantial sources of funding. Our cash and liquid assets at the parent company were $4.5 billion at the end of the quarter. We expect to receive net proceeds of $1.7 billion from the sale of our Prudential of Korea business following the close of the transaction, which is expected in the second half of this year. And another source of funding is free cash flow from our businesses. In May, we added a new $1.5 billion contingent capital facility that combined with our previous facility, brings our total available contingent capital funding resources to $3 billion. Turning to Slide 15. And in summary, we remained on-track with our objectives for the year, as we accelerate the execution of our initiatives. We\u2019re exploring the potential to increase our cost savings initiative and looking at additional ways to build upon our repricing and product shift to further mitigate market impacts. And we maintain a rock bound \u2013 rock-solid balance sheet with a robust capital liquidity position. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] First, with the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question was just on the mortality assumption you laid out for the third quarter. So if I look at your disclosures, longevity did benefit your results in both the Q1 and the Q2 this year. So I\u2019m just trying to understand why that would at least continue to some degree in the third quarter?\nKen Tanji: Hi, Elyse. This is Ken. I\u2019ll take your question about the COVID mortality into the third quarter. So we - in our second quarter, we benefited from our longevity business in the UK. Mortality in the UK came in a little bit higher than we had previously estimated, and that resulted in a gain from our UK longevity reinsurance business. While there was fatalities in the UK in the second, right now that seems to be more contained and we wouldn't expect that to continue given the current fatality rates. So we also, in our new estimate, have incorporated into to that sensitivity, what we learned from the second quarter, which is in our - also in our life insurance and group insurance businesses, the fatality rates were lower than we previously estimated. So we've incorporated that into our new estimate.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. Thanks. And then second, on the capital side, you guys said in your prepared remarks that you would continue to monitor credit markets and the economy in determining your strategy. I guess, as we have one additional quarter under your belt, how are you thinking about capital return? Is it dependent upon getting the capital, you know, the $1.7 billion from the Korea sales towards the end of this year? Or is it more just dependent upon kind of more time going on and seeing how credit loss [ph] developed?\nCharlie Lowrey: Elyse, it's Charlie. I\u2019ll take that one. So as you know, we paused our share repurchases in the second quarter, in line with the risk framework that we had in place. And as you said, until we get better visibility into the depth and the duration of the pandemic, the possible recession and the credit cycle, we will maintain our financial flexibility and resiliency. When we get the clarity into those issues I just mentioned, we\u2019ll then share the timing of our plan to resume share buybacks and by how much, and that would also include the proceeds from the sale or potential sale of the Korean business. So we're going to focus on maintaining our financial strength. But when we get clarity into the issues going forward, we will certainly let you know, and we\u2019ll be transparent about it.\nElyse Greenspan: Thank you. I appreciate the color.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW. Please go ahead.\nRyan Krueger: Hi, good morning. Could you elaborate on, I guess, the things you're considering that would cause a reduction in your market in interest rate sensitivity? And I guess, in particular, I guess, I would assume to meaningfully change that you - that would require some sort of in-force reinsurance transaction. But if you could elaborate some on what you're thinking about?\nRob Falzon: Ryan, it's Rob. I'll take a shot at that. First, let me just bring it up a level and say, as we sort of think about our strategy on a go-forward basis, we think about the elements of that is, in the first instance, simplifying and derisking the business as we articulated in our opening remarks, The other components of that are about improving near-term earnings through the efficiency initiatives that we've talked about and which we think has some expansion opportunity associated with them And then obviously, continue to expand our addressable market in order to support longer-term growth. Specifically with regard to the derisking, I would characterize the repricing and product shifts that we've done as sort of the first steps transitioning to lower volatility, less interest rate and general market sensitivity across our businesses. For those products that we've either stepped back from or actually explicitly discontinued. So think about that as being HDI in the variable annuities business and guaranteed universal life in the life business. We'll look actively at opportunities to optimize the economics of the legacy blocks that are associated with those products. And those options range anywhere from simply sort of just running off the blocks to reinsuring indoor \u2013 looking at selling the blocks. A couple of other things outside of that across our products, we're actually looking actively at product design, as well as individual and aggregate limits that could reduce the amount of potential volatility that we get from any individual products or grouping of products. So you saw us significantly reduced the retention limits that we have within our individual life business, by way of example. Charlie hit on financial flexibility and resiliency, so we're going to retain our capital in order to make sure that we that in place. And we think that, that's an element of the derisking, at least in the near term. We're also looking at the investment portfolio, and looking at strategic asset allocation, re-optimizing sort of the risk return and volatility trade-offs that are associated with our equity, our credit and our interest rate exposures, in light of where we are in the cycle and the opportunities that are in front of us. And I guess the last thing I'd mention is that as we look at the growth of the business, on a go-forward basis, our strategic emphasis is really on growing the elements of our business that are less rate-sensitive and more predictable and more capital like, for instance, peach of our asset management business. So those would be the primary things that we're thinking about from a derisking standpoint. Charlie, I don't know if there's any further color you'd want to add on to that?\nCharlie Lowrey: Yes. Thanks, Rob. So, Ryan let me just try and connect some dots. Because over the past 18 months, as Rob said, we\u2019ve taken actions to begin to accomplish many of the objectives that Rob articulated, namely, lower market sensitivity, lower capital intensity of our business mix becoming more competitive in terms of serving our customers with processes, better processes and lower costs. And then finally, as Rob said, increasing growth, right? And so let me just tick through a number of things that we've done in order to achieve those objectives. We're sold or selling out of lower growth businesses, Italy, Poland, Korea and exploring options for Taiwan. We acquired assurance around which we have high conviction about growth in a business that isn't as market sensitive, so lower risk. We've significantly reduced or stopped selling certainly highly interest rate-sensitive products and annuities and IOI [ph]. We introduced less market-sensitive products such as the buffered annuity. We repriced almost our entire product line. We announced and are executing on our future work initiative, which will produce $500 million in cost savings with the potential to do more. And as Rob said, we're currently exploring other options on book to business that are market sensitive. So we're executing on a series of incremental changes that we believe will lead to fundamental change in our business mix and ultimately, the trajectory of the firm as we go forward. So that's a foundation off of which we are going to grow going forward.\nRyan Krueger: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And next from the line of Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead.\nHumphrey Lee: Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Regarding the kind of potential \u2013 hello?\nCharlie Lowrey: Yes, Humphrey we can hear you.\nHumphrey Lee: I know it's still probably in the early stage of planning. But is there any way to help us think line of about the potential size and scope of that impact? Should it be kind of comparable to what you've been targeting so far? Or just more of an incremental to what you \u2013 just a modest incremental to what you've been targeting?\nRob Falzon: Humphrey, it's Rob. I'll take a shot at that. You cut out a little bit, but I think I understood your question. So as we have been in the course of executing on the efficiency initiatives that we had articulated earlier in the year - earlier last year. We've actually accelerated those actions. And in the course of doing so, we've actually institutionalized continuous transformation capability. And as a result of that, we're generating new ideas and strategies for further efficiencies that enhance customer experiences. Remember, that's sort of the first priority of that is they enable our businesses, putting us in more competitive positions, and it increases our operating profits, particularly in light of the \u2013 which is needed in particular in light of the impact of earnings of a low rate environment. The levers we're using Humphrey are pretty much the things that we've done to date. So increased use of technology and automation, process improvements, sourcing, org design, all the things that are classic. We just think there's - as a result of this continuous process, much further that we can go from \u2013 than what we've articulated to date. We're also contemplating learnings from the crisis and some of the implications of the pandemic and our experience in that on things like remote work, changes in communications and travel and use of technology on a go-forward basis. So all of that leads us to be optimistic that we can expand materially from where we are today. But we're not ready to quantify that. We'll provide more guidance on that when we get further into year. And once we finished our work, we'll \u2013 as Charlie indicated, will be transparent.\nHumphrey Lee: Appreciate the color. Shifting gear, looking at PGIM, as you mentioned, flows were very good in the quarter, especially on the retail side. But on the institutional side, even after that $4.5 billion of passive equity mandate redemption, flows were still connective [ph] So I was just wondering, can you comment on what you saw in the quarter? And then also, how is your pipeline looking out for - especially on the institutional side?\nAndy Sullivan: Sure, Humphrey. It's Andy. I'll take your question. And you were cutting in a little bit. I'm not sure if it was you or me. So retail flows are really a result of three things, very strong investment management performance, a broad and wide product portfolio and strong distribution. And we're performing well on all of those fronts. Our investment performance in the second quarter was very strong. All of our PGIM fixed income strategies outperformed benchmark. 96% of our equity - Genesis equities outperformed benchmark, so very, very strong fundamental performance. As you know, we've been building out our global distribution over time. So we were actually quite pleased with our flows in the quarter. We were the number one mutual fund family year-to-date, and had $9.5 billion in positive retail flows. We did have the $4.5 billion index passive flow related to QMA. That was a very low mandate. So think in the neighborhood of 1 to 2 bps. So literally, it was less than $1 million in fees. It also was the last of our - what I would call [Technical Difficulty] As you look forward, quarter-to-quarter, there will be variability. But over the long run, our fundamental investment performance, the strength of our distribution, we have had strong organic flows over the last five years, and we expect that to continue as we look forward over the next several years.\nCharlie Lowrey: Andy, you cut out for one sec. Do you want to repeat the point you were making about? I don't know that it was well heard on the number of passive large mandate passive funds.\nAndy Sullivan: Sorry about that. All I mentioned was the $4.5 billion outflow was the last large passive mandate that we have in our portfolio.\nHumphrey Lee: Got it. Appreciate the color.\nOperator: And next we\u2019ll go to the line of Tom Gallagher with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nTom Gallagher: Good morning. Charlie, just a follow up on Ryan's question on the - I guess, the range of things you're considering with risk transfer. I hear what you guys are saying on limiting new sales considering some reinsurance back books, it sounds like maybe on life insurance. Have you considered anything more transformational? And the reason I ask that is kind of a more moderate, we'll say, limited approach to the strategy probably from a shareholder standpoint is going to result in very limited growth as you have some of these businesses that you still own that are shrinking every year. So it becomes kind of a challenge from an annual earnings growth standpoint. Have you considered that? And would you consider something more extreme like an IPO of some of your capital market-sensitive businesses or a bigger reinsurance transaction? Or are you thinking in a more limited scale?\nCharlie Lowrey: So Tom, thanks for the question. I appreciate it. Let me just take a step back and then I'll answer your question directly, but - and make a comment about how we think about capital allocation and particular optimization. Because when we look across our businesses, what we\u2019re trying to both domestically and internationally is ensure we're optimizing that capital deployment. So we've mentioned in the past that we're looking at or continue to look at businesses such as IOI [ph] annuities and some of our international operations as well as LTC. You've seen us take some bold action in terms of Italy, Poland, Korea, potentially, Taiwan, et cetera. So what we're going to do is - and what we can assure you is that we will continue to look to ways to optimize capital and capital deployment to maximize outcomes for shareholders, right? Be that through significant dispositions, whatever flavor that may take, through potential share repurchases or through acquisitions. And right now, we have acknowledged - we'll continue to acknowledge that there's a high hurdle for any major acquisition given where our stock price is trading. We get that. But we're looking, as you've seen in the actions we've taken to date over the last 18 months. And I think what you'll see us do going forward is look at all our businesses in order to optimize the capital we deploy and how we do that. And that's our commitment to shareholders, and that's what we're doing.\nTom Gallagher: Got you. Appreciate it. I guess, my follow-up is just, it looks like you've reduced pretty substantially the expense drag for the subsidies you were planning on or you've been paying to the Life Planners in Japan. Is that because you see greater visibility on a sales recovery emerging? Or have you guys lowered the level of subsidy?\nScott Sleyster: Why don't I go ahead and take that, Tom? This is Scott. I think the answer is multifaceted, but maybe I'll speak first to the question on have we seen a sales recovery. We actually started to see a pretty good bounce back June, to the point where we were starting to get close to even to 2019 sales in both Japan and in Brazil. And that has continued and actually modestly strengthened in the month of July. So we are seeing a pretty good sales recovery, and we're encouraged. But of course, that is -- that has to be that has to be tempered by any kind of resurgence that could occur. In the case of the Life Planner, we were actually able to take what was an initial subsidy that was sort of an uncharacteristic payment that we have, and we were able to roll it into their bonusable plan. So a portion of the amount that we have for POJ is actually being deferred into their sales comp. So you're not seeing it as directly, but it's still there.\nTom Gallagher: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: And next we'll go to Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJimmy Bhullar: Hi. Good morning. First, just on your annual assumption review and the interest rate assumption. Obviously, it's more conservative than it was before. But still fairly optimistic versus market levels. So just if you could talk about what went into your thoughts on how much to reduce the rate assumption by? And why did you not like make a bigger adjustment given where market rates are?\nKen Tanji: Jimmy, it's Ken. In terms of our long-term rate assumption, we followed a very established process that we've had for a number of years, and it considers multiple perspectives. So we look at, again, long-term interest rate forecast of economists, banks and managers. And we look to be at the median of all those. And for this year, when we looked at that, that meant a 10-year U.S. treasury rate in the long-term of 3.25% and 1% for the JGB in Japan. So we followed the same process we've had for a number of years. It's also important to know how we grade into that long-term assumption. We do that over 10 years, and the first two years follows the forward curve. And as a result, it's not just the long-term assumption, but the path of which we get there. And so over the next five years, our average rate would be 1.25%. In 10 years, it's about 1.9%. And so again, we have a pretty established process. We look at third-party inputs, and look to be at the median, and that was and that was the result for this year.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then any color on how your long-term care block has held up recently? And whether you've seen any benefit on your claims or reserves from the pandemic?\nKen Tanji: We saw a little bit elevated mortality in our policies that are already on claim, policies that are already on claim, but it was but it was fairly modest, and I wouldn't call significant.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And next, we'll go to John Barnidge with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nJohn Barnidge: Great. Thanks. Most of my questions have been answered. But can you talk about commercial mortgage loan forbearance in the quarter, directionality of that as well? Thank you.\nRob Falzon: John, it's Rob. Yes, to date, our - we've received forbearance requests that are about 8% or so of the portfolio. We provided forbearance and 6% of those instances and the remaining 2% are under review, and that excludes a little bit that we've gotten requests on that were declined. but in that, only about 1% of the requests resulted in a deferral of interest. In all other instances, we remain current on interest and they've been deferrals of principal. Recall that across our portfolio, our loan to values are actually quite low. And so as a result of that, when we defer principal, we're actually not particularly concerned about that because we know that the principal amount is actually quite safe. The average loan-to-value across our entire portfolio, based on our internal appraisals is 56-ish percent, using external appraisals, it will be about 10 points lower than that, so less than 50%. And so given that low LTV, accommodations on amortization of principal or repayment or principal, we believe there's a prudent thing to be doing, and if we can remain card on interest, that keeps the loans performing, and that's been sort of our experience to date.\nJohn Barnidge: Great. Thanks for the answer.\nOperator: And next we'll go to Suneet Kamath with Citi. Please go ahead.\nSuneet Kamath: Thanks. Just a question, first off, on variable annuities. One of the things that folks are talking about now is that the AIC is reviewing the mean to reversion assumption that they include in VA capital reform. So just curious if that \u2013 what if that was changed would you expect to see either a big impact on your hedging program or your capital requirements for VA?\nKen Tanji: Hi. This is Ken. We've - I just a little bit of backdrop on this for us. We've managed our VA business with a very robust economic view and active hedging for many years. We're very supportive of a statutory framework that also is based on robust economic scenarios, both in terms of the long-term assumptions, but also the dispersion around those assumptions. Our internal scenarios that we use to manage the business are actually more conservative than those being considered by the NAIC. So we continue to advocate for appropriate economic scenarios within the VM-21 framework and we believe that it will be well positioned due to our - the internal framework that we've used to manage the business for many years.\nSuneet Kamath: Got it. Okay. And then just to shift over to international, if I could. Obviously, a lot of moving parts in terms of COVID, face-to-face sales, low interest rates, expenses. But as you think about the longer-term outlook for the Japan businesses, when do you see those businesses sort of back to earnings growth, as opposed to earnings declines or flattish earnings, again, just conceptually, how are you thinking about the outlook for that business?\nScott Sleyster: Hi, Suneet. This is Scott again, I'll go ahead and take that. I guess I\u2019d talk a little bit about capital rotation mixed in with that question. We were seeing low growth in the developed markets in Korea, Taiwan and Japan. And you saw that we took out actions in Korea and we're considering those in Taiwan. And the reason that you see a difference between those businesses in Japan is that we have really strong market share in Japan, and we have a really high-performing LP model there. The business generates attractive returns over our cost of capital and it generates a lot of free cash flow to the parent. So we really like our Japan operation, and we continue to invest in it. That being said, overall premium growth in Japan is been negative for the last several years and the country continues to face demographic challenges. So the fact that we've been able to continue to grow in POJ has been a significant outperformance in the country. So I guess what I would say is, we expect kind of low single-digit growth in Japan. And if we're achieving that, that's actually very strong relative performance. And then in the context of a business system that's creating a lot of value and cash to the parent. In the meantime, we'll look for redeployment in higher-growth markets, but those are going to have to be opportunistic.\nSuneet Kamath: Okay. Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And seeing no further questions coming in, Mr. Lowrey, I'll turn it over to you.\nCharlie Lowrey: Okay. Thanks very much. So as we come to the end of the call today, I'd just like to thank you for listening and for your continued interest in Prudential. I also want to take a moment to thank all our employees for the steps they continue to take to support our business, our customers and our community, including our collective efforts to address racial equity at Prudential and in society at large. We continue to make progress on executing our initiatives for the year, and frankly, are working to do more even as the global health pandemic continues. Backed by our financial strength and guided by our purpose, we'll continue to focus on delivering meaningful outcomes and value to all our stakeholders. Thanks again for joining us today. We appreciate it.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Charlie Lowrey",
            "content": "Thank you, Darin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll start by saying we hope that you, your families and colleagues remain safe and healthy during these extraordinary times. The events of the past several months have created unforeseen new difficulties for people around the world, while further exposing the deep-seated problem of an equity in our society. It's in times like these that we believe our company's purpose of solving the financial challenges of our changing world and standing by our employees, customers and communities is most important. After transitioning over 95% of our US employees and most of our international employees to remote work in March, we continue to seamlessly serve customers, while the vast majority of our employees around the world continue to work in that fashion. This allows us to exercise utmost caution as we evaluate how and when to return to the workplace. In the meantime, I am so proud of our people and how they've continued to focus on meeting the evolving needs of our customers, many of whom face new challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impact. We'll continue to innovate the ways we serve our customers during and after the pandemic. During the second quarter, we maintained a clear focus on executing against our 2020 initiative, despite the challenging macroeconomic backdrop. By delivering on progress on our cost savings targets, aggressively repricing and pivoting products to mitigate the impact of low rates on our performance and rotating our international earnings mix. We're also focused on identifying opportunities for further action, particularly as we look to continue to reduce our sensitivity to market. And we're exploring the potential to generate additional cost savings on top our existing 2020 targets. Throughout this period, we benefited from the strength of our rock-solid balance sheet, which gives us the confidence and the flexibility to navigate changes to the economic environment. I'll touch on each of these points in greater detail before turning it over to Rob and Ken for a look at our second quarter results. Turning now to our 2020 priorities on slide three. We remain on track to achieve our $143 million cost savings target for the whole years, and have achieved $75 million in savings year-to-date, with $45 million in the second quarter. We also continued to make progress in shifting our international earnings mix to higher growth markets. We remained on track to close on the sale of Prudential of Korea in the second half of 2020, and are advancing our review of strategic options for Prudential of Taiwan, which may include a sale. As I mentioned earlier, we are aggressively modifying our product mix, while exercising a highly disciplined approach to pricing in this low interest rate environment. Turning to slide four. While we are encouraged by the progress we're making to position our businesses and operations for the future, we continue to look at ways to work smarter and more efficiently in order to achieve cost savings on top of our target of $500 million by 2022. This includes using technology and automation, and leveraging the learnings from operating in a remote work environment to optimize how and where we work. In addition, we are looking at other ways to build upon our repricing and product shift to further mitigate the impact of market sensitivity. On slide five, we note how we're embarking on these initiatives, with the foundational strength provided by our balance sheet and robust capital position, including highly liquid assets of $4.5 billion at the end of the second quarter. Prudential Financial and its subsidiaries continue to exceed AA financial strength rating. Our second quarter assumption update had a modest effect on our financial results, even as we reduced our US long term interest rate by 50 basis points to 3.4%. Lastly, we anticipate receiving the US$1.7 billion of proceeds from sales Korea, our Korea business by the end of the year. In terms of capital deployment plans, we'll continue to monitor developments in the credit markets and the economy to determine our strategy. Slide six shows our second quarter financial results. This quarter exemplified the benefits of our thoughtful approach to risk management and our complementary business mix. We aim to balance mortality and longevity risk, so we don't have a one-sided exposure. In the quarter, we had net favorable underwriting experience. Our adjusted operating income was $931 million in the quarter. While we recorded a net GAAP loss, driven primarily by the non-cash effect of non-economic market impacts, which have no effect on our regulatory capital position. Our US businesses reported adjusted operating income of $455 million, due to more favorable underwriting, offset by the unfavorable impact of the assumption update and lower fee and spread income. PGIM reported record adjusted operating income of $324 million, as well as record assets under management of $1.4 trillion, a 9% increase from the year earlier period. This growth reflected strong flows into fixed income, as well as market appreciation. Our International businesses reported adjusted operating income of $693 million, as more favorable underwriting, higher earnings from joint ventures and business growth were offset by the unfavorable impact of the assumption update and lower spread income and higher expenses. Before turning it over to Rob, I'd like to address the recent disturbing incidence of racial injustice and how we as an organization, are responding to the deep-seated and persistent problem of racism and inequity in society. Last month, we announced commitments to advance racial equity, as highlighted on slide seven. These commitments were borne out of the courageous candor of our employees, who have shared their experiences and their expectations, and the listening that is taking place all across Prudential. Taking a bottom-up approach, we developed concrete and measurable actions spanning our talent practices to how we design and deliver products, to the investments we make and how we foster social and racial equity in the communities where we work and do business. We already had a substantive set of programs underway and a body of work that reflects our long-standing commitment to racial equity, including investing over $1 billion in our hometown of Newark. We recognized that this moment calls for us to amplify what Prudential has already been doing to drive change within our company and within society. It is a moral and it is a business imperative that aligns directly with our company's purpose to solve the financial challenges of our changing world, as well as our multi-stakeholder commitments to employees, customers, shareholders and society. We stand by the promises we make, and we are prepared to be judged for our actions to support our colleagues, customers and communities today and over the long term. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob. Elyse, it's Charlie. I'll take that one. So as you know, we paused our share repurchases in the second quarter, in line with the risk framework that we had in place. And as you said, until we get better visibility into the depth and the duration of the pandemic, the possible recession and the credit cycle, we will maintain our financial flexibility and resiliency. When we get the clarity into those issues I just mentioned, we'll then share the timing of our plan to resume share buybacks and by how much, and that would also include the proceeds from the sale or potential sale of the Korean business. So we're going to focus on maintaining our financial strength. But when we get clarity into the issues going forward, we will certainly let you know, and we'll be transparent about it. Yes. Thanks, Rob. So, Ryan let me just try and connect some dots. Because over the past 18 months, as Rob said, we've taken actions to begin to accomplish many of the objectives that Rob articulated, namely, lower market sensitivity, lower capital intensity of our business mix becoming more competitive in terms of serving our customers with processes, better processes and lower costs. And then finally, as Rob said, increasing growth, right? And so let me just tick through a number of things that we've done in order to achieve those objectives. We're sold or selling out of lower growth businesses, Italy, Poland, Korea and exploring options for Taiwan. We acquired assurance around which we have high conviction about growth in a business that isn't as market sensitive, so lower risk. We've significantly reduced or stopped selling certainly highly interest rate-sensitive products and annuities and IOI [ph]. We introduced less market-sensitive products such as the buffered annuity. We repriced almost our entire product line. We announced and are executing on our future work initiative, which will produce $500 million in cost savings with the potential to do more. And as Rob said, we're currently exploring other options on book to business that are market sensitive. So we're executing on a series of incremental changes that we believe will lead to fundamental change in our business mix and ultimately, the trajectory of the firm as we go forward. So that's a foundation off of which we are going to grow going forward. Yes, Humphrey we can hear you. Andy, you cut out for one sec. Do you want to repeat the point you were making about? I don't know that it was well heard on the number of passive large mandate passive funds. So Tom, thanks for the question. I appreciate it. Let me just take a step back and then I'll answer your question directly, but - and make a comment about how we think about capital allocation and particular optimization. Because when we look across our businesses, what we're trying to both domestically and internationally is ensure we're optimizing that capital deployment. So we've mentioned in the past that we're looking at or continue to look at businesses such as IOI [ph] annuities and some of our international operations as well as LTC. You've seen us take some bold action in terms of Italy, Poland, Korea, potentially, Taiwan, et cetera. So what we're going to do is - and what we can assure you is that we will continue to look to ways to optimize capital and capital deployment to maximize outcomes for shareholders, right? Be that through significant dispositions, whatever flavor that may take, through potential share repurchases or through acquisitions. And right now, we have acknowledged - we'll continue to acknowledge that there's a high hurdle for any major acquisition given where our stock price is trading. We get that. But we're looking, as you've seen in the actions we've taken to date over the last 18 months. And I think what you'll see us do going forward is look at all our businesses in order to optimize the capital we deploy and how we do that. And that's our commitment to shareholders, and that's what we're doing. Okay. Thanks very much. So as we come to the end of the call today, I'd just like to thank you for listening and for your continued interest in Prudential. I also want to take a moment to thank all our employees for the steps they continue to take to support our business, our customers and our community, including our collective efforts to address racial equity at Prudential and in society at large.

            "name": "Ken Tanji",
            "content": "Thanks, Rob. I will begin on slide 12, which provides insight into earnings for the third quarter relative to our second quarter results. The key point is that our underlying earnings power increased slightly from last quarter, primarily reflecting higher equity markets. To help you see this, I'll start with pretax adjusted operating income in the second quarter, which was $931 million and resulted in earnings per share of $1.85 on an after-tax basis. Then, we adjust for the following items. First, the annual review of assumptions and other refinements resulted in a net charge of $334 million in the second quarter, primarily driven by a reduction of our long-term interest rate assumption by 50 basis points in the US. Next, we adjusted variable income to a normalized level, which is worth $130 million. Please note that while we have not included an adjustment for variable investment income for the third quarter, the potential exists for continued revaluation of private equity and real estate investments due to the current adverse economic conditions. While returns of our alternative investment portfolio are currently lower than our target returns, and will vary period-to-period, over time, this portfolio has generated income above our target returns. Third, we adjusted underwriting experience by $155 million. This reflects $100 million of favorable experience in the second quarter, primarily driven by reserve gains in retirement. We estimate claims experience in the third quarter will include $55 million for COVID-19. Next, there are other items that combined may be $75 million more favorable in the third quarter, primarily related to expenses and markets. We expect expenses, including implementation costs to be $130 million lower in the third quarter, this is primarily due to legal expenses in the second quarter. In addition, due to favorable markets in the second quarter, other related revenues in PGIM benefited by $45 million. And in [indiscernible] income in our Gibraltar segment also benefited by $25 million. We expect operating cost due to COVID-19 to be $25 million in the third quarter. And last, we anticipate net investment income will be reduced by $15 million, reflecting the difference between new money rates and disposition yields of our investment portfolio. These items combined get us to a baseline of $2.63 per share for the third quarter. Please note that this baseline includes items specific to the third quarter that reduced EPS by approximately $0.19 per share. While we have provided these items to consider, to meet [ph] the other factors that affect earnings per share in the third quarter. On Slide 13, we provided an update on the potential impact of the pandemic. We have included a sensitivity for operating income based on the US population experiencing 100,000 of incremental deaths due to the pandemic. We estimate that this may lower operating income by $70 million. And this is less than the sensitivity we provided on our last earnings call, as we have seen a lower fatality rate due to COVID-19 in our US insurance businesses than previously estimated. Our third quarter baseline includes a net impact for mortality due to COVID-19 of approximately $55 million. The actual impact will depend on a variety of factors, such as infection and fatality rates, geographic considerations and progress in testing and medical treatments. We have also reduced our estimate for incremental operating costs due to COVID-19 and have estimated the potential reduction in other operating costs, such as for travel and entertainment. In the second half of 2020, we expect to incur incremental operating costs of $60 million due to COVID-19, with $40 million in the third quarter and $20 million in the fourth quarter. The estimate of these costs is lower than what we provided on our last call, primarily due to lower health benefit costs of our US employees and lower cost to support our sales professionals in Japan, as their productivity is improving faster than previously estimated. We also expect to have $30 million of lower travel and entertainment expenses in the second half of 2020. Turning to Slide 14, we continue to maintain a robust capital position and adequate sources of funding. Our capital position exceeds our AA financial strength targets, and we maintain liquid assets at the parent company that are greater than 3 times annual fixed charges. We have substantial sources of funding. Our cash and liquid assets at the parent company were $4.5 billion at the end of the quarter. We expect to receive net proceeds of $1.7 billion from the sale of our Prudential of Korea business following the close of the transaction, which is expected in the second half of this year. And another source of funding is free cash flow from our businesses. In May, we added a new $1.5 billion contingent capital facility that combined with our previous facility, brings our total available contingent capital funding resources to $3 billion. Turning to Slide 15. And in summary, we remained on-track with our objectives for the year, as we accelerate the execution of our initiatives. We're exploring the potential to increase our cost savings initiative and looking at additional ways to build upon our repricing and product shift to further mitigate market impacts. And we maintain a rock bound \u2013 rock-solid balance sheet with a robust capital liquidity position. Now, I'll turn it over to the operator for your questions. Hi, Elyse. This is Ken. I'll take your question about the COVID mortality into the third quarter. So we - in our second quarter, we benefited from our longevity business in the UK. Mortality in the UK came in a little bit higher than we had previously estimated, and that resulted in a gain from our UK longevity reinsurance business. While there was fatalities in the UK in the second, right now that seems to be more contained and we wouldn't expect that to continue given the current fatality rates. So we also, in our new estimate, have incorporated into to that sensitivity, what we learned from the second quarter, which is in our - also in our life insurance and group insurance businesses, the fatality rates were lower than we previously estimated. So we've incorporated that into our new estimate. Jimmy, it's Ken. In terms of our long-term rate assumption, we followed a very established process that we've had for a number of years, and it considers multiple perspectives. So we look at, again, long-term interest rate forecast of economists, banks and managers. And we look to be at the median of all those. And for this year, when we looked at that, that meant a 10-year U.S. treasury rate in the long-term of 3.25% and 1% for the JGB in Japan. So we followed the same process we've had for a number of years. It's also important to know how we grade into that long-term assumption. We do that over 10 years, and the first two years follows the forward curve. And as a result, it's not just the long-term assumption, but the path of which we get there. And so over the next five years, our average rate would be 1.25%. In 10 years, it's about 1.9%. And so again, we have a pretty established process. We look at third-party inputs, and look to be at the median, and that was and that was the result for this year. We saw a little bit elevated mortality in our policies that are already on claim, policies that are already on claim, but it was but it was fairly modest, and I wouldn't call significant. Hi. This is Ken. We've - I just a little bit of backdrop on this for us. We've managed our VA business with a very robust economic view and active hedging for many years. We're very supportive of a statutory framework that also is based on robust economic scenarios, both in terms of the long-term assumptions, but also the dispersion around those assumptions.

So retail flows are really a result of three things, very strong investment management performance, a broad and wide product portfolio and strong distribution. And we're performing well on all of those fronts. Our investment performance in the second quarter was very strong. All of our PGIM fixed income strategies outperformed benchmark. 96% of our equity - Genesis equities outperformed benchmark, so very, very strong fundamental performance. As you know, we've been building out our global distribution over time. So we were actually quite pleased with our flows in the quarter. We were the number one mutual fund family year-to-date, and had $9.5 billion in positive retail flows. We did have the $4.5 billion index passive flow related to QMA. That was a very low mandate.

But over the long run, our fundamental investment performance, the strength of our distribution, we have had strong organic flows over the last five years, and we expect that to continue as we look forward over the next several years. Sorry about that. All I mentioned was the $4.5 billion outflow was the last large passive mandate that we have in our portfolio."

            "content": "Thank you, Charlie. And I want to reemphasize your comment about our commitment as a management team to supporting racial equity. This is an issue that is aligned to our purpose, it's part of the fabric of our culture and critical to our success as an organization. I'll now provide an update on how we are executing on our strategy within our US, PGIM and International businesses, as well as on the outlook for these businesses, and we'll also provide an update on our investment portfolio. Turning to slide eight. Our US businesses produced a diversified source of earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income. We continue to execute on three key priorities. First, we've implemented pricing and product actions to simplify and derisk our business mix, while protecting profitability. For example, we took aggressive pricing actions aligned with intention to significantly reduce sales of HDI, our legacy flagship VA product and launched FlexGuard, our buffered annuity product, which has been well received by the market, supporting our product mix shift to less sensitive, less interest sensitive solutions. And in our Individual Life business, we suspended sales of our single life guaranteed universal life product in July. This will result in the continued shift to variable life and other less interest rate-sensitive products. We will continue to take product and pricing actions, including steps to diversify our mix of business, to maintain profitability in this interest rate environment. As a result, we expect individual annuities and individual life sales to continue to move lower in the near term. Second, as the needs of our customers rapidly evolve, including in response to COVID-19 and its economic impact, we are increasingly leveraging technology to enhance customer engagement and efficiency. For example, we've expanded our process to electronically deliver policies from application submission to policy issuance, and have increased the use of our fast-track automated underwriting process. And we have expanded the use of electronic signatures and self-service customer capabilities across our businesses. And third, we remain committed to expanding our addressable market. The pandemic has amplified the financial wellness challenges that many US households face, and has highlighted the importance of our financial wellness platform and our life insurance, retirement, and financial planning solutions. We also continue to see increasing interest in our Assurance IQ platform from customers in the healthcare, life and P&C lines of business. In preparation for the Medicare annual enrollment period in the fourth quarter, we've been progressing well with our agent onboarding and training process. Now turning to slide nine. PGIM is a top 10 global investment manager that continues to demonstrate the strength and resilience of its multi-manager business model. Our assets under management reached a record level of $1.4 trillion, up 9% from the year ago quarter, driven by net flows, as well as the positive impact from equity and credit markets. PGIM's long-term investment performance remains strong and has rebounded from the temporary downturn in the first quarter, more than 85% of assets under management have outperformed their benchmarks over the last three, five- and 10-year periods. This strong investment performance, coupled with diversified investment capabilities across asset classes, regions, and client segments, has led to continued growth. We generated nearly $4 billion of net third-party flows during the second quarter, driven by record retail flows of $9 billion. Institutional outflows were driven by a single passive equity client redemption. Our public fixed income platform generated flows of $10 billion, as it continues to benefit from our broad suite of strategies and the leading position of our franchise. And PGIM investments was the number one ranked US mutual fund franchise across active and passive asset managers based on net year-to-date sales. PGIM's asset management fees were up 3% compared to the year ago quarter, driven by the growth in average assets under management. In addition, other related revenues increased primarily due to higher strategic investment earnings as a result of strong investment performance and the effect of credit spreads tightening, reversing the widening that had occurred in the first quarter. We also continue to focus on cost discipline to fund growth and further increase our operating leverage. Turning to slide 10. Our international businesses, including our Japanese life insurance operation, where we have a differentiated multichannel distribution model, as well as other operations focused on high growth markets. As expected, Life planner sales decreased 30% compared to the year ago quarter, primarily reflecting lower sales in Japan due to COVID-19-related restrictions on sales activities. Life planner headcount, however, increased 5% compared to a year ago. Similar to Life planner, sales for Gibraltar were 34% lower, but the number of life consultants has declined as we continue to focus on quality distribution. In Chile, market returns in the quarter were higher than average and that contributed to an operating income benefit of approximately $25 million, reversing the impact we experienced in the first quarter. With respect to expenses across international, we provided appropriate sales support to protect and care for our captive distribution, as we noted last quarter. This contributed $55 million to expenses, which we expect to trend lower in the second half of the year. We have seen some recovery in Japan sales beginning in June as the state of emergency was lifted, and over time, we expect sales to normalize. In addition, to mitigate the impacts of reduced face-to-face sales, our agents have adapted to increased usage of virtual tools to connect with customers, and we have seen early signs of success. We believe that our needs-based selling approach and death protection product focus continue to provide important value to our customers. With respect to interest rates, we've successfully managed through decades of low interest rates and other market challenges in Japan. As you have seen us do in the past, we adjust our product offering quickly to meet the needs and preferences of our customers, while also achieving our return expectations. We have already taken actions and will continue to do so as needed as we move forward. Now turning to slide 11. We have a conservative, quality-focused investment portfolio that reflects our robust asset liability management practices, commitment to broad diversification and a disciplined interest rate risk management framework. We also leveraged PGIM's expertise across multiple asset classes, including its deep and long-standing experience in private placements and real estate. Year-to-date credit migration and losses have trended below our expectations. For the second quarter credit losses were $139 million, driven by energy and consumer cyclical sectors. While we expect credit losses to be a multiple quarter story, we feel comfortable that our exposure is manageable and that we are well capitalized to weather whatever emerges. And with that, I'll hand it over to Ken. Ryan, it's Rob. I'll take a shot at that. First, let me just bring it up a level and say, as we sort of think about our strategy on a go-forward basis, we think about the elements of that is, in the first instance, simplifying and derisking the business as we articulated in our opening remarks, The other components of that are about improving near-term earnings through the efficiency initiatives that we've talked about and which we think has some expansion opportunity associated with them And then obviously, continue to expand our addressable market in order to support longer-term growth. Specifically with regard to the derisking, I would characterize the repricing and product shifts that we've done as sort of the first steps transitioning to lower volatility, less interest rate and general market sensitivity across our businesses. For those products that we've either stepped back from or actually explicitly discontinued. So think about that as being HDI in the variable annuities business and guaranteed universal life in the life business. We'll look actively at opportunities to optimize the economics of the legacy blocks that are associated with those products. And those options range anywhere from simply sort of just running off the blocks to reinsuring indoor \u2013 looking at selling the blocks. A couple of other things outside of that across our products, we're actually looking actively at product design, as well as individual and aggregate limits that could reduce the amount of potential volatility that we get from any individual products or grouping of products. So you saw us significantly reduced the retention limits that we have within our individual life business, by way of example. Charlie hit on financial flexibility and resiliency, so we're going to retain our capital in order to make sure that we that in place. And we think that, that's an element of the derisking, at least in the near term. We're also looking at the investment portfolio, and looking at strategic asset allocation, re-optimizing sort of the risk return and volatility trade-offs that are associated with our equity, our credit and our interest rate exposures, in light of where we are in the cycle and the opportunities that are in front of us. And I guess the last thing I'd mention is that as we look at the growth of the business, on a go-forward basis, our strategic emphasis is really on growing the elements of our business that are less rate-sensitive and more predictable and more capital like, for instance, peach of our asset management business. So those would be the primary things that we're thinking about from a derisking standpoint. Charlie, I don't know if there's any further color you'd want to add on to that? Humphrey, it's Rob. I'll take a shot at that. You cut out a little bit, but I think I understood your question. So as we have been in the course of executing on the efficiency initiatives that we had articulated earlier in the year - earlier last year. We've actually accelerated those actions. And in the course of doing so, we've actually institutionalized continuous transformation capability. And as a result of that, we're generating new ideas and strategies for further efficiencies that enhance customer experiences. Remember, that's sort of the first priority of that is they enable our businesses, putting us in more competitive positions, and it increases our operating profits, particularly in light of the \u2013 which is needed in particular in light of the impact of earnings of a low rate environment. The levers we're using Humphrey are pretty much the things that we've done to date. So increased use of technology and automation, process improvements, sourcing, org design, all the things that are classic. We just think there's - as a result of this continuous process, much further that we can go from \u2013 than what we've articulated to date. We're also contemplating learnings from the crisis and some of the implications of the pandemic and our experience in that on things like remote work, changes in communications and travel and use of technology on a go-forward basis. So all of that leads us to be optimistic that we can expand materially from where we are today. But we're not ready to quantify that. We'll provide more guidance on that when we get further into year. And once we finished our work, we'll \u2013 as Charlie indicated, will be transparent. John, it's Rob. Yes, to date, our - we've received forbearance requests that are about 8% or so of the portfolio. We provided forbearance and 6% of those instances and the remaining 2% are under review, and that excludes a little bit that we've gotten requests on that were declined. but in that, only about 1% of the requests resulted in a deferral of interest. In all other instances, we remain current on interest and they've been deferrals of principal. Recall that across our portfolio, our loan to values are actually quite low. And so as a result of that, when we defer principal, we're actually not particularly concerned about that because we know that the principal amount is actually quite safe. The average loan-to-value across our entire portfolio, based on our internal appraisals is 56-ish percent, using external appraisals, it will be about 10 points lower than that, so less than 50%. And so given that low LTV, accommodations on amortization of principal or repayment or principal, we believe there's a prudent thing to be doing, and if we can remain card on interest, that keeps the loans performing, and that's been sort of our experience to date."

            "name": "Scott Sleyster",
            "content": "Why don't I go ahead and take that, Tom? This is Scott. I think the answer is multifaceted, but maybe I'll speak first to the question on have we seen a sales recovery. We actually started to see a pretty good bounce back June, to the point where we were starting to get close to even to 2019 sales in both Japan and in Brazil. And that has continued and actually modestly strengthened in the month of July. So we are seeing a pretty good sales recovery, and we're encouraged. But of course, that is -- that has to be that has to be tempered by any kind of resurgence that could occur. In the case of the Life Planner, we were actually able to take what was an initial subsidy that was sort of an uncharacteristic payment that we have, and we were able to roll it into their bonusable plan. So a portion of the amount that we have for POJ is actually being deferred into their sales comp. So you're not seeing it as directly, but it's still there. Hi, Suneet. This is Scott again, I'll go ahead and take that. I guess I'd talk a little bit about capital rotation mixed in with that question. We were seeing low growth in the developed markets in Korea, Taiwan and Japan. And you saw that we took out actions in Korea and we're considering those in Taiwan. And the reason that you see a difference between those businesses in Japan is that we have really strong market share in Japan, and we have a really high-performing LP model there. The business generates attractive returns over our cost of capital and it generates a lot of free cash flow to the parent. So we really like our Japan operation, and we continue to invest in it. That being said, overall premium growth in Japan is been negative for the last several years and the country continues to face demographic challenges. So the fact that we've been able to continue to grow in POJ has been a significant outperformance in the country. So I guess what I would say is, we expect kind of low single-digit growth in Japan. And if we're achieving that, that's actually very strong relative performance. And then in the context of a business system that's creating a lot of value and cash to the parent. In the meantime, we'll look for redeployment in higher-growth markets, but those are going to have to be opportunistic."

Also, due to circumstances created by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have decided to cancel our Tokyo Investor Day that was scheduled for September. With that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Charlie.\nCharlie Lowrey: Thank you, Darin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I would like to start this morning by recognizing the extraordinary circumstances created by the COVID-19 pandemic and by expressing our gratitude to all of those on the front lines who are fighting this crisis around the world. For those individuals and their families directly affected by the pandemic and particularly those who have lost loved ones, we extend our deepest sympathies. At Prudential, we're guided by our purpose: to make lives better by solving the financial challenges of our changing world and that includes being there for our employees, our customers and our communities, especially in times like these. We are completely focused on ensuring that we take the right course of action for the business, mitigating the impact of COVID-19, while investing for the future in order to emerge from this crisis stronger from this crisis stronger than before. The strength of our balance sheet enables us to manage our business for the long-term growth, while dealing with short-term business realities. Before we get into the first quarter performance, I'll cover some of the key steps we have taken as a company to support our employees, customers and communities in response to COVID-19. First, turning to slide 3. Ensuring the health and well-being of our employees and their families is our top priority. As the pandemic emerged, we initiated new policies and actions to ensure their safety and security, including additional family care support. This included implementing a wide-scale remote work environment, with approximately 98% of our employees and most of our international employees not working remotely. I\u2019m pleased to report that all our businesses and operational functions continue to run smoothly. Prioritizing the well-being of our employees enables us to address the evolving health and financial needs of our customers as the pandemic and its economic impact reverberate more broadly. We've also provided customers with assistance, such as premium deferrals and fee waivers as well as enhanced digital tools. I'm also incredibly proud of the work our employees have done to support our local communities, including in Newark, El Paso, Hartford and multiple international locations. These efforts include the donation of more than 150,000 face masks, including 75,000 N95 respirators for health care workers in New Jersey. In addition, the American Nurses Association and Prudential recently entered into an agreement for Prudential to sponsor ANA events and outreach initiatives in 2020. This agreement will include offering Prudential's financial wellness services and solutions to ANA members and the broader nursing community. We're pleased to be of assistance to those serving on the front lines of this pandemic. Turning to our financial strength. On Slide 4, our rock-solid balance sheet provides the foundation for our employees to serve our customers and our communities. We're confident in our ability to successfully manage in this environment in large part due to the robust, operational and financial risk framework that we put into place after the Great Recession of 2008. This framework prepared us with a playbook to address multiple stress scenarios, including pandemics and economic conditions that are more severe than what we are currently experiencing. In addition, we benefit from our recurring revenue model and mix of complementary businesses, which offset risk and produce capital benefits, giving us confidence about Prudential to navigate the current environment. We began 2020 with a strong capital and liquidity position, and our capital ended the quarter exceeding AA financial strength levels. As the pandemic unfolded and in light of uncertainty in the in the global markets, we executed our playbook. We successfully issued $1.5 billion of senior debt in early March, while spreads were still attractive. This included a $500 million green bond issuance, the first of its kind for a U.S. company in our sector. These actions pre-funded our opportunities through the end of 2021 and enhance the liquidity of our businesses. As part of the playbook, we further enhanced liquidity of our businesses and also paused share repurchases at the end of the first quarter to see how the economic environment develops. During the quarter, our variable annuity hedging performed extremely well with a 99% effective rate. Our approach to hedging the economic risk resulted in significant gains on our equity market and interest rate hedges to offset the increased liability. We feel comfortable about our ability to manage equity market fluctuations and continued low interest rates over time. We're also highly confident about the quality of our investment portfolio, which Rob will cover in more detail shortly. The strength of our financial position means our dividends to shareholders remain well covered by our income and free cash flow. Turning to Slide 5. We are on track to accomplish our strategic initiatives for the year and, in fact, are accelerating their execution in some cases. First, we are repricing our products more quickly and pivoting towards lower risk and less capital-intensive products. Second, with respect to rotating our international earnings mix to higher-growth markets, in April, we reached an agreement to sell our Prudential of Korea business. We also continue to pursue strategic alternatives for our Taiwan business. Finally, we continue to make progress on achieving our goal of $500 million in cost savings, $140 million of which should be achieved this year. We realized $30 million in the first quarter through actions we completed before the start of 2020. Turning to slide 6. While it seems like a light time ago, I'd like to spend a moment on our first quarter performance. We reported pre-tax adjusted operating income of $1.2 billion or $2.32 per share. The GAAP net loss was $0.70 per share, driven largely by non-economic factors. Our U.S. and international business earned lower variable investment income in the quarter. We also generated lower underwriting income in our U.S. businesses. Higher asset management fees at PGIM were offset by lower other related revenues. While the severity and duration of the pandemic and related economic impact remains unknown, we are confident about the strength of our company. Prudential has survived pandemics, wars, recessions and the depression, among other events in its 145-year history. We are resilient, we are strong and we will continue to move forward to deliver sustainable value for all our stakeholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob for a detailed look at our business performance for the quarter.\nRob Falzon: Thank you, Charlie. As Charlie indicated, the results from our businesses in the first quarter were negatively impacted by two significant factors that we had not anticipated: adverse mortality and the impact of the pandemic, particularly on equity markets, interest rates and credit spreads. Adverse market conditions resulted in $150 million of lower variable investment income in our U.S. and international businesses and also reduced other related revenues in PGIM by $55 million, and the Chilean and Kaha earnings in our international business by $30 million. Overall mortality was $60 million above our seasonal expectation. We are continuing to work toward improving the profitability of our individual life business. We have strong life insurance, marketing and distribution capabilities, which we've expanded with the acquisition of Assurance IQ. In aggregate, these factors reduced first quarter's adjusted operating income by about $295 million or $0.58 a share. Lower interest rates and equity markets also challenged fundamentals across our businesses, and we are actively executing pricing and product actions to shift our business mix to less market-sensitive customer solutions. With that in mind, I'll turn now to providing more color on how we are executing on our strategy within our U.S., PGIM and international businesses as well as on the outlook for these businesses considering current market conditions. I will also provide an overview of our investment portfolio, given the increased focus on the risks associated with the potential near-term credit cycle. Turning to slide 7. Our U.S. businesses consist of the workplace solutions, individual solutions and Assurance IQ division that produce a diversified source of earnings from fees, investment spread and underwriting income. Our U.S. businesses continue to execute on three key priorities. First and foremost, the financial strength of these businesses, which continues to be solid despite the impacts of COVID-19 and the broader economic conditions. Continue to take product actions, including steps to diversify our mix of business and maintain profitability. Second, as the needs of our customers rapidly evolve, including in response to COVID-19 and its economic impact, we are leveraging our ongoing technology transformation and digital capabilities to enhance customer engagement. For example, within a matter of days in March, we introduced our fast track automated underwriting process for COVID-19 related claims with expanded e-capabilities for proof of death. Just weekend, we introduced new mobile apps and chat bots to help manage a surge in customer calls and inquiries. And we have expanded the use of electronic signatures across our businesses. We will continue to invest in transforming our capabilities by accelerating use of technology to deliver a better customer experience and enhance the speed at which we operate. And third, we remain committed to expanding our addressable market. The pandemic has amplified the financial wellness challenges that many US households face. To support our clients in these challenging times, we continue to invest in and expand our range of capabilities to meet their needs. For example, we completely transformed our flagship financial wellness offering pathways from an on-site to a virtual offering. In a matter of just weeks, we scheduled over 150 live web-based financial education seminars for our clients. And we introduced a new solution to help customers managed debt in partnership with GreenPath. We're also shifting our focus to serving an expanded addressable market with lower risk and less market sensitive solutions to address the changing market conditions. For example, in our individual annuities business, we're pivoting to less interest rate sensitive products, including accelerating to May of this year for launch of our FlexGuard indexed annuity. In our individual life business, we're also making product and pricing changes that will result in the continued pivot to variable life and other less interest rate-sensitive products. As a result of pricing actions, product pivots and the disruptions from COVID-19, we expect sales to continue to decline for individual annuities in the near term, and we also expect reduced sales for individual life. In our retirement business, while the longevity reinsurance market remains active, we expect that current market conditions will impact the funding levels of pension plans and, therefore, result in lower pension risk transfer transactions. Now turning to slide 8. PGIM is a top 10 global investment manager with $1.3 trillion of assets under management and continues to leverage its diversified multi-manager model to serve investors. Our robust infrastructure and investments in technology have allowed employees to seamlessly transition to working from home. This operational flexibility has allowed us to support clients with portfolio information and insights and address their questions even as we work in a virtual environment. While significant market fluctuations in the month of March affected our three-year performance, PGIM's long-term track record remains strong. 79% of assets under management have outperformed their benchmarks over the last five years and 94% over the last 10 years, and we have seen some recovery of performance and our short-term track record in April. Despite clients temporarily rebalancing into cash, we generated $2.9 billion of net third party flows during the first quarter. This reflects the resiliency of PGIM's diversified platform across asset classes, regions and client segments. Net flows included $4.2 billion of institutional inflows, partially offset by $1.3 billion of retail outflows. Fixed income experienced both retail and institutional inflows, and of note PGIM was the highest ranking US mutual fund franchise across active and passive asset managers based on net sales in the quarter. PGIM's asset management fees were up 8% compared to the year ago quarter driven by growth in average assets under management and a stable fee rate. Other related revenues decline primarily due to the effect of mark-to-market losses from credit spread widening in the first quarter. We expect near-term sales across the industry to be impacted by volatile public market conditions, reduced transaction volume in private asset classes and a slowdown in client activity. Despite this, we expect PGIM to emerge well-positioned vis-\u00e0-vis our competitors, driven by its diversified global platform. Turning to slide 9. Our international businesses include our Japanese life insurance operation, where we have a differentiated multichannel distribution model as well as other operations focused on high-growth markets. Life planner sales decreased 5% compared to the year ago quarter, driven by lower corporate product sales following the Japan tax law change, partially offset by replacement U.S. dollar protection products. Life planner headcount, however, reached a record level, increasing 5% compared to a year ago. Sales for Gibraltar were also 5% lower, primarily reflecting the continued trend of lower single-pay U.S. dollar fixed annuity sales in our life consultant and independent agency channels. In addition, as we continue to focus on quality distribution, the number of life consultants has declined. In Chile, we are the leading pension provider via our joint venture with Habitat. We earn fees on assets and realized mark-to-market gains or losses on the capital that we are required to invest in the funds. Our investment performance has outperformed over time as well as in the fourth quarter -- in the first quarter. Returns in the quarter, however, were down across the industry, and that contributed to approximately $30 million of lower than expected operating income.  As we look to the second quarter, we expect international sales to decrease significantly, reflecting the effect of social distancing protocols that limit in-person engagement with customers across our distribution channels. This will also affect recruiting of new life planners and life consultants. We're actively taking measures, including appropriate sales support to protect and care for our captive distribution during this difficult time. Over the longer term, we believe COVID-19 may result in heightened interest in Protection products, particularly the death protection products throughout the core of our needs-based selling approach. With respect to the current interest rate environment, we have successfully managed through decades of low interest rates and other market challenges in Japan. As you've seen in the past, we adjust to meet the needs and preferences of our customers while also achieving our return expectation. We have already taken actions and will continue to do so as needed as we moved forward. Also, as Charlie stated, in April, we announced that we have entered into a definitive agreement to sell Prudential of Korea. This business represented less than 10% of international business sales. Now turning to our investment portfolio on slide 10. We have a conservative, quality focused approach to our investment portfolio, construction and management reflects our robust asset liability management practices, commitment to broad diversification and a disciplined interest rate risk management framework. We also leverage PGIM's expertise across multiple asset classes, including its deep and long-standing experience in private placements and real estate. With respect to our investment portfolio, here are a few key points. We have a high allocation to government securities, which is primarily comprised of U.S. treasuries and Japanese government bonds. About half of our BBB and below rated corporate securities are private placements with financial covenants and structural protections that have consistently resulted in lower losses than comparable public securities. In past cycles, the loss experience of our BBB private placements has been comparable to A public credits or about half the losses of similarly rated BBB public credits. Our commercial mortgage loans are well-protected with a loan-to-value on the entire portfolio of 56% and debt service coverages in excess of 2.4 times. We are overweight in more defensive sectors, such as industrial and multifamily and underweight in both office and retail. We also have a low exposure in our investment portfolio to currently more vulnerable sectors like energy, retail and other at-risk corporates. Quality of our portfolio as demonstrated by its performance during the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, where our credit loss experience compared favorably to peers. Since then, we have decreased our exposure to structured securities and BBB corporates and increased our holdings of government bonds and single A and above rated corporates. From 2008 through the first quarter of 2020, we our annual fixed maturity credit losses averaged just 13 basis points of our portfolio. Slide 23 in the appendix provides more detail on our investment portfolio to exposures currently in focus. While we expect credit losses to emerge, the main takeaway is that we feel comfortable that our exposure is quite manageable and that we are well capitalized to absorb such losses. Turning to slide 11, to help you assess potential credit losses on our investment portfolio over a three- year recession cycle, we provide a framework using publicly available rating agency and other third-party data for the underlying assumptions. This framework provides potential impairments defaults and ratings migration. The output suggests impact to PICA's RBC ratio and the solvency margin ratios in Japan would be very manageable and consistent with our expectations. Credit losses on an after-tax basis would total approximately $2.4 billion over a 3- year period. To put that into perspective, that will be less than 1 year of our free cash flow. Also, if we used experiences from the prior recession in 2008 as the underlying assumptions for this framework, the after-tax credit losses will be much smaller at about $1.6 billion. And with that, I'll hand it over to Ken.\nKen Tanji: Thanks, Rob. I will begin on slide 12, which provides insight into earnings for the second quarter of 2020 relative to our first quarter results. We began with pretax adjusted operating income in the first quarter, which was $1.2 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $2.32 on an after-tax basis. Then we adjust for the following items: First, we expect variable investment income in the second quarter to be $150 million lower than in the first quarter. This is primarily driven by lower returns from private equity investments resulting from the decline in values in the first quarter, reported on a one quarter lag in the second quarter. Second, next, in the second quarter, we will have lower seasonal expenses, partially offset by higher implementation costs, which will result in a net benefit of $50 million. Third, there are other items that combined may be $45 million more favorable in the second quarter relative to the first quarter. This includes the normalization of PGIM's other related revenues in our Chilean joint venture income, which were lower in the first quarter due to the mark-to-market of assets for equity markets and credit spreads. This normalization is partially offset by classifying our Prudential Korea business as a divested business. Fourth, we expect fees to be lower on a run rate basis in the second quarter. This reflects account values starting the second quarter at a lower point than the average level in the first quarter. Next, we included a placeholder for potential COVID-19 related claims and expenses totaling $250 million. I will provide additional details of these items on the next slide. And last, we anticipate net investment income will be reduced by $15 million, reflecting the difference between new money rates and disposition yields on our investment portfolio. These items combined get us to a baseline of $792 million of operating earnings and $1.53 per share for the second quarter. Please note that this baseline includes items specific to the second quarter that reduced EPS by approximately $1.22 per share. While we have provided these items to consider, there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the second quarter of 2020. Given the extraordinary circumstances created by COVID-19, on slide 13, we provide estimates for the potential operating earnings impact directly associated with the pandemic in 2020. As part of our risk management process, we model many potential stress scenarios, including a pandemic scenario. We have substantial reserves and highly liquid assets to ensure we are well positioned to readily satisfy all policyholder claims and continue to be well capitalized. We also benefit from the diversification of our businesses, and specifically, the complementary nature of our retirement longevity business in our mortality businesses. Although, the extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic remains uncertain, we thought it would be helpful to provide estimates for the potential impact on net mortality and costs in 2020. The estimate for the impact on net mortality assumes 100,000 deaths across the total U.S. population and 40,000 deaths across the total population in Japan. After considering the profile of our insured policyholders, we estimate the impact on earnings from net mortality may be approximately $200 million in 2020. Also, assuming the spread of COVID-19 is substantially contained in the second quarter, we estimate approximately $135 million of earnings impact may occur in the second quarter with possibly lower impact in the second half of the year. Also, as we continue to support our employees and families during this difficult time, we expect to incur additional costs, primarily related to sales support, employee health protection, technology and other expenses. In 2020, we estimate these costs will be approximately $230 million with $115 million of these costs in the second quarter. Turning to slide 14. We continue to maintain a robust capital position and adequate sources of funding. Our capital position exceeds our AA financial strength target and we maintain liquid assets at the parent company that are greater than three times annual fixed charges.  Our financial leverage ratio is at our target and our regulatory capital levels at our insurance companies remain higher than the targets. In addition, we have substantial sources of funding, our cash and liquid assets at the parent company were $5.3 billion at the end of the quarter. As previously highlighted, we expect to receive net proceeds from -- of approximately $1.7 billion from the sale of Prudential of Korea business following the close of the transaction, which is expected in the second half of 2020. And another source of funding is free cash flow from our businesses, which represents approximately 65% of earnings over time. In addition, we have readily available off-balance sheet resources. This includes a $4 billion credit facility with 23 banks and a syndicate structure across the U.S., Europe and Asia. We also have access to $1.5 billion of funding from a contingent capital facility with the right to issue debt in exchange for U.S. treasury securities held by a trust. And we have a bank -- Japan Bank facility with \u00a5100 billion available to Prudential Holdings of Japan. Turning to slide 15, and in summary, we are committed to fulfilling our purpose to make lives better by solving the financial challenges of our changing world. We maintain a rock-solid balance sheet with a robust capital and liquidity position, and we remain on track with our objectives for the year as we accelerate the execution of our initiatives. Now I'll turn it over to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Looks like our first question comes from the line of Erik Bass of Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\nErik Bass: Hi. Thank you. First, can you provide a bit more color on how you're coming up with your estimated COVID impacts and how you're thinking about the interplay between mortality and longevity exposures. And then also just to clarify on the expenses. Is that just related to COVID, or is that a net impact factoring in other things such as lower T&E expense?\nKen Tanji: Yes, hi, Eric, it's Ken. I'll take your questions. On the COVID estimates. First, I want like to recognize that these are placeholders. These are based on an estimate of 100,000 deaths in the U.S. and 40,000 deaths in Japan. Now we'll have to see how things play out. And there's likely a range of outcomes around that for the U.S. and Japan. So I just want to recognize that we've done our best to give a placeholder, but it's predicated on a number of assumptions. What we do then is we then make considerations for lower fatality rates for the insured populations versus a general population. We certainly have taken certainly have taken in consideration higher fatality rates for the older population and then we took into consideration the geography of our insured population with \u2013tend to have a little bit higher concentration in New Jersey and New York, California and Washington. So when we put that all together, we've applied those to our average profile and provided those estimates. And again, we'll likely have a good range around some of those assumptions. In terms of our retirement business, it does provide an offset to some of our life insurance as we've expected and designed. It offsets about 30% of our exposure, and that's just kind of how the modeling plays out. And then your second question was around the expenses. We've \u2013 we looked at the steps that we need to take in order to care for our employees for crisis care as well as compensation for sales professionals, particularly in international locations, if our sales were to decline. And we've estimated that is the appropriate thing to do given the situation. We will \u2013 we haven't included in that estimate, potential offsets for the fact that travel and conferences and entertainment will be lower. We would expect if things return at some point to normal that some of that might come back you know sort of rebound. But I would estimate that we are going to have savings here in the next quarter or so that you can think of that in the tens of millions, but that's not included in the estimate.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Next, we have the line of Suneet Kamath of Citi. Your line is open.\nSuneet Kamath: Thanks. I wanted to go to long-term care. Earlier this week, one of your competitors announced a regulatory review of long-term care reserves resulted in a pretty sizable increase to stat reserves. So just curious if any of your regulators are contemplating or conducting similar reviews and maybe over what time frame would we expect any resolution, if there are such reviews in place? Thanks.\nKen Tanji: Yeah. Hi, this is Ken, Suneet. Just an ordinary course, we review our reserves with our regulators. And they have not indicated any concern about our level of reserves related to long-term care, and there's no special review underway.\nOperator: Next in queue, we have the line of Tom Gallagher of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nTom Gallagher: Good morning. The $2 billion of debt that PRU issued in 1Q is, I think being counted as operating debt. So just curious why that's counted as operating debt, I think which is excluded from the leverage calculation and what your plan is with those proceeds? And then let's see the other question I had is just on the GAAP breakage you had on the variable annuity side this quarter? Was there also a similar statutory level of breakage. I realize it's uneconomic based on the accounting differences between the assets and the liabilities. But just curious, if you had a similar impact on statutory? Thanks.\nCharlie Lowrey: Yes. Hey, Tom, it's -- I'll take those. On the $2 billion of debt included the $1.5 billion that we issued at the holdco. You can think of that as we would ordinarily have issued, say, $500 million earlier in the year and $500 million towards the end of the year. But we decided to do $1.5 billion in March. We were worried about how the conditions were developing and thought it would be prudent to do $1.5 billion, which essentially will take care of any maturities in 2020 and 2021. So it's about $1 billion more than we would ordinarily have done perhaps, but we thought it was an appropriate thing to do. In terms of why we call it operating debt, right now, those proceeds sit at the holding company in cash. And we follow sort of the way that our rating agencies think about classifications of debt. So -- and the planned proceeds, again, we have it available at the holding company. And it would -- it's used -- it's available for paying off the debt again for this year and next year. In terms of the non-AOI item for the quarter, our variable annuity business is very well hedged. And we like to align our outcomes for GAAP us in stat economics. And as Charlie mentioned in his comments, it was highly effective at 99%. The way we hedge interest risk, again, which was highly effective in the quarter, is with both derivatives that mark-to-market and recorded in the P&L, but also by holding a 30-year U.S. treasuries, which had a $1.7 billion gain and would have offset the non-AOI item in the quarter. But the gain on the U.S. treasuries is recorded to OCI and not to the income statement. So economically, and from a stat standpoint, we were very well aligned just with a little bit of difference between where our gain is recorded for GAAP.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Ryan Krueger of KBW. Your line is open.\nRyan Krueger: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Can you help us think about \u2013 I guess interest rate sensitivity within the balance sheet, both GAAP and stat? I think previously, you provided sensitivity for 10-year rates in the 2% to 2.5% range. But given where they are today was hoping for some additional sensitivity.\nCharles Lowrey: Sure. Yeah. Maybe I'll start with stat, Ryan. And the \u2013 we have had sensitivity to our stat financials, primarily around asset adequate testing. Last year, given the decline in rates, we increased our asset adequacy testing reserve by about $0.5 billion. Now we had derivatives that offset that, so we were with a gain. So we were \u2013 had a stable RBC outcome. But it's also important to know that sort of at this level of very low interest rates, that the way the testing works is the \u2013 when rates are so low, the shock is much lower. So we'll have less sensitivity to lower rates from this point forward. From a GAAP standpoint, our sensitivity really hasn't changed. And as you know, we have a process \u2013 I'll remind people that we have a process where we look at our long-term rate assumption and that includes doing a survey of economist banks and other managers. And we also look at the implied forward curve, and we look to be at the median of all that. And that's the process that we're going through. I'd also note that, the way our interest rate assumptions work for GAAP is we start at current rates and we grade to a long-term assumption over 10 years. So as a result, our \u2013 the 10-year treasury under the next seven years is less than 3%. So we're going through our process as we typically would and that will be finalized by our risk management committees in late June. So no change in our \u2013 significant change in our GAAP sensitivity, and we'll be doing our usual process in the second quarter.\nRyan Krueger: Thank you.\nOperator: And next in queue, we have the line of Alex Scott of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nAlex Scott: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. First one, I have is just a follow-up on the stat rate sensitivity comments that you made. I just want to make sure I interpreted it correctly. I guess, as you go through your actuarial review and if the ultimate rate is set lower, does that reduce sensitivity sort of apply now? Like would we -- if it is sort of the 3% to 4% book value type impact on GAAP, would that not necessarily all translate to statutory?\nCharlie Lowrey: Again, the way asset adequacy testing works is we don't set a long-term rate. Those are prescribed by GAAP. And we're going through our -- and so it's a little bit of a different framework. And we'll also -- so we're working through that.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Next in queue, we have the line of Nigel Dally of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nNigel Dally: Great. Thank you. So, I had a question on the -- on buybacks. You spend a fair bit of time running through the strength of your current capital position? And also what appears to be quite a manageable stress scenario. Clearly a number of moving factors, but what are you looking for? What are sort of like some of the things that you're looking for to be comfortable in resuming buybacks? Should we assume that buybacks suspended through the end of the year, or potentially, could it be somewhat sooner than that? Any color there as to kind of how you're looking at that?\nCharlie Lowrey: Yes. The -- I think the primary thing we're looking at is the economic cycle. And we're seeing substantial impact given the situation that we're in. We like the quality of our investment portfolio, and we think it's manageable, but we want to see how this credit cycle emerges. So, I don't know if I can put a timeframe on that. I think time will tell.\nOperator: Next in queue, we have the line of Humphrey Lee of Dowling & Partners. Your line is open.\nHumphrey Lee: Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. My first question is related to Assurance IQ. The losses for the quarter looks a little bit larger than expected, like how should we think about those losses would trend? Should we expect for the next couple of quarters will be kind of in that $30 million range before seeing a recovery in the fourth quarter when activity started to pick up due to enrollment period?\nAndy Sullivan: Yes, Humphrey, good morning it's Andy. And thanks for your question, and I'll give kind of a little bit of a break here. So, on Assurance IQ, I would characterize the results for quarter one as modestly worse than what we expected. We have started to lean in from an investment perspective to building out the platform more broadly. And to bringing new product solutions onto the platform as we think the first-mover advantage is very, very important. As we talked about last quarter as well, we learned some lessons from a Medicare Advantage perspective and we are investing ahead of Q4 to make sure that we have the right number of agents and that they are fully and properly trained and we're ready to ready to go in the fourth quarter. So, I think you could think about performance similar in the next couple of quarters. And obviously, the large opportunity is in Medicare Advantage in Q4.\nHumphrey Lee: Got it.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Next, we have the line of John Barnidge of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nJohn Barnidge: Great. Thanks. If we were to assume the disease, a seasonal nature and returns at the very lease in 1Q 2021, could you help me dimension how many of these non-mortality and morbidity CV-19 cost would remain on a go-forward basis?\nCharlie Lowrey: Yeah. I don't think we want to try to forecast that far, which -- given the situation. Eventually, I think we will operate differently given the changes in environment and the way we're going to have to conduct business, but that's a bit out there. So I don\u2019t think we want to start to look through that far at the moment.\nJohn Barnidge: Okay. And then could you maybe provide average age on the products where you have some CV-19 exposure, please?\nAndy Sullivan: Yeah. So -- this is Andy. So, obviously, two predominant areas there are, really are individual life business and our group life business, and then obviously offsets in the longevity business that we have in retirement. So actually, an individual life and in group insurance, average age across the whole book is relatively similar in the -- about 55. And in group insurance, in particular, though, 95% of that business is under the age of 65. As far as of the longevity risk transfer business and the pension risk transfer business our average age is in 74 to 75 range.\nJohn Barnidge: Thank you.\nOperator: And next in queue is Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. My first question is on the group business. Can you just discuss your outlook for the margins within that business for the rest of the year, just given that I think COVID-19 could impact some of those businesses, or do you think that we might not see an impact there maybe until 2021?\nAndy Sullivan: Yeah. Elyse, this is Andy. So I'll take that question, and there are a number of impacts. So maybe I'll start more on the claim side of things. And we do expect, and it was in the estimates that Ken walked through. That we will see increased mortality in the book of business. Obviously, in the group business, as I just referenced, that's somewhat mitigated by the average age. But we do think that, that will go up. We also believe and have seen evidence that we'll see an uptick in short-term disability incidents. So that will serve to compress margins throughout this year. We see a couple of other impacts I just mentioned from a sales and flows perspective. Most of our book of business is medium and large size employers. So actually, most of our sales for 2020 are already baked in that business. And any slowdown we're seeing is more of a 2021 impact. I guess, the last thing I\u2019d mention is a lot of the impacts that group insurance will feel, we actually are mitigated against from the perspective that we're not in the under 100 live segment business. So we don't have exposure to the small segment employers. And, obviously, here, early days, that's where a number of the impacts have been.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay, great. And then my second question, you guys, in your prepared remarks, went through shifting the business to less interest rate-sensitive products. How do we think about the capital that you have to put forth to write some of the new business where there\u2019s less interest rate-sensitive versus some products that maybe required more capital, is there kind of capital arbitrage there some products that may be required more capital. Is there kind of a capital arbitrage there as you kind of shift your writings in this low interest rate environment?\nKen Tanji: Yes. I'll take that. The products that we are shifting towards do have less interest rate sensitivity, things like variable life things like we\u2019re looking to release a structured variable annuity. And so, they will be less capital-intensive and less interest rate sensitive. I don't think there's anything more to the dynamic than that.\nAndy Sullivan: And this is Andy. Maybe I'll just add some color commentary. So, in the individual life business, as Ken referenced, we've been shifting towards variable life. We're very pleased in Q1 that our sales were $187 million which was up 15% -- Q1 of last year and 50% of those sales were variable life. We've also in April launched a product that is much less sensitive to interest rates and equity markets tuned to the RIA channel. And our buffered annuity, we're very excited about that launch. That has become a robust market. And 60% of the volumes in that marketplace are going through independent broker-dealers, and we have very, very strong relationships there. So, we think to be very promising for us.\nOperator: Next in queue, we have a follow-up from the line of Suneet Kamath of Citi. Your line is open.\nSuneet Kamath: Yes, thanks for the follow-up. On the Individual Life business, in the past, you guys have talked about using reinsurance to either dampen down the earnings volatility or actually free capital. So, I want to get an update on that? And is that strategy still effective or still possible given all the uncertainty around COVID-19?\nAndy Sullivan: Yes Suneet, its Andy. And maybe I'll take that question up a level first. As we talked about last quarter, we are leaned into performing the overall -- to improving the overall performance of that book of business in that business. We\u2019ve three levers. First, we are very much leaned into improving the expense profile of the business. A lot of our future of work, energy and effort is aimed in that regard. And we actually saw a reduction year-over-year in our expenses on business. So, we like the progress we're seeing there. The second lever is leaning into and growing the business with profitable business that we're putting on the books. And as I mentioned, our sales are up year-over-year. And we are comfortable with the pricing and the profitability of the business that we\u2019re selling. As far as the third lever and it\u2019s the lever that you referenced, it really is looking at the ability to reinsure the block of business. We continue to explore solutions. Obviously, we\u2019re looking very carefully about what is the right economic favorability for us and if and when we take action on that, we will report out on it, but nothing to report as we sit here today.\nSuneet Kamath: I just have one quick follow-up for Ken, I guess, a follow-up to Elyse's question on capital. You cited in your prepared remarks pretty significant declines in sales, both in the U.S. as well as Japan. So, any sense of how much capital or lower strain could you guys experience relative to a normal year based on that sales decline?\nKen Tanji: Yes. So all things being equal, we would have less -- if we're selling -- when we sell business, we capitalize it well. And if we're selling less that means it's requiring less capital to support it. And so, we would expect all other things being equal that would be the case. I think it's too hard to quantify that right now \nKen Tanji>: We'll see how our sales plays out. If we have if we have opportunities to make sales in attractive business, we'll do that. If the conditions are such that either the returns aren't attractive or it's too difficult to conduct business that would lower sales and we would see some capital offset for that. So I just don't -- I think it's a little tricky to put a number on that right now.\nSuneet Kamath: Got it. Thanks.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We do have a follow-up from the line of Alex Scott of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nAlex Scott: Hi. Thanks for taking the call. I just wanted to see if you could provide an update on the mortgage loan book. And I guess, specifically the commercial mortgage loans, would be interested if you can operate anything up around like how much of it you've got forbearance requests on and what you'd expect there?\nRob Falzon: Alex, it's Rob. Let me handle that one. We haven't received forbearance request. The vast majority of that, as you would expect is coming from the hotel and mall tenants having said that to date through April in any event, we've actually granted forbearance on a little less than 3% of the portfolio. And that by and large almost entirely has been just with respect to principal amortization, the loans continue to remain current with regard to interest payments. We do expect that that will build over time to some greater amount, but having said that, we're actually quite comfortable. If you look at the loan-to-value that we have across the mortgage portfolio, it's at 56% and based on our internal appraisals. What we find is if we actually use external appraisals that drops to around 46%. So being in a position to be able to provide forbearance on principle, we don't think actually puts at risk our ability to be repaid on those loans given the relatively low amount of leverage that we have on our property, and combined with the fact that our mortgage portfolio is very concentrated in higher quality well located properties. So we're feeling quite good about the status of the mortgage portfolio, and we expect it to be resilient through this crisis as it has been in fact through all prior of our recessions. If you look at the 2008 recession and you sort of take that and you roll that forward, we've had sort of a 1 basis point loss ratio on our mortgages from that period until now. So we actually feel pretty good about the way in which we've underwritten it, and we feel very good about the way we're positioned going forward.\nA \u2013 Andy Sullivan: Alex, it's Andy. I was just going to add a point from our third-party managed fund business, very similar trends. We've to date seen low single-digit levels of forbearance. And clearly, that will rise over time, but very similar trends to what Rob covered.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Next, we do have a follow-up from Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners. Your line is open.\nHumphrey Lee: Thank you for taking my follow-up. Looking at PGIM, so other related revenue has always been a source of variability for that segment. I think this quarter, you had some spread related kind of issue hurting some of the private credit. But looking forward, like some of the strategies that you have in PGIM, whether it's real estate or private credit or some of the specialty products, they're likely to see lower activities, so how should we think about the other related revenue will trend for the balance of the year?\nA \u2013 Andy Sullivan: Yes. So Humphrey, it's Andy. So you're correct. In first quarter, the predominant impact in other related revenue was from our strategic investing portfolio. That's where we have our seed strategies as well as where we co-invest alongside of our clients. The predominant impact was in -- from credit spread widening on the fixed income portion of that portfolio. In general, if you look back, we tend to have somewhere in the neighborhood of $50 million to $60 million coming from our ORR. We do think it is reasonable as you kind of look forward over the next couple of quarters Obviously, we think flows will be lumpier in general, and we do believe that there will be some slowdown in client activity and then transactions. So there may be some near-term pressure on that. But over the long run, you could think of that in the $50 million to $60 million range.\nOperator: With no further questions here in queue, I'll be happy to turn it back to Charlie Lowrey for any closing remarks.\nCharlie Lowrey: Great. Thank you very much. We'd just like to say in closing that we'd like to take a moment to thank all our employees for the extraordinary steps they've taken to support our businesses, our customers and our communities. Together, we remain financially strong. We remain resilient, and we remain committed to fulfilling our purpose of solving financial challenges of our changing world, including doing our part to contribute to an inclusive global recovery. Thank you all for joining the call. Please stay safe, and we look forward to talking to you soon.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rob Falzon",
            "content": "Thank you, Charlie. As Charlie indicated, the results from our businesses in the first quarter were negatively impacted by two significant factors that we had not anticipated: adverse mortality and the impact of the pandemic, particularly on equity markets, interest rates and credit spreads. Adverse market conditions resulted in $150 million of lower variable investment income in our U.S. and international businesses and also reduced other related revenues in PGIM by $55 million, and the Chilean and Kaha earnings in our international business by $30 million. Overall mortality was $60 million above our seasonal expectation. We are continuing to work toward improving the profitability of our individual life business. We have strong life insurance, marketing and distribution capabilities, which we've expanded with the acquisition of Assurance IQ. In aggregate, these factors reduced first quarter's adjusted operating income by about $295 million or $0.58 a share. Lower interest rates and equity markets also challenged fundamentals across our businesses, and we are actively executing pricing and product actions to shift our business mix to less market-sensitive customer solutions. With that in mind, I'll turn now to providing more color on how we are executing on our strategy within our U.S., PGIM and international businesses as well as on the outlook for these businesses considering current market conditions. I will also provide an overview of our investment portfolio, given the increased focus on the risks associated with the potential near-term credit cycle. Turning to slide 7. Our U.S. businesses consist of the workplace solutions, individual solutions and Assurance IQ division that produce a diversified source of earnings from fees, investment spread and underwriting income. Our U.S. businesses continue to execute on three key priorities. First and foremost, the financial strength of these businesses, which continues to be solid despite the impacts of COVID-19 and the broader economic conditions. Continue to take product actions, including steps to diversify our mix of business and maintain profitability. Second, as the needs of our customers rapidly evolve, including in response to COVID-19 and its economic impact, we are leveraging our ongoing technology transformation and digital capabilities to enhance customer engagement. For example, within a matter of days in March, we introduced our fast track automated underwriting process for COVID-19 related claims with expanded e-capabilities for proof of death. Just weekend, we introduced new mobile apps and chat bots to help manage a surge in customer calls and inquiries. And we have expanded the use of electronic signatures across our businesses. We will continue to invest in transforming our capabilities by accelerating use of technology to deliver a better customer experience and enhance the speed at which we operate. And third, we remain committed to expanding our addressable market. The pandemic has amplified the financial wellness challenges that many US households face. To support our clients in these challenging times, we continue to invest in and expand our range of capabilities to meet their needs. For example, we completely transformed our flagship financial wellness offering pathways from an on-site to a virtual offering. In a matter of just weeks, we scheduled over 150 live web-based financial education seminars for our clients. And we introduced a new solution to help customers managed debt in partnership with GreenPath. We're also shifting our focus to serving an expanded addressable market with lower risk and less market sensitive solutions to address the changing market conditions. For example, in our individual annuities business, we're pivoting to less interest rate sensitive products, including accelerating to May of this year for launch of our FlexGuard indexed annuity. In our individual life business, we're also making product and pricing changes that will result in the continued pivot to variable life and other less interest rate-sensitive products. As a result of pricing actions, product pivots and the disruptions from COVID-19, we expect sales to continue to decline for individual annuities in the near term, and we also expect reduced sales for individual life. In our retirement business, while the longevity reinsurance market remains active, we expect that current market conditions will impact the funding levels of pension plans and, therefore, result in lower pension risk transfer transactions. Now turning to slide 8. PGIM is a top 10 global investment manager with $1.3 trillion of assets under management and continues to leverage its diversified multi-manager model to serve investors. Our robust infrastructure and investments in technology have allowed employees to seamlessly transition to working from home. This operational flexibility has allowed us to support clients with portfolio information and insights and address their questions even as we work in a virtual environment. While significant market fluctuations in the month of March affected our three-year performance, PGIM's long-term track record remains strong. 79% of assets under management have outperformed their benchmarks over the last five years and 94% over the last 10 years, and we have seen some recovery of performance and our short-term track record in April. Despite clients temporarily rebalancing into cash, we generated $2.9 billion of net third party flows during the first quarter. This reflects the resiliency of PGIM's diversified platform across asset classes, regions and client segments. Net flows included $4.2 billion of institutional inflows, partially offset by $1.3 billion of retail outflows. Fixed income experienced both retail and institutional inflows, and of note PGIM was the highest ranking US mutual fund franchise across active and passive asset managers based on net sales in the quarter. PGIM's asset management fees were up 8% compared to the year ago quarter driven by growth in average assets under management and a stable fee rate. Other related revenues decline primarily due to the effect of mark-to-market losses from credit spread widening in the first quarter. We expect near-term sales across the industry to be impacted by volatile public market conditions, reduced transaction volume in private asset classes and a slowdown in client activity. Despite this, we expect PGIM to emerge well-positioned vis-a\u0300-vis our competitors, driven by its diversified global platform. Turning to slide 9. Our international businesses include our Japanese life insurance operation, where we have a differentiated multichannel distribution model as well as other operations focused on high-growth markets. Life planner sales decreased 5% compared to the year ago quarter, driven by lower corporate product sales following the Japan tax law change, partially offset by replacement U.S. dollar protection products. Life planner headcount, however, reached a record level, increasing 5% compared to a year ago. Sales for Gibraltar were also 5% lower, primarily reflecting the continued trend of lower single-pay U.S. dollar fixed annuity sales in our life consultant and independent agency channels. In addition, as we continue to focus on quality distribution, the number of life consultants has declined. In Chile, we are the leading pension provider via our joint venture with Habitat. We earn fees on assets and realized mark-to-market gains or losses on the capital that we are required to invest in the funds. Our investment performance has outperformed over time as well as in the fourth quarter -- in the first quarter. Returns in the quarter, however, were down across the industry, and that contributed to approximately $30 million of lower than expected operating income.  As we look to the second quarter, we expect international sales to decrease significantly, reflecting the effect of social distancing protocols that limit in-person engagement with customers across our distribution channels. This will also affect recruiting of new life planners and life consultants. We're actively taking measures, including appropriate sales support to protect and care for our captive distribution during this difficult time. Over the longer term, we believe COVID-19 may result in heightened interest in Protection products, particularly the death protection products throughout the core of our needs-based selling approach. With respect to the current interest rate environment, we have successfully managed through decades of low interest rates and other market challenges in Japan. As you've seen in the past, we adjust to meet the needs and preferences of our customers while also achieving our return expectation. We have already taken actions and will continue to do so as needed as we moved forward. Also, as Charlie stated, in April, we announced that we have entered into a definitive agreement to sell Prudential of Korea. This business represented less than 10% of international business sales. Now turning to our investment portfolio on slide 10. We have a conservative, quality focused approach to our investment portfolio, construction and management reflects our robust asset liability management practices, commitment to broad diversification and a disciplined interest rate risk management framework. We also leverage PGIM's expertise across multiple asset classes, including its deep and long-standing experience in private placements and real estate. With respect to our investment portfolio, here are a few key points. We have a high allocation to government securities, which is primarily comprised of U.S. treasuries and Japanese government bonds. About half of our BBB and below rated corporate securities are private placements with financial covenants and structural protections that have consistently resulted in lower losses than comparable public securities. In past cycles, the loss experience of our BBB private placements has been comparable to A public credits or about half the losses of similarly rated BBB public credits. Our commercial mortgage loans are well-protected with a loan-to-value on the entire portfolio of 56% and debt service coverages in excess of 2.4 times. We are overweight in more defensive sectors, such as industrial and multifamily and underweight in both office and retail. We also have a low exposure in our investment portfolio to currently more vulnerable sectors like energy, retail and other at-risk corporates. Quality of our portfolio as demonstrated by its performance during the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, where our credit loss experience compared favorably to peers. Since then, we have decreased our exposure to structured securities and BBB corporates and increased our holdings of government bonds and single A and above rated corporates. From 2008 through the first quarter of 2020, we our annual fixed maturity credit losses averaged just 13 basis points of our portfolio. Slide 23 in the appendix provides more detail on our investment portfolio to exposures currently in focus. While we expect credit losses to emerge, the main takeaway is that we feel comfortable that our exposure is quite manageable and that we are well capitalized to absorb such losses. Turning to slide 11, to help you assess potential credit losses on our investment portfolio over a three- year recession cycle, we provide a framework using publicly available rating agency and other third-party data for the underlying assumptions. This framework provides potential impairments defaults and ratings migration. The output suggests impact to PICA's RBC ratio and the solvency margin ratios in Japan would be very manageable and consistent with our expectations. Credit losses on an after-tax basis would total approximately $2.4 billion over a 3- year period. To put that into perspective, that will be less than 1 year of our free cash flow. Also, if we used experiences from the prior recession in 2008 as the underlying assumptions for this framework, the after-tax credit losses will be much smaller at about $1.6 billion. And with that, I'll hand it over to Ken. Alex, it's Rob. Let me handle that one. We haven't received forbearance request. The vast majority of that, as you would expect is coming from the hotel and mall tenants having said that to date through April in any event, we've actually granted forbearance on a little less than 3% of the portfolio. And that by and large almost entirely has been just with respect to principal amortization, the loans continue to remain current with regard to interest payments. We do expect that that will build over time to some greater amount, but having said that, we're actually quite comfortable. If you look at the loan-to-value that we have across the mortgage portfolio, it's at 56% and based on our internal appraisals. What we find is if we actually use external appraisals that drops to around 46%. So being in a position to be able to provide forbearance on principle, we don't think actually puts at risk our ability to be repaid on those loans given the relatively low amount of leverage that we have on our property, and combined with the fact that our mortgage portfolio is very concentrated in higher quality well located properties. So we're feeling quite good about the status of the mortgage portfolio, and we expect it to be resilient through this crisis as it has been in fact through all prior of our recessions. If you look at the 2008 recession and you sort of take that and you roll that forward, we've had sort of a 1 basis point loss ratio on our mortgages from that period until now. So we actually feel pretty good about the way in which we've underwritten it, and we feel very good about the way we're positioned going forward.\nA \u2013 Andy Sullivan: Alex, it's Andy. I was just going to add a point from our third-party managed fund business, very similar trends. We've to date seen low single-digit levels of forbearance. And clearly, that will rise over time, but very similar trends to what Rob covered."

            "name": "Andy Sullivan",
            "content": "Yes, Humphrey, good morning it's Andy. And thanks for your question, and I'll give kind of a little bit of a break here. So, on Assurance IQ, I would characterize the results for quarter one as modestly worse than what we expected. We have started to lean in from an investment perspective to building out the platform more broadly. And to bringing new product solutions onto the platform as we think the first-mover advantage is very, very important. As we talked about last quarter as well, we learned some lessons from a Medicare Advantage perspective and we are investing ahead of Q4 to make sure that we have the right number of agents and that they are fully and properly trained and we're ready to ready to go in the fourth quarter. So, I think you could think about performance similar in the next couple of quarters. And obviously, the large opportunity is in Medicare Advantage in Q4. Yeah. So -- this is Andy. So, obviously, two predominant areas there are, really are individual life business and our group life business, and then obviously offsets in the longevity business that we have in retirement. So actually, an individual life and in group insurance, average age across the whole book is relatively similar in the -- about 55. And in group insurance, in particular, though, 95% of that business is under the age of 65. As far as of the longevity risk transfer business and the pension risk transfer business our average age is in 74 to 75 range. Yeah. Elyse, this is Andy. So I'll take that question, and there are a number of impacts. So maybe I'll start more on the claim side of things. And we do expect, and it was in the estimates that Ken walked through. That we will see increased mortality in the book of business. Obviously, in the group business, as I just referenced, that's somewhat mitigated by the average age. But we do think that, that will go up. We also believe and have seen evidence that we'll see an uptick in short-term disability incidents. So that will serve to compress margins throughout this year. We see a couple of other impacts I just mentioned from a sales and flows perspective. Most of our book of business is medium and large size employers. So actually, most of our sales for 2020 are already baked in that business. And any slowdown we're seeing is more of a 2021 impact. I guess, the last thing I'd mention is a lot of the impacts that group insurance will feel, we actually are mitigated against from the perspective that we're not in the under 100 live segment business. So we don't have exposure to the small segment employers. And, obviously, here, early days, that's where a number of the impacts have been. And this is Andy. Maybe I'll just add some color commentary. So, in the individual life business, as Ken referenced, we've been shifting towards variable life. We're very pleased in Q1 that our sales were $187 million which was up 15% -- Q1 of last year and 50% of those sales were variable life. We've also in April launched a product that is much less sensitive to interest rates and equity markets tuned to the RIA channel. And our buffered annuity, we're very excited about that launch. That has become a robust market. And 60% of the volumes in that marketplace are going through independent broker-dealers, and we have very, very strong relationships there. So, we think to be very promising for us. Yes Suneet, its Andy. And maybe I'll take that question up a level first. As we talked about last quarter, we are leaned into performing the overall -- to improving the overall performance of that book of business in that business. We've three levers. First, we are very much leaned into improving the expense profile of the business. A lot of our future of work, energy and effort is aimed in that regard. And we actually saw a reduction year-over-year in our expenses on business. So, we like the progress we're seeing there. The second lever is leaning into and growing the business with profitable business that we're putting on the books. And as I mentioned, our sales are up year-over-year. And we are comfortable with the pricing and the profitability of the business that we're selling. As far as the third lever and it's the lever that you referenced, it really is looking at the ability to reinsure the block of business. We continue to explore solutions. Obviously, we're looking very carefully about what is the right economic favorability for us and if and when we take action on that, we will report out on it, but nothing to report as we sit here today."

            "name": "Ken Tanji",
            "content": "Thanks, Rob. I will begin on slide 12, which provides insight into earnings for the second quarter of 2020 relative to our first quarter results. We began with pretax adjusted operating income in the first quarter, which was $1.2 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $2.32 on an after-tax basis. Then we adjust for the following items: First, we expect variable investment income in the second quarter to be $150 million lower than in the first quarter. This is primarily driven by lower returns from private equity investments resulting from the decline in values in the first quarter, reported on a one quarter lag in the second quarter. Second, next, in the second quarter, we will have lower seasonal expenses, partially offset by higher implementation costs, which will result in a net benefit of $50 million. Third, there are other items that combined may be $45 million more favorable in the second quarter relative to the first quarter. This includes the normalization of PGIM's other related revenues in our Chilean joint venture income, which were lower in the first quarter due to the mark-to-market of assets for equity markets and credit spreads. This normalization is partially offset by classifying our Prudential Korea business as a divested business. Fourth, we expect fees to be lower on a run rate basis in the second quarter. This reflects account values starting the second quarter at a lower point than the average level in the first quarter. Next, we included a placeholder for potential COVID-19 related claims and expenses totaling $250 million. I will provide additional details of these items on the next slide. And last, we anticipate net investment income will be reduced by $15 million, reflecting the difference between new money rates and disposition yields on our investment portfolio. These items combined get us to a baseline of $792 million of operating earnings and $1.53 per share for the second quarter. Please note that this baseline includes items specific to the second quarter that reduced EPS by approximately $1.22 per share. While we have provided these items to consider, there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the second quarter of 2020. Given the extraordinary circumstances created by COVID-19, on slide 13, we provide estimates for the potential operating earnings impact directly associated with the pandemic in 2020. As part of our risk management process, we model many potential stress scenarios, including a pandemic scenario. We have substantial reserves and highly liquid assets to ensure we are well positioned to readily satisfy all policyholder claims and continue to be well capitalized. We also benefit from the diversification of our businesses, and specifically, the complementary nature of our retirement longevity business in our mortality businesses. Although, the extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic remains uncertain, we thought it would be helpful to provide estimates for the potential impact on net mortality and costs in 2020. The estimate for the impact on net mortality assumes 100,000 deaths across the total U.S. population and 40,000 deaths across the total population in Japan. After considering the profile of our insured policyholders, we estimate the impact on earnings from net mortality may be approximately $200 million in 2020. Also, assuming the spread of COVID-19 is substantially contained in the second quarter, we estimate approximately $135 million of earnings impact may occur in the second quarter with possibly lower impact in the second half of the year. Also, as we continue to support our employees and families during this difficult time, we expect to incur additional costs, primarily related to sales support, employee health protection, technology and other expenses. In 2020, we estimate these costs will be approximately $230 million with $115 million of these costs in the second quarter. Turning to slide 14. We continue to maintain a robust capital position and adequate sources of funding. Our capital position exceeds our AA financial strength target and we maintain liquid assets at the parent company that are greater than three times annual fixed charges.  Our financial leverage ratio is at our target and our regulatory capital levels at our insurance companies remain higher than the targets. In addition, we have substantial sources of funding, our cash and liquid assets at the parent company were $5.3 billion at the end of the quarter. As previously highlighted, we expect to receive net proceeds from -- of approximately $1.7 billion from the sale of Prudential of Korea business following the close of the transaction, which is expected in the second half of 2020. And another source of funding is free cash flow from our businesses, which represents approximately 65% of earnings over time. In addition, we have readily available off-balance sheet resources. This includes a $4 billion credit facility with 23 banks and a syndicate structure across the U.S., Europe and Asia. We also have access to $1.5 billion of funding from a contingent capital facility with the right to issue debt in exchange for U.S. treasury securities held by a trust. And we have a bank -- Japan Bank facility with \u00a5100 billion available to Prudential Holdings of Japan. Turning to slide 15, and in summary, we are committed to fulfilling our purpose to make lives better by solving the financial challenges of our changing world. We maintain a rock-solid balance sheet with a robust capital and liquidity position, and we remain on track with our objectives for the year as we accelerate the execution of our initiatives. Now I'll turn it over to the operator for your questions. Yes, hi, Eric, it's Ken. I'll take your questions. On the COVID estimates. First, I want like to recognize that these are placeholders. These are based on an estimate of 100,000 deaths in the U.S. and 40,000 deaths in Japan. Now we'll have to see how things play out. And there's likely a range of outcomes around that for the U.S. and Japan. So I just want to recognize that we've done our best to give a placeholder, but it's predicated on a number of assumptions. What we do then is we then make considerations for lower fatality rates for the insured populations versus a general population. We certainly have taken certainly have taken in consideration higher fatality rates for the older population and then we took into consideration the geography of our insured population with \u2013tend to have a little bit higher concentration in New Jersey and New York, California and Washington. So when we put that all together, we've applied those to our average profile and provided those estimates. And again, we'll likely have a good range around some of those assumptions. In terms of our retirement business, it does provide an offset to some of our life insurance as we've expected and designed. It offsets about 30% of our exposure, and that's just kind of how the modeling plays out. And then your second question was around the expenses. We've \u2013 we looked at the steps that we need to take in order to care for our employees for crisis care as well as compensation for sales professionals, particularly in international locations, if our sales were to decline. And we've estimated that is the appropriate thing to do given the situation. We will \u2013 we haven't included in that estimate, potential offsets for the fact that travel and conferences and entertainment will be lower. We would expect if things return at some point to normal that some of that might come back you know sort of rebound. But I would estimate that we are going to have savings here in the next quarter or so that you can think of that in the tens of millions, but that's not included in the estimate. Yeah. Hi, this is Ken, Suneet. Just an ordinary course, we review our reserves with our regulators. And they have not indicated any concern about our level of reserves related to long-term care, and there's no special review underway. Yes. I'll take that. The products that we are shifting towards do have less interest rate sensitivity, things like variable life things like we're looking to release a structured variable annuity. And so, they will be less capital-intensive and less interest rate sensitive. I don't think there's anything more to the dynamic than that. Yes. So all things being equal, we would have less -- if we're selling -- when we sell business, we capitalize it well. And if we're selling less that means it's requiring less capital to support it. And so, we would expect all other things being equal that would be the case. I think it's too hard to quantify that right now \nKen Tanji>: We'll see how our sales plays out. If we have if we have opportunities to make sales in attractive business, we'll do that. If the conditions are such that either the returns aren't attractive or it's too difficult to conduct business that would lower sales and we would see some capital offset for that. So I just don't -- I think it's a little tricky to put a number on that right now."

            "name": "Charlie Lowrey",
            "content": "Thank you, Darin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I would like to start this morning by recognizing the extraordinary circumstances created by the COVID-19 pandemic and by expressing our gratitude to all of those on the front lines who are fighting this crisis around the world. For those individuals and their families directly affected by the pandemic and particularly those who have lost loved ones, we extend our deepest sympathies. At Prudential, we're guided by our purpose: to make lives better by solving the financial challenges of our changing world and that includes being there for our employees, our customers and our communities, especially in times like these. We are completely focused on ensuring that we take the right course of action for the business, mitigating the impact of COVID-19, while investing for the future in order to emerge from this crisis stronger from this crisis stronger than before. The strength of our balance sheet enables us to manage our business for the long-term growth, while dealing with short-term business realities. Before we get into the first quarter performance, I'll cover some of the key steps we have taken as a company to support our employees, customers and communities in response to COVID-19. First, turning to slide 3. Ensuring the health and well-being of our employees and their families is our top priority. As the pandemic emerged, we initiated new policies and actions to ensure their safety and security, including additional family care support. This included implementing a wide-scale remote work environment, with approximately 98% of our employees and most of our international employees not working remotely. I'm pleased to report that all our businesses and operational functions continue to run smoothly. Prioritizing the well-being of our employees enables us to address the evolving health and financial needs of our customers as the pandemic and its economic impact reverberate more broadly. We've also provided customers with assistance, such as premium deferrals and fee waivers as well as enhanced digital tools. I'm also incredibly proud of the work our employees have done to support our local communities, including in Newark, El Paso, Hartford and multiple international locations. These efforts include the donation of more than 150,000 face masks, including 75,000 N95 respirators for health care workers in New Jersey. In addition, the American Nurses Association and Prudential recently entered into an agreement for Prudential to sponsor ANA events and outreach initiatives in 2020. This agreement will include offering Prudential's financial wellness services and solutions to ANA members and the broader nursing community. We're pleased to be of assistance to those serving on the front lines of this pandemic. Turning to our financial strength. On Slide 4, our rock-solid balance sheet provides the foundation for our employees to serve our customers and our communities. We're confident in our ability to successfully manage in this environment in large part due to the robust, operational and financial risk framework that we put into place after the Great Recession of 2008. This framework prepared us with a playbook to address multiple stress scenarios, including pandemics and economic conditions that are more severe than what we are currently experiencing. In addition, we benefit from our recurring revenue model and mix of complementary businesses, which offset risk and produce capital benefits, giving us confidence about Prudential to navigate the current environment. We began 2020 with a strong capital and liquidity position, and our capital ended the quarter exceeding AA financial strength levels. As the pandemic unfolded and in light of uncertainty in the in the global markets, we executed our playbook. We successfully issued $1.5 billion of senior debt in early March, while spreads were still attractive. This included a $500 million green bond issuance, the first of its kind for a U.S. company in our sector. These actions pre-funded our opportunities through the end of 2021 and enhance the liquidity of our businesses. As part of the playbook, we further enhanced liquidity of our businesses and also paused share repurchases at the end of the first quarter to see how the economic environment develops. During the quarter, our variable annuity hedging performed extremely well with a 99% effective rate. Our approach to hedging the economic risk resulted in significant gains on our equity market and interest rate hedges to offset the increased liability. We feel comfortable about our ability to manage equity market fluctuations and continued low interest rates over time. We're also highly confident about the quality of our investment portfolio, which Rob will cover in more detail shortly. The strength of our financial position means our dividends to shareholders remain well covered by our income and free cash flow. Turning to Slide 5. We are on track to accomplish our strategic initiatives for the year and, in fact, are accelerating their execution in some cases. First, we are repricing our products more quickly and pivoting towards lower risk and less capital-intensive products. Second, with respect to rotating our international earnings mix to higher-growth markets, in April, we reached an agreement to sell our Prudential of Korea business. We also continue to pursue strategic alternatives for our Taiwan business. Finally, we continue to make progress on achieving our goal of $500 million in cost savings, $140 million of which should be achieved this year. We realized $30 million in the first quarter through actions we completed before the start of 2020. Turning to slide 6. While it seems like a light time ago, I'd like to spend a moment on our first quarter performance. We reported pre-tax adjusted operating income of $1.2 billion or $2.32 per share. The GAAP net loss was $0.70 per share, driven largely by non-economic factors. Our U.S. and international business earned lower variable investment income in the quarter. We also generated lower underwriting income in our U.S. businesses. Higher asset management fees at PGIM were offset by lower other related revenues. While the severity and duration of the pandemic and related economic impact remains unknown, we are confident about the strength of our company. Prudential has survived pandemics, wars, recessions and the depression, among other events in its 145-year history. We are resilient, we are strong and we will continue to move forward to deliver sustainable value for all our stakeholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob for a detailed look at our business performance for the quarter. Yes. Hey, Tom, it's -- I'll take those. On the $2 billion of debt included the $1.5 billion that we issued at the holdco. You can think of that as we would ordinarily have issued, say, $500 million earlier in the year and $500 million towards the end of the year. But we decided to do $1.5 billion in March. We were worried about how the conditions were developing and thought it would be prudent to do $1.5 billion, which essentially will take care of any maturities in 2020 and 2021. So it's about $1 billion more than we would ordinarily have done perhaps, but we thought it was an appropriate thing to do. In terms of why we call it operating debt, right now, those proceeds sit at the holding company in cash. And we follow sort of the way that our rating agencies think about classifications of debt. So -- and the planned proceeds, again, we have it available at the holding company. And it would -- it's used -- it's available for paying off the debt again for this year and next year. In terms of the non-AOI item for the quarter, our variable annuity business is very well hedged. And we like to align our outcomes for GAAP us in stat economics. And as Charlie mentioned in his comments, it was highly effective at 99%. The way we hedge interest risk, again, which was highly effective in the quarter, is with both derivatives that mark-to-market and recorded in the P&L, but also by holding a 30-year U.S. treasuries, which had a $1.7 billion gain and would have offset the non-AOI item in the quarter. But the gain on the U.S. treasuries is recorded to OCI and not to the income statement. So economically, and from a stat standpoint, we were very well aligned just with a little bit of difference between where our gain is recorded for GAAP. Again, the way asset adequacy testing works is we don't set a long-term rate. Those are prescribed by GAAP. And we're going through our -- and so it's a little bit of a different framework. And we'll also -- so we're working through that. Yes. The -- I think the primary thing we're looking at is the economic cycle. And we're seeing substantial impact given the situation that we're in. We like the quality of our investment portfolio, and we think it's manageable, but we want to see how this credit cycle emerges. So, I don't know if I can put a timeframe on that. I think time will tell. Yeah. I don't think we want to try to forecast that far, which -- given the situation. Eventually, I think we will operate differently given the changes in environment and the way we're going to have to conduct business, but that's a bit out there. So I don't think we want to start to look through that far at the moment. Great. Thank you very much. We'd just like to say in closing that we'd like to take a moment to thank all our employees for the extraordinary steps they've taken to support our businesses, our customers and our communities. Together, we remain financially strong. We remain resilient, and we remain committed to fulfilling our purpose of solving financial challenges of our changing world, including doing our part to contribute to an inclusive global recovery. Thank you all for joining the call. Please stay safe, and we look forward to talking to you soon."

Prudential delivered strong financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year, reflecting favorable investment performance and continued high demand for the products we introduced during the pandemic to address our customers' evolving needs. 2021 was also a pivotal year for Prudential and our efforts to become a higher growth, less market-sensitive and more nimble company. First, we are repositioning our business mix to generate sustainable long-term growth with reduced market sensitivity. Second, we continue to advance our cost savings program. And third, we maintained our disciplined and thoughtful approach to deploying capital. I'll provide an update on each of these areas before turning it over to Rob and Ken. Moving to Slide 3. We are making significant progress repositioning our business for sustainable long-term growth with reduced market sensitivity through a mix of divestitures and strategic programmatic acquisitions. Following the successful completion of the sales of our Korea and Taiwan insurance businesses, which produced $1.8 billion in proceeds, we reached agreements to divest our full service business and a portion of our traditional variable annuities. We are on track to close both of these transactions in the first half of 2022 and generate additional proceeds of over $4 billion. We are redeploying capital in part through highly targeted acquisitions and investments in asset management and emerging markets. Last year, PGIM acquired Montana Capital Partners, a European-based private equity secondaries asset manager; and Green Harvest, a separately managed account platform that provides customized solutions for high net worth investors. Meanwhile, on the emerging markets front, we closed on an investment in ICEA LION Holdings, a highly respected financial services market leader in Kenya with operations in Tanzania and Uganda. Turning to Slide 4. We continue to advance our cost savings program and are on track to achieve $750 million in savings by the end of 2023. To date, we have already achieved $635 million in run rate cost savings, exceeding our $500 million target for 2021. We have also taken steps to improve experiences around the world for our customers and employees through innovation. This includes using automation, artificial intelligence and other technology to expedite underwriting, reduce and simplify processes, provide faster, more convenient service options, and deliver meaningful financial advice in the ways our customers want it. I'll touch more upon how we're using the technology in a moment. Turning to Slide 5. We have maintained a disciplined and balanced approach to deploying capital by enhancing returns to shareholders, reducing financial leverage and by investing in the growth of our businesses. We currently plan to return a total of $11 billion of capital to shareholders between 2021 and the end of 2023. This includes $4.3 billion returned during 2021 through share repurchases and dividends. As part of this plan, the Board has authorized $1.5 billion of share repurchases and a 4% increase in our quarterly dividend beginning in the first quarter. This represents our 14th consecutive annual dividend increase. We also reduced debt by $1.3 billion in 2021. In addition to the acquisitions I previously mentioned, we\u2019ve also made investments in our businesses to drive long-term growth and to meet the evolving needs of our customers. In PGIM, for example, we have significantly strengthened our suite of environmental, social and governance bond funds to better serve sustainability-focused investors. Meanwhile, in our insurance businesses, we continue to develop products that are less market-sensitive and have higher-growth potential, such as our FlexGuard and Variable life products, with a focus on improved customer experience and driving greater operational efficiency. One example, as I mentioned earlier, is our use of artificial intelligence. We use AI to quickly and accurately assess risk in our life insurance businesses and to expedite the application and underwriting process. The application of innovative technology generated significant efficiencies for our global businesses during 2021, while delivering a dramatically better experience for our customers. We will continue to expand the use of AI and other emerging technologies across the firm. Our capital deployment strategy is supported by a rock solid balance sheet, which includes $3.6 billion in highly liquid assets at the end of the fourth quarter and a capital position that continues to support our AA financial strength rating. Turning to Slide 6. Our ongoing efforts to transform the company in 2021 go hand-in-hand with Prudential's long-standing commitment to sustainability. This commitment is reflected in several significant enhancements to our environmental, social and governance framework last year. We committed to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 across our primary global home office operations, with an interim goal of becoming carbon-neutral in these facilities by 2040. We are also reviewing our general account investment holdings and have restricted new direct investments in companies that derive 25% or more of their revenues from thermal coal. On the social front, the Prudential Foundation surpassed $1 billion in grants to partners primarily focused on eliminating barriers to financial and social mobility around the world. This achievement follows another milestone that we reached in 2020 when our impact investment portfolio exceeded $1 billion. We also continue to advance our nine commitments to racial equity through investments in funding for organizations committed to diversity, equity and inclusion, and through internal measures, including diversity training and our commitment to equitable compensation for our employees. Our governance actions reflected a shared commitment to diversity and inclusion, beginning at the top with over 80% of our independent Board Directors being diverse. It also includes the steps we are taking to improve diverse representation throughout Prudential and to provide greater transparency around the composition of our U.S. workforce. In 2021, we enhanced our diversity disclosures by publishing EEO-1 data and the results of our pay equity analysis for our U.S. employees. We also expanded our policy of tying compensation plans for senior executives to the achievement of workforce diversity goals. As I noted earlier, we believe our sustainability commitments and transformation to become a higher growth, less market-sensitive and more nimble business are closely connected. Together, they help us fulfill our purpose of making lives better by solving the financial challenges of our changing world by expanding access to investing insurance and retirement security for customers and clients around the globe. Before turning it over to Rob, I'd like to thank all of our employees for their unwavering dedication to the customers and communities we serve, particularly in light of the continued challenges created by the pandemic. I am proud of the progress we made and the momentum we built in 2021 and look forward to making an even more meaningful difference in the lives of all our stakeholders in 2022 and beyond. Thank you for your time this morning. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob.\nRobert Falzon: Thanks, Charlie. I'll provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for our PGIM, U.S. and International businesses. I'll begin on Slide 7 with our financial results. For 2021, pre-tax adjusted operating income was $7.3 billion or $14.58 a share on an after-tax basis. Results for the year included a benefit from the outperformance of variable investment income that exceeded target returns by about $1.6 billion, reflecting market performance, strategy and manager selection. In the fourth quarter, pre-tax adjusted operating income was $1.6 billion or $3.18 a share on an after-tax basis, while GAAP net income was $3.13 per share. Of note, our GAAP net income includes realized investment gains and favorable market experience updates that were offset by a goodwill impairment that resulted in a charge of $837 million net of tax. This charge reflects 2 main drivers of a reduction in the estimated fair value of Assurance. First, we acquired capabilities to increase access to more customers, and we have experienced good revenue growth. However, this growth has been slower than expected and we are now assuming it will take longer to monetize into earnings and cash flow. And second, we have seen a significant decline in publicly traded peer valuations, which is a key input in our assessment of fair value. Turning to the operating results of our businesses. PGIM, our global asset manager, had record asset management fees driven by record account values of over $1.5 trillion. Relative to the year-ago quarter, earnings reflected the elevated level of other related revenues last year as well as higher expenses supporting business growth in the current period. Results of our U.S. Businesses increased 13% from the year-ago quarter and reflected higher net investment spread, including a greater benefit from variable investment income, higher fee income, primarily driven by equity market appreciation, partially offset by higher expenses driven by a legal reserve and less favorable underwriting experience due to COVID-19-related mortality. Earnings in our International Businesses increased 5%, reflecting continued business growth, lower expenses and higher net investment spread. Turning to Slide 8. PGIM continues to demonstrate the strength of its diversified capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed income, alternatives, real estate and equities as a top 10 global investment manager. PGIM's investment performance remains attractive with more than 95% of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last 3-, 5- and 10-year periods. This performance has contributed to third-party net flows of $11 billion for the year, with positive flows across U.S. and non-U.S.-based clients in both public and private strategies. As the investment engine of Prudential, success and growth of PGIM and of our U.S. and International insurance businesses are mutually enhancing. PGIM's asset origination capabilities, investment management expertise and access to institutional and other sources of private capital provide a competitive advantage by helping our businesses to bring enhanced solutions, innovation and more value to our customers. And our businesses, in turn, provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated flows and unique access to insurance liabilities that complement its successful third-party track record of growth. PGIM's sixth consecutive quarter of record asset management fees reflect strong business fundamentals and record assets under management. We continue to expand our global equity franchise to grow our alternatives and private credit business, which has assets in excess of $240 billion across private credit and real estate equity and debt and benefits from our global scale and market-leading positions. Notably, PGIM's private businesses deployed nearly $50 billion of gross capital, up 33% from last year. Now turning to Slide 9. Our U.S. Businesses produced diversified earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income and also benefit from our complementary mix of longevity and mortality businesses. We continue to shift our business mix towards higher growth and less interest rate-sensitive products and businesses to transform our capabilities and cost structure and to expand our addressable markets. Our product pivots have worked well, demonstrated by continued strong sales of our buffered annuities, which were nearly $6 billion for the year, representing 87% of total individual annuity sales. These sales reflect customer demand for investment solutions that offer the potential for appreciation from equity markets combined with downside protection. We have also exercised discipline through frequent pricing actions and our sales benefit from having a strong and trusted brand and a highly effective distribution team. Our Individual Life sales also reflect our earlier product pivot strategy with Variable products representing 71% of sales for the year. Our Retirement business has market-leading capabilities, which drove robust international reinsurance and funded pension risk transfer sales, including a $5 billion transaction, which was the fourth largest in the history of the market during 2021. And reflected strong persistency and revenue growth in 2021 across all segments. With respect to Assurance, our digitally enabled distribution platform, total revenues for the year were up 43% from last year. Turning to Slide 10. Our International Businesses include our Japanese life insurance companies, where we have a differentiated multichannel distribution model as well as other businesses focused on high-growth emerging markets. We remain encouraged by the resiliency of our unique distribution capabilities, which have maintained the stability of our sales and our in-force business despite the pandemic. In Japan, we are focused on providing high-quality service, growing our world-class sales force and expanding our geographic coverage and product offerings. Our needs-based approach and mortality protection focus continue to provide important value to our customers as we expand our product offerings to meet their evolving needs. In emerging markets, we are focused on creating a carefully selected portfolio of businesses and regions where customers' needs are growing where there are compelling opportunities to build market-leading businesses and partnerships and where Prudential -- the Prudential enterprise can add value. As we look ahead, we're well positioned across our businesses to be a global leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security. We plan to continue to invest in growth businesses and markets to deliver industry-leading customer experiences and create the next generation of financial solutions to better serve the diverse needs of a broad range of customers. And with that, I will now hand it over to Ken.\nKenneth Tanji: Thanks, Rob. I'll begin on Slide 11, which provides insight into earnings for the first quarter of 2022 relative to our fourth quarter results. Pre-tax adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter was $1.6 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $3.18 on an after-tax basis. To get a sense for all our first quarter results might develop, we suggest adjustments for the following items: first, variable investment income outperformed expectations in the fourth quarter by $440 million. Next, we adjust underwriting experience by a net $90 million. This adjustment includes a placeholder for COVID-19's claims experience in the first quarter of $195 million, assuming 75,000 COVID-19-related fatalities in the U.S. While we have provided this placeholder for COVID-related claims experience, the actual impact will depend on a variety of factors such as infection and fatality rates, geographic and demographic mix and the effectiveness of vaccines. Third, we expect seasonal expenses and other items will be lower in the first quarter by $105 million. Fourth, we anticipate net investment income will be reduced by about $10 million, reflecting the difference between new money rates and disposition yields of our investment portfolio. And last, we expect the first quarter effective tax rate to normalize. These items combined get us to a baseline of $2.73 per share for the first quarter. I'll note that if you exclude items specific to the first quarter, earnings per share would be $3.17. The key takeaway is that the underlying earnings power per share continues to improve and has increased 9% over the last year, driven by business growth, the benefits of our cost savings program, capital management and market appreciation. While we have provided these items to consider, please note there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the first quarter. As we look forward, we have also included seasonal and other considerations for 2022 in the appendix. Turning to Slide 12. We continue to maintain a robust capital position and adequate sources of funding. Our capital position continues to support a AA financial strength rating and we have substantial sources of funding. Our cash and liquid assets were $3.6 billion and within our $3 billion to $5 billion liquidity target range and other sources of funds include free cash flow from our businesses and contingent capital facilities. Turning to Slide 13 and in summary, we are executing on our plans to reposition our businesses and we are on track to achieve our targeted cost savings. And with the support of our rock solid balance sheet, we are thoughtfully deploying capital. Now I'll turn it to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is coming from Ryan Krueger from KBW. Your line is now live.\nRyan Krueger: Hi, good morning. The recent acquisitions that you've talked about have not utilized a material amount of capital. I guess, given the amount of capital that you are freeing up from the full service retirement and variable annuity block sales, would you consider deals that were a bit larger in size if they're available and they need the opportunities you're looking for?\nCharles Lowrey: Hey, Ryan, this is Charlie. I'll answer that question. And let me offer a couple of comments. First, one of the major tenets of our strategy is to be prudent stewards of capital. And we're doing that by balancing three factors. One is investment in our existing businesses to achieve business growth, the second is programmatic M&A, and the third is returning capital to shareholders. But with regards specifically to your question in terms of acquisitions, what we can say is they're going to be consistent with our stated strategy of growing PGIM and emerging markets, by which we can expand and extend our capabilities or our distribution or increase the scale of our existing businesses. And to your point, we'll be looking at a variety of opportunities in different sizes. But what we can also say is that regardless of size, we will evaluate the strategic and financial merits of each transaction with the obvious observation that the larger the transaction, the more financially compelling that transaction needs to be. And as we've said, we will have a programmatic approach, right, as demonstrated by the three acquisitions we did last year and as we've actually done for a couple of decades in both areas where you've seen us make numerous acquisitions in both emerging markets and asset management at various scales.\nRyan Krueger: Thanks. And then from a divestiture standpoint, are you still looking to do more, whether it be in U.S. Individual Life or more in Variable Annuity?\nCharles Lowrey: Yes. Sure. Ryan, it's Charlie again. I'll take that. So first of all, we're focused on closing the existing transaction that you referred to. And that we've signed -- and just as an update, we're on track to close both those transactions in the first half of 2022. But we continuously see opportunities within the businesses and the existing blocks that we have to optimize capital and reduce market sensitivity while improving the consistency and the predictability of our financial results with the goal of creating additional value for shareholders. But as we've said in the past, we'll continue to be thoughtful as we progress towards the goal of becoming a more nimble, less market-sensitive and a higher-growth company. So we'll continue to look for opportunities as they arise and execute accordingly.\nAndrew Sullivan: Ryan, it's Andy. Let me just add in. We\u2019re making great progress on derisking in our annuities business. And as we've talked about before, that's a two-step process to derisk the legacy. Step one is all about runoff, and we are very much on track. We're seeing the expected runoff. We saw a $3.8 billion in runoff in the quarter. And we saw over $18 billion in runoff in the year. So runoff is a significant contributor to derisking. As Charlie said, step two was about doing the derisking transaction. And obviously, we're very pleased with the PALAC sale and that represents about 20% of our legacy account values. So as Charlie said, we're going to continue to explore how to further derisk the remaining legacy, but we are very focused right now on closing the Fortitude Re deal in a high-quality manner.\nRyan Krueger: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question is on the write-down that you guys took within Assurance IQ. Can you just give us a sense of the contributions? You mentioned lower earnings and cash flows as well as public peer valuations. Can you give us a sense of the contributions of each when you came up with the goodwill write-down that you took in the quarter?\nKenneth Tanji: Yes. It was -- Elyse, it's Ken. It is a good combination of both. So we -- each quarter, we assess the conditions and the fair value of the business. We've been doing that since we've acquired it. We incorporated the recent experience from the Medicare annual enrollment and we looked at the updated values for multiples of peers. And so that all went in. And so it was both a combination of our updating for recent experience as well as the recent multiples in the market for peers.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. Thanks. And then maybe a follow-up on the capital side. So you guys mentioned that the PALAC and full-service retirement transactions are on track for a half year one close. At some point, if M&A transactions either don't materialize or don't materialize to a higher magnitude, would you guys consider raising the repurchase authorization for 2022 above the $1.5 billion?\nCharles Lowrey: So Elyse, this is Charlie. I think what we've said and what we'll continue to say is, again, we're going to be prudent stewards of capital. And to the extent that we can't find opportunities to execute on our strategy, we'll consider returning capital. And if you saw what we did last year, we actually increased the share buybacks by $1 billion in two $500 million segments. We've done it in the past, and we will continue to be prudent stewards of capital as we go forward and consider all our opportunities.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Erik Bass from Autonomous Research. Your line is now live.\nErik Bass: Hi, thank you. Can you talk about flow trends at PGIM in the new business pipeline heading into 2022? And are you seeing much shift in demand for fixed income given the rise in interest rates?\nAndrew Sullivan: Hi, Eric, it's Andy. I'll take your question. As we've discussed in the past, obviously, PGIM flows will vary quarter-to-quarter. And in the fourth quarter, we experienced overall flat flows. As you saw, our retail outflows were $3.6 billion. Market volatility really led to client rotation out of our sub-advised equities and out of our core and core plus fixed income into shorter duration strategies. That was counteracted by very strong inflows on the institutional side and in particular, in fixed income, as many pension plans allocations rotate in this type of an environment. I would say it's important to note, if you look at our fixed income business overall across both institutional and retail, overall, we had positive flows in the quarter despite facing the rising rate environment. That is a real testament to the diversification of our distribution and of our portfolio. As we've always said, we think it's very important to look at the long-term track record when it comes to flows. We have done $60 billion in flows over the last five years and we did $11 billion in 2021. Specific to your question around the retail side and what we are seeing from a fixed income perspective, we have seen $27 billion in retail flows over the last five years and our retail assets under management have doubled in that timeframe, really driven by the positive flows that we see, the alpha performance that we've seen and end markets. So we've been very successful there. Flows are an outcome of having outstanding capabilities, exceptional investment performance and great distribution, and we feel very strongly we have all of those and we'll be a net winner over time, and we've proven our ability to succeed across all different market conditions.\nErik Bass: Thank you. And then can you provide some more color on your group results this quarter, both for Group Life and Disability?\nAndrew Sullivan: Sure, Eric, it's Andy. I'll keep going, and I'm going to split this out between Group Life and Group Disability. I'll start on the Group Life side. As we've all seen Delta and now Omicron are having a big impact on the country. U.S. deaths were higher than 3Q. So we saw 126,000 U.S. deaths in 4Q versus 94,000 in 3Q. As a top 3 life carrier, we have a big broad book of business. There's 2 effects really on the Life side that I would note. The first very similar to third quarter. And that's we have a high concentration of large retail and health care employer accounts. If you think about it, those are employers that have a high number of frontline workers that are out and about and exposed on a daily basis. And also many of those workers are in low vaccination geographies. The second effect we saw is while in this quarter, we did see a slight shift to older age, we're still seeing significant increase in incidence rates in the under 55 population. And that population tends to have larger dollar amount policies. If I shift over to the Disability side, I'd start by saying most of our impact in the quarter in the business was on the Life side. But we are seeing some impacts on the Disability side as well. I would frame this, it's what we expected to see and what we prepared for, for the Disability business. Our ratio -- benefit ratio was 87.3. That was 320 bps better than a year ago. There's really 2 effects. On the STD assets side of the business, we are seeing increased volumes. If you think about the impact that Omicron has had as an example and the isolation rules, that drives the STD in absence. But that's a fee-based business. So the effect we're seeing there really is enhanced expense showing up in the admin ratio. We staffed up to make sure that we're there for our customers because that's job 1. On the LTD side, much like third quarter, we continue to see about a 10% increase in incidents and about a 10% increase in severity. But again, it's what we expected, and it is what we prepared for from a claims management perspective. So we're just proud to be able to deliver on our promises to our customers. And as the pandemic subsides or as it flows into being more of an endemic, we know that our benefit ratios will come back into the normal range.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse.\nAndrew Kligerman: Want to kind of shift back to M&A. As I think about the Prudential over the last 2 decades, the company has done a lot of excellent M&As. But the Assurance IQ, which -- with this write-down today, kind of puts a little bit of a shade on it. And Charlie, you've talked about programmatic M&A, being prudent. So what I'd like to know is how does the Assurance IQ acquisition, how does that I think you think about acquisitions going forward, particularly in terms of accretion dilution?\nCharles Lowrey: Sure. It's Charlie. So let me take that, Andrew. Let me take a step back and explain exactly why we did the assurance transaction and the function it plays within our business mix. Assurance is a young and innovative company that it is completely aligned with our purpose and our strategy. It's helping us expand our addressable market which is something we want to do and increase access to more customers, especially a customer base that's traditionally been underserved by our industry, and that's absolutely aligned with our purpose. Secondly, it's a digitally-based platform, frankly, in which we were underinvested and is a new space for us, but one that we wanted very much to be in. And third, from a strategic perspective, it's helping us to reduce market sensitivity by increasing our mix of fee-based earnings which is entirely consistent with what we talked about of becoming a more nimble, less market-sensitive and higher-growth company. Now as we look forward, as I mentioned earlier in the call that the acquisitions we'll be making, they are going to be in PGIM and emerging markets, and they'll be focused on -- will be focused on acquiring more mature businesses, again, by which we can expand and extend our capabilities or our distribution or our scale over time. And this is absolutely in our wheelhouse, right? This is what we've been doing for decades in both emerging markets and asset management. And have made, I won't say hundreds, but tens of successful acquisitions over that time period. So we feel very good about the strategic merits of the Assurance deal and the role it plays within our company.\nAndrew Kligerman: And any comment on accretion dilution you might add to that?\nCharles Lowrey: Sure. Let me talk about the metrics that we use for a moment. So when we think about acquisitions from both -- we think about them both from a strategic and a financial perspective. And strategic perspective, we look to add capabilities, as I said, such as product or distribution or increasing scale in a market or country. And from a financial standpoint, we look at a variety of metrics when assessing potential acquisitions such as earnings contribution and growth, et cetera. Now obviously, the larger the transaction, the more compelling the financial aspects of the transaction has to be. But importantly, I think our focus is on becoming a higher growth, again, less margin-sensitive and more nimble business, and we're going to continue to be extremely thoughtful and disciplined goal of creating value for all our stakeholders.\nAndrew Kligerman: Okay. Got it. And just real quickly on the expenses. It looks great that you're targeting $750 million in savings by '23. And that's -- I think you've completed 635 so far per the slides, and that's up from an initial 500. Do you think beyond that, you could do more in expense saves?\nKenneth Tanji: Andrew, it's Ken. We've made excellent progress, both in terms of not just gaining efficiencies and lowering costs, but also building capabilities. And as we have done that on an accelerated basis relative to our initial targets, we remain certainly focused, again, both on building capabilities, but also gaining efficiency to drive growth going forward. We're very much on track to achieve $750 million by 2023. And at this point, we've really institutionalized both capabilities but also a mindset across the company of continuous improvement. And we're getting good payback on our initiative costs. So we expect to maintain a budget for that and also maintain this discipline going forward. Right now, we're focused on achieving that $750 million by 2023, and that's our main objective.\nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Tom Gallagher from Evercore.\nThomas Gallagher: Just a question on sort of sources and uses of capital. How should we think about the $4.5 billion of proceeds plus coming from the deals? How much of that do you think is free and clear for you to use? How much do you think you might need to use to bolster capital levels, if any of it is? I ask only because just looking at the HoldCo levels, I guess you're getting closer to the low end of the target now. I'm wondering if you want to bolster that back up to the top end. And also maybe any comments you have at any subsidiary levels that you'd like to strengthen capital, if at all, or you find across the board there? And any debt reduction?\nKenneth Tanji: Yes. Tom, it's Ken. I'll take that. You should think of that $4 billion of or more proceeds coming in from our 2 transactions as free and clear and readily deployable. It will quickly move to the holding company upon the close of the transaction. And just in general, we've had a very consistent approach to capital management. Our businesses are generating free cash flow. And also last year, we reduced debt. So that we thought it was a good time to reduce debt. And so we certainly have debt capacity as well. And now we also have the $4 billion of proceeds coming in. So we feel really good about our capital position and our liquidity and our flexibility and including being well positioned to meet our objective of returning $11 billion to shareholders over the 3-year period 2021 to 2023.\nThomas Gallagher: Got you. Thanks, Ken. And then my follow-up is just I was looking at your supplement and saw that you had operating debt of $5.6 billion that was issued out of the holding company. Now I guess I've always typically thought about operating debt getting issued out of the operating subs, not out of the holding company because it's kind of higher-rated entity. But can you talk a little bit about what is that exactly, the operating debt that's issued out of the holding company?\nKenneth Tanji: Yes. So we consider operating debt to be funding that fund sort of a specific asset or structure that where the cash flows from that asset or structure will pay off the debt. And some examples would be within our PGIM business. We do co and seed investments that are funded both with capital to support the risk of those investments, but also operating debt. And we find that efficient to do that from the holding company. Our PGIM business also has an agency mortgage business, where we fund loans from time to time, again, where those loans would support that operating debt. So those are 2 examples. But again, it's where specific assets or structures will support that debt.\nOperator: Next question is coming from John Barnidge from Piper Sandler.\nJohn Barnidge: My first question, is there any way to bifurcate VII between marks and realized gains?\nKenneth Tanji: Yes. We do look at that and you should think of it as variable investment income is both balanced between cash coming from distributions as well as appreciation in the mark-to-market. Usually, it's pretty balanced. Last year, a little bit more appreciation than cash just given the move in the market.\nJohn Barnidge: Great. And my follow-up, given the focus on large and jumbo within group, how much of the contracts there have seen pricing increases since COVID emerged?\nAndrew Sullivan: So John, it's Andy. I'll take your question. So I don't have the exact percentage at my fingertips, but I'll make some high-level commentary. So as I think you're very aware, those contracts renew anywhere from every 2 years to say, every 5 years, and it's very much based on the size of the business with the smaller cases renewing more frequently every 2 years and large national accounts renewing approximately every 5 years. 80% of our group insurance block of business is national accounts. So our renewal cycle, they would tend to be more towards the longer end of that spectrum. From a pricing perspective, now that we're entering the third year of the pandemic and it's probable at least that this will go from pandemic to endemic, we very much felt that we needed to take our COVID experience from the last 24 months and to put it into our new business and renewal business pricing. And we have done that on both the Life and Disability side. So that business will reprice over the next few years.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Tracy Benguigui from Barclays.\nTracy Benguigui: I wanted to circle back to your comment about completing a $5 billion PRT deal, the fourth largest in market history. So I recall, Andy, in a group meeting, you mentioned that more competitors have entered the space something like 15 to 20, and probably 6 or 7 of those are consistently trying to do these over $1 billion transaction. So I'm just wondering if pricing is getting too frothy for these mega deals and have your view of IRR change due to competition?\nAndrew Sullivan: Yes. Tracy, so it's Andy. Thank you for your question. So yes, we did 2 transactions in the fourth quarter for $210 million. And as you noted, that was on the heels of a very successful transaction in 3Q, which ended up being the largest transaction of the year and we were one of the top writers of the year. I guess I'd make 2 comments. One, the market outlook here for the size of the market remains very strong. The funding levels are at the strongest they've been in 10 years, funded status at the end of November was at 98%. So we believe that the market is going to stay large. And as a pioneer and a leader in the space, to your point, despite it becoming more competitive, there are more competitors, we are still seeing that we -- by being disciplined with underwriting and pricing, we could pick our spots. And we could pick our spots and given the size of the market, we'll win our fair share and we'll be able to continue to grow that business, thanks to our brand and our capabilities.\nTracy Benguigui: That's very helpful. And here's like, I guess, a bigger picture question on wage inflation. I guess, on one hand, that could maybe boost sales. But on the other hand, there are these talent shortages. So I'm wondering how that may also impact expenses, if you could provide some color?\nRobert Falzon: Tracy, it's Rob. I'll take a first stab at that. And Andy, if you want to jump in, please feel free to do so. I guess, Tracy, I'd start by bringing it up a level, which is the most significant impact of inflation would be on rates. And that would be -- if inflation actually leads to higher rates, that's a good thing for the industry and for us included as a part of that. With respect to operating costs, your specific question, one, I would note that our ongoing efficiency initiatives will help to mitigate any impact that we would have on increases that come through. Secondly, we are quite comfortable that we have sufficient pricing power in most -- in our most material products and markets that if the -- that to the extent there's a residual impact, we'll be able to incorporate that into pricing. And I'd add that while inflation is a macro factor that we're very much looking at how it influences the upcoming year, there are a number of other things happening from a macro standpoint beyond inflation. And we believe that there will be drivers actually to tailwinds that will get created for our businesses, things like higher rates and an improving outlook for COVID. Andy, I don't know if you want to add anything more specific on a business level basis.\nAndrew Sullivan: Maybe the only thing I would add is, Tracy, both our U.S. Insurance and Retirement businesses and our PGIM business, we're big, we're broad, we're well diversified. And there are plenty of spots in our business system where this environment is very good. And I just mentioned, we are one of the largest real estate investors in the world, # 3 by assets under management. And obviously, an inflationary environment could be very helpful for that business.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Humphrey Lee from Dowling and Partners.\nHumphrey Lee: I just have a question related to Group Disability. In the slide deck, you talked about you looking to diversify your group insurance portfolio and looking to expand into group disability and voluntary product. Can you just talk about how you are planning to do that, especially with some of the industry disability results recently seeing some pressure? How do you balance growing market share at the same time achieving adequate pricing?\nAndrew Sullivan: Sure, Humphrey. It's Andy. So let me first bring it up a level to talk about how do we think about this strategically. So as we've talked about expanding our addressable market and bringing more solutions to more people, we continue to believe that the workplace is a great place to grow because of the reach and access that it gives us. We've been executing on a strategy in our group business very consistently over the last 5 years to grow and in particular, to grow in certain spots, to grow in middle market, so smaller cases, to grow our disability block and to grow our voluntary capabilities in block so that we diversify the business further. And that makes a lot of sense because a lot of clients in the group space bundle. As I said earlier, the majority of our business at Group Insurance is large national account and the majority is life. So we feel we have a lot of room to grow. And in essence, we're going to stay the course on our value prop. We've invested quite significantly in strengthening our overall value prop, both our financial wellness capabilities but also our core fundamental capabilities in both Life and Disability. Your question about how do you do it in an environment like we're in? It's all about discipline, right? It's about being disciplined in pricing and underwriting and making sure that you -- especially on the Disability side, that you maintain strong disability claims expertise and staffing, so that you could properly manage the business in an environment where we're seeing increased incidence and severity.\nHumphrey Lee: So my follow-up to that is in kind of your strategic review, you talked about M&A area would be asset management and emerging markets. But given your interest now in expanding disability and voluntary benefits in the work site, is now group insurance be in other area of potential M&A? Or are you still sticking to kind of asset management in emerging markets?\nCharles Lowrey: So Humphrey, this is Charlie. For now, our concentration is going to be on asset management and emerging markets. Those are 2 areas where we think we have we can benefit significantly from the increase in capabilities and scale in the markets in which we already are doing business. And so that's going to be our focus in the -- certainly in the near to medium term.\nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Suneet Kamath from Jefferies.\nSuneet Kamath: Charlie, a year ago, we talked about wanting to increase the earnings contribution from growth businesses from, I think the math was 18% to over 30%. And I'm just wondering, is that still on the table because it would seem that, that might be difficult without M&A, but I was just wanting to get your thoughts on whether you can get there organically.\nCharles Lowrey: Sure. That remains our goal in 2 to 3 years. But as you point out, we'll be doing it through a combination of a couple of things. One is -- or 3 things, really. One is organic growth. So we will be continuing to invest in our businesses. One is to get there. And the third is really the dispositions of either lower growth or market-sensitive businesses. And you've seen us begin to execute on that with the 2 transactions that we're going to close this year. And that's all within, again, the context of being prudent stewards of capital, of investing in our business, having programmatic M&A and returning capital to shareholders. So the short answer of your question is, yes, that still remains our goal, and we'll do it through a combination of factors.\nSuneet Kamath: And is it fair to say that the M&A piece might need to be the biggest of the 3? Or do you think it's sort of evenly distributed across the 3?\nCharles Lowrey: It's hard to say whether -- what the percentages will be. It will depend on the opportunities we see, both organically and inorganically, and the dispositions that we make. So it's sort of a multivariable equation, if you will, but we're looking to balance that equation and do it thoughtfully and prudently.\nSuneet Kamath: Got it. Makes sense. And then I just wanted to ask about international sales, if we focus on Japan and Gibraltar. It looks like sales have kind of been flattish. Just wondering if -- or is the reason sort of the COVID impacts and lack of face-to-face or do you have to do some more work in terms of the product set that you guys are offering, both in Gibraltar and the Life Planner model.\nScott Sleyster: Suneet, this is Scott. Let me give a little more context on why the sales are down, and then I can talk about what we're doing. First of all, our bank channel is subject to a higher level of variability and given when there are shifts in the competitive market. And given both COVID-related headwinds, but also higher U.S. dollar interest rates, the regional banks have shifted to easier to sell investment products. As you know, we maintain a strong pricing discipline on deposit products, and we've always concentrated our efforts on selling recurring premium death protection products in that channel. There was a second factor during the fourth quarter, where we're making some product shelf adjustments in our Life Consultant channel, and we're in the process of updating our U.S. dollar annuity offerings and we expect the majority of the new products to be in place by the end of the first quarter. So I think that explains why we were down. The actions that we're taking, in the bank channel, look, we intend to maintain our discipline, but we do think the market will evolve over time, especially as COVID restrictions are relaxed. Additionally, in Japan, we continue to go front and center with our death protection products. But increasingly, we've been adding to our product line with more retirement, wealth transfer and health products. And we believe, given those product line increases, coupled with really high-quality distribution there in Life Planners and Life Consultants, we'll be able to counteract this. We're actually pretty optimistic about going forward there.\nOperator: Next question is coming from Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs.\nAlexander Scott: Yes. I guess for my first one, I just had a follow-up on International. When I think through sales and persistency, it seems for at least the near term, I think premium growth will kind of continue to be the same or if not a little lower than you've had. And when I look at earnings over the last few years, it seems like G&A expenses declining has allowed for you guys to defend earnings in a pretty strong way. And I just wanted to probe there a little bit and understand what have you been doing to take expenses out? And is that something you can continue to do to help earnings in international?\nScott Sleyster: Yes. There's a couple of different comments I'll give there. First of all, just like the U.S. transformation, the International Business, Japan and others have been looking for ways to be more efficient and to use automation and other activities to control costs. Also in some of our emerging markets, we're experiencing faster growth. So we're starting to see some scale benefits. And then finally, we've done a good job of cost control at the corporate center level. That being said, I think our opportunities to grow earnings internationally are much more driven by the revenue actions that I alluded to in the product actions and the distribution force actions that are taking place in both LP and LC. So we're always going to be disciplined on the expense front, but I think it's more of the product and the emerging market growth areas that we think will be more important going forward. Lastly, I would say, of course, COVID has made it more challenging to recruit Life Planners and Life Consultants. And we do expect that to ease as the pandemic eases or turns into an endemic.\nAlexander Scott: Got it. And then maybe for a follow-up, there was a long-term care insurance underwriter that had a pretty sizable gross charge associated with reimbursement policies and the impacts of inflation. And I just wanted to find out from you all, what do you feel like your exposure is to that? And will that have any impact on your stat filings and the required reserves? And is there any material impact to cash flow we should consider?\nKenneth Tanji: No. The short answer is no. We do factor in inflation into our assumptions, and we're well positioned for an elevated level of inflation in the near term. And we continue to see claims experience consistent with our assumptions and actually a little bit more favorable.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Mike Zaremski from Wolfe Research.\nMichael Zaremski: Okay, great. Just one question and a follow-up on the pension marketplace comments. You mentioned that funding levels at their highest levels looks like since the great financial crisis, but not above 100 yet. Just curious, is there kind of like a magic number, given there's costs associated with it, pension funding levels, let's say, we had a good market in -- macro market in '22, if they got to like 103, 105. Or is there a magic number that would kind of cause sales to an uplift?\nAndrew Sullivan: Mike, it's Andy. I'll take your question. And the answer is, we don't believe so. At 98%, plan sponsors are very willing to lean in and to transact. I think plan sponsors, when they're in this range and they see the volatility in the marketplace, it really drives the desire to transact and to derisk their pension plans. So there's no magic number. Having said that, we think at these levels, we're going to continue to see robust markets.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ve reached end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Lowrey for any further or closing comments.\nCharles Lowrey: Thank you, and thank you for joining us today. 2021 was a year of transformation for Prudential in which we reached a record high level of after-tax operating earnings, distributed a record amount back to shareholders and made real progress towards becoming a more nimble, less market-sensitive and higher-growth company. As we look ahead to 2022 and beyond, we are focused on creating and driving growth and becoming a global leader in expanding access to investing insurance and retirement security. We are both excited about and confident in our strategy and our ability to create value for all our stakeholders by building even further upon our progress. We look forward to sharing more with you along the way, and thank you again for joining us today.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

            "name": "Kenneth Tanji",
            "content": "Thanks, Rob. I'll begin on Slide 11, which provides insight into earnings for the first quarter of 2022 relative to our fourth quarter results. Pre-tax adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter was $1.6 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $3.18 on an after-tax basis. To get a sense for all our first quarter results might develop, we suggest adjustments for the following items: first, variable investment income outperformed expectations in the fourth quarter by $440 million. Next, we adjust underwriting experience by a net $90 million. This adjustment includes a placeholder for COVID-19's claims experience in the first quarter of $195 million, assuming 75,000 COVID-19-related fatalities in the U.S. While we have provided this placeholder for COVID-related claims experience, the actual impact will depend on a variety of factors such as infection and fatality rates, geographic and demographic mix and the effectiveness of vaccines. Third, we expect seasonal expenses and other items will be lower in the first quarter by $105 million. Fourth, we anticipate net investment income will be reduced by about $10 million, reflecting the difference between new money rates and disposition yields of our investment portfolio. And last, we expect the first quarter effective tax rate to normalize. These items combined get us to a baseline of $2.73 per share for the first quarter. I'll note that if you exclude items specific to the first quarter, earnings per share would be $3.17. The key takeaway is that the underlying earnings power per share continues to improve and has increased 9% over the last year, driven by business growth, the benefits of our cost savings program, capital management and market appreciation. While we have provided these items to consider, please note there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the first quarter. As we look forward, we have also included seasonal and other considerations for 2022 in the appendix. Turning to Slide 12. We continue to maintain a robust capital position and adequate sources of funding. Our capital position continues to support a AA financial strength rating and we have substantial sources of funding. Our cash and liquid assets were $3.6 billion and within our $3 billion to $5 billion liquidity target range and other sources of funds include free cash flow from our businesses and contingent capital facilities. Turning to Slide 13 and in summary, we are executing on our plans to reposition our businesses and we are on track to achieve our targeted cost savings. And with the support of our rock solid balance sheet, we are thoughtfully deploying capital. Now I'll turn it to the operator for your questions. Yes. It was -- Elyse, it's Ken. It is a good combination of both. So we -- each quarter, we assess the conditions and the fair value of the business. We've been doing that since we've acquired it. We incorporated the recent experience from the Medicare annual enrollment and we looked at the updated values for multiples of peers. And so that all went in. And so it was both a combination of our updating for recent experience as well as the recent multiples in the market for peers. Andrew, it's Ken. We've made excellent progress, both in terms of not just gaining efficiencies and lowering costs, but also building capabilities. And as we have done that on an accelerated basis relative to our initial targets, we remain certainly focused, again, both on building capabilities, but also gaining efficiency to drive growth going forward. We're very much on track to achieve $750 million by 2023. And at this point, we've really institutionalized both capabilities but also a mindset across the company of continuous improvement. And we're getting good payback on our initiative costs. So we expect to maintain a budget for that and also maintain this discipline going forward. Right now, we're focused on achieving that $750 million by 2023, and that's our main objective. Yes. Tom, it's Ken. I'll take that. You should think of that $4 billion of or more proceeds coming in from our 2 transactions as free and clear and readily deployable. It will quickly move to the holding company upon the close of the transaction. And just in general, we've had a very consistent approach to capital management. Our businesses are generating free cash flow. And also last year, we reduced debt. So that we thought it was a good time to reduce debt. And so we certainly have debt capacity as well. And now we also have the $4 billion of proceeds coming in. So we feel really good about our capital position and our liquidity and our flexibility and including being well positioned to meet our objective of returning $11 billion to shareholders over the 3-year period 2021 to 2023. Yes. So we consider operating debt to be funding that fund sort of a specific asset or structure that where the cash flows from that asset or structure will pay off the debt. And some examples would be within our PGIM business. We do co and seed investments that are funded both with capital to support the risk of those investments, but also operating debt. And we find that efficient to do that from the holding company. Our PGIM business also has an agency mortgage business, where we fund loans from time to time, again, where those loans would support that operating debt. So those are 2 examples. But again, it's where specific assets or structures will support that debt. Yes. We do look at that and you should think of it as variable investment income is both balanced between cash coming from distributions as well as appreciation in the mark-to-market. Usually, it's pretty balanced. Last year, a little bit more appreciation than cash just given the move in the market. No. The short answer is no. We do factor in inflation into our assumptions, and we're well positioned for an elevated level of inflation in the near term. And we continue to see claims experience consistent with our assumptions and actually a little bit more favorable."

            "name": "Andrew Sullivan",
            "content": "Ryan, it's Andy. Let me just add in. We're making great progress on derisking in our annuities business. And as we've talked about before, that's a two-step process to derisk the legacy. Step one is all about runoff, and we are very much on track. We're seeing the expected runoff. We saw a $3.8 billion in runoff in the quarter. And we saw over $18 billion in runoff in the year. So runoff is a significant contributor to derisking. As Charlie said, step two was about doing the derisking transaction. And obviously, we're very pleased with the PALAC sale and that represents about 20% of our legacy account values. So as Charlie said, we're going to continue to explore how to further derisk the remaining legacy, but we are very focused right now on closing the Fortitude Re deal in a high-quality manner. Hi, Eric, it's Andy. I'll take your question. As we've discussed in the past, obviously, PGIM flows will vary quarter-to-quarter. And in the fourth quarter, we experienced overall flat flows. As you saw, our retail outflows were $3.6 billion. Market volatility really led to client rotation out of our sub-advised equities and out of our core and core plus fixed income into shorter duration strategies. That was counteracted by very strong inflows on the institutional side and in particular, in fixed income, as many pension plans allocations rotate in this type of an environment. I would say it's important to note, if you look at our fixed income business overall across both institutional and retail, overall, we had positive flows in the quarter despite facing the rising rate environment. That is a real testament to the diversification of our distribution and of our portfolio. As we've always said, we think it's very important to look at the long-term track record when it comes to flows. We have done $60 billion in flows over the last five years and we did $11 billion in 2021. Specific to your question around the retail side and what we are seeing from a fixed income perspective, we have seen $27 billion in retail flows over the last five years and our retail assets under management have doubled in that timeframe, really driven by the positive flows that we see, the alpha performance that we've seen and end markets. So we've been very successful there. Flows are an outcome of having outstanding capabilities, exceptional investment performance and great distribution, and we feel very strongly we have all of those and we'll be a net winner over time, and we've proven our ability to succeed across all different market conditions. Sure, Eric, it's Andy. I'll keep going, and I'm going to split this out between Group Life and Group Disability. I'll start on the Group Life side. As we've all seen Delta and now Omicron are having a big impact on the country. U.S. deaths were higher than 3Q. So we saw 126,000 U.S. deaths in 4Q versus 94,000 in 3Q. As a top 3 life carrier, we have a big broad book of business. There's 2 effects really on the Life side that I would note. The first very similar to third quarter. And that's we have a high concentration of large retail and health care employer accounts. If you think about it, those are employers that have a high number of frontline workers that are out and about and exposed on a daily basis. And also many of those workers are in low vaccination geographies. The second effect we saw is while in this quarter, we did see a slight shift to older age, we're still seeing significant increase in incidence rates in the under 55 population. And that population tends to have larger dollar amount policies. If I shift over to the Disability side, I'd start by saying most of our impact in the quarter in the business was on the Life side. But we are seeing some impacts on the Disability side as well. I would frame this, it's what we expected to see and what we prepared for, for the Disability business. Our ratio -- benefit ratio was 87.3. That was 320 bps better than a year ago. There's really 2 effects. On the STD assets side of the business, we are seeing increased volumes. If you think about the impact that Omicron has had as an example and the isolation rules, that drives the STD in absence. But that's a fee-based business. So the effect we're seeing there really is enhanced expense showing up in the admin ratio. We staffed up to make sure that we're there for our customers because that's job 1. On the LTD side, much like third quarter, we continue to see about a 10% increase in incidents and about a 10% increase in severity. But again, it's what we expected, and it is what we prepared for from a claims management perspective. So we're just proud to be able to deliver on our promises to our customers. And as the pandemic subsides or as it flows into being more of an endemic, we know that our benefit ratios will come back into the normal range. So John, it's Andy. I'll take your question. So I don't have the exact percentage at my fingertips, but I'll make some high-level commentary. So as I think you're very aware, those contracts renew anywhere from every 2 years to say, every 5 years, and it's very much based on the size of the business with the smaller cases renewing more frequently every 2 years and large national accounts renewing approximately every 5 years. 80% of our group insurance block of business is national accounts. So our renewal cycle, they would tend to be more towards the longer end of that spectrum. From a pricing perspective, now that we're entering the third year of the pandemic and it's probable at least that this will go from pandemic to endemic, we very much felt that we needed to take our COVID experience from the last 24 months and to put it into our new business and renewal business pricing. And we have done that on both the Life and Disability side. So that business will reprice over the next few years. Yes. Tracy, so it's Andy. Thank you for your question. So yes, we did 2 transactions in the fourth quarter for $210 million. And as you noted, that was on the heels of a very successful transaction in 3Q, which ended up being the largest transaction of the year and we were one of the top writers of the year. I guess I'd make 2 comments. One, the market outlook here for the size of the market remains very strong. The funding levels are at the strongest they've been in 10 years, funded status at the end of November was at 98%. So we believe that the market is going to stay large. And as a pioneer and a leader in the space, to your point, despite it becoming more competitive, there are more competitors, we are still seeing that we -- by being disciplined with underwriting and pricing, we could pick our spots. And we could pick our spots and given the size of the market, we'll win our fair share and we'll be able to continue to grow that business, thanks to our brand and our capabilities. Maybe the only thing I would add is, Tracy, both our U.S. Insurance and Retirement businesses and our PGIM business, we're big, we're broad, we're well diversified. And there are plenty of spots in our business system where this environment is very good. And I just mentioned, we are one of the largest real estate investors in the world, # 3 by assets under management. And obviously, an inflationary environment could be very helpful for that business. Sure, Humphrey. It's Andy. So let me first bring it up a level to talk about how do we think about this strategically. So as we've talked about expanding our addressable market and bringing more solutions to more people, we continue to believe that the workplace is a great place to grow because of the reach and access that it gives us. We've been executing on a strategy in our group business very consistently over the last 5 years to grow and in particular, to grow in certain spots, to grow in middle market, so smaller cases, to grow our disability block and to grow our voluntary capabilities in block so that we diversify the business further. And that makes a lot of sense because a lot of clients in the group space bundle. As I said earlier, the majority of our business at Group Insurance is large national account and the majority is life. So we feel we have a lot of room to grow. And in essence, we're going to stay the course on our value prop. We've invested quite significantly in strengthening our overall value prop, both our financial wellness capabilities but also our core fundamental capabilities in both Life and Disability. Your question about how do you do it in an environment like we're in? It's all about discipline, right? It's about being disciplined in pricing and underwriting and making sure that you -- especially on the Disability side, that you maintain strong disability claims expertise and staffing, so that you could properly manage the business in an environment where we're seeing increased incidence and severity. Mike, it's Andy. I'll take your question. And the answer is, we don't believe so. At 98%, plan sponsors are very willing to lean in and to transact.

            "name": "Robert Falzon",
            "content": "Thanks, Charlie. I'll provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for our PGIM, U.S. and International businesses. I'll begin on Slide 7 with our financial results. For 2021, pre-tax adjusted operating income was $7.3 billion or $14.58 a share on an after-tax basis. Results for the year included a benefit from the outperformance of variable investment income that exceeded target returns by about $1.6 billion, reflecting market performance, strategy and manager selection. In the fourth quarter, pre-tax adjusted operating income was $1.6 billion or $3.18 a share on an after-tax basis, while GAAP net income was $3.13 per share. Of note, our GAAP net income includes realized investment gains and favorable market experience updates that were offset by a goodwill impairment that resulted in a charge of $837 million net of tax. This charge reflects 2 main drivers of a reduction in the estimated fair value of Assurance. First, we acquired capabilities to increase access to more customers, and we have experienced good revenue growth. However, this growth has been slower than expected and we are now assuming it will take longer to monetize into earnings and cash flow. And second, we have seen a significant decline in publicly traded peer valuations, which is a key input in our assessment of fair value. Turning to the operating results of our businesses. PGIM, our global asset manager, had record asset management fees driven by record account values of over $1.5 trillion. Relative to the year-ago quarter, earnings reflected the elevated level of other related revenues last year as well as higher expenses supporting business growth in the current period. Results of our U.S. Businesses increased 13% from the year-ago quarter and reflected higher net investment spread, including a greater benefit from variable investment income, higher fee income, primarily driven by equity market appreciation, partially offset by higher expenses driven by a legal reserve and less favorable underwriting experience due to COVID-19-related mortality. Earnings in our International Businesses increased 5%, reflecting continued business growth, lower expenses and higher net investment spread. Turning to Slide 8. PGIM continues to demonstrate the strength of its diversified capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed income, alternatives, real estate and equities as a top 10 global investment manager. PGIM's investment performance remains attractive with more than 95% of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last 3-, 5- and 10-year periods. This performance has contributed to third-party net flows of $11 billion for the year, with positive flows across U.S. and non-U.S.-based clients in both public and private strategies. As the investment engine of Prudential, success and growth of PGIM and of our U.S. and International insurance businesses are mutually enhancing. PGIM's asset origination capabilities, investment management expertise and access to institutional and other sources of private capital provide a competitive advantage by helping our businesses to bring enhanced solutions, innovation and more value to our customers. And our businesses, in turn, provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated flows and unique access to insurance liabilities that complement its successful third-party track record of growth. PGIM's sixth consecutive quarter of record asset management fees reflect strong business fundamentals and record assets under management. We continue to expand our global equity franchise to grow our alternatives and private credit business, which has assets in excess of $240 billion across private credit and real estate equity and debt and benefits from our global scale and market-leading positions. Notably, PGIM's private businesses deployed nearly $50 billion of gross capital, up 33% from last year. Now turning to Slide 9. Our U.S. Businesses produced diversified earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income and also benefit from our complementary mix of longevity and mortality businesses. We continue to shift our business mix towards higher growth and less interest rate-sensitive products and businesses to transform our capabilities and cost structure and to expand our addressable markets. Our product pivots have worked well, demonstrated by continued strong sales of our buffered annuities, which were nearly $6 billion for the year, representing 87% of total individual annuity sales. These sales reflect customer demand for investment solutions that offer the potential for appreciation from equity markets combined with downside protection. We have also exercised discipline through frequent pricing actions and our sales benefit from having a strong and trusted brand and a highly effective distribution team. Our Individual Life sales also reflect our earlier product pivot strategy with Variable products representing 71% of sales for the year. Our Retirement business has market-leading capabilities, which drove robust international reinsurance and funded pension risk transfer sales, including a $5 billion transaction, which was the fourth largest in the history of the market during 2021. And reflected strong persistency and revenue growth in 2021 across all segments. With respect to Assurance, our digitally enabled distribution platform, total revenues for the year were up 43% from last year. Turning to Slide 10. Our International Businesses include our Japanese life insurance companies, where we have a differentiated multichannel distribution model as well as other businesses focused on high-growth emerging markets. We remain encouraged by the resiliency of our unique distribution capabilities, which have maintained the stability of our sales and our in-force business despite the pandemic. In Japan, we are focused on providing high-quality service, growing our world-class sales force and expanding our geographic coverage and product offerings. Our needs-based approach and mortality protection focus continue to provide important value to our customers as we expand our product offerings to meet their evolving needs. In emerging markets, we are focused on creating a carefully selected portfolio of businesses and regions where customers' needs are growing where there are compelling opportunities to build market-leading businesses and partnerships and where Prudential -- the Prudential enterprise can add value. As we look ahead, we're well positioned across our businesses to be a global leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security. We plan to continue to invest in growth businesses and markets to deliver industry-leading customer experiences and create the next generation of financial solutions to better serve the diverse needs of a broad range of customers. And with that, I will now hand it over to Ken. Tracy, it's Rob. I'll take a first stab at that. And Andy, if you want to jump in, please feel free to do so. I guess, Tracy, I'd start by bringing it up a level, which is the most significant impact of inflation would be on rates. And that would be -- if inflation actually leads to higher rates, that's a good thing for the industry and for us included as a part of that. With respect to operating costs, your specific question, one, I would note that our ongoing efficiency initiatives will help to mitigate any impact that we would have on increases that come through. Secondly, we are quite comfortable that we have sufficient pricing power in most -- in our most material products and markets that if the -- that to the extent there's a residual impact, we'll be able to incorporate that into pricing. And I'd add that while inflation is a macro factor that we're very much looking at how it influences the upcoming year, there are a number of other things happening from a macro standpoint beyond inflation. And we believe that there will be drivers actually to tailwinds that will get created for our businesses, things like higher rates and an improving outlook for COVID. Andy, I don't know if you want to add anything more specific on a business level basis."

            "content": "Thank you, Bob, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. Prudential delivered strong financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year, reflecting favorable investment performance and continued high demand for the products we introduced during the pandemic to address our customers' evolving needs. 2021 was also a pivotal year for Prudential and our efforts to become a higher growth, less market-sensitive and more nimble company. First, we are repositioning our business mix to generate sustainable long-term growth with reduced market sensitivity. Second, we continue to advance our cost savings program. And third, we maintained our disciplined and thoughtful approach to deploying capital. I'll provide an update on each of these areas before turning it over to Rob and Ken. Moving to Slide 3. We are making significant progress repositioning our business for sustainable long-term growth with reduced market sensitivity through a mix of divestitures and strategic programmatic acquisitions. Following the successful completion of the sales of our Korea and Taiwan insurance businesses, which produced $1.8 billion in proceeds, we reached agreements to divest our full service business and a portion of our traditional variable annuities. We are on track to close both of these transactions in the first half of 2022 and generate additional proceeds of over $4 billion. We are redeploying capital in part through highly targeted acquisitions and investments in asset management and emerging markets. Last year, PGIM acquired Montana Capital Partners, a European-based private equity secondaries asset manager; and Green Harvest, a separately managed account platform that provides customized solutions for high net worth investors. Meanwhile, on the emerging markets front, we closed on an investment in ICEA LION Holdings, a highly respected financial services market leader in Kenya with operations in Tanzania and Uganda. Turning to Slide 4. We continue to advance our cost savings program and are on track to achieve $750 million in savings by the end of 2023. To date, we have already achieved $635 million in run rate cost savings, exceeding our $500 million target for 2021. We have also taken steps to improve experiences around the world for our customers and employees through innovation. This includes using automation, artificial intelligence and other technology to expedite underwriting, reduce and simplify processes, provide faster, more convenient service options, and deliver meaningful financial advice in the ways our customers want it. I'll touch more upon how we're using the technology in a moment. Turning to Slide 5. We have maintained a disciplined and balanced approach to deploying capital by enhancing returns to shareholders, reducing financial leverage and by investing in the growth of our businesses. We currently plan to return a total of $11 billion of capital to shareholders between 2021 and the end of 2023. This includes $4.3 billion returned during 2021 through share repurchases and dividends. As part of this plan, the Board has authorized $1.5 billion of share repurchases and a 4% increase in our quarterly dividend beginning in the first quarter. This represents our 14th consecutive annual dividend increase. We also reduced debt by $1.3 billion in 2021. In addition to the acquisitions I previously mentioned, we've also made investments in our businesses to drive long-term growth and to meet the evolving needs of our customers. In PGIM, for example, we have significantly strengthened our suite of environmental, social and governance bond funds to better serve sustainability-focused investors. Meanwhile, in our insurance businesses, we continue to develop products that are less market-sensitive and have higher-growth potential, such as our FlexGuard and Variable life products, with a focus on improved customer experience and driving greater operational efficiency. One example, as I mentioned earlier, is our use of artificial intelligence. We use AI to quickly and accurately assess risk in our life insurance businesses and to expedite the application and underwriting process. The application of innovative technology generated significant efficiencies for our global businesses during 2021, while delivering a dramatically better experience for our customers. We will continue to expand the use of AI and other emerging technologies across the firm. Our capital deployment strategy is supported by a rock solid balance sheet, which includes $3.6 billion in highly liquid assets at the end of the fourth quarter and a capital position that continues to support our AA financial strength rating. Turning to Slide 6. Our ongoing efforts to transform the company in 2021 go hand-in-hand with Prudential's long-standing commitment to sustainability. This commitment is reflected in several significant enhancements to our environmental, social and governance framework last year. We committed to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 across our primary global home office operations, with an interim goal of becoming carbon-neutral in these facilities by 2040. We are also reviewing our general account investment holdings and have restricted new direct investments in companies that derive 25% or more of their revenues from thermal coal. On the social front, the Prudential Foundation surpassed $1 billion in grants to partners primarily focused on eliminating barriers to financial and social mobility around the world. This achievement follows another milestone that we reached in 2020 when our impact investment portfolio exceeded $1 billion. We also continue to advance our nine commitments to racial equity through investments in funding for organizations committed to diversity, equity and inclusion, and through internal measures, including diversity training and our commitment to equitable compensation for our employees. Our governance actions reflected a shared commitment to diversity and inclusion, beginning at the top with over 80% of our independent Board Directors being diverse. It also includes the steps we are taking to improve diverse representation throughout Prudential and to provide greater transparency around the composition of our U.S. workforce. In 2021, we enhanced our diversity disclosures by publishing EEO-1 data and the results of our pay equity analysis for our U.S. employees. We also expanded our policy of tying compensation plans for senior executives to the achievement of workforce diversity goals. As I noted earlier, we believe our sustainability commitments and transformation to become a higher growth, less market-sensitive and more nimble business are closely connected. Together, they help us fulfill our purpose of making lives better by solving the financial challenges of our changing world by expanding access to investing insurance and retirement security for customers and clients around the globe. Before turning it over to Rob, I'd like to thank all of our employees for their unwavering dedication to the customers and communities we serve, particularly in light of the continued challenges created by the pandemic. I am proud of the progress we made and the momentum we built in 2021 and look forward to making an even more meaningful difference in the lives of all our stakeholders in 2022 and beyond. Thank you for your time this morning. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob. Hey, Ryan, this is Charlie. I'll answer that question. And let me offer a couple of comments. First, one of the major tenets of our strategy is to be prudent stewards of capital. And we're doing that by balancing three factors. One is investment in our existing businesses to achieve business growth, the second is programmatic M&A, and the third is returning capital to shareholders. But with regards specifically to your question in terms of acquisitions, what we can say is they're going to be consistent with our stated strategy of growing PGIM and emerging markets, by which we can expand and extend our capabilities or our distribution or increase the scale of our existing businesses. And to your point, we'll be looking at a variety of opportunities in different sizes. But what we can also say is that regardless of size, we will evaluate the strategic and financial merits of each transaction with the obvious observation that the larger the transaction, the more financially compelling that transaction needs to be. And as we've said, we will have a programmatic approach, right, as demonstrated by the three acquisitions we did last year and as we've actually done for a couple of decades in both areas where you've seen us make numerous acquisitions in both emerging markets and asset management at various scales. Yes. Sure. Ryan, it's Charlie again. I'll take that. So first of all, we're focused on closing the existing transaction that you referred to. And that we've signed -- and just as an update, we're on track to close both those transactions in the first half of 2022. But we continuously see opportunities within the businesses and the existing blocks that we have to optimize capital and reduce market sensitivity while improving the consistency and the predictability of our financial results with the goal of creating additional value for shareholders. But as we've said in the past, we'll continue to be thoughtful as we progress towards the goal of becoming a more nimble, less market-sensitive and a higher-growth company. So we'll continue to look for opportunities as they arise and execute accordingly. So Elyse, this is Charlie. I think what we've said and what we'll continue to say is, again, we're going to be prudent stewards of capital. And to the extent that we can't find opportunities to execute on our strategy, we'll consider returning capital. And if you saw what we did last year, we actually increased the share buybacks by $1 billion in two $500 million segments. We've done it in the past, and we will continue to be prudent stewards of capital as we go forward and consider all our opportunities. Sure. It's Charlie. So let me take that, Andrew. Let me take a step back and explain exactly why we did the assurance transaction and the function it plays within our business mix. Assurance is a young and innovative company that it is completely aligned with our purpose and our strategy. It's helping us expand our addressable market which is something we want to do and increase access to more customers, especially a customer base that's traditionally been underserved by our industry, and that's absolutely aligned with our purpose. Secondly, it's a digitally-based platform, frankly, in which we were underinvested and is a new space for us, but one that we wanted very much to be in. And third, from a strategic perspective, it's helping us to reduce market sensitivity by increasing our mix of fee-based earnings which is entirely consistent with what we talked about of becoming a more nimble, less market-sensitive and higher-growth company. Now as we look forward, as I mentioned earlier in the call that the acquisitions we'll be making, they are going to be in PGIM and emerging markets, and they'll be focused on -- will be focused on acquiring more mature businesses, again, by which we can expand and extend our capabilities or our distribution or our scale over time. And this is absolutely in our wheelhouse, right? This is what we've been doing for decades in both emerging markets and asset management. And have made, I won't say hundreds, but tens of successful acquisitions over that time period. So we feel very good about the strategic merits of the Assurance deal and the role it plays within our company. Sure. Let me talk about the metrics that we use for a moment. So when we think about acquisitions from both -- we think about them both from a strategic and a financial perspective. And strategic perspective, we look to add capabilities, as I said, such as product or distribution or increasing scale in a market or country. And from a financial standpoint, we look at a variety of metrics when assessing potential acquisitions such as earnings contribution and growth, et cetera. Now obviously, the larger the transaction, the more compelling the financial aspects of the transaction has to be. But importantly, I think our focus is on becoming a higher growth, again, less margin-sensitive and more nimble business, and we're going to continue to be extremely thoughtful and disciplined goal of creating value for all our stakeholders. So Humphrey, this is Charlie. For now, our concentration is going to be on asset management and emerging markets. Those are 2 areas where we think we have we can benefit significantly from the increase in capabilities and scale in the markets in which we already are doing business. And so that's going to be our focus in the -- certainly in the near to medium term. Sure. That remains our goal in 2 to 3 years. But as you point out, we'll be doing it through a combination of a couple of things. One is -- or 3 things, really. One is organic growth. So we will be continuing to invest in our businesses. One is to get there. And the third is really the dispositions of either lower growth or market-sensitive businesses. And you've seen us begin to execute on that with the 2 transactions that we're going to close this year. And that's all within, again, the context of being prudent stewards of capital, of investing in our business, having programmatic M&A and returning capital to shareholders. So the short answer of your question is, yes, that still remains our goal, and we'll do it through a combination of factors. It's hard to say whether -- what the percentages will be. It will depend on the opportunities we see, both organically and inorganically, and the dispositions that we make. So it's sort of a multivariable equation, if you will, but we're looking to balance that equation and do it thoughtfully and prudently. Thank you, and thank you for joining us today. 2021 was a year of transformation for Prudential in which we reached a record high level of after-tax operating earnings, distributed a record amount back to shareholders and made real progress towards becoming a more nimble, less market-sensitive and higher-growth company. As we look ahead to 2022 and beyond, we are focused on creating and driving growth and becoming a global leader in expanding access to investing insurance and retirement security. We are both excited about and confident in our strategy and our ability to create value for all our stakeholders by building even further upon our progress. We look forward to sharing more with you along the way, and thank you again for joining us today."

            "name": "Scott Sleyster",
            "content": "Suneet, this is Scott. Let me give a little more context on why the sales are down, and then I can talk about what we're doing. First of all, our bank channel is subject to a higher level of variability and given when there are shifts in the competitive market. And given both COVID-related headwinds, but also higher U.S. dollar interest rates, the regional banks have shifted to easier to sell investment products. As you know, we maintain a strong pricing discipline on deposit products, and we've always concentrated our efforts on selling recurring premium death protection products in that channel. There was a second factor during the fourth quarter, where we're making some product shelf adjustments in our Life Consultant channel, and we're in the process of updating our U.S. dollar annuity offerings and we expect the majority of the new products to be in place by the end of the first quarter. So I think that explains why we were down. The actions that we're taking, in the bank channel, look, we intend to maintain our discipline, but we do think the market will evolve over time, especially as COVID restrictions are relaxed. Additionally, in Japan, we continue to go front and center with our death protection products. But increasingly, we've been adding to our product line with more retirement, wealth transfer and health products. And we believe, given those product line increases, coupled with really high-quality distribution there in Life Planners and Life Consultants, we'll be able to counteract this. We're actually pretty optimistic about going forward there. Yes. There's a couple of different comments I'll give there. First of all, just like the U.S. transformation, the International Business, Japan and others have been looking for ways to be more efficient and to use automation and other activities to control costs. Also in some of our emerging markets, we're experiencing faster growth. So we're starting to see some scale benefits. And then finally, we've done a good job of cost control at the corporate center level. That being said, I think our opportunities to grow earnings internationally are much more driven by the revenue actions that I alluded to in the product actions and the distribution force actions that are taking place in both LP and LC. So we're always going to be disciplined on the expense front, but I think it's more of the product and the emerging market growth areas that we think will be more important going forward. Lastly, I would say, of course, COVID has made it more challenging to recruit Life Planners and Life Consultants. And we do expect that to ease as the pandemic eases or turns into an endemic."

Prudential delivered solid financial results for the third quarter, reflecting our strong investment performance and high demand for the products we've introduced to support our customers as they solve their financial challenges in a changing world. We also made significant progress executing on our transformation strategy to become a higher-growth, less market-sensitive and more nimble company. First, we reached agreements to divest our full-service recordkeeping business and to sell a portion of our traditional variable annuities, advancing our pivot toward less market-sensitive and higher-growth businesses. Second, we continue to advance our cost-savings program and remain on track to achieve $750 million of savings by the end of 2023. And third, with the support of our rock-solid balance sheet, we are maintaining a disciplined and balanced approach to redeploying capital. I'll provide an update on each of these transformation initiatives before turning it over to Rob and Ken. Turning to Slide 3. In September, we reached an agreement to sell a block of our traditional variable annuities to Fortitude Re. This divestiture, which is expected to close in the first half of 2022, represents approximately 20% of our traditional individual annuities account values and significantly advances our goal of cutting in half the earnings contribution of legacy variable annuities products through a mix of strategic transactions and natural runoff. This transaction expands upon our prior divestiture activity, including the agreement we announced in July to sell our full-service recordkeeping business and the successful completion of the sales of our Taiwan and Korea insurance businesses. As a result of these divestitures to date, we expect to generate net proceeds of approximately $6 billion by the first half of 2022. And we continue to explore additional opportunities to derisk in-force blocks of business. With the pending sale of our full-service recordkeeping business and our annuities block transaction, we have combined our individual annuities and retirement businesses to better serve the retirement needs of both individuals and institutions and support our growth strategy. Turning next to our cost-savings program on slide 4. We are progressing well and remain on track to achieve our $750 million cost-savings target by the end of 2023 as we look to reduce expenses while improving both the customer and employee experience. To date, we have achieved $590 million in run rate cost savings, exceeding our $500 million target for the full year. These savings include $145 million achieved in the third quarter for a total of $385 million this year. Turning to slide 5. We continue to demonstrate a disciplined and balanced approach to capital deployment by enhancing returns to shareholders, reducing leverage and investing in the growth of our businesses, all supported by our rock solid balance sheet. Year-to-date, we returned $3.5 billion to shareholders, including $2.1 billion of share buybacks and $1.4 billion in dividend payments, reflecting a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend, compared to last year. And we're targeting to return $11 billion of capital to shareholders by the end of 2023. During the third quarter, we also took steps to enhance our financial flexibility by redeeming $900 million of outstanding debt. This reduced financial leverage and generated $30 million in annual interest savings going forward. We also continued to deploy capital in our businesses to drive long-term growth. For example, this quarter, we completed a $5 billion funded pension risk transfer transaction, which is the fourth largest transaction in the history of the PRT market and demonstrates our expertise, ability to execute at scale and commitment to this market. We also deployed capital to support our ongoing pivot to less interest rate sensitive and higher growth products, including our FlexGuard and variable life products. Our capital deployment is supported by our balance sheet strength, including highly liquid assets of $3.8 billion at the end of the third quarter and a capital position that continues to support AA financial strength rating. Turning to slide 6. I'm pleased to report a meaningful expansion of our environmental, social and governance commitments. Earlier this week, we announced our commitment to achieve a net-zero emissions across our primary global home office operations by 2050, with an interim goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2040. We're also carefully assessing the emissions impact of our investment portfolio. As an immediate action, we will restrict new direct investments in companies that derive a material portion of their revenues from thermal coal. Separately, on the social front, the Prudential Foundation achieved an important milestone during the quarter, reaching $1 billion in funding to partners aimed at eliminating barriers to financial and social mobility around the world since making its first grant in 1978. These investments include funding aligned with our racial equity commitments to support organizations, such as those supporting minority-owned small businesses and historically black colleges and universities that foster black economic empowerment and address the racial wealth gap. This milestone by the foundation follows the $1 billion investment mark achieved in our impact investing portfolio in 2020. We are confident these actions taken alongside of our strategic transformation will help us build a more sustainable company on behalf of all our stakeholders. Thank you for your time this morning. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob.\nRob Falzon: Thank you, Charlie. I'll provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for our PGIM, US and International businesses. I'll begin on Slide 7 with our financial results for the third quarter. Our pre-tax adjusted operating income was $1.8 billion or $2.78 per share on an after-tax basis and reflected the benefit of strong markets and business growth, which exceeded the net mortality impacts from COVID-19. PGIM, our global asset manager, had record-high asset management fees, driven by record account values of over $1.5 trillion that were offset by lower other related revenues relative to the elevated level in the year ago quarter as well as higher expenses supporting business growth. Results of our US Businesses increased approximately 29% from the year ago quarter and reflected higher net investment spread, driven by higher variable investment income and higher fee income, primarily driven by equity market appreciation, partially offset by less favorable underwriting experience driven by COVID-19-related mortality. Earnings in our International Businesses increased 14%, reflecting continued business growth, higher net investment spread, lower expenses and higher earnings from joint venture investments. This increase was partially offset by less favorable underwriting results, primarily driven by higher COVID-19 claims. Turning to Slide 8. PGIM continues to demonstrate the strength of its diversified capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed income, alternatives, real estate and equities as a top 10 global active investment manager. PGIM's investment performance remains attractive with more than 94% of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last three, five and 10-year periods. Third-party net flows were $300 million in the quarter, including institutional net flows of $700 million, primarily driven by public fixed income flows. Modest retail net outflows of $400 million were due to equity outflows from sub-advised mandates and client reallocations due to rising rates and inflation concerns. As the investment engine of Prudential, PGIM benefits from a mutually beneficial relationship with our US and International Insurance businesses. PGIM's asset origination capabilities and investment management expertise provide a competitive advantage by helping our businesses to bring enhanced solutions and more value to our customers. And our businesses, in turn, provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated flows that complement its successful third-party track record of growth. PGIM's asset management fees reached another record, up 13% compared to the year ago quarter as a result of strong flows driven by investment performance and market depreciation. PGIM's alternatives business, which has assets in excess of $250 billion, continues to demonstrate momentum across private credit and real estate equity and debt, benefiting by our global scale and market-leading positions. As an example, PGIM's private businesses deployed almost $12 billion of capital this quarter, 28% more than the year ago quarter. This strategic focus on expanding higher-yielding products has resulted in stable fee rates over time despite industry-wide fee pressures. Now turning to Slide 9. Our US businesses produced diversified earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income and benefit from our complementary mix of longevity and mortality businesses. We continue to shift our business mix away from low-growth, capital-intensive and interest rate-sensitive products and businesses, transform our capabilities and cost structure and expand our addressable markets. In addition to the agreement that we announced in July to sell our full-service retirement business, this quarter, we also announced the sale of a portion of our legacy in-force annuities block to reduce the overall contribution of traditional variable annuities. These transactions are significant steps forward in shifting our business mix and product portfolio to reduce market sensitivity and accelerate long-term growth. In addition, our product pivots have worked well, demonstrated by continued strong sales of our buffered annuity products, which were $1.3 billion in the third quarter, representing 88% of total individual annuity sales. Since the launch of FlexGuard in 2020, sales have exceeded $6 billion. These sales reflect customer demand for investment solutions that offer the potential for appreciation from equity markets combined with downside protection. We have also exercised discipline through frequent pricing actions, and our sales continue to benefit from having a strong and trusted brand and highly effective distribution team. Also, our Individual Life sales continue to be strong and reflect our product pivot strategy, with higher variable life sales compared to the year ago quarter. Our retirement business reflected strong sales in the quarter, including a $5.2 billion funded pension risk transfer transaction and $1.6 billion of international reinsurance transactions, demonstrating our market-leading capabilities. With respect to Assurance, our digitally enabled distribution platform, total revenues, our primary financial metric as we concentrate on scaling the business, were up 47% over the prior year quarter. During the third quarter, we increased the number of agents to prepare for the seasonally higher expected demand of the Medicare annual enrollment period that occurs in the fourth quarter. Turning to slide 10, our International Businesses include our Japanese life insurance operation, where we have a differentiated multichannel distribution model as well as other operations focused on high-growth emerging markets. Sales across both Life Planner and Gibraltar operations were higher than last quarter amidst the state of emergency in Japan that ended on September 30th. However, sales were lower than the prior year quarter, which were elevated ahead of the US dollar-denominated product repricing in Japan that we implemented in the third quarter of last year. We also continue to see sales momentum in Brazil, particularly within the third-party distribution channel. We remain encouraged by the resiliency of our unique distribution capabilities, which have supported the continued growth of our in-force business. And with that, I'll hand it over to Ken.\nKen Tanji: Thanks Rob. I'll begin on slide 11, which provides insight into earnings for the fourth quarter of 2021 relative to our third quarter results. Pretax adjusted operating income in the third quarter was $1.8 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $3.78 on an after-tax basis. To get a sense for how our fourth quarter results might develop, we suggest adjustments for the following items. First, variable investment income outperformed expectations in the third quarter by $570 million. Next, we included a placeholder for COVID-19 claims experience in the fourth quarter that is a similar level to our experience in the third quarter. While we have provided this placeholder for COVID-19-related claims experience, the actual impact will depend on a variety of factors, such as infection and fatality rates, geographic, and demographic mix and the continued acceptance and effectiveness of vaccines. Third, we expect seasonal expenses and other items will be higher in the fourth quarter by $140 million. Fourth, we anticipate net investment income will be reduced by about $10 million, reflecting the difference between new money rates and disposition yields of our investment portfolio. And last, we expect the fourth quarter effective tax rate to normalize. These items combined get us to a baseline of $2.27 per share in the fourth quarter. I'll note that if you exclude items specific to the fourth quarter, earnings per share would be $3.05. The key takeaway is that our underlying earnings power has increased from last quarter, driven by the benefits of business growth, our cost-savings program and market appreciation. While we have provided these items to consider, please note that there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the fourth quarter. Turning to slide 12. We continue to maintain a robust capital position and adequate sources of funding. Our capital position continues to support a AA financial strength rating and have substantial sources of funding. Our cash and liquid assets were $3.8 billion, which is greater than three times annual fixed charges, and other sources of funds include free cash flow from our businesses and contingent capital facilities. Turning to slide 13 and in summary, we are executing on divestitures. We are on track to achieve our targeted cost-saving initiatives. And with the support of our rock solid balance sheet, we are thoughtfully redeploying capital. Now I'll turn it to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Erik Bass from Autonomous Research. Your line is now live.\nErik Bass: Hi. Thank you. So we've recently seen asset managers, such as T. Rowe and Franklin, announce sizable deals to acquire private and alternative asset capabilities and transactions that were generally well received by investors. Wondering if you see more properties like these available in the market? And would this be the type of programmatic M&A that you might consider for PGIM?\nAndy Sullivan: So thanks, Erik. It's Andy and good morning, I'll take your question. So let me start by reiterating that PGIM is a business that has demonstrated incredibly strong ability to grow organically year-after-year. And that's really due to the success of our multi-manager model and the team's very strong execution. We've seen $55 billion in net flows over the last five years, and we've seen $11 billion in year-to-date flows. As we've talked about in the past, though, we do want to build upon that track record with programmatic bolt-on M&A. And we've been very assertive in making sure that we're both in the now and in the flow, and we are aware of these transactions in the marketplace. We're leaned into areas that are higher-growth and higher-fee-oriented areas. Three I would mention; we're looking to continue to globalize the business, specifically in Europe and Asia. We're looking to continue to build on our already strong alternatives business, where we have $250 billion in assets under management. And our acquisition of Montana Capital Partners is a great example of that. And we're looking in the area of real assets. As always, we're going to be disciplined in what we do and in how we deploy capital. To your question about sizable deals, we very much feel, if you look across our managers in PGIM, we are at scale. So it's unlikely that you would see us do what I would call a big pure-play scale deal. But to the degree that we would look and potentially do something larger, it would come with a key capability or strengthen us in a material way in a key geography and also bring along with it synergies.\nErik Bass: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. And then was hoping you could talk a little bit or provide some more color on your group claims experience this quarter, and particularly, the trends you're seeing in both group life and disability.\nAndy Sullivan: Sure, Eric. It's Andy. I'll take that one again. And let me start on the group life side. So as I'm sure you know and you've seen in the press, Delta has had a large impact on the country. The deaths in 3Q were 3 times what were expected. We were expecting 30,000 deaths, and we saw 95,000. We are a top three life and disability carrier, so -- and because of that, we have a very big and broad book of business. And there's really three effects that I would point to that we saw in the quarter. First, U.S. deaths in the age group between 35 and 54 tripled from a percentage perspective. And we cover a lot of younger workers. The average age of our group block is in the neighborhood of 46 years old. Second, as you probably know and expect, we have a large national account book of business and have a very strong share in health care, in retail and in manufacturing. These are areas where frontline workers are out and about by the definition and nature of their job, and therefore, more exposed. And then, the third thing I would mention is, about 50% of the pandemic impact we saw on the life side came from claims in the southern United States. So, clearly, this is very unfortunate that we keep experiencing this, but we're proud that we're able to deliver on our promises and help these families. As I flip to the group disability side, I would frame it as, we're seeing what we expected to see, and we're seeing what we prepared for as an organization. And as I frame this, this impact on the disability side was not the predominant impact on group insurance. It was the life side. But having said that, the disability benefit ratio was somewhat elevated at 85.9%. There were really two effects that were at play. In our fee-based STD and absence business, we are continuing to see a higher level of absence in STD claims. That really leads to more expense in the business, and you see that show up in the admin ratio. On the LTD side, as we talked about in previous quarters, we had both put up IBNR, but also we had built claims staffing to be able to -- be ready to handle what we expected to come, which we thought we would see enhanced incidents due to both the morbidity impacts of the pandemic, but also the impacts from the unemployment -- the subsequent unemployment. And we are seeing that. Our incidents on LTD was up about 10% in the quarter, and our severity was up as well, about 10% in the quarter. But again, this is what we expected to see, and this is what we prepared for. So we're handling it well. And we would expect, obviously, for this to improve and subside over time.\nErik Bass: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ryan Krueger from KBW. Your line is now live.\nRyan Krueger: Hey, good morning. First question was, what areas are you focused on additional derisking? Does that include more potential variable annuity transactions? And then, is individual life also part of the consideration?\nCharlie Lowrey: Yes. Hi, Ryan, it's Charlie Lowrey. I'll take that. As we stated in our opening remarks, we're making significant progress on executing to become a higher-growth, less market-sensitive and more nimble business. And this includes, as you rightly point out, the sales of our full-service recordkeeping business and our block of traditional variable annuities, as well as the completed sales of what we've talked about in Korea, Taiwan, Italy and Poland. We have also noted, to your point, that in the past, we're looking at other blocks of business that may include the areas that you spoke about. So we're accomplishing a significant amount, but we still have a lot of work to do. I would note that in terms of our overall goals, we have -- which we stated is between $5 billion and $10 billion of capital that we wanted to free up to reposition, we're already $6 billion into that, right? So we don't need to do other deals at this point. We are very happy with the economics of the deals we've done as we think it reflects the high quality of the businesses we have, but we'll only transact other deals if they make sense for all our stakeholders as we go forward.\nRyan Krueger: Thanks. And then a bit of a follow-up on M&A. So you've done a few deals, but they've been on the pretty small side, I think, in terms of capital, and you have a fair amount of capital coming in next year from the transactions you've announced. Do you still anticipate ultimately redeploying that additional capital freed up into M&A transactions over time, or if not, would you consider upping the buybacks again?\nCharlie Lowrey: Yes. I think what we've always said in the past, Ryan, is that if we can't find good uses for that capital, we will return that capital to stakeholders. But what I would also say is that we are looking both organically and inorganically at ways of redeploying that capital, and organic investment is another way of doing that. So we'll be very disciplined as we go forward in looking at potential acquisitions. The M&A is going to focus on, again, asset management and emerging markets as we increase the percentage of earnings from growth areas and reduce the percentage of our legacy traditional variable annuities but we\u2019ll continue to focus in a very disciplined way on those two areas. Andy mentioned in his previous comment the acquisition of Montana as a capital partner as an example of that, but we'll look at the pipeline that's out there and see if there are good deals to do. If they're not, we'll return capital to shareholders as we have in the past.\nRyan Krueger: Thanks, Charlie.\nOperator: Thanks. Our next question today is coming from Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners. Your line is now live.\nHumphrey Lee: Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. My first question is regarding the fourth quarter outlook for Assurance IQ. Can you talk about the preparation you've done so far in terms of -- for the enrollment period? And how confident are you in terms of kind of generating the necessary level of activities to support the breakeven AOI?\nAndy Sullivan: Humphrey, good morning, it's Andy. And thanks for your question. So as you know and as we've talked about in the past, we do expect our revenue at Assurance IQ to be strongest in the fourth quarter given the annual enrollment season. Medicare Advantage remains a very strong opportunity for us. If you look, last year, we had a little under 1% share in that marketplace, and that marketplace is growing at 10% per year. So there's a lot of space to operate. As you saw in the quarter, we continue to invest in the platform, both in the business overall, but specifically in the quarter, we invested in building out our W-2 Prudential agent force. And what we saw is coming into the annual enrollment period season, we came in with more agents than we had last year, and those agents were operating at a higher level of productivity right out of the gate. So we're encouraged versus last year. As I've said before, we're confident in what the platform can do for us in the long term and its ability to scale.\nKen Tanji: Humphrey, it's Ken. Just if I could add, as Andy said, we're well prepared. For the purposes of the baseline for the fourth quarter, we just simply put in a placeholder for Assurance at a breakeven because we wanted to neutralize for the seasonality, but it's not a forecast. It's just a placeholder to neutralize the earnings for the fourth quarter.\nHumphrey Lee: Okay. Got it. I see. Yes, because I was just thinking like what type of revenue level would you need to have in order to get to that break-even target, but it seems like this is just more of a placeholder as opposed to anything.\nKen Tanji: That's right.\nHumphrey Lee: Okay. All right. My second question is regarding PGIM, especially on the retail side. The flow seems to be -- kind of have softened a bit over the past couple of quarters. Can you provide some color in terms of what you're seeing there and what kind of actions that you have taken to improve retail flows?\nAndy Sullivan: Yes. Humphrey, it's Andy again. Thank you for your question on PGIM. So as we've discussed in the past, we will see natural variability and variation quarter-to-quarter when it comes to flows. This quarter, in aggregate, we saw modest inflows driven by a positive result on the institutional side, thanks to our work at fixed income and real estate. We did experience modest outflows on the retail side as a result of client reallocation out of equities and in the fixed income space into shorter-duration strategies. What I would say is, in any given quarter, you could experience client reallocations, and that can go either way. What we think is very important to keep your eye on is the long-term track record. And as I've said, this is a business where we've experienced a lot of flows over the long term and $11 billion year-to-date. That really comes from both outstanding capabilities and strong execution. We have a broad and diversified product portfolio in PGIM. And we -- as you've seen in the release, we continue to have exceptional investment performance with 94%-plus outperforming benchmarks in the three, five and 10-year period. So we're confident that while there'll be variability quarter-to-quarter, potentially in the near-term, we will be a net winner over time.\nHumphrey Lee: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thanks. Our next question today is coming from Tracy Benguigui from Barclays. Your line is now live.\nTracy Benguigui: Thank you. So assume this quarter so far is an early glimpse on LDTI with some company disclosures. There was one that was quantitative, another more qualitative. Your 10-Q is not out yet, but are you planning to add any disclosures there, like either now this quarter or in the near future?\nKen Tanji: Hey, Tracy, it's Ken. We continue to evaluate the new standards and refine our methods. And we continue to adjust as we move towards the effective date, and the effective date is still over a year away. And the impact also will be subject to rates at the time of the effective date as well as the actions that we have been taking and will continue to make to shift our business to be less market-sensitive. And that will have an impact obviously at the time of the effective date. So overall, we're making good progress on implementing the new standards, but it's too early to provide estimates, and that's where we are.\nTracy Benguigui: Okay. Maybe just one question on that, on your Japanese business. To the extent that there are dollar-dominated products, does that act like a mitigant at all in your view when those liabilities have to be marked to market?\nKen Tanji: Yes, we've had a long-standing capability and competitive advantage in US dollar business in Japan. And again, our Japan business is focused on sort of the lifetime needs of our customers with a primary focus on death protection, including those that are denominated in US dollars. It does have a long duration profile and it's supported with robust reserves and a high-quality investment portfolio and is very financially resilient. Again, we're not -- it's too early for us to provide estimates. But overall, although the accounting will be modified, we feel very good about the overall profitability of the business, the risk profile, and the financial strength of our Japan business, including the US dollar business.\nTracy Benguigui: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live.\nAndrew Kligerman: Hey good morning. I guess the first question is a follow-up on your capital management. Charlie, you made a comment -- two comments that you would look at the pipeline and that organic investing is a way to deploy the capital. So, could you clarify what you meant by organic investing and the amount of money that might that require? And then with regard to the pipeline, color on that. Is there -- because the two deals you did were rather small, is it possible that there might not be anything that really intrigues you, and you might have other uses for that capital?\nCharlie Lowrey: Sure. So, a couple of comments, taking them in order. In terms of organic growth, if you look at FlexGuard as an example, so we have pivoted away from the variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits and then started with new products and are investing in those and supporting those as they grow. And that really ties into becoming a less market-sensitive company, and frankly, a higher growth company. So, that's an example. So we'll look at the product pivots that we do as an example of organic growth. In terms of inorganic growth, I think there are going to be plenty of opportunities as we go forward, especially in the areas that we want to invest in, namely asset management and emerging markets, some of the growth areas. So, over time, I think we will find good places to put the capital. And as always, if we don't find places to put that capital to the extent that we don't have attractive opportunities that meet our strategic and financial criteria, we'll return the excess capital to shareholders as we've done in the past.\nAndrew Kligerman: Got it. That makes sense, Charlie. And then with regard to your international businesses in Japan, Gibraltar and the Life Planners, sales were off pretty sharply in the 30%-plus range. And in the press release, you cited the dollar-denominated product repricing that went on in the year ago quarter, that the people wanted to catch these products. Could you clarify for us whether those products written a year ago were adequately priced and adequate returns? Was there a possibility for anti-selection? And now going forward, with an emergency act and kind of that getting out of the rearview, is there a possibility that as COVID subsides, these sales could really jet upward?\nScott Sleyster: Thanks, Andrew. This is Scott. I'll go ahead and take that one. As you recall, we took significant crediting rate actions last August on our US dollar products. And that's really just part of our ongoing effort to maintain strong profitability on all of our new business activity. And that's across Japan, but across all of our other operations. And as is typical, that does create a sales surge ahead of the crediting rate, which typically pull sales forward from a quarter or two. And then additionally, I would say the impact of COVID emergency states, as well as the Olympics in Japan also dampened sales for a period. But we are happy with the recovery that we've had in sales. And if you look at the third quarter -- quarter-over-quarter, it looks good. In Japan, we benefit from having multiple distribution channels. We've got life planners, life consultants, the affinity channel, bank and third-party distribution. And further, I would say that we've made significant progress in using and enhancing technology and new strategies to support both our customers and our distribution channels. So, I think all of that put together says we feel pretty good about the sales momentum that we have. And we maintain a strong discipline and a continuous watch on our pricing actions. And where we're priced now, quite frankly, we don't foresee any material repricing actions on the horizon in Japan. And I think we made the actions that we took a year ago in a timely manner. Ken, were you going to say something?\nKen Tanji: I'd just say, our Japan business has consistently written business above its cost of capital. We are happy with the returns last year, and it's these pricing actions that keep us in good position from both a profitability, but a customer value proposition. So, it's been a pretty consistent story.\nCharlie Lowrey: And Andrew, it's Charlie, if I could just add one -- Andrew, if I could add one other thing, and that is what Scott alluded to, which is that we have been extraordinarily disciplined in looking at the pricing of all our products around the world, not just in Japan, but as Scott said, in all the other countries, including the US. And we've been really pleased as we've increased the pricing, as we've had to with the low interest rates, the strength of the sales, and I think that comes from 3 points of view. One is the strength of our brand. Second is the strength of the solutions we provide, such as \u2013 with the new introduction of FlexGuard in this example. And third is the quality of our distribution, which is both in-house distribution and through third parties. So, we have plenty of different ways of distributing the product and I think that endures to our benefit.\nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Tom Gallagher from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live. \nTom Gallagher: Good morning. So individual mortality held up pretty well this quarter despite the increase in COVID mortality and also by some measures, there was elevated non-COVID mortality also this quarter. In terms of describing why you think your block only had minor sensitivity, can you comment on what that might be? Is it just vaccination levels, older age, demographics and geography, or anything you could share on that?\nAndy Sullivan: Yes. Tom, it's Andy. I'll take your question, and thanks for the question. So when you think about our Individual Life block in the third quarter. I'd go through a series of items here. I think we did see lift. Third quarter, I think, as you're aware, is our highest underwriting gain quarter. So there's definitely seasonality that's showing in the results. We also saw in the quarter fewer large face amount claims. And again, that's the type of thing that will vary quarter-to-quarter. This quarter, we happened to just see fewer of those. I guess the -- when it comes to the pandemic effect, in particular, I would say that our block tends to be more oriented towards the Northeast as far as geographic distribution. And I think it's pretty clear that from a US death perspective, it was heavier in the Southern region of the United States. And then, yes, you mentioned this, but the average age of our ILI block tends to be older, and those older-age demographics tend to have higher vaccination rates.\nTom Gallagher: Got you. Okay. Thanks. And then for my follow-up, just curious, any updates on economic solvency regime in Japan? Is that still -- I think last I heard, it was like 2025. Is that still the timing? And if so, how do you feel that you're positioned to adopt that?\nRob Axel: Hey, Tom, it's Rob. I'll take a shot at that. To our knowledge, there's not been any change in the timing of that. The JFSA has been well synchronized with a broader international -- ICS, or the International Capital Standard, that's being rolled out. And so it's -- their plan has always been to sort of be slightly behind the implementation of that as their new solvency regime is closely aligned to that. And with respect to our Japan business, I think as both Ken and Scott have pointed out, the underlying economics to our Japan business are incredibly strong. And so we would hope that under both accounting and regulatory constructs that, that ultimately is visible. Having said that, we would -- we have articulated some concerns, as others in the industry have, with regard to both the international capital standard that's being proposed in terms of some fundamental flaws that continue to persist there. And then to the extent that those carry over into Japan's economic solvency regime, that would be a concern that we would have. But we continue to be in an active dialogue both on the international front and in Japan, along with a number of our peers. And we're optimistic that through that continued engagement, we can ensure that the economics of the underlying business get appropriately reflected in the regulatory constructs.\nTom Gallagher: Okay. Thanks, Rob.\nOperator: Thanks. Our next question today is coming from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, on the PRT business. You guys had some pretty good activity in the third quarter. Can you just talk about the pipeline there for the fourth quarter? I know that tends to be heavy towards the end of the year. And any initial outlook for 2022?\nAndy Sullivan: Yes. Elyse, hi, it's Andy. I'd be happy to take the question. So, we think the market in 3Q was in and around $17 billion and that's very consistent with what communicated on the previous couple of calls, that we felt the back half of the year would be very healthy. The average funded status for plans is around 97%, which is the best level in 10 years and they still have a very strong desire to transact. We think the total market size for the year will be in the neighborhood of $40 billion and we think that level of momentum will continue in the near-term. This is a space that, in many ways, we're a pioneer in and very much a leader in the space. As we've said in the past, we are very committed to it, and we are going to pick our spots. We're very confident that the strength of our brand and our capabilities and our track record. We're going to gain more than our fair share over time. But in the near-term, we do think the market is going to be healthy.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. And then my second question, going on to your Group Life book, you guys gave some good color on what you'll be elevated COVID boxes there in the third quarter. As we think about the fourth quarter in 2022, do you expect that you would see losses in line with kind of that same elevated severity that you've been seeing? And then how much of your losses that you've set up so far for COVID or IBNR?\nAndy Sullivan: So, Elyse, maybe I'll start and then Ken could follow-up. So, I kind of went through the dynamics of what's causing the elevated mortality, the three predominant things being the average age, the predominance of our book in certain segments, and the distribution of the claims being in places where the vaccination rates are lower. We would expect those underlying drivers to continue near-term into the fourth quarter.\nKen Tanji: Yes. And Elyse, in terms of IBNR, the -- it's -- we stayed pretty current on claim activity. So, the lag is measured in weeks and we have a pretty established process to measure that and so that continues. In terms of an outlook for 2022, we have not provided an outlook beyond the current quarter. And based upon, as Andy described, just sort of the continuation of current trends, we think that's the most reasonable approach. The situation is very unique and very dynamic, a lot of variables at play, whether it's social distancing or other preventive measures or vaccines and treatments and variants. So, we've -- in our baseline, we've extrapolated the current trends and that's what that reflects.\nElyse Greenspan: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from John Barnidge from Piper Sandler. Your line is now live.\nJohn Barnidge: Thank you. Just thinking about the group business, given the enduring nature of the pandemic, unfortunately, is there a need to build more administrative expenses to support that effort?\nAndy Sullivan: So, John, it's Andy. I think as we've talked about in the past, we actually have a higher level of both call and claims staff across our product lines. We hired out ahead of what we expected to see. So, we were well prepared as it was coming in. But we think that that level is already reflected in the admin ratio that you see.\nJohn Barnidge: That's great. Thank you. And then maybe my follow-up, just wanted to touch on that comment around LTD incidence increase in frequency and severity. How should we be thinking of this maybe in light of vaccine mandates? There's headlines about Boeing and Raytheon in percentage of workers there. I'm just trying to think through that in light of PRU's focus within the group market. Thank you.\nAndy Sullivan: So it's Andy, again. I guess I'd say two things. Our expectation for the number of deaths in the quarter take into account what we think the current approach is in the employer marketplace and the current landscape of mandates. To the degree, our book tends to be more of a national account book of business, and there are more mandates in that segment, I think that would be a help to us and a tailwind.\nJohn Barnidge: Great. Thank you for your answers, and best of luck.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is a follow-up from Tracy Benguigui from Barclays. Your line is now live.\nTracy Benguigui: Thanks for taking another question. I just want to touch on your upcoming combination of individual and institutional retirement business. Is this just to simplify your operational model after the pending full-service sale, or should we expect anything strategic coming out of that either on the expense or revenue side?\nAndy Sullivan: So Tracy, it's Andy. Let me take your question of -- about the drivers. So first and foremost, this is really a statement about our commitment as a firm to helping solve the retirement needs in America. And we continue to see a real need in the pension derisking area. We continue to see the need to lean in and help individuals in the retirement accumulation and deccumulation journeys. This was really about taking two businesses that had great momentum, that were market leaders in their space and combining together the market leading talent market and market leading capabilities. The benefits we expect to see is it will accelerate our decision making as we go -- as we continue to go after the retirement need and sharpen our focus on the retirement space. So that was really the driver, and it's an important step in how we're transforming our business mix and system.\nTracy Benguigui: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.\nJimmy Bhullar: So just a follow-up question on, Charlie, your comments around dispositions and/or derisking reinsurance type transactions. I think you mentioned annuities potentially and Individual Life as well. But how do you think about long-term care in that context? And is that a business where you're seeing counterparties emerge, or is it still like the bid ask as to why to expect a transaction in the near future?\nCharlie Lowrey: Yeah. I'll start and then maybe Ken can add to that, Jimmy. I think what you observed is exactly correct. So it is something that we would, obviously, look at if the market was there, but I think the market is extraordinarily thin at this point for bidders on blocks like that. I would also observe that we have a very relatively small block of business and a relatively young block of business. And as a result -- and one, frankly, that we feel reasonably good about, in fact, quite good about. So if we are, as we've said, going to be very disciplined about the divestitures we make and with an eye toward creating shareholder value, we need to get -- make sure that the -- if we did transact something that it would be a transaction that was in the economic interest of our shareholders. And given the young block that it is, the bid-ask spread, if you will, can be quite large. So we'll continue to evaluate options if they come up. But at this point, we are continuing to run the book, and the book is going quite well. Ken, anything to add.\nKen Tanji: No. I think that covers it well, Charlie. Nothing to add from me.\nJimmy Bhullar: And then, just on the -- can you talk about the operating environment in your two largest international markets, in Japan and in Brazil? Obviously, different stages in terms of COVID in both markets. But how are those businesses faring? And what your outlook is for sales, given the pandemic and economic conditions in Latin America?\nCharlie Lowrey: Well, why don't I start, Jimmy, with Japan, which I think I covered a little bit before. But I would say that the combined impact of the states of emergency and then the Olympics really did slow things down, and the effect of that really ran through September 29, with the state of emergency. We've come out of that nicely. And we really feel that our channels have benefited from our use of technology, as have our customers during this period. So we really feel like our sales organizations have adapted well to the new environment. And now that we see things out of a state of emergency and returning to a more normal state, you've seen a good sequential quarter. I would also say that, recruiting has been somewhat challenged during a coveted environment. We've also learned how to recruit and bring people on board in a more remote environment. But I think, as we come out of COVID, both the actual sales activity and the ability to recruit will continue to improve, and we see that as a positive sign. In Brazil, our sales have been improving from the combination of having a strong Life Planner model. But more importantly, we've been building our third-party distribution. And most recently, that's now exceeded a-third of our sales. And just a few years ago, that was closer to 10%. So we've seen positive momentum from the channels that we sell in. COVID hit harder -- quite frankly, a bit harder in Brazil than it did in Japan. And again, we're really happy with the resiliency that our sales force has shown there. So overall, we feel good about the trends in both markets. And I think the most recent quarter is indicative of why we maintain that confidence.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We reach the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Lowrey for any further closing comments.\nCharlie Lowrey: Thank you. And thank you all for joining us today. Our performance this year and the progress we're making on repositioning our business mix and advancing the cost-savings program, along with disciplined capital deployment, reinforces our confidence in our strategy to transform Prudential and generate substantial growth. We remain optimistic about the opportunity to continue to deliver strong financial outcomes to all our stakeholders. Thank you again for joining us today and for your time.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webinar. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Charlie Lowrey",
            "content": "Thank you, Bob, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. As always, we hope you and your families remain safe and healthy. Prudential delivered solid financial results for the third quarter, reflecting our strong investment performance and high demand for the products we've introduced to support our customers as they solve their financial challenges in a changing world. We also made significant progress executing on our transformation strategy to become a higher-growth, less market-sensitive and more nimble company. First, we reached agreements to divest our full-service recordkeeping business and to sell a portion of our traditional variable annuities, advancing our pivot toward less market-sensitive and higher-growth businesses. Second, we continue to advance our cost-savings program and remain on track to achieve $750 million of savings by the end of 2023. And third, with the support of our rock-solid balance sheet, we are maintaining a disciplined and balanced approach to redeploying capital. I'll provide an update on each of these transformation initiatives before turning it over to Rob and Ken. Turning to Slide 3. In September, we reached an agreement to sell a block of our traditional variable annuities to Fortitude Re. This divestiture, which is expected to close in the first half of 2022, represents approximately 20% of our traditional individual annuities account values and significantly advances our goal of cutting in half the earnings contribution of legacy variable annuities products through a mix of strategic transactions and natural runoff. This transaction expands upon our prior divestiture activity, including the agreement we announced in July to sell our full-service recordkeeping business and the successful completion of the sales of our Taiwan and Korea insurance businesses. As a result of these divestitures to date, we expect to generate net proceeds of approximately $6 billion by the first half of 2022. And we continue to explore additional opportunities to derisk in-force blocks of business. With the pending sale of our full-service recordkeeping business and our annuities block transaction, we have combined our individual annuities and retirement businesses to better serve the retirement needs of both individuals and institutions and support our growth strategy. Turning next to our cost-savings program on slide 4. We are progressing well and remain on track to achieve our $750 million cost-savings target by the end of 2023 as we look to reduce expenses while improving both the customer and employee experience. To date, we have achieved $590 million in run rate cost savings, exceeding our $500 million target for the full year. These savings include $145 million achieved in the third quarter for a total of $385 million this year. Turning to slide 5. We continue to demonstrate a disciplined and balanced approach to capital deployment by enhancing returns to shareholders, reducing leverage and investing in the growth of our businesses, all supported by our rock solid balance sheet. Year-to-date, we returned $3.5 billion to shareholders, including $2.1 billion of share buybacks and $1.4 billion in dividend payments, reflecting a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend, compared to last year. And we're targeting to return $11 billion of capital to shareholders by the end of 2023. During the third quarter, we also took steps to enhance our financial flexibility by redeeming $900 million of outstanding debt. This reduced financial leverage and generated $30 million in annual interest savings going forward. We also continued to deploy capital in our businesses to drive long-term growth. For example, this quarter, we completed a $5 billion funded pension risk transfer transaction, which is the fourth largest transaction in the history of the PRT market and demonstrates our expertise, ability to execute at scale and commitment to this market. We also deployed capital to support our ongoing pivot to less interest rate sensitive and higher growth products, including our FlexGuard and variable life products. Our capital deployment is supported by our balance sheet strength, including highly liquid assets of $3.8 billion at the end of the third quarter and a capital position that continues to support AA financial strength rating. Turning to slide 6. I'm pleased to report a meaningful expansion of our environmental, social and governance commitments. Earlier this week, we announced our commitment to achieve a net-zero emissions across our primary global home office operations by 2050, with an interim goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2040. We're also carefully assessing the emissions impact of our investment portfolio. As an immediate action, we will restrict new direct investments in companies that derive a material portion of their revenues from thermal coal. Separately, on the social front, the Prudential Foundation achieved an important milestone during the quarter, reaching $1 billion in funding to partners aimed at eliminating barriers to financial and social mobility around the world since making its first grant in 1978. These investments include funding aligned with our racial equity commitments to support organizations, such as those supporting minority-owned small businesses and historically black colleges and universities that foster black economic empowerment and address the racial wealth gap. This milestone by the foundation follows the $1 billion investment mark achieved in our impact investing portfolio in 2020. We are confident these actions taken alongside of our strategic transformation will help us build a more sustainable company on behalf of all our stakeholders. Thank you for your time this morning. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob. Yes. Hi, Ryan, it's Charlie Lowrey. I'll take that. As we stated in our opening remarks, we're making significant progress on executing to become a higher-growth, less market-sensitive and more nimble business. And this includes, as you rightly point out, the sales of our full-service recordkeeping business and our block of traditional variable annuities, as well as the completed sales of what we've talked about in Korea, Taiwan, Italy and Poland. We have also noted, to your point, that in the past, we're looking at other blocks of business that may include the areas that you spoke about. So we're accomplishing a significant amount, but we still have a lot of work to do. I would note that in terms of our overall goals, we have -- which we stated is between $5 billion and $10 billion of capital that we wanted to free up to reposition, we're already $6 billion into that, right? So we don't need to do other deals at this point. We are very happy with the economics of the deals we've done as we think it reflects the high quality of the businesses we have, but we'll only transact other deals if they make sense for all our stakeholders as we go forward. Yes. I think what we've always said in the past, Ryan, is that if we can't find good uses for that capital, we will return that capital to stakeholders. But what I would also say is that we are looking both organically and inorganically at ways of redeploying that capital, and organic investment is another way of doing that. So we'll be very disciplined as we go forward in looking at potential acquisitions. The M&A is going to focus on, again, asset management and emerging markets as we increase the percentage of earnings from growth areas and reduce the percentage of our legacy traditional variable annuities but we'll continue to focus in a very disciplined way on those two areas. Andy mentioned in his previous comment the acquisition of Montana as a capital partner as an example of that, but we'll look at the pipeline that's out there and see if there are good deals to do. If they're not, we'll return capital to shareholders as we have in the past. Sure. So, a couple of comments, taking them in order. In terms of organic growth, if you look at FlexGuard as an example, so we have pivoted away from the variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits and then started with new products and are investing in those and supporting those as they grow. And that really ties into becoming a less market-sensitive company, and frankly, a higher growth company. So, that's an example. So we'll look at the product pivots that we do as an example of organic growth. In terms of inorganic growth, I think there are going to be plenty of opportunities as we go forward, especially in the areas that we want to invest in, namely asset management and emerging markets, some of the growth areas. So, over time, I think we will find good places to put the capital. And as always, if we don't find places to put that capital to the extent that we don't have attractive opportunities that meet our strategic and financial criteria, we'll return the excess capital to shareholders as we've done in the past. And Andrew, it's Charlie, if I could just add one -- Andrew, if I could add one other thing, and that is what Scott alluded to, which is that we have been extraordinarily disciplined in looking at the pricing of all our products around the world, not just in Japan, but as Scott said, in all the other countries, including the US. And we've been really pleased as we've increased the pricing, as we've had to with the low interest rates, the strength of the sales, and I think that comes from 3 points of view. One is the strength of our brand. Second is the strength of the solutions we provide, such as \u2013 with the new introduction of FlexGuard in this example. And third is the quality of our distribution, which is both in-house distribution and through third parties. So, we have plenty of different ways of distributing the product and I think that endures to our benefit. Yeah. I'll start and then maybe Ken can add to that, Jimmy. I think what you observed is exactly correct. So it is something that we would, obviously, look at if the market was there, but I think the market is extraordinarily thin at this point for bidders on blocks like that. I would also observe that we have a very relatively small block of business and a relatively young block of business. And as a result -- and one, frankly, that we feel reasonably good about, in fact, quite good about. So if we are, as we've said, going to be very disciplined about the divestitures we make and with an eye toward creating shareholder value, we need to get -- make sure that the -- if we did transact something that it would be a transaction that was in the economic interest of our shareholders. And given the young block that it is, the bid-ask spread, if you will, can be quite large. So we'll continue to evaluate options if they come up. But at this point, we are continuing to run the book, and the book is going quite well. Ken, anything to add. Well, why don't I start, Jimmy, with Japan, which I think I covered a little bit before. But I would say that the combined impact of the states of emergency and then the Olympics really did slow things down, and the effect of that really ran through September 29, with the state of emergency. We've come out of that nicely. And we really feel that our channels have benefited from our use of technology, as have our customers during this period. So we really feel like our sales organizations have adapted well to the new environment. And now that we see things out of a state of emergency and returning to a more normal state, you've seen a good sequential quarter. I would also say that, recruiting has been somewhat challenged during a coveted environment. We've also learned how to recruit and bring people on board in a more remote environment. But I think, as we come out of COVID, both the actual sales activity and the ability to recruit will continue to improve, and we see that as a positive sign. In Brazil, our sales have been improving from the combination of having a strong Life Planner model. But more importantly, we've been building our third-party distribution. And most recently, that's now exceeded a-third of our sales. And just a few years ago, that was closer to 10%. So we've seen positive momentum from the channels that we sell in. COVID hit harder -- quite frankly, a bit harder in Brazil than it did in Japan. And again, we're really happy with the resiliency that our sales force has shown there. So overall, we feel good about the trends in both markets. And I think the most recent quarter is indicative of why we maintain that confidence. Thank you. And thank you all for joining us today. Our performance this year and the progress we're making on repositioning our business mix and advancing the cost-savings program, along with disciplined capital deployment, reinforces our confidence in our strategy to transform Prudential and generate substantial growth. We remain optimistic about the opportunity to continue to deliver strong financial outcomes to all our stakeholders. Thank you again for joining us today and for your time."

            "content": "Thanks Rob. I'll begin on slide 11, which provides insight into earnings for the fourth quarter of 2021 relative to our third quarter results. Pretax adjusted operating income in the third quarter was $1.8 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $3.78 on an after-tax basis. To get a sense for how our fourth quarter results might develop, we suggest adjustments for the following items. First, variable investment income outperformed expectations in the third quarter by $570 million. Next, we included a placeholder for COVID-19 claims experience in the fourth quarter that is a similar level to our experience in the third quarter. While we have provided this placeholder for COVID-19-related claims experience, the actual impact will depend on a variety of factors, such as infection and fatality rates, geographic, and demographic mix and the continued acceptance and effectiveness of vaccines. Third, we expect seasonal expenses and other items will be higher in the fourth quarter by $140 million. Fourth, we anticipate net investment income will be reduced by about $10 million, reflecting the difference between new money rates and disposition yields of our investment portfolio. And last, we expect the fourth quarter effective tax rate to normalize. These items combined get us to a baseline of $2.27 per share in the fourth quarter. I'll note that if you exclude items specific to the fourth quarter, earnings per share would be $3.05. The key takeaway is that our underlying earnings power has increased from last quarter, driven by the benefits of business growth, our cost-savings program and market appreciation. While we have provided these items to consider, please note that there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the fourth quarter. Turning to slide 12. We continue to maintain a robust capital position and adequate sources of funding. Our capital position continues to support a AA financial strength rating and have substantial sources of funding. Our cash and liquid assets were $3.8 billion, which is greater than three times annual fixed charges, and other sources of funds include free cash flow from our businesses and contingent capital facilities. Turning to slide 13 and in summary, we are executing on divestitures. We are on track to achieve our targeted cost-saving initiatives. And with the support of our rock solid balance sheet, we are thoughtfully redeploying capital. Now I'll turn it to the operator for your questions. Humphrey, it's Ken. Just if I could add, as Andy said, we're well prepared. For the purposes of the baseline for the fourth quarter, we just simply put in a placeholder for Assurance at a breakeven because we wanted to neutralize for the seasonality, but it's not a forecast. It's just a placeholder to neutralize the earnings for the fourth quarter. That's right. Hey, Tracy, it's Ken. We continue to evaluate the new standards and refine our methods. And we continue to adjust as we move towards the effective date, and the effective date is still over a year away. And the impact also will be subject to rates at the time of the effective date as well as the actions that we have been taking and will continue to make to shift our business to be less market-sensitive. And that will have an impact obviously at the time of the effective date. So overall, we're making good progress on implementing the new standards, but it's too early to provide estimates, and that's where we are. Yes, we've had a long-standing capability and competitive advantage in US dollar business in Japan. And again, our Japan business is focused on sort of the lifetime needs of our customers with a primary focus on death protection, including those that are denominated in US dollars. It does have a long duration profile and it's supported with robust reserves and a high-quality investment portfolio and is very financially resilient. Again, we're not -- it's too early for us to provide estimates. But overall, although the accounting will be modified, we feel very good about the overall profitability of the business, the risk profile, and the financial strength of our Japan business, including the US dollar business. I'd just say, our Japan business has consistently written business above its cost of capital. We are happy with the returns last year, and it's these pricing actions that keep us in good position from both a profitability, but a customer value proposition. So, it's been a pretty consistent story. Yes. And Elyse, in terms of IBNR, the -- it's -- we stayed pretty current on claim activity. So, the lag is measured in weeks and we have a pretty established process to measure that and so that continues. In terms of an outlook for 2022, we have not provided an outlook beyond the current quarter. And based upon, as Andy described, just sort of the continuation of current trends, we think that's the most reasonable approach. The situation is very unique and very dynamic, a lot of variables at play, whether it's social distancing or other preventive measures or vaccines and treatments and variants. So, we've -- in our baseline, we've extrapolated the current trends and that's what that reflects. No. I think that covers it well, Charlie. Nothing to add from me."

            "content": "Hey, Tom, it's Rob. I'll take a shot at that. To our knowledge, there's not been any change in the timing of that. The JFSA has been well synchronized with a broader international -- ICS, or the International Capital Standard, that's being rolled out. And so it's -- their plan has always been to sort of be slightly behind the implementation of that as their new solvency regime is closely aligned to that. And with respect to our Japan business, I think as both Ken and Scott have pointed out, the underlying economics to our Japan business are incredibly strong. And so we would hope that under both accounting and regulatory constructs that, that ultimately is visible. Having said that, we would -- we have articulated some concerns, as others in the industry have, with regard to both the international capital standard that's being proposed in terms of some fundamental flaws that continue to persist there. And then to the extent that those carry over into Japan's economic solvency regime, that would be a concern that we would have. But we continue to be in an active dialogue both on the international front and in Japan, along with a number of our peers. And we're optimistic that through that continued engagement, we can ensure that the economics of the underlying business get appropriately reflected in the regulatory constructs."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Andy Sullivan",
            "content": "So thanks, Erik. It's Andy and good morning, I'll take your question. So let me start by reiterating that PGIM is a business that has demonstrated incredibly strong ability to grow organically year-after-year. And that's really due to the success of our multi-manager model and the team's very strong execution. We've seen $55 billion in net flows over the last five years, and we've seen $11 billion in year-to-date flows. As we've talked about in the past, though, we do want to build upon that track record with programmatic bolt-on M&A. And we've been very assertive in making sure that we're both in the now and in the flow, and we are aware of these transactions in the marketplace. We're leaned into areas that are higher-growth and higher-fee-oriented areas. Three I would mention; we're looking to continue to globalize the business, specifically in Europe and Asia. We're looking to continue to build on our already strong alternatives business, where we have $250 billion in assets under management. And our acquisition of Montana Capital Partners is a great example of that. And we're looking in the area of real assets. As always, we're going to be disciplined in what we do and in how we deploy capital. To your question about sizable deals, we very much feel, if you look across our managers in PGIM, we are at scale. So it's unlikely that you would see us do what I would call a big pure-play scale deal. But to the degree that we would look and potentially do something larger, it would come with a key capability or strengthen us in a material way in a key geography and also bring along with it synergies. Sure, Eric. It's Andy. I'll take that one again. And let me start on the group life side. So as I'm sure you know and you've seen in the press, Delta has had a large impact on the country. The deaths in 3Q were 3 times what were expected. We were expecting 30,000 deaths, and we saw 95,000. We are a top three life and disability carrier, so -- and because of that, we have a very big and broad book of business. And there's really three effects that I would point to that we saw in the quarter. First, U.S. deaths in the age group between 35 and 54 tripled from a percentage perspective. And we cover a lot of younger workers. The average age of our group block is in the neighborhood of 46 years old. Second, as you probably know and expect, we have a large national account book of business and have a very strong share in health care, in retail and in manufacturing. These are areas where frontline workers are out and about by the definition and nature of their job, and therefore, more exposed. And then, the third thing I would mention is, about 50% of the pandemic impact we saw on the life side came from claims in the southern United States. So, clearly, this is very unfortunate that we keep experiencing this, but we're proud that we're able to deliver on our promises and help these families. As I flip to the group disability side, I would frame it as, we're seeing what we expected to see, and we're seeing what we prepared for as an organization. And as I frame this, this impact on the disability side was not the predominant impact on group insurance. It was the life side. But having said that, the disability benefit ratio was somewhat elevated at 85.9%. There were really two effects that were at play. In our fee-based STD and absence business, we are continuing to see a higher level of absence in STD claims. That really leads to more expense in the business, and you see that show up in the admin ratio. On the LTD side, as we talked about in previous quarters, we had both put up IBNR, but also we had built claims staffing to be able to -- be ready to handle what we expected to come, which we thought we would see enhanced incidents due to both the morbidity impacts of the pandemic, but also the impacts from the unemployment -- the subsequent unemployment. And we are seeing that. Our incidents on LTD was up about 10% in the quarter, and our severity was up as well, about 10% in the quarter. But again, this is what we expected to see, and this is what we prepared for. So we're handling it well. And we would expect, obviously, for this to improve and subside over time. Humphrey, good morning, it's Andy. And thanks for your question. So as you know and as we've talked about in the past, we do expect our revenue at Assurance IQ to be strongest in the fourth quarter given the annual enrollment season. Medicare Advantage remains a very strong opportunity for us. If you look, last year, we had a little under 1% share in that marketplace, and that marketplace is growing at 10% per year. So there's a lot of space to operate. As you saw in the quarter, we continue to invest in the platform, both in the business overall, but specifically in the quarter, we invested in building out our W-2 Prudential agent force. And what we saw is coming into the annual enrollment period season, we came in with more agents than we had last year, and those agents were operating at a higher level of productivity right out of the gate. So we're encouraged versus last year. As I've said before, we're confident in what the platform can do for us in the long term and its ability to scale. Yes. Humphrey, it's Andy again. Thank you for your question on PGIM. So as we've discussed in the past, we will see natural variability and variation quarter-to-quarter when it comes to flows. This quarter, in aggregate, we saw modest inflows driven by a positive result on the institutional side, thanks to our work at fixed income and real estate. We did experience modest outflows on the retail side as a result of client reallocation out of equities and in the fixed income space into shorter-duration strategies. What I would say is, in any given quarter, you could experience client reallocations, and that can go either way. What we think is very important to keep your eye on is the long-term track record. And as I've said, this is a business where we've experienced a lot of flows over the long term and $11 billion year-to-date. That really comes from both outstanding capabilities and strong execution. We have a broad and diversified product portfolio in PGIM. And we -- as you've seen in the release, we continue to have exceptional investment performance with 94%-plus outperforming benchmarks in the three, five and 10-year period. So we're confident that while there'll be variability quarter-to-quarter, potentially in the near-term, we will be a net winner over time. Yes. Tom, it's Andy. I'll take your question, and thanks for the question. So when you think about our Individual Life block in the third quarter. I'd go through a series of items here. I think we did see lift. Third quarter, I think, as you're aware, is our highest underwriting gain quarter. So there's definitely seasonality that's showing in the results. We also saw in the quarter fewer large face amount claims. And again, that's the type of thing that will vary quarter-to-quarter. This quarter, we happened to just see fewer of those. I guess the -- when it comes to the pandemic effect, in particular, I would say that our block tends to be more oriented towards the Northeast as far as geographic distribution. And I think it's pretty clear that from a US death perspective, it was heavier in the Southern region of the United States. And then, yes, you mentioned this, but the average age of our ILI block tends to be older, and those older-age demographics tend to have higher vaccination rates. Yes. Elyse, hi, it's Andy. I'd be happy to take the question. So, we think the market in 3Q was in and around $17 billion and that's very consistent with what communicated on the previous couple of calls, that we felt the back half of the year would be very healthy. The average funded status for plans is around 97%, which is the best level in 10 years and they still have a very strong desire to transact. We think the total market size for the year will be in the neighborhood of $40 billion and we think that level of momentum will continue in the near-term. This is a space that, in many ways, we're a pioneer in and very much a leader in the space. As we've said in the past, we are very committed to it, and we are going to pick our spots. We're very confident that the strength of our brand and our capabilities and our track record. We're going to gain more than our fair share over time. But in the near-term, we do think the market is going to be healthy. So, Elyse, maybe I'll start and then Ken could follow-up. So, I kind of went through the dynamics of what's causing the elevated mortality, the three predominant things being the average age, the predominance of our book in certain segments, and the distribution of the claims being in places where the vaccination rates are lower. We would expect those underlying drivers to continue near-term into the fourth quarter. So, John, it's Andy. I think as we've talked about in the past, we actually have a higher level of both call and claims staff across our product lines. We hired out ahead of what we expected to see. So, we were well prepared as it was coming in. But we think that that level is already reflected in the admin ratio that you see. So it's Andy, again. I guess I'd say two things. Our expectation for the number of deaths in the quarter take into account what we think the current approach is in the employer marketplace and the current landscape of mandates. To the degree, our book tends to be more of a national account book of business, and there are more mandates in that segment, I think that would be a help to us and a tailwind. So Tracy, it's Andy. Let me take your question of -- about the drivers. So first and foremost, this is really a statement about our commitment as a firm to helping solve the retirement needs in America. And we continue to see a real need in the pension derisking area. We continue to see the need to lean in and help individuals in the retirement accumulation and deccumulation journeys. This was really about taking two businesses that had great momentum, that were market leaders in their space and combining together the market leading talent market and market leading capabilities. The benefits we expect to see is it will accelerate our decision making as we go -- as we continue to go after the retirement need and sharpen our focus on the retirement space. So that was really the driver, and it's an important step in how we're transforming our business mix and system."

            "name": "Rob Falzon",
            "content": "Thank you, Charlie. I'll provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for our PGIM, US and International businesses. I'll begin on Slide 7 with our financial results for the third quarter. Our pre-tax adjusted operating income was $1.8 billion or $2.78 per share on an after-tax basis and reflected the benefit of strong markets and business growth, which exceeded the net mortality impacts from COVID-19. PGIM, our global asset manager, had record-high asset management fees, driven by record account values of over $1.5 trillion that were offset by lower other related revenues relative to the elevated level in the year ago quarter as well as higher expenses supporting business growth. Results of our US Businesses increased approximately 29% from the year ago quarter and reflected higher net investment spread, driven by higher variable investment income and higher fee income, primarily driven by equity market appreciation, partially offset by less favorable underwriting experience driven by COVID-19-related mortality. Earnings in our International Businesses increased 14%, reflecting continued business growth, higher net investment spread, lower expenses and higher earnings from joint venture investments. This increase was partially offset by less favorable underwriting results, primarily driven by higher COVID-19 claims. Turning to Slide 8. PGIM continues to demonstrate the strength of its diversified capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed income, alternatives, real estate and equities as a top 10 global active investment manager. PGIM's investment performance remains attractive with more than 94% of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last three, five and 10-year periods. Third-party net flows were $300 million in the quarter, including institutional net flows of $700 million, primarily driven by public fixed income flows. Modest retail net outflows of $400 million were due to equity outflows from sub-advised mandates and client reallocations due to rising rates and inflation concerns. As the investment engine of Prudential, PGIM benefits from a mutually beneficial relationship with our US and International Insurance businesses. PGIM's asset origination capabilities and investment management expertise provide a competitive advantage by helping our businesses to bring enhanced solutions and more value to our customers. And our businesses, in turn, provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated flows that complement its successful third-party track record of growth. PGIM's asset management fees reached another record, up 13% compared to the year ago quarter as a result of strong flows driven by investment performance and market depreciation. PGIM's alternatives business, which has assets in excess of $250 billion, continues to demonstrate momentum across private credit and real estate equity and debt, benefiting by our global scale and market-leading positions. As an example, PGIM's private businesses deployed almost $12 billion of capital this quarter, 28% more than the year ago quarter. This strategic focus on expanding higher-yielding products has resulted in stable fee rates over time despite industry-wide fee pressures. Now turning to Slide 9. Our US businesses produced diversified earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income and benefit from our complementary mix of longevity and mortality businesses. We continue to shift our business mix away from low-growth, capital-intensive and interest rate-sensitive products and businesses, transform our capabilities and cost structure and expand our addressable markets. In addition to the agreement that we announced in July to sell our full-service retirement business, this quarter, we also announced the sale of a portion of our legacy in-force annuities block to reduce the overall contribution of traditional variable annuities. These transactions are significant steps forward in shifting our business mix and product portfolio to reduce market sensitivity and accelerate long-term growth. In addition, our product pivots have worked well, demonstrated by continued strong sales of our buffered annuity products, which were $1.3 billion in the third quarter, representing 88% of total individual annuity sales. Since the launch of FlexGuard in 2020, sales have exceeded $6 billion. These sales reflect customer demand for investment solutions that offer the potential for appreciation from equity markets combined with downside protection. We have also exercised discipline through frequent pricing actions, and our sales continue to benefit from having a strong and trusted brand and highly effective distribution team. Also, our Individual Life sales continue to be strong and reflect our product pivot strategy, with higher variable life sales compared to the year ago quarter. Our retirement business reflected strong sales in the quarter, including a $5.2 billion funded pension risk transfer transaction and $1.6 billion of international reinsurance transactions, demonstrating our market-leading capabilities. With respect to Assurance, our digitally enabled distribution platform, total revenues, our primary financial metric as we concentrate on scaling the business, were up 47% over the prior year quarter. During the third quarter, we increased the number of agents to prepare for the seasonally higher expected demand of the Medicare annual enrollment period that occurs in the fourth quarter. Turning to slide 10, our International Businesses include our Japanese life insurance operation, where we have a differentiated multichannel distribution model as well as other operations focused on high-growth emerging markets. Sales across both Life Planner and Gibraltar operations were higher than last quarter amidst the state of emergency in Japan that ended on September 30th. However, sales were lower than the prior year quarter, which were elevated ahead of the US dollar-denominated product repricing in Japan that we implemented in the third quarter of last year. We also continue to see sales momentum in Brazil, particularly within the third-party distribution channel. We remain encouraged by the resiliency of our unique distribution capabilities, which have supported the continued growth of our in-force business. And with that, I'll hand it over to Ken."

            "content": "Thanks, Andrew. This is Scott. I'll go ahead and take that one. As you recall, we took significant crediting rate actions last August on our US dollar products. And that's really just part of our ongoing effort to maintain strong profitability on all of our new business activity. And that's across Japan, but across all of our other operations. And as is typical, that does create a sales surge ahead of the crediting rate, which typically pull sales forward from a quarter or two. And then additionally, I would say the impact of COVID emergency states, as well as the Olympics in Japan also dampened sales for a period. But we are happy with the recovery that we've had in sales. And if you look at the third quarter -- quarter-over-quarter, it looks good. In Japan, we benefit from having multiple distribution channels. We've got life planners, life consultants, the affinity channel, bank and third-party distribution. And further, I would say that we've made significant progress in using and enhancing technology and new strategies to support both our customers and our distribution channels. So, I think all of that put together says we feel pretty good about the sales momentum that we have. And we maintain a strong discipline and a continuous watch on our pricing actions. And where we're priced now, quite frankly, we don't foresee any material repricing actions on the horizon in Japan. And I think we made the actions that we took a year ago in a timely manner.

We reported strong financial results for the second quarter, reflecting robust investment performance and further progress in achieving our cost savings target. We also made significant progress executing on our strategy to become a higher growth, less market-sensitive, and more nimble Company. As an example, we announced an agreement to sell our full-service retirement business last month. Second, our cost-savings program is progressing well and is ahead of our original plan. And third, with the support of our rock-solid balance sheet, we are thoughtfully redeploying capital, both by increasing capital return to shareholders and by selectively pursuing acquisition opportunities. I'll now provide an update on each of these strategic initiatives beginning with our recent divestiture activity. Turning to Slide 3. Following the sale of our Korea business last year, we successfully closed on the sale of our Taiwan business during the second quarter. And in July, we announced an agreement to sell our full-service retirement business to Empower Retirement, in a transaction which is expected to close in the First Quarter of 2022. Including the announced full-service sale and the completed sales of our Korea and Taiwan businesses, we expect net proceeds of approximately $4.2 billion from these divestitures. Meanwhile, we continue to pursue opportunities to reduce the size of our legacy block of traditional variable annuities, with guaranteed living benefits. Moving to Slide 4. As I mentioned earlier, we are progressing well, and remain on track to generate $750 million of cost savings by the end of 2023. To date, we have achieved 515 million of run-rate cost savings, which exceeded our original target of 500 million, and did so 18 months ahead of plan. These savings include $130 million in the second quarter and a total of 240 million for the first half of 2021. We've also identified new cost savings to replace those we had not yet realized in our full-service retirement business. And as a result, continue to expect to generate $750 million of cost savings. Turning to Slide 5, these initiatives are complemented by our thoughtful approach to capital redeployment, including through increased shareholder distributions. Last month, when announcing our agreement to sell the full-service retirement business, we increased our share repurchase authorization by an additional $500 million, our second increase of this amount since the beginning of 2021. This brings our total shareholder distributions to a targeted $11 billion through the end of 2023, up from the 10 billion target we initially identified earlier this year. Year-to-date, we've returned $2.2 billion to shareholders, including 1.3 billion in the second quarter, comprised of 875 million in share buybacks and 460 million in dividend payments. In addition, consistent with our disciplined approach to capital management and guided by our philosophy of being prudent stewards of shareholder capital, we intend to reduce leverage and enhance our financial flexibility by redeeming $900 million of outstanding debt in the third quarter. Meanwhile, we are being disciplined in executing on our programmatic M&A opportunities as we have done in the past, with a focus on higher-growth areas, including asset management and emerging markets. As evidence of this, earlier this year our Africa joint-venture partner closed on a minority stake in ICEA LION Holdings, a highly respected financial service market leader in Kenya, with operations in Tanzania and Uganda. More recently in July, PGIM announced a deal to acquire Montana Capital Partners, a European-based private equity secondaries asset manager, which will enhance PGIM\u2019s capabilities and further expand its $250 billion alternatives platform. These transactions are consistent with our strategy to add capabilities in PGIM and deepen our presence in emerging markets, enhancing our growth opportunity. Our capital deployment is supported by our rock-solid balance sheet, including highly liquid assets of $4.9 billion at the end of the second quarter, and AA financial strength capital levels at our primary business subsidiaries. Before turning it over to Rob, I'd like to provide an update on our environmental, social, and governance commitments, which are integral to our business strategy and purpose of solving the financial challenges of our changing world. This Quarter, I'll focus on our environmental commitments. Last month, we took an important next step to integrate our ESG and financial frameworks, with the renewal of a standing $4 billion credit facility, which now directly links our financing costs to our progress in meeting previously established sustainability targets. These targets include reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, as well as improving diverse representation among our senior ranks. We also continued to make strong progress against other goals outlined in our 2019 Global Environmental Commitment, including investing in sustainable companies and projects, issuing our inaugural green bond last year, and by providing greater transparency around our general account investment allocations. We are also reducing our reliance on paper documentation both internally and in the volume of letters and other mailings shared with our customers. In partnership with American Forests, we aspire to significantly reduce our paper use by the end of 2022. We are committed to ensuring that sustainability runs through everything we do at Prudential. This also includes fulfilling the 9 commitments to advance racial equity that we established one year ago this week, which are in addition to our ongoing diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. I look forward to updating you next quarter on the progress of this work as well as on our other social commitments. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob for more specific details on our business performance.\nRobert Falzon: Thanks, Charlie. I'll provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for PGIM, U.S. and International Businesses. I'll begin on Slide 6 of our financial results for the second quarter. Our pre-tax adjusted operating income was $1.9 billion, or $3.79 per share on an after-tax basis, and reflected the benefit of strong markets, business growth, and lower than typical expenses, which exceeded the net mortality impacts from COVID-19. PGIM, our Global Asset Manager had record asset management fees, driven by record account values of $1.5 trillion that were offset by lower other related revenues, driven by a decrease in seed and co-investment income, and higher expenses supporting business growth. Our U.S. business results were more than double the year-ago quarter and reflected higher net investment spread results, driven by higher variable investment income, higher fee income, primarily driven by equity market appreciation, and a more favorable impact from our annual assumption update, partially offset by less favorable underwriting experience, driven by COVID-19 -related mortality. And earnings in our international business have increased 16%, reflecting continued business growth, higher net investment spread results, lower expenses, and a more favorable impact of the annual assumption update. This increase was partially offset by lower earnings from required co-investment in our Chilean pension joint venture, and less favorable underwriting results, primarily driven by higher COVID-19 claims in Brazil. Turning to Slide 7, PGIM continues to demonstrate the strength of its diversified active management platform as a top 10 Global Investment Manager. PGIM\u2019s diversified global investment capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed income, alternatives, real estate, and equities positioned us favorably to capture flows. In addition, PGIM\u2019s investment performance remains attractive, with more than 93% of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last three, five and ten year periods. Our diversified capabilities and strong investment performance helped to contribute to more than $5 billion of third-party net flows during the quarter, driven by continued strong public fixed income flows, with $5.6 billion of institutional flows partially offset by modest retail outflows. These retail outflows reflected continued positive inflows into PGIM's mutual funds, offset by outflows from sub-advisory mandates in U.S. equities As the investment engine of Prudential, PGIM also benefits from a mutually beneficial relationship with our U.S. and international insurance businesses. PGIM 's asset origination capabilities and investment management expertise provide a competitive advantage, helping our businesses to bring enhanced solutions and more value to our customers. And our businesses in turn, provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated flows that complement a successful third-party track record of growth. PGIM's asset management fees increased 16% compared to the year-ago quarter to a record level, as a result of market appreciation and continued positive third-party net flows. This contributed the PGIM's adjusted operating margin of 33%, which is above our expectation of 30% across the cycle. Now, turning to Slide 8. Our U.S. businesses produced diversified earnings from fees, net investments spread, and underwriting income, and benefit from our complimentary mix of longevity and mortality businesses. We continue to strengthen our businesses, transform our cost structure, and expand our addressable markets, while shifting away from low-growth, capital intensive, and interest rate sensitive products and businesses. Our product debits have worked well, demonstrated by continued strong sales of our buffered annuity, FlexGuard, which was $1.5 billion in the second quarter, representing 87% of total individual annuity sales. Over the past three quarters, FlexGuard sales have totaled $4.3 billion. These sales reflect customer demand for investment solutions that offer the potential for appreciation from equity markets combined with downside protection. We've exercised discipline through frequent pricing actions and our sales continue to benefit from having a strong and trusted brand and highly effective distribution team. Our Individual Life sales continued to be strong with higher Variable Life sales compared to the year-ago quarter, offset by lower sales of other policies, in particular, Universal Life sales, consistent with our product pivot strategy. In Group Insurance, financial wellness capabilities are core to our business success, and continue to differentiate our value proposition, enhanced benefit participation, and accelerate growth in our targeted markets. With respect to Assurance, total revenues, our primary financial metric as we concentrate on scaling the business, grew up 92% over the prior-year quarter. I would also note that similar to last year, we plan to increase the number of agents in the Third Quarter to help meet the seasonally higher expected demand of the Medicare annual enrollment period that occurs in the Fourth Quarter. Turning to Slide 9. Our international businesses include our Japanese life insurance operation where we have a differentiated multi-channel distribution model as well as other operations focused on high-growth markets. Sales across both Life Planner and Gibraltar operations held up well amidst the state of emergency in Japan. Life Planner sales were 49% higher than the year-ago quarter, while Gibraltar sales were 33% higher than the prior year. We remain encouraged by the resiliency of our unique distribution capabilities which have helped to continue the growth of our in-force business. And with that, I'll hand it over to Ken.\nKen Tanji: Thanks, Rob. I'll begin on Slide 10, which provides insight into earnings for the Third Quarter of 2021, relative to our Second Quarter results. Pre-tax adjusted operating income in the Second Quarter was 1.9 billion, and resulted in earnings per share of $3.79 on an after-tax basis. To get a sense of how our Third Quarter results might develop, we suggest adjustments for the following items. First, our annual assumption update and other refinements resulted in a net charge of 34 million in the Second Quarter. Next, Variable Investment income outperformed expectations in the Second Quarter by 365 million. Third, underwriting experience is adjusted by a net 30 million. This adjustment includes a placeholder for COVID-19 claims experienced in the Third Quarter of 25 million for our U.S. businesses, based on 30,000 COVID-19 related fatalities in the U.S. and 20 million for our international businesses. While we have provided this placeholder for COVID-19 related underwriting experience for the Third Quarter, the actual impact will depend on a variety of factors such as infection and fatality rates, geographic concentration, and the continued acceptance and effectiveness of the vaccine. Fourth, we expect earnings will be lower in the Third Quarter by 290 million, primarily due to the timing of expenses between the Second and Third Quarters. And the make-whole fee of approximately 90 million associated with a previously announced redemption of 900 million of debt in the Third Quarter. This also includes the reduction in adjusted operating income from the sale of our full-service business, which will be reclassified to a divested business, as well as retained costs that will be reported in corporate and other. Last, we anticipate net investment income will be reduced by about 10 million, reflecting the difference between new money rates and disposition yields of our investment portfolio. These items combined, get us to a baseline of $2.59 per share for the Third Quarter. I'll note that if we exclude items specific to the Third Quarter, earnings per share would be $3. The key takeaway is that our underlying earnings power has increased from last quarter, as the benefits from business growth, our cost savings program, and higher equity markets, more than offset the reduction in earnings from the sale of the full-service business. While we have provided these items to consider, please note that there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the third quarter. I would also note that with the debt make-whole fee and retained cost of Full Service, we now expect the full-year 2021 corporate and other loss to be about 1.65 billion. Turning to Slide 11. We continue to maintain a robust capital position inadequate sources of funding. Our capital position continues to support a AA financial strength rating and we have substantial sources of funding. Our cash and liquid assets were 4.9 billion, which is greater than 3 times annual fixed charges. And other sources of funds include free cash flow from our businesses and other contingent capital facilities. The redemption of debt, as previously mentioned, will complete our plan to reduce financial leverage in 2021 and generate annual interest savings of approximately 30 million, while also enhancing our financial flexibility for the future as we execute on our strategic transformation. Turning to Slide 12 and in summary. We are executing on divestitures. We are ahead of schedule on cost-saving initiatives, and with the support of our rock-solid balance sheet, we are thoughtfully redeploying capital. Now, I'll turn it to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [ Operator instructions]. And we do ask of you, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. And first we have the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW, please go ahead.\nRyan Krueger: Hi. Good morning. Could you provide an update on your progress toward a variable annuity transaction, and also I think in the past you had commented that the market tended to be interested in 1 billion to 2 billion in size VA transactions, also curious if that's still the case?\nAndy Sullivan: Hi, Ryan. Good morning. It's Andy. I'll take your question. Let me start by reiterating what Charlie said in his prepared remarks at the top. We are committed to significantly reducing the earnings contribution from traditional variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits. And as you remember, we talked about this is a two-step process. Step 1 is run-off. And we expect about 40% to 45% of the earnings reduction will come from run-off. And we're executing on what we consider to be a highly successful pivot. If you look at this quarter, we had 0% of our sales in those legacy products, those traditional variable annuities, and we experienced 3.8 billion in run-off in those products in the quarter. And we've pivoted to products that are much better balanced, consumer value with shareholder value, and obviously FlexGuard being the chassis product there, where we saw a 17% market share in the First Quarter and we were the number 2 provider of Index Variable Annuity. So step one is all about runoff. And now having said that, step two is a transaction, and conducting a transaction does remain a priority for us. We have work in progress, and we're progressing that work forward. As you noted, I would say the 1 billion to 2 billion range, if you look at the transactions that have been done in the marketplace is a good precedent, and I would say that we continue to see tailwinds of capital coming towards the space. As we've articulated before, we have a very high-quality block of business. As always, as we continue to progress, we are going to be disciplined to make sure we only do things that are shareholder-friendly and have the right economics, much like you saw us do with the full-service transaction. So we're going to keep moving down the tracks and we will share when we have something more to share.\nRyan Krueger: Thank you. And a follow-up is, other than variable annuities, but you've already said there in the full-service retirement sale, are there any other businesses that you'd consider divesting at this point?\nCharlie Lowrey: Hi Ryan, it's Charlie. As Andy said, and as I said in my opening remarks, we're making significant progress. I think executing on becoming a higher growth, less market sensitive, and more nimble business. And this includes the announced full-service sale, but also the completed sales of some of the things we've done before, including the sale of our Korea, Taiwan, Italy, and Poland businesses. So we'll continue to pursue opportunities to reduce the size of our legacy block, as Andy said, of traditional variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits, but as we've noted in the past, we're looking at life insurance blocks of business as well. So we've accomplished a significant amount, but we still have a lot more work to do, and we're going to be very thoughtful about how we execute on the dual goals of fulfilling our purpose, on the one hand, and creating value for shareholders on the other.\nRyan Krueger: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question's from Erik Bass with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nErik Bass: Hi. Thank you. Last night, we saw another jumbo PRT transaction, and one of your competitors was talking about this being potentially a record year for industry volumes and Pru\u2019s historically been the dominant competitor in the jumbo market. But now we're seeing some others take the lead. So I was just hoping you could talk about your appetite for PRT business going forward and the competitive dynamics in the market currently.\nAndy Sullivan: Thanks, Erik. This is Andy, I'll take your question. And thank you for your recognition. We absolutely have been a pioneer and a leader in the space of pension risk transfer. We have a great brand, we have very strong capabilities, and we believe that we have a unique and distinguished track record of execution. We also are seeing strong market opportunity. The market size in second quarter was about 4.5 billion, that was similar to what we saw in the first quarter. We expect the back half of the year to be very healthy. The average funding rate is 99% and sponsors still have a high desire to transact. That being said, this has become a more competitive market, both from the perspective of the number of competitors competing in it but also the number of competitors that are seeking larger and larger deals. Very consistent to what we've told you in the past, we're going to be disciplined in our approach, and we're going to pick our spots, and that is what you're seeing from us, and you should expect to see quarter-to-quarter variation. But if you combine the strong pipeline that we see going forward with the strength of our business, number one, we feel comfortable we could take this approach, and number two, we expect that we'll be a net winner over time and experience good flows.\nErik Bass: Thank you. And then for -- next question is, you highlighted two examples of programmatic M&A that you've done year-to-date. Can you give a sense of how capital was allocated to these transactions, and will deals of this size be enough to meet your capital reallocation targets, or do you expect [Indiscernible]?\nCharlie Lowrey: We've been on that one, we're not going to talk about the specific size of some of these transactions, but it is fair to say that we are taking a very disciplined approach and balanced approach to M&A, and that with programmatic M&A you can expect us to do more of this type of deal going forward.\nErik Bass: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead.\nHumphrey Lee: Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Just a follow-up on M&A. I understand some of the transactions you have done year-to-date, but just thinking about the impact of the full-service sale and the stranded cost being left behind. Is the priority going to be something focus more on the mature businesses that provide more solid earnings so that you can absorb and offset the stranded costs from the full-service sale?\nCharlie Lowrey: Yeah. Humphrey, it's Charlie. Let me take that one. First of all, again, we're going to take a very disciplined and balanced approach to this, but when we think about acquisitions, we think about them both from a strategic and a financial perspective. So from a strategic perspective, we look to add capabilities such as product or distribution or increased scale in a market or country. And from a financial standpoint, we look at a variety of metrics when assessing potential acquisitions and that can be earnings contribution, it can be growth. It's going to be a number of factors that we consider. But most importantly, our focus is on becoming a higher-growth, less market-sensitive, and more nimble business. And we're going to continue to be very thoughtful and disciplined about how we execute, with the goal of creating value for shareholders.\nKen Tanji: And maybe, Charlie, I'll just add. In terms of, Humphrey, what you described as stranded cost or the retained cost from the transaction, as we've demonstrated across the company, we've made excellent progress in transforming our operations, gaining efficiencies, but also including capabilities. We have an institutionalized process and structure and it's accelerating our progress on our cost objectives. We're focused on meeting the cost-saving objectives of 750 million by 2023, and as we reallocate and redeploy capital, we'll look to reallocate overhead across our businesses as well.\nHumphrey Lee: Got it. Shifting gears, you talked about using some of the proceeds from the full-service sale to lower your leverage. Can you just talk about the rationale behind the decision since the sale doesn't really trigger any issue with your leverage, especially given the expected gain from the sale?\nKen Tanji: Humphrey, this is really part of our regular review of capital and liquidity profile. And given our current position, we thought it was a good time to redeem the debt. That redemption will have a near-term earnings benefit, but it's also going to provide debt capacity and flexibility for the future. So it really just reflects, we thought it was a good way and a good time to reduce our debt in an efficient way.\nHumphrey Lee: Okay, so I shouldn't read it as like a potential VA transaction that may have an impact on your book value or you may be, more leaning towards, [Indiscernible] down the road, but it periodic, your regular review and just fine is a good term right now.\nKen Tanji: Exactly. I don't -- I wouldn't connect it directly to any specific transaction. It's -- we're overall regularly reviewing where we are and we thought it was a smart thing to do.\nHumphrey Lee: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Andrew Kligerman with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Kligerman: Hey, good morning. I'm thinking about Assurance IQ and that superb 92% year-over-year growth in revenue. But then you had a loss pre-tax of about 38 million, which was up materially year-over-year. Could you talk a little bit about, A, the growth rate? Can you keep at this pace? And, B, when might we think about a timeframe for when you get to breakeven?\nAndy Sullivan: So thanks Andrew, it's Andy, I'll take your question. As we've discussed in the past, we're very intentionally building out the business and the platform. And we're doing that because as we brought this business into Prudential, we saw just real opportunity and incredible customer demand. We saw again 7 million shoppers in the Quarter, and we're looking at hundreds of thousands of policies that we're going to have sold, and these are customers that we would have never reached at Prudential, so very much part of expanding our addressable market. As you look at those investments, there is, I'll call it a J-curve to those investments, whereas we're adding agents as an example, they will become more and more productive over time. And a number of these investments are fixed expense. So that's why we say the predominant metric is scale. We have to scale up to -- I'll use the word overcome that sixth expense. And we're seeing great progress. You know that we're also -- we're very pleased with the 112 million and the 92% growth rate. We believe that we have a lot of continued room in front of us to grow, to specifically answer your question. As to a specific timeframe around achieving the long-term economics, we're not going to provide more exact guidance.\nAndrew Kligerman: Yeah, that was helpful. And the buffered annuity markets. So now that was I think 87% of your total segment sales there. Do you see a point where you could get to the volumes even of what you were doing on the Legacy products, and how do you see the competition there? It seems like a lot of players have been jumping into the buffered annuity market, is that going to impede your growth?\nAndy Sullivan: Thanks for the question on the buffered annuity market and on FlexGuard. Let me start by saying, the driver of our success has a lot to do with; we're a very well established brand that's very well-respected, we have just an outstanding distribution system and distribution partners, and we came to market with a very differentiated product from the indexing strategy perspective. All of that has enabled us to have one of the best launches in probably the history of the industry. So we're very, very proud of it. The market itself is growing. So we're seeing more and more volume industry-wide shift from more traditional-type product designs over to the index variable annuity area. And I would think of this as more of a chassis. It's really a pretty broad area of accumulation-oriented products that have upside and downside buffering. So we see a good bit of room still to run. Having said that, we have at this time rolled it out to all of our third-party relationships and we're in all of our key geographies. So quite pleased with how we've done. As far as its ability to get to some of the very high levels that we saw have 5-10 years ago, I'm not going to put a prediction on that.\nAndrew Kligerman: Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question is from Tracy Benguigui with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nTracy Benguigui: Thank you. I have another Assurance IQ question. It looks like there is a changing of the guard, I understand the original founders are not there anymore, and have left before a potential earn-out, which would have been on meeting performance targets anyway. What is the new strategic direction under new management that we should anticipate?\nAndy Sullivan: Thanks Tracy, it's Andy. Let me hit the tail end of your question first. There is zero change in strategic direction or change in strategy with the Assurance platform, and with Prudential and what we're trying to accomplish. As you would expect, we have been adding to the team and deepening the talent as the business matures. You rightly identified the top of the house, Mike Rowell, a founder, has moved over to a Strategic Advisor role to me, that enables me to take a broader use of his experience and expertise. In addition to that, we promoted Allison Arzeno, who was the Chief Data Scientist, to be the CEO. I'm very excited by that. She is a fantastic leader and has jumped in and has continued the momentum. The other thing I mentioned is we've been very pleased that through the combination of Prudential 's brand and the unique and attractiveness of the insurance platform, we've been able to attract top, top industry talent specific for -- specifically for our product P&L roles. As an example, we recruited a gentleman by the name of Chris [Indiscernible], who has deep health expertise both in Core Health but also was a key leader at eHealth, and he's leading our Under 65 Health and Medicare Advantage. So we're pleased with the talent situation and we're confident that we have the right team and the right talent to take it forward.\nTracy Benguigui: Okay. Great. Maybe moving onto your assumption update, I see that you did not change your long-term rate assumption, and I get that interest rates are at a higher spot now than this time last year. But I guess my thinking was that ensures we still want to grade into lower version in the main assumption to prepare for LDTI. Is that part of your thinking at all or is it more near-term when you conducted your review?\nKen Tanji: Hi, Tracy. It's Ken. As you know, we've talked about we have a very established process for studying our long-term rate assumptions. And in doing so, we look at a variety of forecasts for long-term rates both internally and externally. And when we did that this year, we saw very little movement in those forecasts, and therefore, we didn't see it appropriate to change our long-term rate assumptions. So we look at it very consistently the way we've done it in the past. In terms of long duration target improvements, that's still a year-and-a-half away, we're making great progress in implementing that, and we'll be ready to adopt that on time, but it won't be a transition, it's an adoption date, and that's the method that we think is appropriate.\nTracy Benguigui: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nTom Gallagher: Hey Charlie, when you mentioned you were looking at life insurance risk transfer deals as well as VA, can you provide a little bit of color on the process here? Is that a dual-track process where you're simultaneously looking at both VA and life deals, so you could get either/or transaction and the timing is unclear between the two, or any way of sort of handicapping whether you're more likely to do life insurance or a VA first? And then just relatedly, now that you do have those two lines, you're looking specifically at doing risk transfer on, are we now looking closer to maybe the high end of the 5 billion to 10 billion of freeing up of capital that you guys had laid out?\nCharlie Lowrey: Let me start and then Rob can elaborate. So right now we've said that we're at 4.2 billion if you include Korea, Taiwan, and the full-service business. We won't make predictions, we've said 5 to 10 because we're going to take a very prudent approach to doing this. We don't have to do anything, but if it makes sense for shareholders, we will do things and we'll see where we fall out in there, but that's an intentionally wide band. In terms of annuities versus life insurance. I think we have said that we are we're focused on annuities right now, but we will also think about life insurance as we go forward. Rob, do you want to add to that?\nRobert Falzon: Just Tom, that we have distinct teams focused on each of those initiatives, but as Charlie indicated, the more important initiative from the standpoint of the impact we believe on valuation to shareholders and overall valuation to the Company, is to get the VA transaction done first. And so it's been a priority, but not necessarily to the detriment of having resources that are dedicated to looking at the opportunities within the life sector as well.\nTom Gallagher: Okay. That's helpful, guys. Thanks. Just a quick follow-up. The -- based on the guidance you'd given out for 3Q, it looks like you're estimating virtually all of the COVID impacts are going to come on group and not individual life. Is that what you saw in this quarter also? And you can provide a little color about what you're seeing from COVID impacts for group versus individual.\nAndy Sullivan: Yeah. Tom, it's Andy. I'll take your question. We saw in second-quarter COVID mortality impacts in both individual life insurance and group insurance. And going forward for 3Q, similarly, overall we estimate that we will continue to see impact from COVID mortality in both group insurance and in life, but I would note that that COVID impact in trend is beginning to moderate as we go into 3Q. I think what you're picking up there in ILI is the COVID impact is being partially offset by the fact that the Third Quarter is the highest Quarter for our seasonal underwriting results. So that's why that looks a little different in the exhibit.\nScott Sleyster: Tom, this is Scott. On the international front, we're continuing to see really modest impacts across the board in Japan. We are seeing more of our impact in our Brazil operations, and similar to the U.S., we are seeing a mix across both group and individual lines.\nTom Gallagher: Okay. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: And next we'll go to Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, when you guys announced the full-service sale, you did up your buyback by 500 million for this year. So as we think about additional transactions with CDA and perhaps life insurance, should we think about some portion of the capital potentially going to incremental repurchases, as well as for the M&A bucket?\nCharlie Lowrey: Elyse, it's Charlie. I'll take your question. We've said all along we want to be good stewards of capital. And we have and will continue to demonstrate disciplined and a balanced approach to the redeployment of capital within our businesses and to our shareholders, so that's the overriding concept. And to date, we've already returned a significant amount of capital to shareholders. We've returned over $2 billion and have increased both the dividend and the share repurchase authorization. So we plan over the next 3 years or through the end of 2023, to return $11 billion of capital. But stepping back, let me share with you how we think about capital allocation, and in particular optimization of that capital. Because we look across all our businesses, both domestically and internationally, to ensure that we're optimizing capital deployment, and we'll continue to look for ways to optimize that capital to maximize outcomes for shareholders. And as we've stated, to the extent we cannot find attractive capital deployment opportunities to meet our strategic and financial criteria, then we'll return excess capital to shareholders as you've seen us do in the past.\nElyse Greenspan: That's helpful. And then, when we think about corporate costs, I guess I'm thinking more of beyond 2020 and -- 2021, sorry, into 2022 and 2023. Can you give us a sense of how corporate costs could come in as we think about both implementation costs and how we should see those trending in the outyears, and then also the [Indiscernible] from the Full Service Retirement Business? I know the guide. So there's 1.5 billion in life up this year, but how should we think about corporate costs over the next couple of years?\nKen Tanji: Elyse, it's Ken. As I mentioned earlier, we're making great progress with our transformation effort, including gaining efficiencies, and it is a ongoing and institutionalized and continuous improvement process at this point. So we continue to expect to make progress towards our 750 million cost savings objective by 2023, and we think we're well on track to continue with that. Again, as we reallocate capital and redeploy capital, we'll reallocate some of our overhead costs, and you can expect that to continue as well. So Overall, we continue to make good progress with our cost objectives. I think you should expect us to continue to make progress like we have in the past.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question's from John Barnidge with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nJohn Barnidge: Thank you. With the group disability loss ratio coming down for 2 straight quarters, how should we be thinking about the relationship with the administrative expense ratio, as that's been elevated for a few quarters to handle those increased cases?\nAndy Sullivan: So thanks, John. It's Andy. As you rightly noted, we have had enhanced staffing levels in our group insurance business. I think we talked about this on previous quarters. Given the nature of the pandemic and the morbidity effects, we have seen an enhanced level of [Indiscernible] and absence claims, and we've been maintaining higher staffing levels to make sure that we provide the right level of service. We also have been making sure that we maintain our long-term disability claims staff at higher levels. So you're definitely seeing that as a contributor to the elevated administrative ratio. The other thing I would mention is, and we've talked about this on previous conversations, we have entered into a strategic relationship with Accenture to do some of the operations for us. And the nature of that, we're implementing that as we speak, and there's some transition costs, basically, that are doubling up. But that's a one-time effect, and over time, we expect everything we're doing in our group business will bring down the admin ratio as part of our transformation efforts.\nJohn Barnidge: Okay. And then second question; have you developed a sense of maybe vaccination rates of insured life blocks versus that of the general population?\nCharlie Lowrey: Generally, John, we believe that the vaccination rate of the insured population is higher than the general population, and that reflects a variety of factors between age, geography, and a number of things. But yes, we generally feel that the insured population has a higher vaccination rate.\nJohn Barnidge: Thanks for the answers.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Jimmy Bhullar with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nJimmy Bhullar: Good morning. First I had a question on your Japan -- your outlook for the operating environment in Japan, your sales were obviously pretty strong in Tokyo, but it was mostly because of easier comps. To what extent are you seeing an improvement in trends in the market as businesses are opening up, versus ongoing challenges given the increase in the case count in the country?\nScott Sleyster: Thanks, Jimmy. This is Scott. As you pointed out, current Quarter sales were well ahead of the prior year, but that was significantly impacted by COVID really ramping up at that time, but this Quarter was only slightly below the First Quarter, and as you know, our typical First Quarter sales are quite strong, because that's when we're closing out our annual incentive measurement cycle. Although the situation with COVID and it's related impacts remains fluid, dynamic, whatever you want to call it, we are pretty pleased with our strong underlying business performance this quarter, particularly considering the ongoing challenges of the global pandemic. The demand for our products remain strong, I'd even say somewhat elevated because of awareness of threatening life issues. And we continue to focus in Japan on our needs-based selling approach, and that's anchored by recurring premium death protection, and then we add on to that supplemental other products like accident, health, and retirement to meet our evolving customer needs. Our operations are also increasing and enhancing and adapting to the use of digital and virtual tools to support sales activities amid the social distancing restrictions. So that's -- maybe that's a longer answer than you wanted. I would say we feel pretty good about the level that we're at. We feel that we've adapted to the technology. I have to acknowledge that it is still difficult to recruit at past levels in both LPs and LCs amid the COVID environment. But right now, we feel pretty good, actually quite good about how the business is performing in Japan.\nJimmy Bhullar: Thanks. And on Assurance, when you had announced the deal, I think you had mentioned that there was the potential for up to a 1.2 billion of earn-outs. Can you discuss our results of [Indiscernible] versus the metrics that the business would have had to hit for the earnout payments.\nKen Tanji: Hey Jimmy, it's Ken. When we set that earnout, you may recall that it was above what we set as a baseline for the performance of the business. It was to provide compensation if they were to exceed our original expectations. So that's the way we thought about it when we did the deal, and that continues to be the way that earn-out is positioned.\nJimmy Bhullar: But you're not -- I'm assuming that you don't think that the likelihood of you having to be anything out is high; is that right?\nKen Tanji: Again, it was there to provide upside if they outperformed our expectations and that's still the way it's designed.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. And when can you -- so when would you have the clarity on whether or not you're going to have to be anything?\nKen Tanji: It extends to the end of next year, so we're midway through it at this point.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. And as based on the results so far, any color on yes or no or sort of how --\nKen Tanji: I think we've been -- Jimmy, I think we've been pretty transparent with the results so far. They're separately disclosed, so you can evaluate them for yourself.\nJimmy Bhullar: Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And next, we'll go to Mike Ward with UBS. Please go ahead.\nMike Ward: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was just wondering on the retirement segment net flows, there was some pressure. My understanding is that it's being driven in part by some seasonality in PRT flows coming through mostly in the second half. So I guess what I'm just wondering is should we be thinking about that phenomenon becoming more prevalent going forward with Full Service being divested?\nAndy Sullivan: Mike, it's Andy, I'll take your question. As I think you're aware, the PRT and LRT business, they are transaction-oriented businesses which means by definition, on the sale of inflow side, that's going to be episodic. But on the outflow side, it's going to be more steady and consistent, and we obviously have pretty large blocks given our past success. So I do think it's right to think of that, that will produce quarter-to-quarter variation, but I would repeat what I said earlier in the call, we are a pioneer and a leader in this. It has been quite competitive, and we plan to be disciplined, but given the opportunities in front of us, and given the strength of our platform, we think over the long term we'll see good flows and we'll be a net winner.\nMike Ward: Great, thanks. That's helpful. And then I was just wondering about the organic earnings mix change within the transformations, specifically annuities. I know you've mentioned the natural VA, value running off, but just wondering what we should be thinking for the trend in the dollar amount of earnings from annuities organically. Do you have a placeholder that you use to think about what you expect just from the trend in our organic earnings from annuities ex any deals? Thanks.\nAndy Sullivan: So --\nCharlie Lowrey: Sorry. Andy, go ahead.\nAndy Sullivan: Okay. Mike, what I would say is, we expect that as we said, we're going to be very committed to reduce the earnings from traditional variable annuities and that the run-off effect is -- will produce 40% to 45% of the overall result, and obviously, we would look to do transactions to get the remainder of the impact.\nRobert Falzon: Mike, it's Rob. I think the number that we've given out, is that the Legacy book runs off at about 3 billion a quarter, and so you can use that as sort of a metric for thinking about that runoff against the sales that we're doing on our newer products, which are less market sensitive and a very attractive [Indiscernible] and profile. You can look at the offset between those two to get a sense for how the earnings profile would run off absent to anything happening with markets. Obviously, what you've seen, is despite that net runoff. Our [Indiscernible] are up as a result of continued appreciation in the market.\nMike Ward: Thanks very much.\nOperator: And with no further questions, I will turn the call over to Charlie Lowrey for closing remarks.\nCharlie Lowrey: All right. Thank you very much. Thank you for joining us today. I hope our performance this year, the progress we're making on repositioning the portfolio, advancing our cost savings program and our thoughtful consideration to capital deployment confirms that our strategy to transform Prudential remains on track. We will continue to act with conviction, and with speed to evolve our Company and deliver greater financial opportunity to all of our stakeholders. We look forward to keeping you updated on our progress, and thanks again for your time today.\nOperator: COMPALadies and gentlemen, that concludes your conference call for today. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Charlie Lowrey",
            "content": "Thank you, Darin, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. As always, we hope you and your families remain safe and healthy. We reported strong financial results for the second quarter, reflecting robust investment performance and further progress in achieving our cost savings target. We also made significant progress executing on our strategy to become a higher growth, less market-sensitive, and more nimble Company. As an example, we announced an agreement to sell our full-service retirement business last month. Second, our cost-savings program is progressing well and is ahead of our original plan. And third, with the support of our rock-solid balance sheet, we are thoughtfully redeploying capital, both by increasing capital return to shareholders and by selectively pursuing acquisition opportunities. I'll now provide an update on each of these strategic initiatives beginning with our recent divestiture activity. Turning to Slide 3. Following the sale of our Korea business last year, we successfully closed on the sale of our Taiwan business during the second quarter. And in July, we announced an agreement to sell our full-service retirement business to Empower Retirement, in a transaction which is expected to close in the First Quarter of 2022. Including the announced full-service sale and the completed sales of our Korea and Taiwan businesses, we expect net proceeds of approximately $4.2 billion from these divestitures. Meanwhile, we continue to pursue opportunities to reduce the size of our legacy block of traditional variable annuities, with guaranteed living benefits. Moving to Slide 4. As I mentioned earlier, we are progressing well, and remain on track to generate $750 million of cost savings by the end of 2023. To date, we have achieved 515 million of run-rate cost savings, which exceeded our original target of 500 million, and did so 18 months ahead of plan. These savings include $130 million in the second quarter and a total of 240 million for the first half of 2021. We've also identified new cost savings to replace those we had not yet realized in our full-service retirement business. And as a result, continue to expect to generate $750 million of cost savings. Turning to Slide 5, these initiatives are complemented by our thoughtful approach to capital redeployment, including through increased shareholder distributions. Last month, when announcing our agreement to sell the full-service retirement business, we increased our share repurchase authorization by an additional $500 million, our second increase of this amount since the beginning of 2021. This brings our total shareholder distributions to a targeted $11 billion through the end of 2023, up from the 10 billion target we initially identified earlier this year. Year-to-date, we've returned $2.2 billion to shareholders, including 1.3 billion in the second quarter, comprised of 875 million in share buybacks and 460 million in dividend payments. In addition, consistent with our disciplined approach to capital management and guided by our philosophy of being prudent stewards of shareholder capital, we intend to reduce leverage and enhance our financial flexibility by redeeming $900 million of outstanding debt in the third quarter. Meanwhile, we are being disciplined in executing on our programmatic M&A opportunities as we have done in the past, with a focus on higher-growth areas, including asset management and emerging markets. As evidence of this, earlier this year our Africa joint-venture partner closed on a minority stake in ICEA LION Holdings, a highly respected financial service market leader in Kenya, with operations in Tanzania and Uganda. More recently in July, PGIM announced a deal to acquire Montana Capital Partners, a European-based private equity secondaries asset manager, which will enhance PGIM's capabilities and further expand its $250 billion alternatives platform. These transactions are consistent with our strategy to add capabilities in PGIM and deepen our presence in emerging markets, enhancing our growth opportunity. Our capital deployment is supported by our rock-solid balance sheet, including highly liquid assets of $4.9 billion at the end of the second quarter, and AA financial strength capital levels at our primary business subsidiaries. Before turning it over to Rob, I'd like to provide an update on our environmental, social, and governance commitments, which are integral to our business strategy and purpose of solving the financial challenges of our changing world. This Quarter, I'll focus on our environmental commitments. Last month, we took an important next step to integrate our ESG and financial frameworks, with the renewal of a standing $4 billion credit facility, which now directly links our financing costs to our progress in meeting previously established sustainability targets. These targets include reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, as well as improving diverse representation among our senior ranks. We also continued to make strong progress against other goals outlined in our 2019 Global Environmental Commitment, including investing in sustainable companies and projects, issuing our inaugural green bond last year, and by providing greater transparency around our general account investment allocations. We are also reducing our reliance on paper documentation both internally and in the volume of letters and other mailings shared with our customers. In partnership with American Forests, we aspire to significantly reduce our paper use by the end of 2022. We are committed to ensuring that sustainability runs through everything we do at Prudential. This also includes fulfilling the 9 commitments to advance racial equity that we established one year ago this week, which are in addition to our ongoing diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. I look forward to updating you next quarter on the progress of this work as well as on our other social commitments. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob for more specific details on our business performance. Hi Ryan, it's Charlie. As Andy said, and as I said in my opening remarks, we're making significant progress. I think executing on becoming a higher growth, less market sensitive, and more nimble business. And this includes the announced full-service sale, but also the completed sales of some of the things we've done before, including the sale of our Korea, Taiwan, Italy, and Poland businesses. So we'll continue to pursue opportunities to reduce the size of our legacy block, as Andy said, of traditional variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits, but as we've noted in the past, we're looking at life insurance blocks of business as well. So we've accomplished a significant amount, but we still have a lot more work to do, and we're going to be very thoughtful about how we execute on the dual goals of fulfilling our purpose, on the one hand, and creating value for shareholders on the other. We've been on that one, we're not going to talk about the specific size of some of these transactions, but it is fair to say that we are taking a very disciplined approach and balanced approach to M&A, and that with programmatic M&A you can expect us to do more of this type of deal going forward. Yeah. Humphrey, it's Charlie. Let me take that one. First of all, again, we're going to take a very disciplined and balanced approach to this, but when we think about acquisitions, we think about them both from a strategic and a financial perspective. So from a strategic perspective, we look to add capabilities such as product or distribution or increased scale in a market or country. And from a financial standpoint, we look at a variety of metrics when assessing potential acquisitions and that can be earnings contribution, it can be growth. It's going to be a number of factors that we consider. But most importantly, our focus is on becoming a higher-growth, less market-sensitive, and more nimble business. And we're going to continue to be very thoughtful and disciplined about how we execute, with the goal of creating value for shareholders. Let me start and then Rob can elaborate. So right now we've said that we're at 4.2 billion if you include Korea, Taiwan, and the full-service business. We won't make predictions, we've said 5 to 10 because we're going to take a very prudent approach to doing this. We don't have to do anything, but if it makes sense for shareholders, we will do things and we'll see where we fall out in there, but that's an intentionally wide band. In terms of annuities versus life insurance. I think we have said that we are we're focused on annuities right now, but we will also think about life insurance as we go forward. Rob, do you want to add to that? Elyse, it's Charlie. I'll take your question. We've said all along we want to be good stewards of capital. And we have and will continue to demonstrate disciplined and a balanced approach to the redeployment of capital within our businesses and to our shareholders, so that's the overriding concept. And to date, we've already returned a significant amount of capital to shareholders. We've returned over $2 billion and have increased both the dividend and the share repurchase authorization. So we plan over the next 3 years or through the end of 2023, to return $11 billion of capital. But stepping back, let me share with you how we think about capital allocation, and in particular optimization of that capital. Because we look across all our businesses, both domestically and internationally, to ensure that we're optimizing capital deployment, and we'll continue to look for ways to optimize that capital to maximize outcomes for shareholders. And as we've stated, to the extent we cannot find attractive capital deployment opportunities to meet our strategic and financial criteria, then we'll return excess capital to shareholders as you've seen us do in the past. Generally, John, we believe that the vaccination rate of the insured population is higher than the general population, and that reflects a variety of factors between age, geography, and a number of things. But yes, we generally feel that the insured population has a higher vaccination rate. Sorry. Andy, go ahead. All right. Thank you very much. Thank you for joining us today. I hope our performance this year, the progress we're making on repositioning the portfolio, advancing our cost savings program and our thoughtful consideration to capital deployment confirms that our strategy to transform Prudential remains on track. We will continue to act with conviction, and with speed to evolve our Company and deliver greater financial opportunity to all of our stakeholders. We look forward to keeping you updated on our progress, and thanks again for your time today."

            "name": "Ken Tanji",
            "content": "Thanks, Rob. I'll begin on Slide 10, which provides insight into earnings for the Third Quarter of 2021, relative to our Second Quarter results. Pre-tax adjusted operating income in the Second Quarter was 1.9 billion, and resulted in earnings per share of $3.79 on an after-tax basis. To get a sense of how our Third Quarter results might develop, we suggest adjustments for the following items. First, our annual assumption update and other refinements resulted in a net charge of 34 million in the Second Quarter. Next, Variable Investment income outperformed expectations in the Second Quarter by 365 million. Third, underwriting experience is adjusted by a net 30 million. This adjustment includes a placeholder for COVID-19 claims experienced in the Third Quarter of 25 million for our U.S. businesses, based on 30,000 COVID-19 related fatalities in the U.S. and 20 million for our international businesses. While we have provided this placeholder for COVID-19 related underwriting experience for the Third Quarter, the actual impact will depend on a variety of factors such as infection and fatality rates, geographic concentration, and the continued acceptance and effectiveness of the vaccine. Fourth, we expect earnings will be lower in the Third Quarter by 290 million, primarily due to the timing of expenses between the Second and Third Quarters. And the make-whole fee of approximately 90 million associated with a previously announced redemption of 900 million of debt in the Third Quarter. This also includes the reduction in adjusted operating income from the sale of our full-service business, which will be reclassified to a divested business, as well as retained costs that will be reported in corporate and other. Last, we anticipate net investment income will be reduced by about 10 million, reflecting the difference between new money rates and disposition yields of our investment portfolio. These items combined, get us to a baseline of $2.59 per share for the Third Quarter. I'll note that if we exclude items specific to the Third Quarter, earnings per share would be $3. The key takeaway is that our underlying earnings power has increased from last quarter, as the benefits from business growth, our cost savings program, and higher equity markets, more than offset the reduction in earnings from the sale of the full-service business. While we have provided these items to consider, please note that there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the third quarter. I would also note that with the debt make-whole fee and retained cost of Full Service, we now expect the full-year 2021 corporate and other loss to be about 1.65 billion. Turning to Slide 11. We continue to maintain a robust capital position inadequate sources of funding. Our capital position continues to support a AA financial strength rating and we have substantial sources of funding. Our cash and liquid assets were 4.9 billion, which is greater than 3 times annual fixed charges. And other sources of funds include free cash flow from our businesses and other contingent capital facilities. The redemption of debt, as previously mentioned, will complete our plan to reduce financial leverage in 2021 and generate annual interest savings of approximately 30 million, while also enhancing our financial flexibility for the future as we execute on our strategic transformation. Turning to Slide 12 and in summary. We are executing on divestitures. We are ahead of schedule on cost-saving initiatives, and with the support of our rock-solid balance sheet, we are thoughtfully redeploying capital. Now, I'll turn it to the operator for your questions. And maybe, Charlie, I'll just add. In terms of, Humphrey, what you described as stranded cost or the retained cost from the transaction, as we've demonstrated across the company, we've made excellent progress in transforming our operations, gaining efficiencies, but also including capabilities. We have an institutionalized process and structure and it's accelerating our progress on our cost objectives. We're focused on meeting the cost-saving objectives of 750 million by 2023, and as we reallocate and redeploy capital, we'll look to reallocate overhead across our businesses as well. Humphrey, this is really part of our regular review of capital and liquidity profile. And given our current position, we thought it was a good time to redeem the debt. That redemption will have a near-term earnings benefit, but it's also going to provide debt capacity and flexibility for the future. So it really just reflects, we thought it was a good way and a good time to reduce our debt in an efficient way. Exactly. I don't -- I wouldn't connect it directly to any specific transaction. It's -- we're overall regularly reviewing where we are and we thought it was a smart thing to do. Hi, Tracy. It's Ken. As you know, we've talked about we have a very established process for studying our long-term rate assumptions. And in doing so, we look at a variety of forecasts for long-term rates both internally and externally. And when we did that this year, we saw very little movement in those forecasts, and therefore, we didn't see it appropriate to change our long-term rate assumptions. So we look at it very consistently the way we've done it in the past. In terms of long duration target improvements, that's still a year-and-a-half away, we're making great progress in implementing that, and we'll be ready to adopt that on time, but it won't be a transition, it's an adoption date, and that's the method that we think is appropriate. Elyse, it's Ken. As I mentioned earlier, we're making great progress with our transformation effort, including gaining efficiencies, and it is a ongoing and institutionalized and continuous improvement process at this point. So we continue to expect to make progress towards our 750 million cost savings objective by 2023, and we think we're well on track to continue with that. Again, as we reallocate capital and redeploy capital, we'll reallocate some of our overhead costs, and you can expect that to continue as well. So Overall, we continue to make good progress with our cost objectives. I think you should expect us to continue to make progress like we have in the past. Hey Jimmy, it's Ken. When we set that earnout, you may recall that it was above what we set as a baseline for the performance of the business. It was to provide compensation if they were to exceed our original expectations. So that's the way we thought about it when we did the deal, and that continues to be the way that earn-out is positioned. Again, it was there to provide upside if they outperformed our expectations and that's still the way it's designed. It extends to the end of next year, so we're midway through it at this point. I think we've been -- Jimmy, I think we've been pretty transparent with the results so far. They're separately disclosed, so you can evaluate them for yourself."

            "name": "Robert Falzon",
            "content": "Thanks, Charlie. I'll provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for PGIM, U.S. and International Businesses. I'll begin on Slide 6 of our financial results for the second quarter. Our pre-tax adjusted operating income was $1.9 billion, or $3.79 per share on an after-tax basis, and reflected the benefit of strong markets, business growth, and lower than typical expenses, which exceeded the net mortality impacts from COVID-19. PGIM, our Global Asset Manager had record asset management fees, driven by record account values of $1.5 trillion that were offset by lower other related revenues, driven by a decrease in seed and co-investment income, and higher expenses supporting business growth. Our U.S. business results were more than double the year-ago quarter and reflected higher net investment spread results, driven by higher variable investment income, higher fee income, primarily driven by equity market appreciation, and a more favorable impact from our annual assumption update, partially offset by less favorable underwriting experience, driven by COVID-19 -related mortality. And earnings in our international business have increased 16%, reflecting continued business growth, higher net investment spread results, lower expenses, and a more favorable impact of the annual assumption update. This increase was partially offset by lower earnings from required co-investment in our Chilean pension joint venture, and less favorable underwriting results, primarily driven by higher COVID-19 claims in Brazil. Turning to Slide 7, PGIM continues to demonstrate the strength of its diversified active management platform as a top 10 Global Investment Manager. PGIM's diversified global investment capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed income, alternatives, real estate, and equities positioned us favorably to capture flows. In addition, PGIM's investment performance remains attractive, with more than 93% of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last three, five and ten year periods. Our diversified capabilities and strong investment performance helped to contribute to more than $5 billion of third-party net flows during the quarter, driven by continued strong public fixed income flows, with $5.6 billion of institutional flows partially offset by modest retail outflows. These retail outflows reflected continued positive inflows into PGIM's mutual funds, offset by outflows from sub-advisory mandates in U.S. equities As the investment engine of Prudential, PGIM also benefits from a mutually beneficial relationship with our U.S. and international insurance businesses. PGIM 's asset origination capabilities and investment management expertise provide a competitive advantage, helping our businesses to bring enhanced solutions and more value to our customers. And our businesses in turn, provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated flows that complement a successful third-party track record of growth. PGIM's asset management fees increased 16% compared to the year-ago quarter to a record level, as a result of market appreciation and continued positive third-party net flows. This contributed the PGIM's adjusted operating margin of 33%, which is above our expectation of 30% across the cycle. Now, turning to Slide 8. Our U.S. businesses produced diversified earnings from fees, net investments spread, and underwriting income, and benefit from our complimentary mix of longevity and mortality businesses. We continue to strengthen our businesses, transform our cost structure, and expand our addressable markets, while shifting away from low-growth, capital intensive, and interest rate sensitive products and businesses. Our product debits have worked well, demonstrated by continued strong sales of our buffered annuity, FlexGuard, which was $1.5 billion in the second quarter, representing 87% of total individual annuity sales. Over the past three quarters, FlexGuard sales have totaled $4.3 billion. These sales reflect customer demand for investment solutions that offer the potential for appreciation from equity markets combined with downside protection. We've exercised discipline through frequent pricing actions and our sales continue to benefit from having a strong and trusted brand and highly effective distribution team. Our Individual Life sales continued to be strong with higher Variable Life sales compared to the year-ago quarter, offset by lower sales of other policies, in particular, Universal Life sales, consistent with our product pivot strategy. In Group Insurance, financial wellness capabilities are core to our business success, and continue to differentiate our value proposition, enhanced benefit participation, and accelerate growth in our targeted markets. With respect to Assurance, total revenues, our primary financial metric as we concentrate on scaling the business, grew up 92% over the prior-year quarter. I would also note that similar to last year, we plan to increase the number of agents in the Third Quarter to help meet the seasonally higher expected demand of the Medicare annual enrollment period that occurs in the Fourth Quarter. Turning to Slide 9. Our international businesses include our Japanese life insurance operation where we have a differentiated multi-channel distribution model as well as other operations focused on high-growth markets. Sales across both Life Planner and Gibraltar operations held up well amidst the state of emergency in Japan. Life Planner sales were 49% higher than the year-ago quarter, while Gibraltar sales were 33% higher than the prior year. We remain encouraged by the resiliency of our unique distribution capabilities which have helped to continue the growth of our in-force business. And with that, I'll hand it over to Ken. Just Tom, that we have distinct teams focused on each of those initiatives, but as Charlie indicated, the more important initiative from the standpoint of the impact we believe on valuation to shareholders and overall valuation to the Company, is to get the VA transaction done first. And so it's been a priority, but not necessarily to the detriment of having resources that are dedicated to looking at the opportunities within the life sector as well. Mike, it's Rob. I think the number that we've given out, is that the Legacy book runs off at about 3 billion a quarter, and so you can use that as sort of a metric for thinking about that runoff against the sales that we're doing on our newer products, which are less market sensitive and a very attractive [Indiscernible] and profile. You can look at the offset between those two to get a sense for how the earnings profile would run off absent to anything happening with markets. Obviously, what you've seen, is despite that net runoff. Our [Indiscernible] are up as a result of continued appreciation in the market."

            "name": "Andy Sullivan",
            "content": "Hi, Ryan. Good morning. It's Andy. I'll take your question. Let me start by reiterating what Charlie said in his prepared remarks at the top. We are committed to significantly reducing the earnings contribution from traditional variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits. And as you remember, we talked about this is a two-step process. Step 1 is run-off. And we expect about 40% to 45% of the earnings reduction will come from run-off. And we're executing on what we consider to be a highly successful pivot. If you look at this quarter, we had 0% of our sales in those legacy products, those traditional variable annuities, and we experienced 3.8 billion in run-off in those products in the quarter. And we've pivoted to products that are much better balanced, consumer value with shareholder value, and obviously FlexGuard being the chassis product there, where we saw a 17% market share in the First Quarter and we were the number 2 provider of Index Variable Annuity. So step one is all about runoff. And now having said that, step two is a transaction, and conducting a transaction does remain a priority for us. We have work in progress, and we're progressing that work forward. As you noted, I would say the 1 billion to 2 billion range, if you look at the transactions that have been done in the marketplace is a good precedent, and I would say that we continue to see tailwinds of capital coming towards the space. As we've articulated before, we have a very high-quality block of business. As always, as we continue to progress, we are going to be disciplined to make sure we only do things that are shareholder-friendly and have the right economics, much like you saw us do with the full-service transaction. So we're going to keep moving down the tracks and we will share when we have something more to share. Thanks, Erik. This is Andy, I'll take your question. And thank you for your recognition. We absolutely have been a pioneer and a leader in the space of pension risk transfer. We have a great brand, we have very strong capabilities, and we believe that we have a unique and distinguished track record of execution. We also are seeing strong market opportunity. The market size in second quarter was about 4.5 billion, that was similar to what we saw in the first quarter. We expect the back half of the year to be very healthy. The average funding rate is 99% and sponsors still have a high desire to transact. That being said, this has become a more competitive market, both from the perspective of the number of competitors competing in it but also the number of competitors that are seeking larger and larger deals. Very consistent to what we've told you in the past, we're going to be disciplined in our approach, and we're going to pick our spots, and that is what you're seeing from us, and you should expect to see quarter-to-quarter variation. But if you combine the strong pipeline that we see going forward with the strength of our business, number one, we feel comfortable we could take this approach, and number two, we expect that we'll be a net winner over time and experience good flows. So thanks Andrew, it's Andy, I'll take your question. As we've discussed in the past, we're very intentionally building out the business and the platform. And we're doing that because as we brought this business into Prudential, we saw just real opportunity and incredible customer demand. We saw again 7 million shoppers in the Quarter, and we're looking at hundreds of thousands of policies that we're going to have sold, and these are customers that we would have never reached at Prudential, so very much part of expanding our addressable market. As you look at those investments, there is, I'll call it a J-curve to those investments, whereas we're adding agents as an example, they will become more and more productive over time. And a number of these investments are fixed expense. So that's why we say the predominant metric is scale. We have to scale up to -- I'll use the word overcome that sixth expense. And we're seeing great progress. You know that we're also -- we're very pleased with the 112 million and the 92% growth rate. We believe that we have a lot of continued room in front of us to grow, to specifically answer your question. As to a specific timeframe around achieving the long-term economics, we're not going to provide more exact guidance. Thanks for the question on the buffered annuity market and on FlexGuard. Let me start by saying, the driver of our success has a lot to do with; we're a very well established brand that's very well-respected, we have just an outstanding distribution system and distribution partners, and we came to market with a very differentiated product from the indexing strategy perspective. All of that has enabled us to have one of the best launches in probably the history of the industry. So we're very, very proud of it. The market itself is growing. So we're seeing more and more volume industry-wide shift from more traditional-type product designs over to the index variable annuity area. And I would think of this as more of a chassis. It's really a pretty broad area of accumulation-oriented products that have upside and downside buffering. So we see a good bit of room still to run. Having said that, we have at this time rolled it out to all of our third-party relationships and we're in all of our key geographies. So quite pleased with how we've done. As far as its ability to get to some of the very high levels that we saw have 5-10 years ago, I'm not going to put a prediction on that. Thanks Tracy, it's Andy. Let me hit the tail end of your question first. There is zero change in strategic direction or change in strategy with the Assurance platform, and with Prudential and what we're trying to accomplish. As you would expect, we have been adding to the team and deepening the talent as the business matures. You rightly identified the top of the house, Mike Rowell, a founder, has moved over to a Strategic Advisor role to me, that enables me to take a broader use of his experience and expertise. In addition to that, we promoted Allison Arzeno, who was the Chief Data Scientist, to be the CEO. I'm very excited by that. She is a fantastic leader and has jumped in and has continued the momentum. The other thing I mentioned is we've been very pleased that through the combination of Prudential 's brand and the unique and attractiveness of the insurance platform, we've been able to attract top, top industry talent specific for -- specifically for our product P&L roles. As an example, we recruited a gentleman by the name of Chris [Indiscernible], who has deep health expertise both in Core Health but also was a key leader at eHealth, and he's leading our Under 65 Health and Medicare Advantage. So we're pleased with the talent situation and we're confident that we have the right team and the right talent to take it forward. Yeah. Tom, it's Andy. I'll take your question. We saw in second-quarter COVID mortality impacts in both individual life insurance and group insurance. And going forward for 3Q, similarly, overall we estimate that we will continue to see impact from COVID mortality in both group insurance and in life, but I would note that that COVID impact in trend is beginning to moderate as we go into 3Q. I think what you're picking up there in ILI is the COVID impact is being partially offset by the fact that the Third Quarter is the highest Quarter for our seasonal underwriting results. So that's why that looks a little different in the exhibit. So thanks, John. It's Andy. As you rightly noted, we have had enhanced staffing levels in our group insurance business. I think we talked about this on previous quarters. Given the nature of the pandemic and the morbidity effects, we have seen an enhanced level of [Indiscernible] and absence claims, and we've been maintaining higher staffing levels to make sure that we provide the right level of service. We also have been making sure that we maintain our long-term disability claims staff at higher levels. So you're definitely seeing that as a contributor to the elevated administrative ratio. The other thing I would mention is, and we've talked about this on previous conversations, we have entered into a strategic relationship with Accenture to do some of the operations for us. And the nature of that, we're implementing that as we speak, and there's some transition costs, basically, that are doubling up. But that's a one-time effect, and over time, we expect everything we're doing in our group business will bring down the admin ratio as part of our transformation efforts. Mike, it's Andy, I'll take your question. As I think you're aware, the PRT and LRT business, they are transaction-oriented businesses which means by definition, on the sale of inflow side, that's going to be episodic. But on the outflow side, it's going to be more steady and consistent, and we obviously have pretty large blocks given our past success. So I do think it's right to think of that, that will produce quarter-to-quarter variation, but I would repeat what I said earlier in the call, we are a pioneer and a leader in this. It has been quite competitive, and we plan to be disciplined, but given the opportunities in front of us, and given the strength of our platform, we think over the long term we'll see good flows and we'll be a net winner. So -- Okay. Mike, what I would say is, we expect that as we said, we're going to be very committed to reduce the earnings from traditional variable annuities and that the run-off effect is -- will produce 40% to 45% of the overall result, and obviously, we would look to do transactions to get the remainder of the impact."

            "content": "Tom, this is Scott. On the international front, we're continuing to see really modest impacts across the board in Japan. We are seeing more of our impact in our Brazil operations, and similar to the U.S., we are seeing a mix across both group and individual lines. Thanks, Jimmy. This is Scott. As you pointed out, current Quarter sales were well ahead of the prior year, but that was significantly impacted by COVID really ramping up at that time, but this Quarter was only slightly below the First Quarter, and as you know, our typical First Quarter sales are quite strong, because that's when we're closing out our annual incentive measurement cycle. Although the situation with COVID and it's related impacts remains fluid, dynamic, whatever you want to call it, we are pretty pleased with our strong underlying business performance this quarter, particularly considering the ongoing challenges of the global pandemic. The demand for our products remain strong, I'd even say somewhat elevated because of awareness of threatening life issues. And we continue to focus in Japan on our needs-based selling approach, and that's anchored by recurring premium death protection, and then we add on to that supplemental other products like accident, health, and retirement to meet our evolving customer needs. Our operations are also increasing and enhancing and adapting to the use of digital and virtual tools to support sales activities amid the social distancing restrictions. So that's -- maybe that's a longer answer than you wanted. I would say we feel pretty good about the level that we're at. We feel that we've adapted to the technology. I have to acknowledge that it is still difficult to recruit at past levels in both LPs and LCs amid the COVID environment. But right now, we feel pretty good, actually quite good about how the business is performing in Japan."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Prudential Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, instructions will be given to you at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Darin Arita. Please go ahead.\nDarin Arita: Good morning and thank you for joining our call. Representing Prudential in today\u2019s call are Charlie Lowrey, Chairman and CEO; Bob Falzon, Vice Chairman; Andy Sullivan, Head of U.S. Businesses; Scott Sleyster, Head of International Businesses; Ken Tanji, Chief Financial Officer; and Rob Axel, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer. We will start with prepared comments by Charlie, Rob and Ken, and then we will take your questions. Today\u2019s presentation may include forward-looking statements. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions we make today. In addition, this presentation may include references to non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of such measures to the comparable GAAP measures and the discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, please see the slide titled Forward-Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measures in the appendix to today\u2019s presentation and the quarterly financial supplement, both of which can be found on our website at investor.prudential.com. With that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Charlie.\nCharlie Lowrey: Thank you, Darin and thank you all for joining us this morning. As always, I hope you and your families have remained safe and healthy. Despite the ongoing challenges created by the pandemic, Prudential reported strong results for the first quarter, including record adjusted operating income and robust sales and flows across many of our businesses. Our performance reflects strong underlying demand for our products, continued execution on our strategic initiatives, the complimentary nature of our retirement and life insurance businesses, which has helped us mitigate mortality risk, favorable markets, and the commitment of our employees around the world. We\u2019re on track with our key transformation initiatives and have increased returns to shareholders supported by our strong performance and the strength of our balance sheet. I\u2019ll cover each of these topics in more detail and begin with a brief review of the transformation initiatives, we highlighted for you in February. Turning to Slide 3. We\u2019re on track to deliver $750 million in cost savings by the end of 2023, $400 million of which were targeted for 2021. Cost savings for the first quarter were $110 million. The initiatives generating these cost savings are also producing better customer and employee experiences. And as a result, enhancing the competitiveness of our businesses. We are also in the process of reallocating $5 billion to $10 billion of capital by pursuing programmatic acquisitions to grow in asset management and in international emerging markets. In addition, we\u2019ll remain focused on investing in our other businesses to expand our addressable market and to continue to improve expense and capital efficiency. In parallel, we\u2019re actively executing on other means of changing our business mix and earnings profile by pivoting to less market and rate sensitive products, such as our buffered annuity product, FlexGuard, running off certain blocks of business and actively pursuing potential de-risking transactions. As a result, we expect Prudential to emerge as a higher growth, less market sensitive and more nimble company. As we execute against our transformation initiatives, you can expect that we\u2019ll continue to demonstrate discipline and the redeployment of capital within our businesses and to our shareholders. Turning now to Slide 4. In the first quarter, we increased our shareholder dividend by 5% and repurchased $375 million of common shares. In addition, based on our progress with our initiatives, as well as the improving macro economic outlook and the more favorable equity market and interest rate environment, we announced a $500 million increase to our 2021 share repurchase authorization. We expect to repurchase these additional shares starting in the second quarter. As a result, we now expect to return $10.5 billion to shareholders through 2023. Moving to Slide 5. Our expanded shareholder return program is supported by our rock solid balance sheet, which included $5.4 billion in highly liquid assets at the end of the first quarter. Our operating subsidiaries continued to hold capital to support AA financial strength ratings. And we have a high quality investment portfolio. Turning to Slide 6. We are also executing on behalf of our stakeholders through our commitment to environmental, social and governance actions. This work has long been reflected in our purpose as a company of solving the financial challenges of our changing world and is as important as ever. Of recent note, on the environment, we have made significant progress, reducing emissions, waste and paper. And we continually evaluate how we can improve our impact on the environment. On social issues, we have invested further in our people with training and development programs and continued to maintain a high level of pay equity throughout the firm. We also achieved our three-year goal that we created in 2017 of increasing representation of diverse persons among our senior management by five points over that time period. We followed this by establishing new goals and are continuing to tie our goals to management compensation as we did in the prior period. And we\u2019re already making progress on our commitments to advance racial equity, which we announced last summer. On governance, we continually refresh our board with people who are highly skilled and who also reflect the diverse communities and geographies that we serve. Today, 82% of our independent directors are diverse. You can see more details on how we\u2019re progressing against our goals and commitments in our ESG summary report that we published in March. Before closing, I would like to thank all of our employees around the world. It\u2019s through their continued hard work and dedication that we\u2019ve been able to support our customers and colleagues during these challenging times, all while advancing our company\u2019s transformation and purpose of making lives better by solving the financial challenges of our changing world. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Rob for more specific details on our business performance.\nRob Axel: Thank you, Charlie. I\u2019ll provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for our U.S., PGIM and international businesses. Turning to Slide 7, I\u2019ll begin with our financial results for the first quarter. Our pretax adjusted operating income was a record high of $2.1 billion or $4.11 per share on an after-tax basis. Earnings exceeded the year ago quarter across all of our businesses. Results of our U.S. businesses were up 38% and reflected higher net investment spread results driven by higher variable investment income and higher fee income, primarily driven by equity market appreciation, partially offset by less favorable underwriting experience driven by COVID-19-related mortality. PGIM, our global asset manager had record high results, including a gain on the sale of our Italian joint venture. Our partner was acquired by another firm with an existing asset management business and expressed a desire to purchase our interest, which was a rated retained under the joint venture agreement. Nonetheless, assets under management of $1.5 trillion were up 12% from year ago, driving asset management fees to a record level. And earnings in our international businesses increased 25%, reflecting business growth, higher net investment spread, more favorable underwriting results and higher earnings from our Chilean pension joint venture. Turning to Slide 8. Our U.S. businesses produced diversified earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income to benefit from a complimentary mix of longevity and mortality businesses. As Charlie noted, we continue to make progress in shifting away from capital intensive and interest rate sensitive products. Our productivity have worked well with sales of our buffered annuity, FlexGuard, growing to $1.6 billion in the first quarter, representing 84% of total annuity sales, up from $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. Our sales reflect increasing customer demand for investment solutions that offer the potential for appreciation from equity markets combined with downside protection. In addition, we benefit from having a strong and trusted brand as well as a highly effective distribution team that has significant reach with Prudential Advisors and third-party advisors. We are engaging with a broad range of advisors with FlexGuard. We also leverage our broad multi-dimensional relationships with our strategic partners that both distribute our products and manage the assets of our clients. With respect to Individual Life, we increased sales by 9% compared to the year ago quarter as higher variable life sales offset lower sales of other policies, in particular, universal life sales consistent with our product pivot strategy. In our retirement business, account values were a record high, up 23% from a year ago, driven by business growth and market appreciation. Net flows in the quarter were $6 billion, including a longevity re-insurance transaction in excess of $8 billion. With respect to assurance, total revenues are our primary financial metric as we concentrate on scaling the business were up 80% over the prior quarter. We grew all business lines, particularly in Medicare, where we expanded distribution to increase sales outside of the fourth quarter annual enrollment period. Now turning to Slide 9. PGIM continues to demonstrate the strength of its diversified active management platform as a top 10 global investment manager. PGIM\u2019s diversified global investment capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed income, alternatives, real estate and equities, position us favorably to capture flows. In addition, PGIM\u2019s investment performance remains attractive with approximately 90% or more of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last 3-, 5- and 10-year periods. Our diversified capabilities and strong investment performance helps contribute to more than $5 billion of third-party net flows during the quarter, including $4 billion of retail and $1 billion of institutional flows. Offsetting the growth in net flows was a decrease in the market value of our fixed income assets, reflecting the increase in interest rates. As the investment engine of Prudential, PGIM, also benefits from a symbiotic relationship with our U.S. and international insurance businesses. PGIM\u2019s asset origination capabilities and investment management expertise provide a competitive advantage, helping our businesses to bring enhanced solutions and more value to our customers. And our businesses in turn provide a differentiated source of growth for PGIM through affiliated flows that compliment its successful third-party track record of growth. PGIM\u2019s asset management fees increased 15% compared to the year ago quarter to a record level as a result of market appreciation and continued positive third-party net flows. This contributed to an 8 point increase in PGIM\u2019s net adjusted operating margin, including the gain on the sale of the Italy joint venture \u2013 excuse me, excluding the gain on the sale of the Italy joint venture compared to the year ago quarter consistent with our expectation of 30% across the cycle. Turning to Slide 10. Our international businesses include our Japanese life insurance operation, where we have a differentiated multi-channel distribution model, as well as other operations focused on high growth markets. While sales across both Life Planner and Gibraltar operations were lower than the prior year, reflecting the disruption from Japan\u2019s metropolitan areas being in a state of emergency this quarter, as well as lower demand for our U.S. dollar denominated products, following price increases last year, profitability increased significantly. We remain encouraged by the resiliency of our unique distribution capabilities, which has helped to continue to grow our in-force business. And with that, I\u2019ll now hand it over to Ken.\nKen Tanji: Thanks, Rob. I\u2019ll begin on Slide 11, which provides insight into earnings for the second quarter of 2021 relative to our first quarter results. Pre-tax adjusted operating income in the first quarter was $2.1 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $4.11 on an after-tax basis; then we adjust for the following items. First, variable investment income outperformed expectations in the first quarter, which is worth $275 million. Second, we adjust underwriting experience by $160 million. This includes a placeholder for COVID-19 claims experience of an additional $70 million based upon 55,000 COVID-19 related fatalities in the U.S. during the second quarter. Third, we expect expenses and other items to be approximately $500 million lower in the second quarter, primarily as a result of favorable items in first quarter, including the $378 million gain from the sale of PGIM\u2019s joint venture in Italy and seasonality. Fourth, we anticipate net investment income will be reduced by $10 million, reflecting difference between new money rates to disposition yields of our investment portfolio. These items combined get us to a baseline of $2.89 per share for the second quarter. I\u2019ll note that if you exclude items specific to the second quarter, earnings per share would be $2.97. The key takeaway is that our underlying earnings power increased from last quarter, including the benefit from business growth and higher equity markets. While we have provided these items to consider, please note that there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the second quarter. I would also note that we continue to expect the full year 2021 corporate and other loss to be about $1.5 billion. On Slide 12, we provided an update on the potential impact of the pandemic. Consistent with the information we provided on our fourth quarter call, the estimated sensitivity of operating income for $100,000 incremental U.S. death due to the pandemic is about $85 million. As I noted earlier, our second quarter baseline includes a net mortality impact of $70 million due to COVID-19. The actual impact will depend on a variety of factors, such as infection and fatality rates, geographic concentration, and the continued speed acceptance and effectiveness of the vaccine rollout. Turning to Slide 13. We continued to maintain a robust capital position and adequate sources of funding. Our capital position continues to support AA financial strength rating, and we have substantial sources of funding. Our cash and liquid assets were $5.4 billion, which is greater than 3 times annual fixed charges and other sources of funds include free cash flow from our businesses and other continued capital facilities. Turning to Slide 14. And in summary, we are on track with our key initiatives that we maintain disciplined capital management while returning additional capital to shareholders, and we continue to benefit from the support of our rock solid balance sheet. Now I\u2019ll turn it to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Tom Gallagher with Evercore. Your line is open.\nTom Gallagher: Good morning. Charlie, just wanted to see if we can get an update on potential timing and sizing of risk transfer deals, where things stand now for freeing up capital, and also say a team question on the programmatic M&A you\u2019re targeting.\nRob Axel: Hey, Tom, it\u2019s Rob. Let me take a first shot at that, if you don\u2019t mind. So thank you for the question. The first actually, let me start with a reminder, a large portion of the broader business mix objectives that we have are actually going to achieve \u2013 be achieved organically. The internal growth objective we have, which essentially to double the growth of our \u2013 double the size of our growth businesses about a third of that is that targeted increase will come from the organic growth of those businesses. And then with respect to the targeted reduction specifically bringing our annuities business down to around 10% or so of total contribution 40% to 45% of that comes from the runoff of our legacy block. We didn\u2019t expect capital redeployment in the form of \u2013 on the growth side, programmatic acquisitions and then on the reduction side re-insurance and/or sales to largely closed the remainder of the gap. And as Charlie indicated in his opening remarks, we are actively executing on that, including through de-risking transactions on the reduction side. While we\u2019re making progress, we\u2019re not yet in a position Tom, where we\u2019re going to speak any more specifically, although, I\u2019d like to reiterate what we said before. First, these transactions are generally complex and therefore, they require time. And secondly, we intend to remain disciplined transacting both with respect to the dispositions as well as acquisitions to ensure that we\u2019re creating value for our shareholders in any transaction that we undertake. That\u2019s why we indicated sort of a relatively broad range of the $5 billion to $10 billion and a multi-year period for accomplishing that. Probably the last thing I\u2019d want to mention is that the product repricing and pivots that we\u2019ve been undertaking are also important levers to change in that business mix. And maybe Andy, if you don\u2019t mind, you could just sort of give a quick update on that.\nAndy Sullivan: Sure, Rob. Tom, good morning. So I\u2019ll make this very specific. So let\u2019s talk about annuity. So as we\u2019ve talked about step one in de-risking is the runoff and that started with ceasing of sales. So you saw this quarter where we only had 1% of our sales that came from traditional variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits. And we very successfully have pivoted over to FlexGuard, we will expect to see about a $3 billion per quarter runoff in that traditional variable annuity block of business. This quarter, we saw about $3.8 billion. As we pivoted to FlexGuard, we\u2019re putting into the market a very different type of product that better balances consumer value with shareholder value. And we could not be more pleased with the success of that product. We had a 14.5% market share back in 4Q and as you saw, our sales have continued to expand where we had $1.6 billion in sales this quarter. That is really coming off the strength of our brand and the strength of our distribution. And we\u2019re very happy with the returns and the risk profile of that new business that we\u2019re putting on the book. So it\u2019s a very good example of how step one is all about the runoff and pivot.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo and your line is open.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi. Thanks. My first question maybe following-up on Tom\u2019s question, just on the M&A side of things. So you guys mentioned PGIM and emerging markets as areas where you have book to deals. As you\u2019re executing on that plan can you just give us a sense of what you\u2019re seeing out there from the M&A perspective as you\u2019re kind of looking to execute there?\nCharlie Lowrey: Sure. Elyse, this is Charlie. Let me just take a step back if you will, and put what we\u2019re doing into context, and then I\u2019ll answer your specific question. As we look at the journey we\u2019re on, if you will, we as a management team are laser focused on three goals. Well, the first is to deliver strong and consistent performance. And hopefully you\u2019ve seen that. The second is to execute on the transformation that Rob and Andy just talked about, and there are three parts to that. One is pivoting our products to be less market sensitive and capital sensitive. The second is to execute on our cost efficiency goals. And you saw that we expanded our goals by 50% last year and are ahead of track. And the third is to lean into the higher growth markets as Rob talked about the reallocation of $5 billion to $10 billion of capital. So that\u2019s the second goal. The third goal is to be good stewards of capital, balancing the return of capital to shareholders with investing both organically and inorganically in our businesses. And we think that by achieving that balance, we can maximize shareholder value over time. So those are the three goals, strong and consistent performance, executing on our transformation and being good stewards of capital. And that will hopefully give you a framework around which we couldn\u2019t look at any of the actions that we take, including, as you talked about the programmatic M&A which Andy now can talk about.\nAndy Sullivan: Yes. So thanks, Charlie. And Elyse, I\u2019ll build upon it. So first, when it comes to PGIM, I\u2019d be remised if I didn\u2019t say that we\u2019ve had just great success organically growing this business. We\u2019ve seen somewhere in the neighbourhood of $55 billion in flows over the last five years due to the strength of our platform. And we will continue to invest in that organic growth. Having said that this is an area we\u2019ve identified where we want to augment through M&A, and we\u2019re \u2013 that all starts with being very clear on our priorities and clear on our spots. As we talked about last quarter, we\u2019re very interested in expanding upon our already good capabilities in alternatives as well as continuing to expand on our track record of success globally. Those are areas we\u2019re focused on because if you look at the overall asset management industry, they are faster growth areas of this space. As we\u2019re looking, everything and anything we look at would obviously we need to vet for a cultural fit and to make sure it fits with our multi-manager model. The way that I talked to my team and my team we talked about this as being in the flow and in the know. And what I mean by that is we need to make sure that we see all potential opportunities, both what\u2019s already in the marketplace, but what might be in the marketplace. And I could tell you that we are very confident that we are in the know and in the flow. We will be very programmatic and disciplined in deploying capital towards these acquisitions. And we are very confident that it will meaningfully add to PGIM over time.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. That\u2019s great. And my second question, in terms of the plans that you guys laid out exiting and the downsizing of businesses, it was all kind of focused on the U.S. individual solutions side of the house. But as we think about the workplace solutions, be that retirement or group and those businesses that if there was an opportunity via transaction to monetize some of the assets. Is that something that you would consider or are you still more focusing on annuities and life as you look to free up capital?\nCharlie Lowrey: It\u2019s Charlie, again, Elyse. We\u2019ve spoken about the fact that we\u2019ve taken a broad strategic review on our businesses within the context of having a business mix that is less market sensitive, less capital intensive and higher growth. And we\u2019re going to be really thoughtful and diligent about how we execute on the process with the goal of maximizing value for shareholders. So when there\u2019s more to report, we\u2019ll let you know. But we\u2019re in the process of doing that.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman with Credit Suisse and your line is open.\nAndrew Kligerman: Good morning, everyone. Just following-up on Elyse\u2019s question. If you could give a little more clarity on the full service retirement business, is that considered a core capital light business?\nCharlie Lowrey: So this is Charlie, Andrew. Again, we\u2019re not going to comment on any particular business. What I\u2019ll do is go back to our original premise, which is that we\u2019ve looked at all businesses, we\u2019re considering a business mix in totality. That\u2019s going to be higher growth, less capital intensive, less market intensive and less volatile over time. And we\u2019ve evaluated all our businesses within that context. And as we go through that process, as we make decisions and execute, you will be one of the first to know, along with all your other colleagues.\nAndrew Kligerman: Maybe you can \u2013 all right, let me know a little before then. But anyway \u2013 moving on to Assurance IQ, I mean, these revenues look phenomenally robust and yet this quarter you generated a pre-tax loss of $39 million. Could you give a sense of when you\u2019d liked to kind of turn the corner on profitability? Or is it still a little too early to say?\nAndy Sullivan: So Andrew, it\u2019s Andy, thank you for your question. First, let me make sure, I point out that, in this quarter, we had $10 million of one-time non-recurring expense. And just to give you that feel and a flavor for that. That as example, we ended a couple of vendor contracts in distribution as we\u2019re maturing our model, as far as the path we\u2019re on to drive the business toward it ultimate \u2013 our ultimate revenue and margin objectives, nothing has changed. We bought this business and platform for its long-term strategic capabilities that it provides us, both from expanding the addressable market, as well as for shifting our mix to a more fee oriented mix. So as such, we\u2019re investing and managing the business for the long-term, we continue to invest in broadening and deepening the product portfolio. We continue to invest in deepening and making a more capable the distribution system and the results in the quarter. You see evidence of that. I\u2019ll point back to what we said, last quarter, the key metric is revenue growth as we scale this platform up, and as you saw, we had 80% quarter-to-quarter revenue growth and had revenues grow in all lines. And so we have a plan, we\u2019re executing against it. We\u2019re seeing the metrics go the right way. We need to scale the platform and as such in the near term, we will see operating losses.\nAndrew Kligerman: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW. And your line is open.\nRyan Krueger: Good morning. I noticed that you stopped breaking out the wellness implementation costs this quarter. Can you give us any context for why you did that? And also I guess as we look, if we think about the corporate segment losses of $1.5 billion for 2021, should we expect that to decline in the following years as implementation costs also decline?\nKen Tanji: Okay. Ryan, it\u2019s Ken. We\u2019re making really good progress on our transformation and cost saving initiative and that\u2019s being driven by our transformation office and they\u2019re making great progress. We included the implementation costs that we expect this year in our estimated loss for corporate and other of $1.5 billion. So it\u2019s in there. And it\u2019s comparable to the amount that we had in 2020. At this stage, we don\u2019t expect the magnitude to vary significantly. So that\u2019s why we didn\u2019t feel the need to continue to separate and isolate it out. We are, as I mentioned, making very good progress towards our objective of achieving $750 million of cost savings by 2023. And over this period, we would expect to have implementation costs included in our corporate and the other segment to continue.\nRyan Krueger: Thanks. And then on your retirement business, can you give us any rough breakdown since there\u2019s kind of multiple \u2013 couple of different businesses in your reporting segment? What\u2019s the rough breakdown in terms of varying contribution is from full service compared to institutional investment products?\nKen Tanji: We have an excellent full service business. But it\u2019s part of our overall retirement segment. We haven\u2019t historically separated that out. It is part of that business line and we\u2019re not going to separate that, those specific are forward just the full service segment.\nRyan Krueger: Got it. All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath with Citi. And your line is open.\nSuneet Kamath: Great. Thanks. My first question is, I\u2019m just trying to reconcile something which is, at the 2019 Investor Day, we spent a lot of time on the financial wellness initiative and how you are tracking a lot of these meetings that you were hosting with the employees of your corporate customers. So I\u2019m trying to reconcile that strategy with comments that we\u2019re hearing today, that a lot of your U.S. businesses are under review, including the retirement business, because it felt to me that those two things were interconnected. So I\u2019m trying to figure out, is there a change in that financial wellness strategy or what\u2019s going on?\nAndy Sullivan: So Suneet, it\u2019s Andy, I\u2019ll take your question. Financial wellness absolutely remains a key component of our organic growth strategy in the company. As we articulated that at Investor Day, and as you heard me say, often, we\u2019re working to bring more solutions to more people and to address a broader swath of the American marketplace. That is both through the workplace, through the advisor channel and direct-to-consumer. As we talked about our financial wellness capability that we\u2019ve built out have really helped to activate a couple of value levers and the two predominant ones would be institutional value. And the second would be converting individuals in the workplace to long-term loyal customers of Prudential. We\u2019ve seen those value levers activated. We\u2019ve talked in the past about institutional value that\u2019s been delivered both from the net revenue growth in the group of insurance business, but also from the growth of our full service platform. And we are seeing the conversion to individual product sales from the financial wellness value prop. So you should think of it as, it is an important component of the organic piece of our strategy to grow and expand our addressable market. But it is that, it\u2019s a component of the broader strategy as we push to the business system to be higher growth, less capital intensive and less market sensitive.\nSuneet Kamath: Okay. And then on the capital reallocation, I think when we were talking about growth businesses last quarter. You\u2019ve highlighted three emerging markets PGIM and Assurance IQ. I think, Charlie, in your prepared remarks this morning, you didn\u2019t mention Assurance IQ. Should we take from that that you\u2019re currently not planning on allocating more capital to either Assurance IQ or other sort of insured tech types of operations?\nCharlie Lowrey: Yes, I think that\u2019s a fair comment. In other words, as we think about programmatic M&A, in particular as we\u2019ve talked about it this morning, it\u2019s investing primarily in our other businesses in the U.S. and international and what we mean by programmatic M&A, it\u2019s a very specific strategy. We\u2019re going to be highly selective and we\u2019re going to do targeted acquisitions that add either scale or augment capabilities to our existing businesses like PGIM and like emerging markets.\nBob Falzon: Hey, Suneet, it\u2019s Rob. Though just add to Charlie\u2019s comments, which is to say that differentiate what would be the objective that we articulated was to have the combination of the three businesses that you mentioned equal to 30% of our earnings in the timetable that we had \u2013 that we had targeted. Then we separately said with regard to redeployment of capital, however that we were focused on PGIM and emerging markets, we did not at that point in time call out assurance as an area for capital deployment.\nSuneet Kamath: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Erik Bass with Autonomous Research. And your line is open.\nErik Bass: Hi, thank you. Can you provide some more details on your current emerging markets businesses and where they stand in terms of scale and profitability? How much earnings are you generating from emerging markets today? And how do you expect that to grow organically over the next three years?\nScott Sleyster: Thanks Eric. This is Scott. I\u2019ll go ahead and take that question. Well, first of all, from a big picture perspective, following the sale of Korea about 94%, 95% of our earnings come from Japan. So that\u2019s why we spend a lot of time focused on Japan. Within the emerging markets, I think, I\u2019ve said before that the bulk of the earnings from those from that sector comes from a combination of Brazil and in Chile. So the good news is in our emerging markets platform is that we feel like we\u2019re in a lot of the right countries. And we\u2019ve actually worked pretty hard to get the right partners in those countries where partners where we required. The challenge that we faced is that we originally started in a lot of those markets with tied agency or NLP model. And we\u2019ve now broadened that out at independent agency in bank assurance, but we\u2019re starting from a rather small platform. So, the good news is, we are seeing a rapid growth in the emerging markets, for example, our in-force grew at high single-digit in Brazil and in double-digit Mexico last year. But for most of our emerging markets, we\u2019re starting off of a rather small phase and that\u2019s why Charlie talks about it in the context of markets that we\u2019d like to grow. We tend to think we\u2019re in the right places. We have licenses and partners, and that\u2019s why we think a bolt-on strategy is probably the best strategy for growing those markets. Thanks.\nErik Bass: Thank you. And then follow-up on sticking with the international businesses, in the Life Planner business, you continue to show healthy growth and Life Planner at POJ, but the total Life Planner counts down year-over-year. I\u2019m assuming the decline is coming from Brazil. This is hoping you could provide some more color on what\u2019s going on and what we should infer about the underlying growth trends in that business?\nScott Sleyster: Yes. That\u2019s a good follow-up and your observation is correct. I believe, I commented last quarter, but we systemically or consistently kind of go through our LT models and we change our contract terms and we do that to maintain productivity, sometimes adapt to regulatory changes customer and regulatory needs and the like, and we did implement some new contract terms in Brazil last year, we were expecting a declined to follow that that in fact that did occur. And so that really was the change actually Japan Life Planner growth was actually up in POJ 4% year-over-year and that\u2019s our biggest market. In quarter-over-quarter we were back up slightly in Brazil. So, I would view that as kind of a contract related change. Further, I would say that if you look back three or four years ago in Brazil, almost all of our sales were coming from the Life Planner channel and we\u2019ve had a lot of growth in our bank segment. And increasingly we\u2019ve been making progress in our group segment, so that recently almost 30% of our sales have been coming from outside the Life Planner model. So, we\u2019re actually quite pleased with how things are going in Brazil. Thanks.\nErik Bass: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next we would go to line of Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please. Go ahead.\nYaron Kinar: Thank you. Good morning everybody. My first question goes to the increasing the buyback authorization less so about I think, 2021, but the thought of seeing that $0.5 billion increase flow through here come through your targets. I just, conceptually, I want to maybe get your sense. Is that something that you think you\u2019ll be revisiting on a quarterly basis based on the performance of the company or is this kind of a one-off, how should we think of this new $10.5 billion target?\nKen Tanji: Hi. This is Ken. We\u2019ve had a very consistent approach to capital management. We use both share purchases and dividend as a way to distribute capital to shareholders. We\u2019ve prioritized dividends and our earnings have been about three times dividends. Our free cash flow has been about 65% of our earnings, and about two times our dividend. So, while we seek to use dividends and grow them we\u2019ll use a level of share repurchases, but it will vary overtime. Our recent decision to increase that by $0.5 billion and again, just not just for 2021, but we also, as you mentioned, increased our three-year outlook. It really reflects where we are at this point in time with our capital position, as well as our outlook on the economy. And again, it\u2019s consistent with returning excess capital to the shareholders as time passes we will continue to reassess our capital position and determine if adjustments are appropriate. So again, it\u2019s really consistent with the approach we\u2019ve had for many years. And if we have excess capital we\u2019ll make the practice of share \u2013returning that to shareholders.\nYaron Kinar: Okay. But a quarter ago you were also talking about the other pillar, which was the fact that $10 billion, if you deploy into shifting businessmen from in shifting to more capital structure. So, I\u2019m just trying to think of if this additional $0.5 billion is that need, that you\u2019re seeing less opportunity to deploy into shifting business mix or is it just that you identify more, that\u2019s a scaffold than you initially thought and therefore by increasing the other pillar?\nKen Tanji: Yes, it\u2019s really a reflection of our current position of excess capital. As Rob mentioned, we\u2019re making great progress towards our objective of, of five to 10 billion of capital reallocation. And again, it\u2019s a wide range because we want \u2013 we will be disciplined about transactions to release and redeploy. So it\u2019s primarily the result of how we feel about our current capital position and the economic outlook.\nYaron Kinar: Understood. And then my second question PGIM so clearly very strong net flows, but kind of tell \u2013 I don\u2019t want to say a story, but like you are seeing very, very robust retail flows, which I think is pretty consistent with what we are hearing in the market whereas institutional flows slowdown a little bit sequentially. And I think that that\u2019s, I don\u2019t know if I should call that a trend or not, but maybe any color you can give us in terms of what you\u2019re seeing in both institutional and retail. And, are you seeing trends there.\nAndy Sullivan: So, Yaron it\u2019s Andy, thanks for your question. Yes, I would not draw any conclusions or say we\u2019re seeing any trends. I guess the way we would frame it is, we are a very diversified business across our multi managers across both public and private sectors. We serve a very wide range of clients. The only thing I\u2019d say on the institutional side is obviously institutional clients can tend to be more lumpy and you\u2019ll get variability quarter-to-quarter versus on the retail side. On the retail side, we have seen a lot of money in, money markets. And we think that could be a tailwind coming, continuing to come into the marketplace, but more broadly we have a broad suite of products. And I think at the end of the day, we\u2019re very confident that we\u2019ll be a net winner from a flows perspective, given the strength and the balance that we have across product types and across institutional and retail. But to your question should you draw any trends or conclusions, I would say now.\nYaron Kinar: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners. And your line is open.\nHumphrey Lee: Good morning. And thank you for taking my questions. My first question is related to the time in general. I think in your 10-K, you indicated at the spread compression in your Full Service business is a key headwind to earnings for Retirement. Just looking back on the past couple of years on at least the past several quarters, in terms of the interest rates have been that you highlighted, how should we think about the portion of a spread compression in Full Service versus that in the IB business?\nKen Tanji: Hey, Humphrey, it\u2019s Ken. We do see a spread compression in a Retirement business and that\u2019s a combination of Full Service in our institutional business, in the baseline roll forward that we provided. You\u2019ll see that of the $10 million impact half of that, or $5 million is in our Retirement segment. But we don\u2019t split that out between Full Service and an institutional.\nHumphrey Lee: I guess, kind of directionally, which one would you say will be have your thoughts of that?\nKen Tanji: Yes. Again, we don\u2019t, want to get down to it. They get into the breakdown of that.\nHumphrey Lee: Okay. I guess that\u2019s just a follow-up, to just the fixed income portion of the business in general. How should we think about the capital that you have is currently backing the stable of this stable, valid business in Full Service?\nKen Tanji: Again, with our Full Service business as part of our overall Retirement segment. That\u2019s where the earnings are reported in the capitals held, but we\u2019re not going to break down the split of it by sub segment.\nHumphrey Lee: Okay. All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tracy Benguigui with Barclays. And your line is open. \nTracy Benguigui: Thank you. I\u2019m wondering if you could reconcile some comments made on one hand, you mentioned the emphasizing higher market and rate sensitive business, but on the other hand, Charlie, you mentioned previously that none of your businesses are secret cows, that you look at everything. So, it\u2019d just be helpful to understand, how open-ended you requested or if you have a pecking order in mind.\nCharlie Lowrey: Thanks Tracy for the question. Yes, we \u2013 I\u2019ll just go back to what I said before, which is we have looked and are looking at all our businesses. Our objective is to create and maximize shareholder value overtime. We\u2019re not going to talk about a pecking order if you will, of businesses at this time, but rest assured that we\u2019re looking carefully at all our businesses and understanding specifically how they fit into an overall business mix and the objective that we articulated in the first quarter, which was to expand our higher growth businesses and to reduce annuities and our market sensitive to a smaller extent. So that\u2019s, about all we want to say at this point about we\u2019re in the process of doing that. And as I said before you all will know when there\u2019s more to report.\nTracy Benguigui: Okay, understood. You go to a different topic. I mean, there\u2019s a lot of talk about COVID-19, but I\u2019m wondering if you had experienced better non-COVID-19 mortality losses for the quarter. I understand the first quarter is usually a heavy full quarter, but looking at CDC data looks like excess mortality, ex-COVID was unusually low. Did you have that experience?\nBob Falzon: Hey, Tracy, this is certainly an unusual stretch of time during the pandemic. But generally we did not see any significant or credible trend or variance in our underwriting experience other than what seems to be related to COVID. So really can\u2019t give you any other comments other than that.\nTracy Benguigui: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of John Barnidge with Piper Sandler. And your line is open.\nJohn Barnidge: Thank you very much. And don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not a question about risk transfers. So, I was curious with some short-term disability claims seemingly than to going to long-term disability, because of the natural things that occur with economic shock lapses, a few quarters out. Can you talk about your expectations with that as well as associated elevated administrative expenses?\nAndy Sullivan: Sure. John it\u2019s Andy, and appreciate the new topic to cover. So, as you would expect last year given the impact of COVID in the pandemic, we absolutely saw an increase in short term disability claims. We\u2019ve actually seen those claims volumes coming back down, obviously it\u2019s a pandemic, it\u2019s getting more to control of vaccines and the like. We continue to expect you know, due to our experience, the impact on the economy to have an effect on long-term disability claim incident. We have not seen that tick up as of yet that, that does not necessarily mean that we won\u2019t there\u2019s generally a six month period on the long-term disability plan. That\u2019s why you saw us put up an idea in our last quarter and we put up an additional IBNR this quarter. So we\u2019re, still expecting that and that directly flows to your question about increased administrative expenses. One of the things that we consider, very, very important to managing this business is having the right number of claims professionals, nurses, and folks specialists. We have beefed up our staffing and in the claims part of the business to be ready to properly help individuals return to work that go on long-term disability claims. And you\u2019re seeing that reflected in the elevated admin ratio.\nOperator: And will that do it for you, John?\nJohn Barnidge: Sorry, I was on mute. Thank you. A follow-up to that related to it. Do you think the corporate push knock through but industry-wide to return to office, June say the summer to fall may actually add another layer dynamic to that long-term disability dynamic?\nAndy Sullivan: So John, it\u2019s Andy, I\u2019ll take your question. That\u2019s a really hard one to predict and where our thoughts go in that is we have a very diversified book of business across size, segments and geographies. And I think the patterns of what we\u2019re going to see from a return to the workplace perspective are going to be pretty varied across those different industry size, segments and geography. So really hard to tell, what influence that might have on the disability claims incidents.\nJohn Barnidge: Thank you very much for your answers.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Josh Shanker with Bank of America, and your line is open.\nJosh Shanker: Yes. Thank you for slipping me in here at the end. Two quick ones, I think the first one is obviously first quarter was very interesting from an industry perspective move and it affected the mark-to-market results, if the PGIM strategies in a negative sort of way. I guess I\u2019m look \u2013 there might be an argument that industries reform is in tuned arrived, probably not that it didn\u2019t first quarter, but does PGIM have the right set of strategy to entertain inflows in a rising industry and economy that PGIM customers will embrace?\nAndy Sullivan: So Josh, it\u2019s Andy. Thanks for your question. So yes, as you\u2019re referring to, if we were to see a consistently rising rate environment that very likely has an impact on fixed income flows in general across the space and couldn\u2019t impact growth for that sector. But I\u2019d go back to something I said earlier, which is, we\u2019re a top 10 asset manager with a very broad and well-diversified portfolio in both public and private and in any economic environment, we feel that we\u2019ll be a net winner across those set of businesses from a net flows perspective. So yes, we feel very well positioned. And then obviously I\u2019d be remiss, if I didn\u2019t add, remember rise \u2013 a rising rate environment overall is a net positive for Prudential.\nJosh Shanker: Yes. I understand that. And to just understand the financial advisor, new sales on the annuity side of the business. Obviously the buffered annuity sales has been very strong. But I just want to break down, if I have a variable annuity with living benefits with Prudential, can I keep contributing into it? And how much of the new sales are legacy living benefits to customers who are putting more money into their older policies?\nAndy Sullivan: Yes. So again, it\u2019s Andy; thanks for the question. So depending on the product, depending on the regulatory territory, there are various rules on what we call those sub pays, how much additional money could be dropped into the policies. We have actually closed off to the jury, we\u2019re able and it is to a large degree sub pace going into those products. That\u2019s why when we report that only 1% is in the traditional variable annuities that guaranteed living benefit that is reflective of the sub pace as well. So when we\u2019re really talking about runoff, those products truly are not only sales to new customers, but additional monies being dropped in, it really is a hard stop on.\nJosh Shanker: Okay, Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will go to a follow-up from Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI. And your line is open.\nTom Gallagher: Thanks. Andy, just a follow-up on the buffer annuity sales, which are now the majority of your annuity sales, that\u2019s obviously a very big pivot into that product. Can you talk a bit about the risk profile of that business, the capital intensity of this product compared to your legacy VA business and why you obviously feel a lot of confidence with this volume of sales, if you\u2019re looking to exit legacy VA? But maybe just to compare and contrast about why you have confidence and clarity on the risk profile there?\nAndy Sullivan: Yes Tom, So it\u2019s Andy, and maybe I\u2019ll take sort of two sides to that question, risk and return. From the risk perspective, the product is vastly different from our traditional variable annuities, like the highest daily income. If you think about it, we\u2019re sharing risk with the consumer, we\u2019re giving them a buffer on the downside for a little bit of upside, but they have detailed downside risk, and obviously the upside is Kat, so at the end of the day, we\u2019re not taking interest rate risks like we were in HDI, the interest rate risk because of the design of the product could be nearly perfectly hedged with simple options. So the risk profile we\u2019re very, very comfortable with \u2013 from a go-forward perspective. Your question around returns, I think what I talked about in previous quarters, we did a lot of work to be able to more rapidly price our products and adjust our product pricing. We\u2019re quite pleased with the returns that we\u2019re seeing on the business that we\u2019re selling. And obviously that might be begging the question of, well, why have you been so successful? So let me hit that, number one, we are one of the very best and top brands in the space with a lot of history through the third-party advisor channels. Number two, we have great distribution people in relationships, inclusive of Prudential Advisors, which is a very big strategic advantage for us. And that has led to the sales results and the very, very positive results. But we liked the risk profile and we liked to return.\nRob Axel: Hey Tom, it\u2019s Rob, just to add onto one thing to Andy said, you talked about the interest rate risk profile, it just implied in his comments as well, just to make sure it\u2019s clear. The equity risk profile is also quite low, we\u2019re able to \u2013 the structure of the buffer is something that we\u2019re able to actively hedge with options in the marketplace. So we\u2019re not taking that equity market risk on ourselves. Thanks.\nTom Gallagher: Okay. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. And with that, Mr. Lowrey, I\u2019d like to turn it back over to you for any closing comments.\nCharlie Lowrey: Thank you very much. So thank you for your time and interest today. I hope we\u2019ve conveyed the increased sense of momentum and the steady progress around our transformation initiatives. We remain confident in our strategy and the additional steps we\u2019re taking to build a nimbler and higher growth business, and one which continues to focus on the evolving needs of our customers. We look forward to sharing more details on our progress with you in the coming quarters. And thank you again for joining us today.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference Service. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Charlie Lowrey",
            "content": "Thank you, Darin and thank you all for joining us this morning. As always, I hope you and your families have remained safe and healthy. Despite the ongoing challenges created by the pandemic, Prudential reported strong results for the first quarter, including record adjusted operating income and robust sales and flows across many of our businesses. Our performance reflects strong underlying demand for our products, continued execution on our strategic initiatives, the complimentary nature of our retirement and life insurance businesses, which has helped us mitigate mortality risk, favorable markets, and the commitment of our employees around the world. We're on track with our key transformation initiatives and have increased returns to shareholders supported by our strong performance and the strength of our balance sheet. I'll cover each of these topics in more detail and begin with a brief review of the transformation initiatives, we highlighted for you in February. Turning to Slide 3. We're on track to deliver $750 million in cost savings by the end of 2023, $400 million of which were targeted for 2021. Cost savings for the first quarter were $110 million. The initiatives generating these cost savings are also producing better customer and employee experiences. And as a result, enhancing the competitiveness of our businesses. We are also in the process of reallocating $5 billion to $10 billion of capital by pursuing programmatic acquisitions to grow in asset management and in international emerging markets. In addition, we'll remain focused on investing in our other businesses to expand our addressable market and to continue to improve expense and capital efficiency. In parallel, we're actively executing on other means of changing our business mix and earnings profile by pivoting to less market and rate sensitive products, such as our buffered annuity product, FlexGuard, running off certain blocks of business and actively pursuing potential de-risking transactions. As a result, we expect Prudential to emerge as a higher growth, less market sensitive and more nimble company. As we execute against our transformation initiatives, you can expect that we'll continue to demonstrate discipline and the redeployment of capital within our businesses and to our shareholders. Turning now to Slide 4. In the first quarter, we increased our shareholder dividend by 5% and repurchased $375 million of common shares. In addition, based on our progress with our initiatives, as well as the improving macro economic outlook and the more favorable equity market and interest rate environment, we announced a $500 million increase to our 2021 share repurchase authorization. We expect to repurchase these additional shares starting in the second quarter. As a result, we now expect to return $10.5 billion to shareholders through 2023. Moving to Slide 5. Our expanded shareholder return program is supported by our rock solid balance sheet, which included $5.4 billion in highly liquid assets at the end of the first quarter. Our operating subsidiaries continued to hold capital to support AA financial strength ratings. And we have a high quality investment portfolio. Turning to Slide 6. We are also executing on behalf of our stakeholders through our commitment to environmental, social and governance actions. This work has long been reflected in our purpose as a company of solving the financial challenges of our changing world and is as important as ever. Of recent note, on the environment, we have made significant progress, reducing emissions, waste and paper. And we continually evaluate how we can improve our impact on the environment. On social issues, we have invested further in our people with training and development programs and continued to maintain a high level of pay equity throughout the firm. We also achieved our three-year goal that we created in 2017 of increasing representation of diverse persons among our senior management by five points over that time period. We followed this by establishing new goals and are continuing to tie our goals to management compensation as we did in the prior period. And we're already making progress on our commitments to advance racial equity, which we announced last summer. On governance, we continually refresh our board with people who are highly skilled and who also reflect the diverse communities and geographies that we serve. Today, 82% of our independent directors are diverse. You can see more details on how we're progressing against our goals and commitments in our ESG summary report that we published in March. Before closing, I would like to thank all of our employees around the world. It's through their continued hard work and dedication that we've been able to support our customers and colleagues during these challenging times, all while advancing our company's transformation and purpose of making lives better by solving the financial challenges of our changing world. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob for more specific details on our business performance. Sure. Elyse, this is Charlie. Let me just take a step back if you will, and put what we're doing into context, and then I'll answer your specific question. As we look at the journey we're on, if you will, we as a management team are laser focused on three goals. Well, the first is to deliver strong and consistent performance. And hopefully you've seen that. The second is to execute on the transformation that Rob and Andy just talked about, and there are three parts to that. One is pivoting our products to be less market sensitive and capital sensitive. The second is to execute on our cost efficiency goals. And you saw that we expanded our goals by 50% last year and are ahead of track. And the third is to lean into the higher growth markets as Rob talked about the reallocation of $5 billion to $10 billion of capital. So that's the second goal. The third goal is to be good stewards of capital, balancing the return of capital to shareholders with investing both organically and inorganically in our businesses. And we think that by achieving that balance, we can maximize shareholder value over time. So those are the three goals, strong and consistent performance, executing on our transformation and being good stewards of capital. And that will hopefully give you a framework around which we couldn't look at any of the actions that we take, including, as you talked about the programmatic M&A which Andy now can talk about. It's Charlie, again, Elyse. We've spoken about the fact that we've taken a broad strategic review on our businesses within the context of having a business mix that is less market sensitive, less capital intensive and higher growth. And we're going to be really thoughtful and diligent about how we execute on the process with the goal of maximizing value for shareholders. So when there's more to report, we'll let you know. But we're in the process of doing that. So this is Charlie, Andrew. Again, we're not going to comment on any particular business. What I'll do is go back to our original premise, which is that we've looked at all businesses, we're considering a business mix in totality. That's going to be higher growth, less capital intensive, less market intensive and less volatile over time. And we've evaluated all our businesses within that context. And as we go through that process, as we make decisions and execute, you will be one of the first to know, along with all your other colleagues. Yes, I think that's a fair comment. In other words, as we think about programmatic M&A, in particular as we've talked about it this morning, it's investing primarily in our other businesses in the U.S. and international and what we mean by programmatic M&A, it's a very specific strategy. We're going to be highly selective and we're going to do targeted acquisitions that add either scale or augment capabilities to our existing businesses like PGIM and like emerging markets. Thanks Tracy for the question. Yes, we \u2013 I'll just go back to what I said before, which is we have looked and are looking at all our businesses. Our objective is to create and maximize shareholder value overtime. We're not going to talk about a pecking order if you will, of businesses at this time, but rest assured that we're looking carefully at all our businesses and understanding specifically how they fit into an overall business mix and the objective that we articulated in the first quarter, which was to expand our higher growth businesses and to reduce annuities and our market sensitive to a smaller extent. So that's, about all we want to say at this point about we're in the process of doing that. And as I said before you all will know when there's more to report. Thank you very much. So thank you for your time and interest today. I hope we've conveyed the increased sense of momentum and the steady progress around our transformation initiatives. We remain confident in our strategy and the additional steps we're taking to build a nimbler and higher growth business, and one which continues to focus on the evolving needs of our customers. We look forward to sharing more details on our progress with you in the coming quarters. And thank you again for joining us today."

            "content": "Thanks, Rob. I'll begin on Slide 11, which provides insight into earnings for the second quarter of 2021 relative to our first quarter results. Pre-tax adjusted operating income in the first quarter was $2.1 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $4.11 on an after-tax basis; then we adjust for the following items. First, variable investment income outperformed expectations in the first quarter, which is worth $275 million. Second, we adjust underwriting experience by $160 million. This includes a placeholder for COVID-19 claims experience of an additional $70 million based upon 55,000 COVID-19 related fatalities in the U.S. during the second quarter. Third, we expect expenses and other items to be approximately $500 million lower in the second quarter, primarily as a result of favorable items in first quarter, including the $378 million gain from the sale of PGIM's joint venture in Italy and seasonality. Fourth, we anticipate net investment income will be reduced by $10 million, reflecting difference between new money rates to disposition yields of our investment portfolio. These items combined get us to a baseline of $2.89 per share for the second quarter. I'll note that if you exclude items specific to the second quarter, earnings per share would be $2.97. The key takeaway is that our underlying earnings power increased from last quarter, including the benefit from business growth and higher equity markets. While we have provided these items to consider, please note that there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the second quarter. I would also note that we continue to expect the full year 2021 corporate and other loss to be about $1.5 billion. On Slide 12, we provided an update on the potential impact of the pandemic. Consistent with the information we provided on our fourth quarter call, the estimated sensitivity of operating income for $100,000 incremental U.S. death due to the pandemic is about $85 million. As I noted earlier, our second quarter baseline includes a net mortality impact of $70 million due to COVID-19. The actual impact will depend on a variety of factors, such as infection and fatality rates, geographic concentration, and the continued speed acceptance and effectiveness of the vaccine rollout. Turning to Slide 13. We continued to maintain a robust capital position and adequate sources of funding. Our capital position continues to support AA financial strength rating, and we have substantial sources of funding. Our cash and liquid assets were $5.4 billion, which is greater than 3 times annual fixed charges and other sources of funds include free cash flow from our businesses and other continued capital facilities. Turning to Slide 14. And in summary, we are on track with our key initiatives that we maintain disciplined capital management while returning additional capital to shareholders, and we continue to benefit from the support of our rock solid balance sheet. Now I'll turn it to the operator for your questions. Okay. Ryan, it's Ken. We're making really good progress on our transformation and cost saving initiative and that's being driven by our transformation office and they're making great progress. We included the implementation costs that we expect this year in our estimated loss for corporate and other of $1.5 billion. So it's in there. And it's comparable to the amount that we had in 2020. At this stage, we don't expect the magnitude to vary significantly. So that's why we didn't feel the need to continue to separate and isolate it out. We are, as I mentioned, making very good progress towards our objective of achieving $750 million of cost savings by 2023. And over this period, we would expect to have implementation costs included in our corporate and the other segment to continue. We have an excellent full service business. But it's part of our overall retirement segment. We haven't historically separated that out. It is part of that business line and we're not going to separate that, those specific are forward just the full service segment. Hi. This is Ken. We've had a very consistent approach to capital management. We use both share purchases and dividend as a way to distribute capital to shareholders. We've prioritized dividends and our earnings have been about three times dividends. Our free cash flow has been about 65% of our earnings, and about two times our dividend. So, while we seek to use dividends and grow them we'll use a level of share repurchases, but it will vary overtime. Our recent decision to increase that by $0.5 billion and again, just not just for 2021, but we also, as you mentioned, increased our three-year outlook. It really reflects where we are at this point in time with our capital position, as well as our outlook on the economy. And again, it's consistent with returning excess capital to the shareholders as time passes we will continue to reassess our capital position and determine if adjustments are appropriate. So again, it's really consistent with the approach we've had for many years. And if we have excess capital we'll make the practice of share \u2013returning that to shareholders. Yes, it's really a reflection of our current position of excess capital. As Rob mentioned, we're making great progress towards our objective of, of five to 10 billion of capital reallocation. And again, it's a wide range because we want \u2013 we will be disciplined about transactions to release and redeploy. So it's primarily the result of how we feel about our current capital position and the economic outlook. Hey, Humphrey, it's Ken. We do see a spread compression in a Retirement business and that's a combination of Full Service in our institutional business, in the baseline roll forward that we provided. You'll see that of the $10 million impact half of that, or $5 million is in our Retirement segment. But we don't split that out between Full Service and an institutional. Yes. Again, we don't, want to get down to it. They get into the breakdown of that. Again, with our Full Service business as part of our overall Retirement segment. That's where the earnings are reported in the capitals held, but we're not going to break down the split of it by sub segment."

            "name": "Rob Axel",
            "content": "Thank you, Charlie. I'll provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for our U.S., PGIM and international businesses. Turning to Slide 7, I'll begin with our financial results for the first quarter. Our pretax adjusted operating income was a record high of $2.1 billion or $4.11 per share on an after-tax basis. Earnings exceeded the year ago quarter across all of our businesses. Results of our U.S. businesses were up 38% and reflected higher net investment spread results driven by higher variable investment income and higher fee income, primarily driven by equity market appreciation, partially offset by less favorable underwriting experience driven by COVID-19-related mortality. PGIM, our global asset manager had record high results, including a gain on the sale of our Italian joint venture. Our partner was acquired by another firm with an existing asset management business and expressed a desire to purchase our interest, which was a rated retained under the joint venture agreement. Nonetheless, assets under management of $1.5 trillion were up 12% from year ago, driving asset management fees to a record level. And earnings in our international businesses increased 25%, reflecting business growth, higher net investment spread, more favorable underwriting results and higher earnings from our Chilean pension joint venture. Turning to Slide 8. Our U.S. businesses produced diversified earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income to benefit from a complimentary mix of longevity and mortality businesses. As Charlie noted, we continue to make progress in shifting away from capital intensive and interest rate sensitive products. Our productivity have worked well with sales of our buffered annuity, FlexGuard, growing to $1.6 billion in the first quarter, representing 84% of total annuity sales, up from $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. Our sales reflect increasing customer demand for investment solutions that offer the potential for appreciation from equity markets combined with downside protection. In addition, we benefit from having a strong and trusted brand as well as a highly effective distribution team that has significant reach with Prudential Advisors and third-party advisors. We are engaging with a broad range of advisors with FlexGuard. We also leverage our broad multi-dimensional relationships with our strategic partners that both distribute our products and manage the assets of our clients. With respect to Individual Life, we increased sales by 9% compared to the year ago quarter as higher variable life sales offset lower sales of other policies, in particular, universal life sales consistent with our product pivot strategy. In our retirement business, account values were a record high, up 23% from a year ago, driven by business growth and market appreciation. Net flows in the quarter were $6 billion, including a longevity re-insurance transaction in excess of $8 billion. With respect to assurance, total revenues are our primary financial metric as we concentrate on scaling the business were up 80% over the prior quarter. We grew all business lines, particularly in Medicare, where we expanded distribution to increase sales outside of the fourth quarter annual enrollment period. Now turning to Slide 9. PGIM continues to demonstrate the strength of its diversified active management platform as a top 10 global investment manager. PGIM's diversified global investment capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed income, alternatives, real estate and equities, position us favorably to capture flows. In addition, PGIM's investment performance remains attractive with approximately 90% or more of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last 3-, 5- and 10-year periods. Our diversified capabilities and strong investment performance helps contribute to more than $5 billion of third-party net flows during the quarter, including $4 billion of retail and $1 billion of institutional flows. Offsetting the growth in net flows was a decrease in the market value of our fixed income assets, reflecting the increase in interest rates. As the investment engine of Prudential, PGIM, also benefits from a symbiotic relationship with our U.S. and international insurance businesses. PGIM's asset origination capabilities and investment management expertise provide a competitive advantage, helping our businesses to bring enhanced solutions and more value to our customers. And our businesses in turn provide a differentiated source of growth for PGIM through affiliated flows that compliment its successful third-party track record of growth. PGIM's asset management fees increased 15% compared to the year ago quarter to a record level as a result of market appreciation and continued positive third-party net flows. This contributed to an 8 point increase in PGIM's net adjusted operating margin, including the gain on the sale of the Italy joint venture \u2013 excuse me, excluding the gain on the sale of the Italy joint venture compared to the year ago quarter consistent with our expectation of 30% across the cycle. Turning to Slide 10. Our international businesses include our Japanese life insurance operation, where we have a differentiated multi-channel distribution model, as well as other operations focused on high growth markets. While sales across both Life Planner and Gibraltar operations were lower than the prior year, reflecting the disruption from Japan's metropolitan areas being in a state of emergency this quarter, as well as lower demand for our U.S. dollar denominated products, following price increases last year, profitability increased significantly. We remain encouraged by the resiliency of our unique distribution capabilities, which has helped to continue to grow our in-force business. And with that, I'll now hand it over to Ken. Hey, Tom, it's Rob. Let me take a first shot at that, if you don't mind. So thank you for the question. The first actually, let me start with a reminder, a large portion of the broader business mix objectives that we have are actually going to achieve \u2013 be achieved organically. The internal growth objective we have, which essentially to double the growth of our \u2013 double the size of our growth businesses about a third of that is that targeted increase will come from the organic growth of those businesses. And then with respect to the targeted reduction specifically bringing our annuities business down to around 10% or so of total contribution 40% to 45% of that comes from the runoff of our legacy block. We didn't expect capital redeployment in the form of \u2013 on the growth side, programmatic acquisitions and then on the reduction side re-insurance and/or sales to largely closed the remainder of the gap. And as Charlie indicated in his opening remarks, we are actively executing on that, including through de-risking transactions on the reduction side. While we're making progress, we're not yet in a position Tom, where we're going to speak any more specifically, although, I'd like to reiterate what we said before. First, these transactions are generally complex and therefore, they require time. And secondly, we intend to remain disciplined transacting both with respect to the dispositions as well as acquisitions to ensure that we're creating value for our shareholders in any transaction that we undertake. That's why we indicated sort of a relatively broad range of the $5 billion to $10 billion and a multi-year period for accomplishing that. Probably the last thing I'd want to mention is that the product repricing and pivots that we've been undertaking are also important levers to change in that business mix. And maybe Andy, if you don't mind, you could just sort of give a quick update on that. Hey Tom, it's Rob, just to add onto one thing to Andy said, you talked about the interest rate risk profile, it just implied in his comments as well, just to make sure it's clear. The equity risk profile is also quite low, we're able to \u2013 the structure of the buffer is something that we're able to actively hedge with options in the marketplace. So we're not taking that equity market risk on ourselves. Thanks."
        },
        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Andy Sullivan",
            "content": "Sure, Rob. Tom, good morning. So I'll make this very specific. So let's talk about annuity. So as we've talked about step one in de-risking is the runoff and that started with ceasing of sales. So you saw this quarter where we only had 1% of our sales that came from traditional variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits. And we very successfully have pivoted over to FlexGuard, we will expect to see about a $3 billion per quarter runoff in that traditional variable annuity block of business. This quarter, we saw about $3.8 billion. As we pivoted to FlexGuard, we're putting into the market a very different type of product that better balances consumer value with shareholder value. And we could not be more pleased with the success of that product. We had a 14.5% market share back in 4Q and as you saw, our sales have continued to expand where we had $1.6 billion in sales this quarter. That is really coming off the strength of our brand and the strength of our distribution. And we're very happy with the returns and the risk profile of that new business that we're putting on the book. So it's a very good example of how step one is all about the runoff and pivot. Yes. So thanks, Charlie. And Elyse, I'll build upon it. So first, when it comes to PGIM, I'd be remised if I didn't say that we've had just great success organically growing this business. We've seen somewhere in the neighbourhood of $55 billion in flows over the last five years due to the strength of our platform. And we will continue to invest in that organic growth. Having said that this is an area we've identified where we want to augment through M&A, and we're \u2013 that all starts with being very clear on our priorities and clear on our spots. As we talked about last quarter, we're very interested in expanding upon our already good capabilities in alternatives as well as continuing to expand on our track record of success globally. Those are areas we're focused on because if you look at the overall asset management industry, they are faster growth areas of this space. As we're looking, everything and anything we look at would obviously we need to vet for a cultural fit and to make sure it fits with our multi-manager model. The way that I talked to my team and my team we talked about this as being in the flow and in the know. And what I mean by that is we need to make sure that we see all potential opportunities, both what's already in the marketplace, but what might be in the marketplace. And I could tell you that we are very confident that we are in the know and in the flow. We will be very programmatic and disciplined in deploying capital towards these acquisitions. And we are very confident that it will meaningfully add to PGIM over time. So Andrew, it's Andy, thank you for your question. First, let me make sure, I point out that, in this quarter, we had $10 million of one-time non-recurring expense. And just to give you that feel and a flavor for that. That as example, we ended a couple of vendor contracts in distribution as we're maturing our model, as far as the path we're on to drive the business toward it ultimate \u2013 our ultimate revenue and margin objectives, nothing has changed. We bought this business and platform for its long-term strategic capabilities that it provides us, both from expanding the addressable market, as well as for shifting our mix to a more fee oriented mix. So as such, we're investing and managing the business for the long-term, we continue to invest in broadening and deepening the product portfolio. We continue to invest in deepening and making a more capable the distribution system and the results in the quarter. You see evidence of that. I'll point back to what we said, last quarter, the key metric is revenue growth as we scale this platform up, and as you saw, we had 80% quarter-to-quarter revenue growth and had revenues grow in all lines. And so we have a plan, we're executing against it. We're seeing the metrics go the right way. We need to scale the platform and as such in the near term, we will see operating losses. So Suneet, it's Andy, I'll take your question. Financial wellness absolutely remains a key component of our organic growth strategy in the company. As we articulated that at Investor Day, and as you heard me say, often, we're working to bring more solutions to more people and to address a broader swath of the American marketplace. That is both through the workplace, through the advisor channel and direct-to-consumer. As we talked about our financial wellness capability that we've built out have really helped to activate a couple of value levers and the two predominant ones would be institutional value. And the second would be converting individuals in the workplace to long-term loyal customers of Prudential. We've seen those value levers activated. We've talked in the past about institutional value that's been delivered both from the net revenue growth in the group of insurance business, but also from the growth of our full service platform. And we are seeing the conversion to individual product sales from the financial wellness value prop. So you should think of it as, it is an important component of the organic piece of our strategy to grow and expand our addressable market. But it is that, it's a component of the broader strategy as we push to the business system to be higher growth, less capital intensive and less market sensitive. So, Yaron it's Andy, thanks for your question. Yes, I would not draw any conclusions or say we're seeing any trends. I guess the way we would frame it is, we are a very diversified business across our multi managers across both public and private sectors. We serve a very wide range of clients. The only thing I'd say on the institutional side is obviously institutional clients can tend to be more lumpy and you'll get variability quarter-to-quarter versus on the retail side. On the retail side, we have seen a lot of money in, money markets. And we think that could be a tailwind coming, continuing to come into the marketplace, but more broadly we have a broad suite of products. And I think at the end of the day, we're very confident that we'll be a net winner from a flows perspective, given the strength and the balance that we have across product types and across institutional and retail. But to your question should you draw any trends or conclusions, I would say now. Sure. John it's Andy, and appreciate the new topic to cover. So, as you would expect last year given the impact of COVID in the pandemic, we absolutely saw an increase in short term disability claims. We've actually seen those claims volumes coming back down, obviously it's a pandemic, it's getting more to control of vaccines and the like. We continue to expect you know, due to our experience, the impact on the economy to have an effect on long-term disability claim incident. We have not seen that tick up as of yet that, that does not necessarily mean that we won't there's generally a six month period on the long-term disability plan. That's why you saw us put up an idea in our last quarter and we put up an additional IBNR this quarter. So we're, still expecting that and that directly flows to your question about increased administrative expenses. One of the things that we consider, very, very important to managing this business is having the right number of claims professionals, nurses, and folks specialists. We have beefed up our staffing and in the claims part of the business to be ready to properly help individuals return to work that go on long-term disability claims. And you're seeing that reflected in the elevated admin ratio. So John, it's Andy, I'll take your question. That's a really hard one to predict and where our thoughts go in that is we have a very diversified book of business across size, segments and geographies. And I think the patterns of what we're going to see from a return to the workplace perspective are going to be pretty varied across those different industry size, segments and geography. So really hard to tell, what influence that might have on the disability claims incidents. So Josh, it's Andy. Thanks for your question. So yes, as you're referring to, if we were to see a consistently rising rate environment that very likely has an impact on fixed income flows in general across the space and couldn't impact growth for that sector. But I'd go back to something I said earlier, which is, we're a top 10 asset manager with a very broad and well-diversified portfolio in both public and private and in any economic environment, we feel that we'll be a net winner across those set of businesses from a net flows perspective. So yes, we feel very well positioned. And then obviously I'd be remiss, if I didn't add, remember rise \u2013 a rising rate environment overall is a net positive for Prudential. Yes. So again, it's Andy; thanks for the question. So depending on the product, depending on the regulatory territory, there are various rules on what we call those sub pays, how much additional money could be dropped into the policies. We have actually closed off to the jury, we're able and it is to a large degree sub pace going into those products. That's why when we report that only 1% is in the traditional variable annuities that guaranteed living benefit that is reflective of the sub pace as well. So when we're really talking about runoff, those products truly are not only sales to new customers, but additional monies being dropped in, it really is a hard stop on. Yes Tom, So it's Andy, and maybe I'll take sort of two sides to that question, risk and return. From the risk perspective, the product is vastly different from our traditional variable annuities, like the highest daily income. If you think about it, we're sharing risk with the consumer, we're giving them a buffer on the downside for a little bit of upside, but they have detailed downside risk, and obviously the upside is Kat, so at the end of the day, we're not taking interest rate risks like we were in HDI, the interest rate risk because of the design of the product could be nearly perfectly hedged with simple options. So the risk profile we're very, very comfortable with \u2013 from a go-forward perspective. Your question around returns, I think what I talked about in previous quarters, we did a lot of work to be able to more rapidly price our products and adjust our product pricing. We're quite pleased with the returns that we're seeing on the business that we're selling. And obviously that might be begging the question of, well, why have you been so successful? So let me hit that, number one, we are one of the very best and top brands in the space with a lot of history through the third-party advisor channels. Number two, we have great distribution people in relationships, inclusive of Prudential Advisors, which is a very big strategic advantage for us. And that has led to the sales results and the very, very positive results. But we liked the risk profile and we liked to return."

Though just add to Charlie's comments, which is to say that differentiate what would be the objective that we articulated was to have the combination of the three businesses that you mentioned equal to 30% of our earnings in the timetable that we had \u2013 that we had targeted. Then we separately said with regard to redeployment of capital, however that we were focused on PGIM and emerging markets, we did not at that point in time call out assurance as an area for capital deployment. Hey, Tracy, this is certainly an unusual stretch of time during the pandemic. But generally we did not see any significant or credible trend or variance in our underwriting experience other than what seems to be related to COVID. So really can't give you any other comments other than that."

            "name": "Scott Sleyster",
            "content": "Thanks Eric. This is Scott. I'll go ahead and take that question. Well, first of all, from a big picture perspective, following the sale of Korea about 94%, 95% of our earnings come from Japan. So that's why we spend a lot of time focused on Japan. Within the emerging markets, I think, I've said before that the bulk of the earnings from those from that sector comes from a combination of Brazil and in Chile. So the good news is in our emerging markets platform is that we feel like we're in a lot of the right countries. And we've actually worked pretty hard to get the right partners in those countries where partners where we required. The challenge that we faced is that we originally started in a lot of those markets with tied agency or NLP model. And we've now broadened that out at independent agency in bank assurance, but we're starting from a rather small platform. So, the good news is, we are seeing a rapid growth in the emerging markets, for example, our in-force grew at high single-digit in Brazil and in double-digit Mexico last year. But for most of our emerging markets, we're starting off of a rather small phase and that's why Charlie talks about it in the context of markets that we'd like to grow. We tend to think we're in the right places. We have licenses and partners, and that's why we think a bolt-on strategy is probably the best strategy for growing those markets. Thanks. Yes. That's a good follow-up and your observation is correct. I believe, I commented last quarter, but we systemically or consistently kind of go through our LT models and we change our contract terms and we do that to maintain productivity, sometimes adapt to regulatory changes customer and regulatory needs and the like, and we did implement some new contract terms in Brazil last year, we were expecting a declined to follow that that in fact that did occur. And so that really was the change actually Japan Life Planner growth was actually up in POJ 4% year-over-year and that's our biggest market. In quarter-over-quarter we were back up slightly in Brazil. So, I would view that as kind of a contract related change. Further, I would say that if you look back three or four years ago in Brazil, almost all of our sales were coming from the Life Planner channel and we've had a lot of growth in our bank segment. And increasingly we've been making progress in our group segment, so that recently almost 30% of our sales have been coming from outside the Life Planner model. So, we're actually quite pleased with how things are going in Brazil. Thanks."

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Bob McLaughlin. Please, go ahead.\nBob McLaughlin: Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. Representing Prudential on today\u2019s call are Charlie Lowrey, Chairman and CEO; Rob Falzon, Vice Chairman; Andy Sullivan, Head of International Businesses; PGIM [ph], our Global Investment Manager, Caroline Feeney, Head of US Businesses, Ken Tanji, Chief Financial Officer and Rob Axel, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer. We will start with prepared comments by Charlie, Rob, and Ken, and then we will take your questions. Today\u2019s presentation may include forward-looking statements. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions that we make today. In addition, this presentation may include references to non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of such measures to the comparable GAAP measures and the discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, please see the slide titled Forward-Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measures in the appendix to today\u2019s presentation and the quarterly financial supplement, both of which can be found on our website at investor.prudential.com. And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Charlie.\nCharlie Lowrey: Thank you, Bob. And thanks to everyone for joining us today. As we look back on 2022. I am proud of the progress we've made executing against our strategic priorities. During the year. We continue to transform our business to be less market sensitive and better positioned to deliver sustainable long-term growth. We exceeded our $750 million cost savings target one year ahead of schedule, and our rock solid balance sheet provided the financial strength to navigate the evolving macro economic environment. I'll provide an update on each of these areas, beginning with our business transformation. Turning to slide three, during 2022 we reduced the overall market sensitivity of our business by completing the sales of the full service retirement business and the pay lock block as well as the run off of traditional variable annuities. We simultaneously continue to invest in the long-term sustainable growth of our business through programmatic acquisitions, and partnerships in emerging markets. In Africa, we acquired a minority interest in Alex Forbes, a leading provider of financial advice, retirement, investment, and wealth management in South Africa. We also continue to grow our third-party distribution network in Latin America, particularly in Brazil, where third-party distribution now accounts for about 50% of sales and complements our strong Life Planner channel. Additionally, we advanced our vision to be a global leader in expanding access to investing insurance and retirement security. For example, we completed the second largest pension risk transfer transaction in US market history with IBM and close several major longevity risk transactions, including the $8 billion transaction we completed in the fourth quarter with the Barclays Bank, UK retirement fund. These transactions underscore our leadership in these markets, as well as the strength of our interconnected business model. Our IBM, PRT transaction provided PGIM with more than $8 billion in additional assets under management, and is a good example of how we leverage synergies across our businesses. We see a strong pipeline of opportunities in these markets in the year ahead. We continue to expand our product offerings to meet the increasing customer needs for financial solutions. For example, building on the success of our FlexGuard annuity products, we introduced during the fourth quarter FlexGuard Life, an indexed variable universal life product. In PGIM, we expanded our private loan capabilities through PGIM private capital, including our direct lending capabilities. This broad proprietary origination platform provides our insurance businesses and our institutional clients with unique investment opportunities and is another example of our self-reinforcing business model. We also invested in enhanced customer experiences that blend human touch with advanced technology. In Brazil for example, we expanded our digital sales application to expedite same-day policy delivery and processing with greater automation. In addition, as we administrator for the IBM PRT transaction, we introduced new technology capabilities to expedite the onboarding experience for 100,000 IBM pensioners. And as part of our continued efforts to refine customer experience, we implemented a company-wide initiative to better understand the evolving needs of all our customers around the globe. And in turn, deliver the most effective products and solutions to meet their needs. Moving to slide 4, we achieved $820 million of annual run rate cost savings, exceeding our target of $750 million one year ahead of schedule. We reach this milestone by streamlining and automating the way in which we operate, while improving the customer and employee experience. We leverage new systems and technologies to enhance our digital underwriting, claims and fund processing capabilities, improving efficiency, while reducing customer wait times. For example, for many of our Individual Life customers, we reduce the underwriting time from 22 days to 22 seconds. Our Group Insurance claims processing is now three times faster, and fund verification to process new annuity sales now takes two to three days, down from two to three weeks. We also implemented a hybrid work model for our employees that reduced our U.S. real estate footprint by 50%, equating to approximately $50 million in annual run rate savings. And finally, we adopted a continuous improvement mindset that helps us proactively identify and execute on cost savings opportunities that enhanced customer and employee experiences, and continue to improve our competitiveness going forward. Now to slide 5, our rock solid balance sheet and disciplined approach to capital deployment have helped Prudential navigate financial and macro economic challenges for nearly 150 years. And 2022 was no exception. Our financial strength, including our AA ratings is supported by $4.5 billion in highly liquid assets at the end of the fourth quarter, as well as a high quality, well diversified investment portfolio. We continue to balance investments in the growth of our businesses with returning capital to our shareholders. During the fourth quarter, we returned more than $800 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, for a total of over $7.5 billion since the beginning of 2021. For 2023, our Board has authorized up to $1 billion in share repurchases, as well as a 4% dividend increase beginning in the first quarter. This represents our 15th consecutive annual dividend increase. Looking ahead, our strategic progress, financial strength and self-reinforcing business system, coupled with a higher interest rate environment position as well to be a leader in expanding access to investing, insurance, and retirement for our customers across the globe. Now, before turning it over to Rob, I'd like to extend a special Thank you to all our employees for their dedication to our customers and our communities. Together, we have made significant progress on our transformation, and are fulfilling our purpose of making lives better, by solving the financial challenges of our changing world. And now, over to Rob, to talk about the fourth quarter financial results, and to provide an update on our business performance.\nRob Falzon: Thank you, Charlie. I'll provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for our PGIM, US, and International Businesses. I'll begin on slide six. Pre-tax adjusted operating income was $4.7 billion or $9.46 per share for 2022 and $1.2 billion or $2.42 per share in the fourth quarter. These results reflect lower variable investment and fee income, partially offset by improved mortality as COVID has transitioned to an endemic phase, an increase in spread income due to rising interest rates, and underlying business growth. In addition, full year results include the strengthening of reserves from our annual assumption update and the gain on the sale of the PALAC Legacy variable annuity block. Our GAAP net loss for the quarter was $1.53 per share and included net realized investment losses and related charges and adjustments of $800 million, largely reflecting the impacts of rising interest rates. This loss also included a $700 million goodwill impairment due to the reduction in the estimated fair value of assurance. While assurance is making good progress in many areas and had a profitable fourth quarter, the impairment reflects lower growth expectations, higher discount rate applied to future applied to future cashflows reflecting macroeconomic conditions, and lower publicly traded peer evaluations. Turning to the operating results from our businesses compared to the year ago quarter. PGIM, our global investment manager reported fees, primarily due to lower assets under management, resulting from higher rates and equity market declines. Results of our US businesses primarily reflected less favorable variable investment income, partially offset by the impact of higher rates on spread income and more favorable underwriting. The decrease in earnings and our international businesses primarily reflected lower spread income, largely due to less favorable variable investment income and less favorable underwriting including elevated surrenders in Japan through the depreciation of the yen. Turning to slide seven, PGIM, our global investment manager has diversified capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed income, equities, and alternatives including real estate and private credit. PGIM's investment performance remains attractive with more than 79% of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last three, five, and 10 year periods. For 2022, PGIM experienced positive institutional net flows that were more than offset by retail outflows, primarily in fixed income, consistent with industry trends due to the rising rate environment. In the fourth quarter, PGIM experienced third-party net outflows of $11.7 billion, driven by public fixed income strategies across institutional and retail clients. Institutional net outflows were driven by a few large client redemptions, while retail net outflows reflected the impact of the rising interest rate environment on retail flows across the industry. As the investment engine of Prudential, success and growth of PGIM and of our US and International Insurance and Retirement businesses are mutually reinforcing. PGIM's asset origination capabilities, investment management expertise and access to institutional and other sources of private capital are a competitive advantage, helping our businesses bring enhanced solutions and create more value for our customers. Our insurance and retirement businesses, in turn, provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated flows that totaled $13 billion during 2022 as well as unique access to insurance liabilities. In addition, we continue to grow our alternatives business, which has assets in excess of $230 billion across private credit and real estate equity and debt and benefits from our global scale and market leading positions. Notably, PGIM\u2019s private businesses deployed nearly $43 billion of gross capital in 2022. Turning to slide 8. Our US Businesses produced diversified earnings from fees, net investments spread and underwriting income and benefit from our complimentary mix of longevity and mortality businesses. We continue to shift towards higher growth and less market sensitive products and markets, enhance our customer experience while reducing costs by amplifying the use of capabilities and self-service tools and further expand our addressable markets. Retirement Strategies achieved robust sales in fourth quarter and full year 2022 across its institutional and individual lines of business. Our Institutional Retirement business has market leading capabilities with full year sales of almost $32 billion driving record account values at the end of the year. This includes being selected for a 50% participation in a $16 billion pension risk transfer transaction and our fourth largest international reinsurance transaction of $8 billion in the fourth quarter. In Individual Retirement, product pivots have resulted in continued strong sales of more simplified solutions like FlexGuard and FlexGuard income, representing over $12 billion of sales since inception, as well as increased fixed annuity sales. Our Individual Life sales were consistent through the year and reflect our earlier product pivot strategy, with variable life products representing approximately 70% of sales for the year. And our Group Insurance benefits ratio has improved during the year from lower COVID mortality. Turning to slide 9. Our International Businesses include our Japanese life insurance companies, where we have a differentiated multi-channel distribution model as well as other businesses aimed at expanding our presence in high growth emerging markets. In Japan, we are focused on providing high quality service and expanding our geographic coverage and product offerings. Our needs-based approach and protection product focus continue to provide important value to our customers as we expand our product offerings to meet their evolving needs. In emerging markets, we are focused on creating a carefully selected portfolio of businesses and regions where customer's needs are growing, where there are compelling opportunities to build market leading businesses and where the Prudential enterprise can add value. Our International Businesses experienced their highest sales since the third quarter of 2020, including record sales in Brazil. Compared to the prior year quarter, Gibraltar sales were up 20% mainly driven by the life consultant channel primarily from higher US dollar sales. Life Planner sales were also up 17%, driven by continued momentum in Brazil's third-party distribution channel, as well as higher sales in Japan. As we look ahead, we're well-positioned across our businesses to be a global leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security. We continue to focus on investing in growth businesses in markets, delivering industry leading customer experiences, and creating the next generation of financial solutions to better serve the diverse needs of a broad range of customers. And with that, I'll now hand it over to Ken.\nKen Tanji: Thanks, Rob. I\u2019ll begin on slide 10, which provides insight into earnings for the first quarter of 2023 relative to our fourth quarter results. As noted, pre-tax adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter was $1.2 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $2.42 on an after tax basis. To get a sense of how our first quarter results might develop, we suggest adjustments for the following items. First, variable investment income was below expectations in the fourth quarter by $125 million. Next, we adjust underwriting experience by net $60 million, as we normalize for fourth quarter experience and expect seasonality in the first quarter. And last, we expect other items to increase adjusted operating income by $91 million, primarily due to seasonally elevated expenses in the fourth quarter. These items combined get us to a baseline of $3.01 per share for the first quarter. I'll note that if you exclude items specific to the first quarter, earnings per share would be $3.07. The key takeaway is that, our underlying earnings power has improved due to the business growth and the benefit of higher interest rates. While we have provided these items to consider, please note that there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the first quarter. As we as we look forward, we have included other considerations for 2023 in the appendix. Turning to slide 11. I'll now provide an update on the adoption of the new accounting standard for long duration insurance contracts which went into effect on January 1. The new standard applies to our GAAP financial statements and will have no direct effect on our statutory financial statements, cash flows or dividend capacity. We estimate that as of September 30, 2022, GAAP equity will increase by approximately $15 billion comprised of two components. Accumulated other comprehensive income, or AOCI, will increase by approximately $17 billion, primarily due to remeasurement of long duration liabilities with higher discount rates in our Japan business. Retained earnings will be reduced by approximately $2 billion, reflecting the reclassification of non-performance risk gains from retained earnings AOCI and other changes in reserves. Also of note, GAAP equity will continue to exclude certain unrealized insurance margins from products subject to LDTI. As of September 30, 2022, the estimated after-tax unrealized insurance margins related to those products are approximately $50 billion, primarily in our Japan business. These margins are an important factor in determining financial strength and assessing profitability. And finally, we do not expect significant impacts from LDTI on our total underlying earnings power, as impacts across our businesses will largely offset. Turning to slide 12. Our capital position continues to support our AA financial strength rating. Our cash and liquid assets were $4.5 billion, at the high end of our liquidity target range. We have substantial off-balance sheet resources, including contingent capital and liquidity facilities. We remain thoughtful in our capital deployment, balancing the preservation of financial strength, investment in our businesses and shareholder distributions. Turning to slide 13 and in summary. We are transforming our businesses for sustainable growth. We exceeded our targeted cost savings one year ahead of plan and will maintain our discipline and continuous improvement mindset going forward. We continue to navigate the current macro environment with the financial strength of our rock solid balance sheet. Now, I'll turn it to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Erik Bass from Autonomous Research. Your line is now live.\nErik Bass: Hi. Thank you. Just hoping you could talk a bit more about how you're viewing excess capital. If we look at the pieces you provide, the pike RBC ratio is below the 400% level where it's run historically, I think the SMR ratio looks in line and Holdco liquidity is within your target range, but at the low end, if we adjust for the planned debt call that you talked about on the last call. So if this suggests a little excess capital, but are there other pieces or sources that we should be considering?\nKen Tanji: Yeah. Hey, Erik, it's Ken. Overall, we do feel good about our overall capital picture in multiple parts, as you suggest, but I thought it might be helpful to give a little bit of an overall context for our capital management. We've had a very well-established and consistent approach. And we've served us very well particularly last year as we look to shift our business to be less market-sensitive and grow, while also maintaining financial strength and the flexibility. We closed the sales of our full service business and the PALAC variable annuity block last year that released capital at attractive terms. And we also deployed capital to the second largest PRT transaction with IBM. We also, as we mentioned and discussed on our last call, absorbed the capital impact of the assumption update in our life insurance business and the non-economic impact of higher rates on staffed capital. Again, that was expected. It's manageable, and we've appropriately addressed those capital implications. When you put that all together, we ended 2022 in a solid capital position. Our RBC ratios were above our AA objectives and our target there is to be above 3.75%. Our Japan solvency margin ratios are above their AA objectives. We have an HLA balance of $4.5 billion at the Holdco. And as you mentioned, that's at the high end of our target range. And we have a healthy outlook for our businesses with sustained profitability and free cash flow, so that led our Board to authorize $1 billion of share repurchases for next year \u2013 or this year, actually, 2023, and that's reflective of our capital position as we end 2022. That also considers the free cash flow outlook for our businesses and our opportunities to deploy capital and also the macro environment, whether that's a potential for another recession or other stress events. So again, when we put that all together, we feel good that we're consistent with our AA objectives. We have a level of flexibility, and that's what our board considered when they issued where they authorized $1 billion in share repurchases for this year and increased our dividend 4%, which, again, is the 15th straight year of dividend increases. So hopefully, I gave you a much broader answer there, but I hope that's helpful context.\nErik Bass: Yes. Thank you. And then my second question was just hoping you could provide a bit more color on the company's sensitivity to short-term interest rates, which it seems like has been a big uplift, particularly in the individual retirement business. Hoping to get a little bit of the sensitivity there. And then just wondering if it were to reverse and the Fed were to cut interest rates would then you see kind of the earnings pattern for individual retirement move back lower?\nKen Tanji: Hey, Erik, I'll start and then turn it over to Caroline to give a broader business context. But just from a sheer sensitivity to short-term rates, yes, we are benefiting from short-term rates. And generally, overall, our variable annuity business is sensitive to rates, both long-term and short-term. So a rise in both is actually helping us. In terms of short-term rates, we did see a pickup in earnings, because we're earning a higher return from collateral, that's posted on our hedging positions, and that's driven by the uptick in short-term rates. But there's more dynamics going on broadly for the business. So maybe Caroline, I'll turn it over to you for that.\nCaroline Feeney: Yes, of course, Ken. So Erik, first, I should point out that the individual annuities market had a record year last year with over $300 billion of sales and our own individual retirement strategies business delivered strong sales and earnings, and our sales success continues to be driven by our FlexGuard suite of index variable annuities where we now have over $12 billion in sales clearly reinforcing our leadership position as a top five player in this market. We also saw, Erik, some strong growth in our fixed indexed and fixed annuity solutions with fourth quarter results twice that of what we saw in the third quarter. Actually, in fact, more than 25% of our sales for the quarter came from these products. So ultimately, we're pleased with the progress we've made in this space. And we like the diversification these products bring to our overall business mix and the role they can play as a strong complement to our FlexGuard suite of solutions.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Tom Gallagher from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live.\nTom Gallagher: Good morning. Ken, should we think about that reduction being a planned use of the $4.5 billion of Holdco cash in 2023. I think you have a callable instrument in the middle part of the year of $1.5 billion. Should we assume your planning on calling that, or you still expect -- should we expect that to remain outstanding?\nKen Tanji: Yes. Generally are -- and again, I think I mentioned this on the last call, our overall level of debt has been pretty consistent over the last few years. And we do have the ability to call about $1.5 billion of debt this year in June. But that's up to us. We're not obligated to do so. It is our practice to pre-fund upcoming maturities and calls and we've factored that into our debt issuance plans last year. Having said that, we're going to continue to evaluate the market conditions in our liquidity position and factor that into the decision to -- and the timing to call the debt or not. And we're also going to look at our overall funding needs going forward. And again, our discipline is to pre-fund upcoming plan. So it's really an ongoing cycle is the best way you should think of it.\nTom Gallagher: Okay. Thanks. And then can you -- just for my follow-up, can you talk about how big of a GUL charge you took at -- for the -- at PICA for year-end? And any other, we'll call it, adjustments that we consider that occurred on a statutory basis at year-end between I assume there might have been AAT reserve releases or any other ins and outs that you can provide on the statutory impacts? Thanks.\nKen Tanji: Sure, Tom. We -- as we described, when we updated our assumptions for GAAP, we would be making those same assumption updates for stat and that -- for statutory purposes occurs in the fourth quarter. So that was -- our GAAP impact was about $1.4 billion. It is larger on a stat basis. Stat tends to be more conservative, and that's what occurred in the fourth quarter. That was generally what led to the -- our RBC ratio in the fourth quarter going from above 400% to below it, but still, again, above our AA objective of 375. And we didn't make a capital contribution into PICA to achieve that again as we expected. So, just a reminder of the moving parts there.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Suneet Kamath from Jefferies. Your line is now live.\nSuneet Kamath: Thanks. I guess for Ken. Just curious, have you used Lotus Re yet and if and when you use it, should we expect sort of the freed resources to be somewhere in that neighborhood of the $800 million capital contribution that you originally made?\nKen Tanji: Yes, thanks for bringing that up. We do have a company in Bermuda called Lotus Re, which is a reinsurer. And it does give us the capability to reinsure business to that entity, and we did so in 2022. As you mentioned, we initially capitalized it and then we reinsured a block of variable life business to that business -- to that entity in 2022, and that was a source of capital release. And all that was factored into our PICA outcomes for the year, which, again, we continue to be above 375.\nSuneet Kamath: And can you size that capital release?\nKen Tanji: I don't think we want to put a precise number on it. It's an internal reinsurance transaction, but it does improve our flexibility.\nSuneet Kamath: Got it. And then I guess my follow-up for Charlie. I guess, overnight, we saw some headlines that came out about -- I don't know if they were quoting you are referring to some comments that you made about Prudential's M&A strategy and perhaps a change post I'm assuming the goodwill write-downs for Assurance IQ. So, I just wanted to give you a chance to comment on that and kind of how you're thinking about M&A, especially as you think about that strategy around improving the earnings contribution from growth businesses that you talked about, I guess, two years ago?\nCharlie Lowrey: Sure, Suneet. Thanks for the question and our ability to clarify. Yes, we saw the headlines too and we're slightly surprised. The -- our strategy remains consistent with exactly what we have been doing. So, what we've said is that we won't be investing in early-stage companies with less proven track records. What we're focusing on is developing a portfolio programmatic acquisitions, concentrating on more established businesses where we can expand the capabilities and scale of our existing businesses. And this approach supports what you said, which is our strategy of growing PGIM and emerging markets and really focusing on asset management and high-growth international markets that will help increase our fee earnings and growth profile. And if you look at our recent -- most recent four transactions, which include ICEA LION, Montana Capital Partners, Custom Harvest Asset Management, and most recently, Alexforbes, these are all examples of this approach of acquiring more established companies and are consistent with what we have done and what we will do going forward.\nSuneet Kamath: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. \nAlex Scott: Hi. First one I had is on just sort of sources of cash flow as we think about 2023. You've talked about $1 billion of share repurchases, potentially some debt reduction. Could you talk about how that will be funded between PGIM cash flows, PICA in the US businesses versus Japan. And specifically, I'm interested in particular in PICA, if you plan to take dividends out this year?\nKen Tanji: Yes. Alex, it's Ken. Our businesses are generating free cash flow to maintain our shareholder distributions, but -- and also to support the growth of the business. And we do have diverse sources of cash flow to the parent company. That's provided by our business mix across our US insurance and retirement PGIM and Japan businesses. And they're all expected to contribute over time, I think the way to think about our free cash flow ratio is it's been about 65% given our -- of our after-tax AOI, given our mix of business and growth. And we think that's about right. And we would expect, again, to receive capital from all of our businesses, including the PICA legal entity.\nAlex Scott: Got it. Second question I had is on Japan. Sales have picked up recently and looked pretty good. I guess, the premium growth is still a bit weaker on year-over-year comps and so forth. So I was just interested in what you expect from that, what kind of top line growth can we expect from that business?\nAndy Sullivan: So Alex, it's Andy. I'll take your question. Yes, you sort of mentioned some of the effects as we look back from the COVID pandemic that obviously resulted in some headwinds from a sales perspective. But thankfully, as we sit here, those pandemic challenges have subsided quite a bit. We're exceptionally proud of our Japanese businesses. We've steadily increased our market share over time, and we've consistently ranked in the top three for new business face amounts every year of the last decade, that's generated significant earnings and cash flows for Prudential. Our strategy to grow the business is threefold. First, we're very focused on continuing to strengthen and expand both our captive and our third-party distribution; Second, we're going to continue to innovate and expand on the solutions that we deliver to our customers; and finally, and importantly, we remain laser-focused on delivering an outstanding customer experience with a particular emphasis on our digital capabilities. We're very, very proud and good at that. In fact, we're consistently ranked by J.D. Power's in the top three and often number one in policy issuance, policy service and claims. The market remains highly attractive to us, and we intend to grow our position in the low-single digits over time.\nAlex Scott: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Ryan Krueger from KBW. Your line is now live.\nRyan Krueger: Hey, good morning. I had a follow-up on Japan. Have you seen any change in policyholder behavior in terms that may be driven by the weaker and volatile yen that we've seen over the last year regarding the FX products? Thanks.\nAndy Sullivan: Yes, Ryan, it's Andy again. I'll take the question. So given the rise in the US dollar and the weakening of the yen, we have seen an elevated level of surrenders in the business. The effect there is really some customers are looking to monetize their gains out of their non-yen products in yen terms. That being said, we saw this effect begin to decelerate in the month of December, and that deceleration has continued here in the month of January as the yen appreciate it. So we would expect as the yen starts to stabilize, this effect will stabilize in the business.\nRyan Krueger: Got it. And then on the FC well charge, is there a chance that some of that could reverse from AAT subtest from higher interest rates when you do the look back in 2023?\nKen Tanji: Ryan, it's Ken. I think you're referring to our asset adequacy testing. We're not expecting any significant change in our AAT reserves in light of the higher rate environment.\nRyan Krueger: Okay. Got it. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Tracy Benguigui from Barclays. Your line is now live.\nTracy Benguigui: Thank you. A follow-up on your statutory reserve charge for your assumption update. Last quarter, Ken, you mentioned it would be absorbed within PICA's excess capital position. Has that changed in the quarter where the ultimate size ended up being higher than your expectations and also on like GAAP reserve charges, I understand that funding for a statutory reserve charge does not have to come in all at once in 4Q. So can you share if you booked a portion of it before 4Q?\nKen Tanji: Hey, Tracy, no, in terms of the assumption update, that is recorded in \u2013 that was recorded in the fourth quarter, again, consistent with established practice for statutory reporting. And nothing new there to report came in as expected, and we did not \u2013 we did not need to fund PICA with capital from Holdco as \u2013 also as expected. So, nothing really new there.\nTracy Benguigui: Okay. And your latest buyback authorization levels suggest you're not meeting your objective over three years of $11 billion of capital returns. So I'm just \u2013 if you could walk us through what has changed since you set that objective. Was it just the reserve charge, or is it something else like PRT? I guess, my broader question is from this experience, are you rethinking the idea of coming up with a multiyear plan versus a singular year plan?\nKen Tanji: Yeah. Tracy, it's Ken. Just looking back here and as a reminder, we set that a three-year objective in 2021 and the target was initially $10 billion over the three-year period. Later in 2021, we increased that objective as cash flow for 2021 was very strong. And as I kind of highlighted earlier in the call, in 2022, last year, we managed through a number of significant items, which was our assumption update in our life insurance business, the jumping rates and the non-economic impact on stat accounting and then we had the major PRT transactions. And again, when we put that all together, we think we end up to \u2013 at the end of 2022 in a very competitive position from a capital standpoint and a healthy outlook for our businesses with sustained cash flow going forward. So yeah, that's what got factored into the decision along with the outlook of the economy with the recession uncertainty. So the $1 billion will put us a little shy of the $11 billion, but it will only take about another quarter to achieve that.\nTracy Benguigui: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.\nJimmy Bhullar: Thanks. First, just could you talk about your sales pipeline in PGIM in both the retail and the institutional side and how that's looking?\nAndy Sullivan: Sure, Jimmy, it's Andy. We have a high degree of confidence in our approach in PGIM. As you've heard me say before, flows are an outcome of really three things; having a broad and diversified product portfolio, great long-term investment results and great distribution. The bottom line is we've stayed very focused on those elements because we know they work. It has resulted in our strong track record over -- with positive flows in 18 of the last 20 years. So we're continuing to expand our product range in vehicles. Just as an example, our ultra-short bond ETF ranked number two in terms of net flow rate in its category. Second, we're continuing to invest in distribution on both the retail and institutional side. In retail, we're maintaining our high activity, high visibility approach with advisers. And in institutional, we added a significant number of new clients this year. And then obviously, finally, our long-term investment track record speaks for itself over three, five and 10 years. The predominant impact that we've seen has been a fixed income impact. And in particular, we believe that sustained higher rates are really good for the fixed income business. So we're going to keep doing what we know works, and we're confident that we're going to be a net grower over time.\nJimmy Bhullar: Do you have enough visibility to assume that you'll have positive flows on an overall basis at PGIM for 2023 or too early to say?\nAndy Sullivan: So as I've said in the past, flow is very a good bit quarter-to-quarter, especially on the institutional side, they're chunky. So we wouldn't provide a forecast on that. Over the long run, we know that we're going to grow.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from John Barnidge from Piper Sandler. Your line is now live.\nJohn Barnidge: Thank you very much. My question is around agents. As I look at the agent count, they've declined overall in international. Is there anything being done to drive greater agent recruitment, or with productivity improved? Are you taking assurance lessons on the tax side to the agent force more generally?\nAndy Sullivan: So John, it's Andy. I'll take your question. So really, the impact you saw near-term, COVID kept pressure on our recruiting efforts and retention efforts. Fact is, throughout the last couple of years, it was a harder environment to recruit and establish culture with new agents. That impacted our life consultant count more so than our Life Planner counts, but it did affect both. As we've started to transition to more of an endemic, we are seeing an improvement and expect to see an improvement over time. We'll remain focused on two areas; first, strengthening our existing people's performance and we're exceptionally proud of our talent. We have the highest number of million dollar roundtable members who really deliver every single day for our customers. And second, we are continuing to lean in to attract land and develop new agents, which as we come out of the COVID pandemic, we believe will be easier for us. So this is a model that has worked for us very consistently over a long period of time, and we expect to keep seeing steady performance.\nJohn Barnidge: Thank you for that. And then my follow-up question. Can you talk about the decline in group new annualized premium in both Group Life and Group Disability? Is this from renewals, selective exits or job cuts at the large and jumbo into the market? Thank you.\nCaroline Feeney: Sure. John, it's Caroline. So I'll take your question. So first of all, just let me say, we're very pleased with the momentum that we've seen in our Group Insurance business. And as you're aware, the fourth quarter does tend to be a little lighter in terms of sales quarter, with the first quarter being our largest, as the majority of our cases do have January 1 inception dates. So the lower sales that you're noticing on a year-over-year basis is largely due to just a large case buyout last year that drove up sales volumes. And these do occur periodically and certainly can produce some variability in sales volumes, particularly in those lighter sales quarters. So John, if you were to normalize for last year's one-time buyout that we saw sales are actually up about 7%. And obviously, this is on the disability side. On the life side, it was just a matter of timing of premiums driven by changes in when some customers do enrollment in the year. So I would just say, overall, we feel very good as well about our existing pipeline as we continue with our strong sales momentum.\nJohn Barnidge : Thank you for the answers.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question, can you talk about the impact that you've seen on your RBC ratio from the IMR getting forward at zero. And do you think that, that issue is solvable via either NAIC changes or by getting a permitted practice from New Jersey?\nKen Tanji : Yes. Hey, Elyse, the impact on our PICA RBC ratio was about 35 basis points, maybe a little bit more. And that occurred with the rise in rates from 2Q through 4Q. And you'll be able to see that in our Blue Book and Green Book combined. So we'll be reporting that at the end of the month. We have been with very active discussions with regulators, and I know many others have across the industry have been as well. There seems to be a good understanding of the issue and a lot of careful consideration being given on how to best address it, so more to come. But rest assured, we're working with our regulators and many others are as well to see what -- how best to address this issue.\nElyse Greenspan: Thanks. And then, Rob, I think you had mentioned that the Board was looking at capital deployment in the context of a recession and severe credit cycle potential. Can you talk about what kind of credit outlook factored into the Board's decision on the 2023 buyback plan? And what is your budget for downgrades and impairments if we enter into a recession?\nRob Axel: Thanks, Elyse. We -- as Ken articulated earlier, the decision with regard to the buybacks factored in a number of considerations, including in that the possibility of recession and obviously, a recession that might be accompanied by a credit cycle, which could affect the portfolio. A couple of thoughts on that. First, while we do scenarios, which would anticipate the potential for both negative migration and credit losses, we also take some comfort, as our Board did from the strength that we have in portfolio management. We think we're incredibly well positioned in the event of any deterioration in the economy that might lead to a credit cycle. We're not yet seeing any of that, I'll note Elyse. If you look at our net credit migration in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2022, it was actually positive. So, we haven't seen any imminent signs of distress sort of percolating within the portfolio that would lead us to be overly concerned about that. But as we established the buyback amount that was authorized, we did anticipate that such a thing could occur and that we would want to be able to both anticipate that level of buyback and have the strength to be able to absorb anything that might happen from a negative migration or default standpoint.\nKen Tanji: Maybe I'll just add just to remind people, we do have contingent sources of funding, in particular, our PCAPs, which is $3 billion is a guaranteed source of funding. So, that's an important source of funding in the event of a variety of reasons, including stress.\nElyse Greenspan: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live.\nAndrew Kligerman: Hey good morning. I know there's been a number of capital questions and the IMR was impacted this quarter due to derivative losses given rising interest rates, now we've got rates coming off a bit in 1Q 2023. So, I'm wondering if you could give us a little sensitivity on rates and how we can think about that impact on capital, particularly with regard to these derivatives?\nKen Tanji: Yes. Again, rising rates is generally a good thing economically. But for this one item called IMR, a decline in rates would help. But it's a pretty complicated and complex item and will also vary depending upon the activity level. So, I can't give you a precise sensitivity as a result. But we factored into our overall capital position in order to make sure we can deal with the volatility.\nAndrew Kligerman: Okay. Okay. And maybe help us on the expenses. So, you've got this terrific $820 million run rate savings. But as I look at results, I'm unable to kind of find those benefits falling to the bottom-line. So, maybe like a little color geographically, is all of it hitting the bottom-line? Like just a little color as to how we could think about that $820 million going forward?\nKen Tanji: Yes. It has been a company-wide objective. So, the impact is across all of our businesses and the contribution that our corporate centers make towards that. And it does hit the bottom-line. Having said that, we are investing to grow certain business lines, particularly PGIM and International and so they just want to add that dynamic in there as well.\nAndrew Kligerman: Got it. And just a real quick technical question. Are you planning to deploy capital into Assurance IQ going forward, or will it -- now that its generating a little profit, can it be self-funding?\nKen Tanji: Yes, we've maintained Assurance well-capitalized and funded its losses as they've been incurred. Profitability continues to improve and we'll continue to keep it well-capitalized going forward.\nAndrew Kligerman: Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Michael Ward from Citi. Your line is now live.\nMichael Ward: Thanks guys. Good morning. Just a high level question, I was wondering if the capital pressures, reserve charge, maybe earnings pressure in certain lines over the last 12 months or so. I'm wondering if that has changed specifically how you think about your business mix at all. And I know you've taken a few solid steps so far, but it seems like some incremental divestment or derisking could help reduce some of these pressures going forward. So I'm just wondering how you think about that prospect?\nCharlie Lowrey: Sure, Mike. It's Charlie. I'll take that. So as you know, we've made significant progress in our transformation so far, but we would also note, we still have more work to do to become a higher growth and less market sensitive company. And as we look ahead, we're going to focus on our financial performance. We're going to focus on advancing our transformation, including the customer and employee experience, and we're going to focus on continuing to thoughtfully deploy capital. All of that, with a goal of creating long-term sustainable value for all our stakeholders. And we think we're well-positioned across our businesses to be a global leader in expanding access to investment -- investing insurance and retirement security. And we'll do that in three ways. We'll continue to invest in our growth businesses and markets as we go forward, we'll deliver industry leading customer experiencing, leveraging our broad capabilities and scope of diversified businesses, and which we'll continue to invest as well, and we'll create the next generation of financial solutions to better serve the diverse needs of a broad range of customers. So what I'd say in summary is that we're definitely committed to becoming a higher growth, less market sensitive company. And our progress will obviously be dependent upon opportunities that arise and the macroeconomic conditions we face, but we're laser focused on what we need to do, and we'll accomplish that.\nMichael Ward: Okay, great. Thank you. And most of my questions were asked, but I was curious, just sort of nail in the coffin, making sure you're not liable for the earn-out with Assurance IQ?\nKen Tanji: Yeah, I'll cover that. Actually, one of the things that we disclosed for GAAP is the fair value of that earn-out, and we've been disclosing that as zero. So I think that would give you a good indication.\nMichael Ward: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is a follow-up from Suneet Kamath from Jefferies. Your line is now live.\nSuneet Kamath: Great. Thanks for the follow-up. Maybe just two quick ones. Just for Ken, I was curious about your comment about no change to AAT reserves even with the move up in rates. Can you just talk about why that would be the case?\nKen Tanji: Yeah, because AAT, I mean it looks at a number of scenarios and it also looks at not just the level of ending surplus but also interim periods. And with derivatives, we have some interim periods that offset the impact of higher rates on the ultimate period. So it's a little technical question. But overall, little changes there.\nSuneet Kamath: Got it. And then just curious on LDTI. I know you said that the AO impacts offset across businesses. But can you just give us a sense of maybe, which businesses benefits, and which businesses saw some pressure?\nKen Tanji: Yeah. Sure. So yeah, again, overall, we don't expect an overall change to the run rate level of the earnings. And actually, some of the businesses will have no or little impact, which would be, as you would expect, PGIM, Assurance and Group Insurance. The earnings from our International and Institutional Retirement businesses, are expected to increase on a run rate basis, and that's really due to the earlier recognition of the unrealized insurance margins, which are quite sizable. On the other hand, earnings from individual retirement and life insurance in the US are expected to be lower, and that's primarily due to the slower recognition of revenue for those businesses. Again, kind of some pluses and minuses that offset but that's sort of the segment level information. We, like others, will be providing a lot more information prior to our first quarter earnings when we restate under the new standard. So, you can expect to get a lot more.\nSuneet Kamath: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Lowrey for any further or closing comments.\nCharlie Lowrey: Okay, thank you. And thank you everyone for joining us today. I hope we demonstrated the progress we are making to transform Prudential to deliver sustainable, long-term growth and meet the evolving needs of our customers. Looking ahead, we remain confident in our strategy and the strength of our company. For nearly 150 years, Prudential is focused on creating value for our customers and other stakeholders who we will continue to serve as we strive to be the global leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security. Thank you again for your time today.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ken Tanji",
            "content": "Thanks, Rob. I'll begin on slide 10, which provides insight into earnings for the first quarter of 2023 relative to our fourth quarter results. As noted, pre-tax adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter was $1.2 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $2.42 on an after tax basis. To get a sense of how our first quarter results might develop, we suggest adjustments for the following items. First, variable investment income was below expectations in the fourth quarter by $125 million. Next, we adjust underwriting experience by net $60 million, as we normalize for fourth quarter experience and expect seasonality in the first quarter. And last, we expect other items to increase adjusted operating income by $91 million, primarily due to seasonally elevated expenses in the fourth quarter. These items combined get us to a baseline of $3.01 per share for the first quarter. I'll note that if you exclude items specific to the first quarter, earnings per share would be $3.07. The key takeaway is that, our underlying earnings power has improved due to the business growth and the benefit of higher interest rates. While we have provided these items to consider, please note that there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the first quarter. As we as we look forward, we have included other considerations for 2023 in the appendix. Turning to slide 11. I'll now provide an update on the adoption of the new accounting standard for long duration insurance contracts which went into effect on January 1. The new standard applies to our GAAP financial statements and will have no direct effect on our statutory financial statements, cash flows or dividend capacity. We estimate that as of September 30, 2022, GAAP equity will increase by approximately $15 billion comprised of two components. Accumulated other comprehensive income, or AOCI, will increase by approximately $17 billion, primarily due to remeasurement of long duration liabilities with higher discount rates in our Japan business. Retained earnings will be reduced by approximately $2 billion, reflecting the reclassification of non-performance risk gains from retained earnings AOCI and other changes in reserves. Also of note, GAAP equity will continue to exclude certain unrealized insurance margins from products subject to LDTI. As of September 30, 2022, the estimated after-tax unrealized insurance margins related to those products are approximately $50 billion, primarily in our Japan business. These margins are an important factor in determining financial strength and assessing profitability. And finally, we do not expect significant impacts from LDTI on our total underlying earnings power, as impacts across our businesses will largely offset. Turning to slide 12. Our capital position continues to support our AA financial strength rating. Our cash and liquid assets were $4.5 billion, at the high end of our liquidity target range. We have substantial off-balance sheet resources, including contingent capital and liquidity facilities. We remain thoughtful in our capital deployment, balancing the preservation of financial strength, investment in our businesses and shareholder distributions. Turning to slide 13 and in summary. We are transforming our businesses for sustainable growth. We exceeded our targeted cost savings one year ahead of plan and will maintain our discipline and continuous improvement mindset going forward. We continue to navigate the current macro environment with the financial strength of our rock solid balance sheet. Now, I'll turn it to the operator for your questions. Yeah. Hey, Erik, it's Ken. Overall, we do feel good about our overall capital picture in multiple parts, as you suggest, but I thought it might be helpful to give a little bit of an overall context for our capital management. We've had a very well-established and consistent approach. And we've served us very well particularly last year as we look to shift our business to be less market-sensitive and grow, while also maintaining financial strength and the flexibility. We closed the sales of our full service business and the PALAC variable annuity block last year that released capital at attractive terms. And we also deployed capital to the second largest PRT transaction with IBM. We also, as we mentioned and discussed on our last call, absorbed the capital impact of the assumption update in our life insurance business and the non-economic impact of higher rates on staffed capital. Again, that was expected. It's manageable, and we've appropriately addressed those capital implications. When you put that all together, we ended 2022 in a solid capital position. Our RBC ratios were above our AA objectives and our target there is to be above 3.75%. Our Japan solvency margin ratios are above their AA objectives. We have an HLA balance of $4.5 billion at the Holdco. And as you mentioned, that's at the high end of our target range. And we have a healthy outlook for our businesses with sustained profitability and free cash flow, so that led our Board to authorize $1 billion of share repurchases for next year \u2013 or this year, actually, 2023, and that's reflective of our capital position as we end 2022. That also considers the free cash flow outlook for our businesses and our opportunities to deploy capital and also the macro environment, whether that's a potential for another recession or other stress events. So again, when we put that all together, we feel good that we're consistent with our AA objectives. We have a level of flexibility, and that's what our board considered when they issued where they authorized $1 billion in share repurchases for this year and increased our dividend 4%, which, again, is the 15th straight year of dividend increases. So hopefully, I gave you a much broader answer there, but I hope that's helpful context. Hey, Erik, I'll start and then turn it over to Caroline to give a broader business context. But just from a sheer sensitivity to short-term rates, yes, we are benefiting from short-term rates. And generally, overall, our variable annuity business is sensitive to rates, both long-term and short-term. So a rise in both is actually helping us. In terms of short-term rates, we did see a pickup in earnings, because we're earning a higher return from collateral, that's posted on our hedging positions, and that's driven by the uptick in short-term rates. But there's more dynamics going on broadly for the business. So maybe Caroline, I'll turn it over to you for that. Yes. Generally are -- and again, I think I mentioned this on the last call, our overall level of debt has been pretty consistent over the last few years. And we do have the ability to call about $1.5 billion of debt this year in June. But that's up to us. We're not obligated to do so. It is our practice to pre-fund upcoming maturities and calls and we've factored that into our debt issuance plans last year. Having said that, we're going to continue to evaluate the market conditions in our liquidity position and factor that into the decision to -- and the timing to call the debt or not. And we're also going to look at our overall funding needs going forward. And again, our discipline is to pre-fund upcoming plan. So it's really an ongoing cycle is the best way you should think of it. Sure, Tom. We -- as we described, when we updated our assumptions for GAAP, we would be making those same assumption updates for stat and that -- for statutory purposes occurs in the fourth quarter. So that was -- our GAAP impact was about $1.4 billion. It is larger on a stat basis. Stat tends to be more conservative, and that's what occurred in the fourth quarter. That was generally what led to the -- our RBC ratio in the fourth quarter going from above 400% to below it, but still, again, above our AA objective of 375. And we didn't make a capital contribution into PICA to achieve that again as we expected. So, just a reminder of the moving parts there. Yes, thanks for bringing that up. We do have a company in Bermuda called Lotus Re, which is a reinsurer. And it does give us the capability to reinsure business to that entity, and we did so in 2022. As you mentioned, we initially capitalized it and then we reinsured a block of variable life business to that business -- to that entity in 2022, and that was a source of capital release. And all that was factored into our PICA outcomes for the year, which, again, we continue to be above 375. I don't think we want to put a precise number on it. It's an internal reinsurance transaction, but it does improve our flexibility. Yes. Alex, it's Ken. Our businesses are generating free cash flow to maintain our shareholder distributions, but -- and also to support the growth of the business. And we do have diverse sources of cash flow to the parent company. That's provided by our business mix across our US insurance and retirement PGIM and Japan businesses. And they're all expected to contribute over time, I think the way to think about our free cash flow ratio is it's been about 65% given our -- of our after-tax AOI, given our mix of business and growth. And we think that's about right. And we would expect, again, to receive capital from all of our businesses, including the PICA legal entity. Ryan, it's Ken. I think you're referring to our asset adequacy testing. We're not expecting any significant change in our AAT reserves in light of the higher rate environment. Hey, Tracy, no, in terms of the assumption update, that is recorded in \u2013 that was recorded in the fourth quarter, again, consistent with established practice for statutory reporting. And nothing new there to report came in as expected, and we did not \u2013 we did not need to fund PICA with capital from Holdco as \u2013 also as expected. So, nothing really new there. Yeah. Tracy, it's Ken. Just looking back here and as a reminder, we set that a three-year objective in 2021 and the target was initially $10 billion over the three-year period. Later in 2021, we increased that objective as cash flow for 2021 was very strong. And as I kind of highlighted earlier in the call, in 2022, last year, we managed through a number of significant items, which was our assumption update in our life insurance business, the jumping rates and the non-economic impact on stat accounting and then we had the major PRT transactions. And again, when we put that all together, we think we end up to \u2013 at the end of 2022 in a very competitive position from a capital standpoint and a healthy outlook for our businesses with sustained cash flow going forward. So yeah, that's what got factored into the decision along with the outlook of the economy with the recession uncertainty. So the $1 billion will put us a little shy of the $11 billion, but it will only take about another quarter to achieve that. Yes. Hey, Elyse, the impact on our PICA RBC ratio was about 35 basis points, maybe a little bit more. And that occurred with the rise in rates from 2Q through 4Q. And you'll be able to see that in our Blue Book and Green Book combined. So we'll be reporting that at the end of the month. We have been with very active discussions with regulators, and I know many others have across the industry have been as well. There seems to be a good understanding of the issue and a lot of careful consideration being given on how to best address it, so more to come. But rest assured, we're working with our regulators and many others are as well to see what -- how best to address this issue. Maybe I'll just add just to remind people, we do have contingent sources of funding, in particular, our PCAPs, which is $3 billion is a guaranteed source of funding. So, that's an important source of funding in the event of a variety of reasons, including stress. Yes. Again, rising rates is generally a good thing economically.

So, I can't give you a precise sensitivity as a result. But we factored into our overall capital position in order to make sure we can deal with the volatility. Yes.

            "name": "Andy Sullivan",
            "content": "So Alex, it's Andy. I'll take your question. Yes, you sort of mentioned some of the effects as we look back from the COVID pandemic that obviously resulted in some headwinds from a sales perspective. But thankfully, as we sit here, those pandemic challenges have subsided quite a bit. We're exceptionally proud of our Japanese businesses. We've steadily increased our market share over time, and we've consistently ranked in the top three for new business face amounts every year of the last decade, that's generated significant earnings and cash flows for Prudential. Our strategy to grow the business is threefold. First, we're very focused on continuing to strengthen and expand both our captive and our third-party distribution; Second, we're going to continue to innovate and expand on the solutions that we deliver to our customers; and finally, and importantly, we remain laser-focused on delivering an outstanding customer experience with a particular emphasis on our digital capabilities. We're very, very proud and good at that. In fact, we're consistently ranked by J.D. Power's in the top three and often number one in policy issuance, policy service and claims. The market remains highly attractive to us, and we intend to grow our position in the low-single digits over time. Yes, Ryan, it's Andy again. I'll take the question. So given the rise in the US dollar and the weakening of the yen, we have seen an elevated level of surrenders in the business. The effect there is really some customers are looking to monetize their gains out of their non-yen products in yen terms. That being said, we saw this effect begin to decelerate in the month of December, and that deceleration has continued here in the month of January as the yen appreciate it. So we would expect as the yen starts to stabilize, this effect will stabilize in the business. Sure, Jimmy, it's Andy. We have a high degree of confidence in our approach in PGIM. As you've heard me say before, flows are an outcome of really three things; having a broad and diversified product portfolio, great long-term investment results and great distribution. The bottom line is we've stayed very focused on those elements because we know they work. It has resulted in our strong track record over -- with positive flows in 18 of the last 20 years. So we're continuing to expand our product range in vehicles. Just as an example, our ultra-short bond ETF ranked number two in terms of net flow rate in its category. Second, we're continuing to invest in distribution on both the retail and institutional side. In retail, we're maintaining our high activity, high visibility approach with advisers. And in institutional, we added a significant number of new clients this year. And then obviously, finally, our long-term investment track record speaks for itself over three, five and 10 years. The predominant impact that we've seen has been a fixed income impact. And in particular, we believe that sustained higher rates are really good for the fixed income business. So we're going to keep doing what we know works, and we're confident that we're going to be a net grower over time. So as I've said in the past, flow is very a good bit quarter-to-quarter, especially on the institutional side, they're chunky. So we wouldn't provide a forecast on that. Over the long run, we know that we're going to grow. So John, it's Andy. I'll take your question. So really, the impact you saw near-term, COVID kept pressure on our recruiting efforts and retention efforts. Fact is, throughout the last couple of years, it was a harder environment to recruit and establish culture with new agents. That impacted our life consultant count more so than our Life Planner counts, but it did affect both. As we've started to transition to more of an endemic, we are seeing an improvement and expect to see an improvement over time. We'll remain focused on two areas; first, strengthening our existing people's performance and we're exceptionally proud of our talent. We have the highest number of million dollar roundtable members who really deliver every single day for our customers. And second, we are continuing to lean in to attract land and develop new agents, which as we come out of the COVID pandemic, we believe will be easier for us. So this is a model that has worked for us very consistently over a long period of time, and we expect to keep seeing steady performance."

            "name": "Caroline Feeney",
            "content": "Yes, of course, Ken. So Erik, first, I should point out that the individual annuities market had a record year last year with over $300 billion of sales and our own individual retirement strategies business delivered strong sales and earnings, and our sales success continues to be driven by our FlexGuard suite of index variable annuities where we now have over $12 billion in sales clearly reinforcing our leadership position as a top five player in this market. We also saw, Erik, some strong growth in our fixed indexed and fixed annuity solutions with fourth quarter results twice that of what we saw in the third quarter. Actually, in fact, more than 25% of our sales for the quarter came from these products. So ultimately, we're pleased with the progress we've made in this space. And we like the diversification these products bring to our overall business mix and the role they can play as a strong complement to our FlexGuard suite of solutions. Sure. John, it's Caroline. So I'll take your question. So first of all, just let me say, we're very pleased with the momentum that we've seen in our Group Insurance business. And as you're aware, the fourth quarter does tend to be a little lighter in terms of sales quarter, with the first quarter being our largest, as the majority of our cases do have January 1 inception dates. So the lower sales that you're noticing on a year-over-year basis is largely due to just a large case buyout last year that drove up sales volumes. And these do occur periodically and certainly can produce some variability in sales volumes, particularly in those lighter sales quarters. So John, if you were to normalize for last year's one-time buyout that we saw sales are actually up about 7%. And obviously, this is on the disability side. On the life side, it was just a matter of timing of premiums driven by changes in when some customers do enrollment in the year. So I would just say, overall, we feel very good as well about our existing pipeline as we continue with our strong sales momentum."

            "name": "Rob Falzon",
            "content": "Thank you, Charlie. I'll provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for our PGIM, US, and International Businesses. I'll begin on slide six. Pre-tax adjusted operating income was $4.7 billion or $9.46 per share for 2022 and $1.2 billion or $2.42 per share in the fourth quarter. These results reflect lower variable investment and fee income, partially offset by improved mortality as COVID has transitioned to an endemic phase, an increase in spread income due to rising interest rates, and underlying business growth. In addition, full year results include the strengthening of reserves from our annual assumption update and the gain on the sale of the PALAC Legacy variable annuity block. Our GAAP net loss for the quarter was $1.53 per share and included net realized investment losses and related charges and adjustments of $800 million, largely reflecting the impacts of rising interest rates. This loss also included a $700 million goodwill impairment due to the reduction in the estimated fair value of assurance. While assurance is making good progress in many areas and had a profitable fourth quarter, the impairment reflects lower growth expectations, higher discount rate applied to future applied to future cashflows reflecting macroeconomic conditions, and lower publicly traded peer evaluations. Turning to the operating results from our businesses compared to the year ago quarter. PGIM, our global investment manager reported fees, primarily due to lower assets under management, resulting from higher rates and equity market declines. Results of our US businesses primarily reflected less favorable variable investment income, partially offset by the impact of higher rates on spread income and more favorable underwriting. The decrease in earnings and our international businesses primarily reflected lower spread income, largely due to less favorable variable investment income and less favorable underwriting including elevated surrenders in Japan through the depreciation of the yen. Turning to slide seven, PGIM, our global investment manager has diversified capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed income, equities, and alternatives including real estate and private credit. PGIM's investment performance remains attractive with more than 79% of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last three, five, and 10 year periods. For 2022, PGIM experienced positive institutional net flows that were more than offset by retail outflows, primarily in fixed income, consistent with industry trends due to the rising rate environment. In the fourth quarter, PGIM experienced third-party net outflows of $11.7 billion, driven by public fixed income strategies across institutional and retail clients. Institutional net outflows were driven by a few large client redemptions, while retail net outflows reflected the impact of the rising interest rate environment on retail flows across the industry. As the investment engine of Prudential, success and growth of PGIM and of our US and International Insurance and Retirement businesses are mutually reinforcing. PGIM's asset origination capabilities, investment management expertise and access to institutional and other sources of private capital are a competitive advantage, helping our businesses bring enhanced solutions and create more value for our customers. Our insurance and retirement businesses, in turn, provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated flows that totaled $13 billion during 2022 as well as unique access to insurance liabilities. In addition, we continue to grow our alternatives business, which has assets in excess of $230 billion across private credit and real estate equity and debt and benefits from our global scale and market leading positions. Notably, PGIM's private businesses deployed nearly $43 billion of gross capital in 2022. Turning to slide 8. Our US Businesses produced diversified earnings from fees, net investments spread and underwriting income and benefit from our complimentary mix of longevity and mortality businesses. We continue to shift towards higher growth and less market sensitive products and markets, enhance our customer experience while reducing costs by amplifying the use of capabilities and self-service tools and further expand our addressable markets. Retirement Strategies achieved robust sales in fourth quarter and full year 2022 across its institutional and individual lines of business. Our Institutional Retirement business has market leading capabilities with full year sales of almost $32 billion driving record account values at the end of the year. This includes being selected for a 50% participation in a $16 billion pension risk transfer transaction and our fourth largest international reinsurance transaction of $8 billion in the fourth quarter. In Individual Retirement, product pivots have resulted in continued strong sales of more simplified solutions like FlexGuard and FlexGuard income, representing over $12 billion of sales since inception, as well as increased fixed annuity sales. Our Individual Life sales were consistent through the year and reflect our earlier product pivot strategy, with variable life products representing approximately 70% of sales for the year. And our Group Insurance benefits ratio has improved during the year from lower COVID mortality. Turning to slide 9. Our International Businesses include our Japanese life insurance companies, where we have a differentiated multi-channel distribution model as well as other businesses aimed at expanding our presence in high growth emerging markets. In Japan, we are focused on providing high quality service and expanding our geographic coverage and product offerings. Our needs-based approach and protection product focus continue to provide important value to our customers as we expand our product offerings to meet their evolving needs. In emerging markets, we are focused on creating a carefully selected portfolio of businesses and regions where customer's needs are growing, where there are compelling opportunities to build market leading businesses and where the Prudential enterprise can add value. Our International Businesses experienced their highest sales since the third quarter of 2020, including record sales in Brazil. Compared to the prior year quarter, Gibraltar sales were up 20% mainly driven by the life consultant channel primarily from higher US dollar sales. Life Planner sales were also up 17%, driven by continued momentum in Brazil's third-party distribution channel, as well as higher sales in Japan. As we look ahead, we're well-positioned across our businesses to be a global leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security. We continue to focus on investing in growth businesses in markets, delivering industry leading customer experiences, and creating the next generation of financial solutions to better serve the diverse needs of a broad range of customers. And with that, I'll now hand it over to Ken."

            "name": "Charlie Lowrey",
            "content": "Thank you, Bob. And thanks to everyone for joining us today. As we look back on 2022. I am proud of the progress we've made executing against our strategic priorities. During the year. We continue to transform our business to be less market sensitive and better positioned to deliver sustainable long-term growth. We exceeded our $750 million cost savings target one year ahead of schedule, and our rock solid balance sheet provided the financial strength to navigate the evolving macro economic environment. I'll provide an update on each of these areas, beginning with our business transformation. Turning to slide three, during 2022 we reduced the overall market sensitivity of our business by completing the sales of the full service retirement business and the pay lock block as well as the run off of traditional variable annuities. We simultaneously continue to invest in the long-term sustainable growth of our business through programmatic acquisitions, and partnerships in emerging markets. In Africa, we acquired a minority interest in Alex Forbes, a leading provider of financial advice, retirement, investment, and wealth management in South Africa. We also continue to grow our third-party distribution network in Latin America, particularly in Brazil, where third-party distribution now accounts for about 50% of sales and complements our strong Life Planner channel. Additionally, we advanced our vision to be a global leader in expanding access to investing insurance and retirement security. For example, we completed the second largest pension risk transfer transaction in US market history with IBM and close several major longevity risk transactions, including the $8 billion transaction we completed in the fourth quarter with the Barclays Bank, UK retirement fund. These transactions underscore our leadership in these markets, as well as the strength of our interconnected business model. Our IBM, PRT transaction provided PGIM with more than $8 billion in additional assets under management, and is a good example of how we leverage synergies across our businesses. We see a strong pipeline of opportunities in these markets in the year ahead. We continue to expand our product offerings to meet the increasing customer needs for financial solutions. For example, building on the success of our FlexGuard annuity products, we introduced during the fourth quarter FlexGuard Life, an indexed variable universal life product. In PGIM, we expanded our private loan capabilities through PGIM private capital, including our direct lending capabilities. This broad proprietary origination platform provides our insurance businesses and our institutional clients with unique investment opportunities and is another example of our self-reinforcing business model. We also invested in enhanced customer experiences that blend human touch with advanced technology. In Brazil for example, we expanded our digital sales application to expedite same-day policy delivery and processing with greater automation. In addition, as we administrator for the IBM PRT transaction, we introduced new technology capabilities to expedite the onboarding experience for 100,000 IBM pensioners. And as part of our continued efforts to refine customer experience, we implemented a company-wide initiative to better understand the evolving needs of all our customers around the globe. And in turn, deliver the most effective products and solutions to meet their needs. Moving to slide 4, we achieved $820 million of annual run rate cost savings, exceeding our target of $750 million one year ahead of schedule. We reach this milestone by streamlining and automating the way in which we operate, while improving the customer and employee experience. We leverage new systems and technologies to enhance our digital underwriting, claims and fund processing capabilities, improving efficiency, while reducing customer wait times. For example, for many of our Individual Life customers, we reduce the underwriting time from 22 days to 22 seconds. Our Group Insurance claims processing is now three times faster, and fund verification to process new annuity sales now takes two to three days, down from two to three weeks. We also implemented a hybrid work model for our employees that reduced our U.S. real estate footprint by 50%, equating to approximately $50 million in annual run rate savings. And finally, we adopted a continuous improvement mindset that helps us proactively identify and execute on cost savings opportunities that enhanced customer and employee experiences, and continue to improve our competitiveness going forward. Now to slide 5, our rock solid balance sheet and disciplined approach to capital deployment have helped Prudential navigate financial and macro economic challenges for nearly 150 years. And 2022 was no exception. Our financial strength, including our AA ratings is supported by $4.5 billion in highly liquid assets at the end of the fourth quarter, as well as a high quality, well diversified investment portfolio. We continue to balance investments in the growth of our businesses with returning capital to our shareholders. During the fourth quarter, we returned more than $800 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, for a total of over $7.5 billion since the beginning of 2021. For 2023, our Board has authorized up to $1 billion in share repurchases, as well as a 4% dividend increase beginning in the first quarter. This represents our 15th consecutive annual dividend increase. Looking ahead, our strategic progress, financial strength and self-reinforcing business system, coupled with a higher interest rate environment position as well to be a leader in expanding access to investing, insurance, and retirement for our customers across the globe. Now, before turning it over to Rob, I'd like to extend a special Thank you to all our employees for their dedication to our customers and our communities. Together, we have made significant progress on our transformation, and are fulfilling our purpose of making lives better, by solving the financial challenges of our changing world. And now, over to Rob, to talk about the fourth quarter financial results, and to provide an update on our business performance. Sure, Suneet. Thanks for the question and our ability to clarify. Yes, we saw the headlines too and we're slightly surprised. The -- our strategy remains consistent with exactly what we have been doing. So, what we've said is that we won't be investing in early-stage companies with less proven track records. What we're focusing on is developing a portfolio programmatic acquisitions, concentrating on more established businesses where we can expand the capabilities and scale of our existing businesses. And this approach supports what you said, which is our strategy of growing PGIM and emerging markets and really focusing on asset management and high-growth international markets that will help increase our fee earnings and growth profile. And if you look at our recent -- most recent four transactions, which include ICEA LION, Montana Capital Partners, Custom Harvest Asset Management, and most recently, Alexforbes, these are all examples of this approach of acquiring more established companies and are consistent with what we have done and what we will do going forward. Sure, Mike. It's Charlie. I'll take that. So as you know, we've made significant progress in our transformation so far, but we would also note, we still have more work to do to become a higher growth and less market sensitive company. And as we look ahead, we're going to focus on our financial performance. We're going to focus on advancing our transformation, including the customer and employee experience, and we're going to focus on continuing to thoughtfully deploy capital. All of that, with a goal of creating long-term sustainable value for all our stakeholders. And we think we're well-positioned across our businesses to be a global leader in expanding access to investment -- investing insurance and retirement security. And we'll do that in three ways. We'll continue to invest in our growth businesses and markets as we go forward, we'll deliver industry leading customer experiencing, leveraging our broad capabilities and scope of diversified businesses, and which we'll continue to invest as well, and we'll create the next generation of financial solutions to better serve the diverse needs of a broad range of customers. So what I'd say in summary is that we're definitely committed to becoming a higher growth, less market sensitive company. And our progress will obviously be dependent upon opportunities that arise and the macroeconomic conditions we face, but we're laser focused on what we need to do, and we'll accomplish that. Okay, thank you. And thank you everyone for joining us today. I hope we demonstrated the progress we are making to transform Prudential to deliver sustainable, long-term growth and meet the evolving needs of our customers. Looking ahead, we remain confident in our strategy and the strength of our company. For nearly 150 years, Prudential is focused on creating value for our customers and other stakeholders who we will continue to serve as we strive to be the global leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security. Thank you again for your time today."

And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Charlie.\nCharlie Lowrey: Thank you, Bob, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our third quarter financial results reflect the impact of market conditions, including the variability in alternative investment returns and lower fee income, as well as an elevated level of COVID-19 hospitalization claims in Japan, partially offset by underlying business growth, including the benefit from rising interest rates. We continue to transform our businesses to be less market-sensitive and better positioned to deliver sustainable long-term growth. This includes investing in products and solutions that meet the evolving needs of our customers and achieving our $750 million cost savings target one year ahead of schedule. Our rock-solid balance sheet provides the financial strength to navigate the current macroeconomic environment and support our customers, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders. Turning to slide three. I'll start off today with an update on how we are investing in long-term growth opportunities that meet the evolving needs of our customers and support our vision to be a global leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security. In September, Prudential was selected by IBM for a 50% participation in the second largest pension risk transfer transaction in US market history, with a total value of over $16 billion. This transaction builds upon our leadership role in this market, where we have helped employers safeguard their workers' retirements since pioneering the first jumbo PRT transaction a decade ago. We are well positioned to continue to benefit from the growing PRT market, which is expected to have over $50 billion of total industry transactions in 2022. In the individual retirement market, our FlexGuard suite continues to grow in both sales volume and product scope, with an additional $1 billion in sales, bringing the total to nearly $12 billion since its launch in 2020. Building upon FlexGuard's tremendous success, we plan to introduce FlexGuard Life, an index variable universal life product later this month. We expect our businesses will benefit from the increased demand for retirement decumulation products over the next decade, as we strengthen our role as a leader in the $300 billion annuities market. We're making similar growth investments on behalf of our international customers as well. During the third quarter, we expanded into Argentina, our partnership with Mercado Libre, Latin America's largest e-commerce platform with approximately 200 million users. Our expanded partnership follows our initial launch with Mercado Libre in Brazil earlier this year, which delivers life insurance and accident and health products tailored to the platform's mass market customer base. Moving to slide 4. As I noted earlier, we have now achieved $765 million of annual run rate cost savings, exceeding our target of $750 million and completed this one year ahead of schedule. This includes $180 million realized in the third quarter. To achieve these cost savings, we carefully assessed all aspects of our business and operations from our physical office space, to how we leverage technology to deliver more efficient customer experiences. For example, by embracing a hybrid work model, we reduced our office space footprint in the US by approximately 50%, which results in an annual run rate savings of about $50 million. On the customer experience front, our use of artificial intelligence accelerated our individual life underwriting from 22 days to 22 seconds. And our new digital claims processing capability can now deliver funds to most customers in six hours as opposed to six days. We also automated and reduced the timing of fund verification and processing on about one-third of new annuity sales from what was two to three weeks to now two to three days. And our group insurance claims processing is now three times faster, thanks to new data systems we have installed. Turning now to slide 5. Our rock-solid balance sheet and disciplined approach to capital deployment has helped Prudential navigate financial and macroeconomic challenges for nearly 150 years. Consistent with our AA financial strength rating, we have a strong capital position, a high-quality, well-diversified investment portfolio and approximately $5 billion in highly liquid assets at the end of the third quarter. We continue to balance investing in our businesses for long-term growth, with shareholder distributions. In addition to the investments in our businesses that I previously mentioned, we also returned over $800 million to shareholders during the third quarter through dividends and share repurchases and for a total of $7 billion since the beginning of 2021. Looking ahead, we expect higher interest rates will economically benefit our business over time. We have the financial strength to continue to navigate the current economic and market environment. As we monitor developments, we will maintain our disciplined approach to capital management and redeployment, and our Board will review our 2023 capital plan early next year. Before turning it over to Rob, I'd like to touch upon the leadership transition we announced last week as part of our thoughtful approach to creating a sustainable long-term leadership structure. Beginning early next year, Andy Sullivan will move from his current role as Head of our US Businesses, including PGIM, to lead our international businesses and PGIM. Caroline Feeney who currently leads our US Insurance & Retirement Businesses, will take on an expanded role as Head of our Business Portfolio in the US and will join our executive leadership team. Scott Sleyster, who currently leads our international businesses, will retire in the first quarter of 2023. We thank Scott for his tremendous contributions to Prudential over the course of the 35-year career with the company. And look forward to working closely with Andy and Caroline in their new roles. I'll now turn it over to Rob for an update on our business performance.\nRob Falzon: Thank you, Charlie. I'll provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for our PGIM, US and international businesses. I'll begin on Slide 6 with our financial results for the third quarter of 2022. Pre-tax adjusted operating income was $1 billion or $2.13 per share on an after-tax basis and reflected lower variable investment income driven by market conditions and an elevated level of Japan COVID-19 hospitalization claims, partially offset by underlying business growth, including a benefit from rising interest rates. Our GAAP net loss per share was $0.78 on an after-tax basis, primarily reflecting realized investment losses, largely driven by higher interest rates. Turning to the operating results from our businesses compared to the year ago quarter. PGIM, our Global Investment Manager reported lower asset management fees, resulting from a reduction in assets under management reflecting higher interest rates, widening credit spreads and declines in equity markets. Results of our US businesses were lower than the year-ago quarter, reflecting lower spread income due to less favorable variable investment income and lower fee income resulting from the sale of a portion of the legacy variable annuities business, the decline in equity markets and net outflows, partially offset by more favorable underwriting as COVID-19 transitions to an endemic level in the US. The decrease in earnings in our international businesses reflected elevated COVID-19 hospitalization claims in Japan and lower spread income driven by less favorable variable investment income. Turning to Slide 7. PGIM, our global active investment manager, has diversified capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed income, alternatives, real estate and equities. PGIM's long-term investment performance remains attractive with more than 80% of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last five and 10-year periods. PGM experienced retail outflows, primarily in fixed income, consistent with industry trends due to the rising rate environment, while institutional net flows continue to be positive. As the investment engine of Prudential, the success and growth of PGIM and of our US and international insurance and retirement businesses are mutually enhancing. PGIM's asset origination capabilities, investment management expertise and access to institutional and other sources of private capital or a competitive advantage. This helps our businesses bring enhanced solutions and create more value for our customers. Our insurance and retirement businesses, in turn, provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated flows and unique access to insurance liabilities that complement its track record of third-party growth. PGIM's annual fee rate increased due to the continued shift toward higher fee strategies, including our alternatives and private credit business. We continue to grow our alternatives in private credit business, which has assets under management of nearly $230 billion across private credit, real estate equity and debt and private equity secondaries and benefits from our global scale and market-leading positions. Across PGIM's private platform, we deployed $9.6 billion of capital this quarter. As we continue to invest in growth areas that are aligned with the needs of our clients, we also remain disciplined in finding opportunities to protect operating margins by managing the business more efficiently. Turning to Slide 8. Our US businesses produced diversified earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income and benefit from our complementary mix of longevity and mortality businesses. We continue to shift our business mix towards higher growth and less market-sensitive products in markets, transform our capabilities and cost structure and further expand our addressable markets.  Retirement Strategies achieved robust sales in the third quarter across its institutional and individual lines of business. Institutional Retirement closed nearly $10 billion of pension risk transfer transactions in the third quarter including being selected by IBM for a 50% participation in a $16 billion pension risk transfer transaction. Our focus on superior execution, supported by the experience of our high-quality PRT team and our continued market leadership in the US pension risk transfer market contributed to IBM selecting us. We continue to see a significant opportunity in the growing PRT market. In individual retirement, product pits have resulted solutions with $1 billion of FlexGuard and FlexGuard income sales in the third quarter, as well as increased fixed annuity sales. Our individual life sales also reflect our earlier product pivot strategy with variable life products representing approximately 70% of sales for the quarter. Group Insurance experienced a 50% increase in sales compared to the year ago quarter, reflecting higher national account life and disability sales and execution of our product growth strategy to drive supplemental health. Turning to Slide 9. Our international businesses include our Japanese life insurance companies, where we have a differentiated multichannel distribution model as well as other businesses aimed at expanding our presence in high-growth emerging markets. In Japan, we are focused on providing high-quality service and expanding our geographic coverage and product offerings. Our needs-based approach and protection product focus continue to provide important value to our customers as we expand our product offerings to meet their evolving needs. For example, we launched a yen-denominated investment product with a joint survivorship feature in the bank channel in the third quarter. In emerging markets, we are focused on creating a carefully selected portfolio of businesses and regions where customer needs are growing, where there are compelling opportunities to build market-leading businesses and where the Prudential enterprise can add value. In the third quarter, we continued to focus on expanding product and business capabilities to meet the evolving needs of customers. In Brazil, we expanded our digital sales application and achieved record sales for the second consecutive quarter driven by strong performance across all distribution channels. We further expanded our product offerings on the Mercado Libre platform in Brazil and successfully launched the sales platform in Argentina, as Charlie mentioned. In addition, we completed our tender offer for Alex Forbes, expanding our ownership to 33% of a leading provider of integrated retirement, investment and wealth management services in South Africa. As we look ahead, we're well positioned across our businesses to be a global leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security. We continue to invest in growth businesses and markets, deliver industry-leading customer experiences and create the next generation of financial solutions to better serve the diverse needs of a broad range of customers. And now with that, I'll hand it over to Ken.\nKen Tanji: Thanks, Rob. I'll begin on Slide 10, which provides insight into earnings for the fourth quarter of 2022 relative to our third quarter results. As noted, pretax adjusted operating income in the third quarter was $1 billion, and resulted in earnings per share of $2.13 on an after-tax basis.  To get a sense for how our fourth quarter results might develop, we suggest adjustments for the following items: First, variable investment income was below expectations in the third quarter by $295 million; next, we adjust underwriting experience by a net $165 million. This adjustment includes a placeholder for COVID-19 claims experience in the fourth quarter of $20 million for our International Insurance businesses. We expect a lower level of hospitalization claims due to the recent government supported industry revision of eligible benefits policyholders recovering from COVID-19 at home in Japan; and last, we expect seasonal and other items to reduce adjusted operating income by $166 million, primarily driven by the seasonally elevated expenses expected in the fourth quarter. These items combined get us to a baseline of $2.71 per share for the fourth quarter. I'll note that if you exclude items specific to the fourth quarter, earnings per share would be $2.96. The key takeaway is that our underlying earnings power improved due to business growth, including the benefit of higher interest rates that more than offset equity market depreciation. While we have provided these items to consider, please note that there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the fourth quarter. Turning to slide 11. Our capital position supports our AA financial strength rating. Our cash and liquid assets were $5 billion at the high end of our liquidity target range after investing in our businesses to support long-term growth, including the capital to support our IBM pension risk transfer transaction. We have substantial off-balance sheet resources, including contingent capital and liquidity facilities. Over the long-term, a higher interest rate environment is economically beneficial. In the near-term, the current market environment and the annual assumption update reduce our regulatory capital and excess liquidity. We will remain prudent in our capital deployment, balancing the preservation of financial strength, investment in our businesses for sustainable long-term growth and shareholder distributions. Turning to slide 12 and in summary. We are executing our plans to reposition our businesses, we achieved our targeted cost savings one year ahead of plan, and we are navigating the current macro environment with the financial strength of our rock solid balance sheet. Now I'll turn it over to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Tom Gallagher from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live.\nTom Gallagher: Good morning. The first question is just on the decline in the holding company cash balance dropped $2 billion sequentially despite the increase in net debt by $500 million. Ken, can you comment on whether there were any contributions to subs, I assume there were no dividends taking out, but a little bit of color for what happened there?\nKen Tanji: Yeah. Hey Tom, sure. I'll cover that. We did make a capital contribution of $1 billion to PICA, our main US life insurance company. And that is to support a high volume of business growth, including the IBM and other pension risk transfer transactions that we did. We also made a $200 million of contributions to fund a few international joint venture investments that's part of our programmatic M&A into emerging markets. And then as we mentioned and highlighted that we funded shareholder distributions of $800 million. The $500 million of net debt increase that we had as we refinance our debt profile was essentially offset by holding company costs, including interest. We did not have dividends from our subs in this quarter, the timing of dividends from our subs to the holdco tend to vary and tend to be greater in the fourth quarter and first quarter. Putting that all together, we ended with highly liquid assets, $5.1 billion, still above our target range. So in some, the primary reason our holdco HLA declined or highlight liquid assets declined was due to the $1.2 billion of business growth. I also -- I just thought it would be helpful to remind people what I said on our last call is that we expect the statutory funding needs for our US Life Insurance business, including our assumption updates to be comparable to our GAPP -- the GAAP impact that we recorded in 2Q. The reserve strengthening will be higher, stat is more conservative, and that's going to be fully reflected in our stat results in the fourth quarter. As I also mentioned on our last call, we have excess capacity already in Pika available to meet that need. So the combination of the capital that we contributed to support business growth this quarter and the excess capacity we had in Pika within Pika will remain with RBC ratios consistent with our AA financial strength target. In terms of shareholder distributions, we will complete our shareholder distributions for this year in the fourth quarter with both dividends and share repurchases. And as Charlie mentioned in his remarks, our capital plan for 2023 will be approved by the Board early next year. And as always, they'll consider our capital position, opportunities to invest in our businesses and now increasingly so, the volatility uncertainty of the economy and markets looking ahead. So we'll factor that all in. But we'll continue with our philosophy of being thoughtful and disciplined with our capital and balance investment in our businesses with long-term growth and maintaining financial strength and returning capital to shareholders.\nCharlie Lowrey: Hey, Tom, it's Charlie. Let me just add one thing because I think part of your question is about can we execute on a long-term plan. And I'll just take it up a level and say we have additional levers we can pull and resources that we can use to do just that, to execute on our long-term plan.\nTom Gallagher: Thanks a lot guys. It was very comprehensive. And Charlie, just -- so you'd still -- I think it was the $10 billion three-year total capital return plan. You still feel good about that given the levers that you have to work from?\nCharlie Lowrey: Yes. Ken, do you want to comment on that?\nKen Tanji: Yes. Yes. Again, we're will complete -- we've already returned $7 billion through the third quarter. We'll complete our plans for this year. And again, our Board will factor in all the considerations that I mentioned into their decisions in early part of next year.\nTom Gallagher: Okay. Thanks a lot guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Tracy Benguigui from Barclays. Your line is now live.\nTracy Benguigui: Thank you. First, congratulations to Scott, your retirement, Andy, Carolina in your new role. I'm wondering, given your progress to-date and thinking about market opportunities, do you feel like you need to elongate the three-year timetable of reallocating $5 billion to $10 billion of capital to higher growth less market-sensitive business.\nCharlie Lowrey: Sure, Tracy, it's Charlie. Let me take that one. So let me start by saying we remain totally focused on executing on our transformation strategy to become a less market-sensitive and higher-growth company. As you've seen, we've made a number of programmatic acquisitions in PGIM and emerging markets and in the second quarter, we completed two key divestitures that reduced our overall market sensitivity by 20%, so we're well on our way. Now, our path may not be linear as different growth opportunities present themselves at different times. And I would note that our diverse set of businesses provides opportunities to grow in different market environments as we've seen with this market environment, and we're well-positioned to benefit from this diversification. For instance, in the third quarter, our Retirement Strategies business did nearly $15 billion of sales, including a significant PRT transaction that demonstrate our leadership position in this market where we believe there's just tremendous growth potential going forward. But our business system is also self-reinforcing and as an example, the recent IBM PRT -- with the recent IBM PRT transaction, which is in the institutional retirement business. That also brought in over $8 billion in AUM to PGIM. So by saying we're focused on our high-growth businesses, naming PGIM and emerging markets, doesn't mean we're not looking to grow our other businesses as well. So, in summary, what I'd say is we're definitely committed to becoming a higher growth, less market-sensitive company. But our progress will depend upon a couple of things. One is the opportunities that arise, and the second is the macroeconomic conditions.\nTracy Benguigui: That's very helpful. So, it sounds like you have organic growth opportunities. You're not only relying on programmatic acquisition. So, speaking of organic and you mentioned PRT. I'm just wondering if we should expect to see more coinsurance in the future for these large deals. And also if you could comment on funded status these days and what you've seen in the pipeline would that prohibit some deals getting done?\nAndy Sullivan: So, Tracy, it's Andy. And first, let me thanks for -- I appreciate the congratulations. You probably could tell we're exceptionally proud of our team and of our capabilities in our pension risk transfer business. The fact that we conducted the second largest transaction in history is second only to the ground breakage transaction we did with General Motors about a decade ago for $29 billion. This transaction, we did split 50-50 between us and another provider. And for clarity, the decision to split a deal is made by the plan sponsor versus carriers bidding together. As we look forward, we don't think deal splitting will be atypical and we will always be open to that type of situation depending on the deal's characteristics. Overall, the market in pension risk transfer remains very robust. The industry experienced a third successive record-breaking quarter. Third quarter came in at $28 billion, which was a 60% increase from last year. Funded status remains near record levels at 106%. So, we now expect this year, as you heard in Charlie's remarks to come in above $50 billion for the industry, and we believe that we'll consistently see about $40 billion going forward. Given the size of that market, despite that it's a competitive market, we expect, given our industry-leading track record and our capabilities, we're going to continue to find success at picking our spots. And net-net, this will be a nice organic growth area for us over time.\nTracy Benguigui: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Ryan Krueger from KBW. Your line is now live.\nRyan Krueger: Hey thanks. Morning. I had a question on individual retirement earnings. I think on a core basis, they were up about $60 million, sequentially. Can you help us think through the key drivers of that? And if you'd expect that to be sustainable longer term?\nAndy Sullivan: Yes. So, Ryan, it's Andy again. Good morning. Thanks for your question on the Individual Retirement business. We're very pleased with the momentum that we're seeing this quarter. Let me speak first about our core earnings progress, and then I'll talk about our continued success at FlexGuard. We saw a material lift in our core earnings, thanks primarily to the change in the interest rate environment. And that's both on the short and long end of the curve. We get lift from interest rates on our collateral on the short end, and we're getting lift on the long-term side in our portfolio as well. And we're seeing the FlexGuard block grow. That's why you saw the step-up in our core earnings. And I would just kind of go back to what Ken said earlier, higher rates are a good thing overall for Prudential. Additionally, we're very pleased with the continued progress at building a very healthy FlexGuard block of business. Quarter in and quarter out, we remain a top share player in the market. We've achieved $11 billion in sales life to date. We very much like the profitability of the block that we've brought into the organization. And at the end of the day, kind of back to the organic growth discussion, we see the retirement decumulation opportunity in the country as a very good growth opportunity and we have all the right stuff to capture it.\nRyan Krueger: Thanks. And then just wanted -- I had one quick capital follow-up. Charlie, you had mentioned that you have other levers that you can pull to execute on your long-term capital deployment plan. See if you could expand on that at all? And I guess, probably related to that, just you would contribute to capital earlier this year to Bermuda. At what point in time do you think you might see more business there to then release capital in the US? Thanks.\nCharlie Lowrey: Sure. Let me take the first part of that and then turn it over to Ken. I'll just give you a couple of quick examples. One would be sort of ongoing reinsurance transactions that we continue to review. And the other would be, we have levers both on and off balance sheet that we can pull. So we have lots of different levers and resources that we can use and regularly look at them in order to access additional capital. And Ken, do you want to talk about Bermuda?\nKen Tanji: Yes, Ryan. Yes, the Bermuda sub that we launched earlier in the year is a good example of the levers that Charlie referenced. We have a new reinsurer in Bermuda. It's called Lotus Re. We did capitalize it with $800 million earlier this year, and we've reinsured a block of variable life business to it. So it will create capital efficiency, and it's a reinsurance capability that's sort of another tool in our toolbox going forward.\nRyan Krueger: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Suneet Kamath from Jefferies. Your line is now live.\nSuneet Kamath: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to circle back on capital. You made comments about 2023 a couple of times. But just to level set, I mean, we're used to thinking about kind of the 65% free cash flow conversion as sort of the level of capital return that you guys would do on an annual basis, ex any specific special transactions. Should we be thinking about that as a baseline for next year, or are you signaling that the operating environment is a little bit more challenging. So maybe you'd guide to something a little bit lower than that.\nKen Tanji: Yes. Hey, Suneet, yes, 65%, if you looked at our -- what we've generated in free cash flow from our businesses over time, that's been the average. It's been in some years higher than that and in some years, lower than that. Cash flow from our businesses this year is below our historical average. That's both as we continue to invest in our businesses for long-term growth, but also work through the statutory reserve increases in our life insurance businesses that we updated this year. So it will vary over time, but we think given our growth rates and our business profile, that's what our historical average has been.\nSuneet Kamath: Okay. Got it. And then just if I could come back to that $1 billion infusion into PICA, I mean, my rough math would suggest maybe half of that was related to the IBM PRT deal. So that leaves another $400 million, $500 million left. And I hear you on FlexGuard funding that growth, but individual retirement is still in outflows. And I would have thought the capital release from withdrawals would have sort of supported the new business. I guess I'm just trying to understand what the other piece of it is into PICA apart from the PRT transaction. Thanks.\nKen Tanji: Yes. I don't know what rule of thumb you're using on specific business lines, but it was -- for us, it was primarily related to not just the IBM transaction but the other deals that we did as well. And the growth in our FlexGuard business. And we continue to see good profitability and cash flows from our existing VA business as well.\nSuneet Kamath: Was there any impact from interest rate hedges? You had a GAAP loss, but just wondering if there's any impact from that on the statutory results?\nKen Tanji: Yes. There is, Suneet, is the rise in interest rates has been very swift. And over time, that will allow us to invest our insurance reserves at higher yields and improving profitability and cash flows. But in the near-term, our statutory surplus in the US business -- for our US business is reduced by what we consider a non-economic statutory reserve method that tends to manifest itself when rates rise, and we experienced unrealized and realized losses on our fixed income and derivatives. This is not unique to us. We believe it's an issue for the broader industry and it's uneconomic in nature and should be addressed. And there's a lot of discussions going on with regulators in the industry about this. So we'll manage the change in the rate environment, and we'll maintain regulatory capital is consistent with our AA financial strength objectives, but there is a short-term impact on our statutory capital.\nSuneet Kamath: Can you size that at all?\nKen Tanji: It's still -- it's going to be subject to where the rates move. And so that's still dynamic.\nSuneet Kamath: Okay. Thanks, Ken.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from John Barnidge from Piper Sandler. Your line is now live.\nJohn Barnidge: Thank you very much. Seasonally 3Qs had typically been the best more talented quarter in any given year. This is a pre-pandemic world, of course. With COVID now clearly endemic, did that typical mortality seasonality return this year?\nAndy Sullivan: Hey, John, good morning, it's Andy. I'll talk about our COVID. We intentionally, as we've talked about many times in the past, manage our business mix to have a good balance between longevity and mortality. That absolutely paid us dividends all throughout the pandemic. During 3Q, the US experienced 42,000 deaths, which was 17,000 more than our estimate. But the fact is we continue to see a declining impact from COVID in the US. Let me just hit a little bit about each business. In Group Insurance, our life benefit ratio was 91.4%. It did reflect pre-pandemic mortality. That was slightly elevated due to accidental death and dismemberment claims that we very much see just as a natural quarter-to-quarter variability, nothing more. We're very pleased that we continue to see working age guests and its impact on working as continuing to decline. In Individual Life, we saw our mortality actual to expect it at the low end of our range, 97%. And we saw particularly good performance in the smaller face amount bands, and that is typically where we would see the COVID experience show up. In Institutional Retirement, we did see underwriting gains above our seasonalized expectations, particularly in pension risk transfer, but again, not surprising given the average age of that block of business. So the bottom line is, given the balanced mix of businesses that we have, we very much expect this will be very manageable as COVID continues to shift into an endemic state.\nJohn Barnidge: Great. And then my follow-up question. Institutional flows positive, but material deceleration in PGIM, retail improve in outflow. Can you maybe talk about how FX impact is changing where you're seeing demand, either a geographic perspective or from an asset perspective? Thank you.\nAndy Sullivan: Yeah, John, it's Andy. I'll take your question on flows. As we've always talked about, flows will vary quarter-to-quarter. So we stay very focused on our long-term track record. In Q3, we experienced third-party net outflows of $4 billion, driven on the retail side. Institutional net flows remained positive with strong positive flows into both Jennison equity and real estate debt. So showing the benefit of our diversified portfolio. We're very pleased with our positive $9 billion in institutional flows year-to-date. I would also note that, we experienced good affiliated flows. So from our insurance transactions, like the IBM transaction, we saw $7 billion in affiliated flows in Q3 and $14 billion year-to-date. That is a very important part of our strategy, and it reflects the synergies between our liability generation capability as well as our asset management capability. To your specific question about retail outflows were $4.6 billion that was a marked improvement from the $8.3 billion last quarter. Much like the rest of the industry, we continue to be impacted by headwinds in both active fixed income and growth equity. As far as where are the flows going, the flows are tending to go into passive, and in the short-duration strategies, we're obviously not a passive player. As far as FX impacts, we really haven't seen anything material to speak of. At the end of the day, we're highly confident that our diversified product portfolio has us well positioned that as the environment settles down and stabilize and flows start to shift back in, we have the experience to succeed and will be a net winner as we always have been. As we've talked about before, we've experienced 18 out of 19 years of positive inflows.\nJohn Barnidge: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question is on the Japan COVID losses. You had guided last quarter to maybe seeing about $50 million of unfavorable underwriting impact. And that came in at $200 million this quarter. So are you concerned that some of that leads into the fourth quarter? And do you think that there could be any movement around your reserves?\nScott Sleyster: Thanks, Elyse. This is Scott. During the quarter, Japan experienced the largest surge of COVID cases since the beginning of the pandemic. Japan sort of did a really good job upfront, but Omicron hit them hard much later. The new infections were mainly concentrated in younger ages and they peaked in August, I think, at like over 240,000. They have since declined quite significantly. I think they're running around 40,000 today. So they're down to about one-sixth to where they were. From the beginning of the pandemic and consistent with regulatory guidance, A&H claims provided for a policyholder payments related to hospitalizations irrespective of whether the patient actually checked into the hospital. So with the large sets of COVID cases, we did, in fact, see a big spike in A&H claims, which is what you were seeing. Starting September 26, the industry in agreement or with support from the government determined that hospitalization benefits will no longer be paid if the insured individuals are not actually in the hospital with very few exceptions, things for people over 65 or pregnant women and certain serious comorbidities. So we expect the change here to be pretty dramatic in the fourth quarter. First of all, the infection levels are down a great deal and then the qualification levels have been substantially restricted. I think Ken already mentioned that we've got a placeholder for $20 million versus the $180 million for the fourth quarter. So we'll continue to closely monitor the situation. And as in the past, we remain focused on really taking care of our customers, but also looking out for our employees and maintaining the strength of our distribution channels.\nElyse Greenspan: Thanks. And then my second question, what are you guys seeing in terms of the base spreads within institutional retirement? How quickly are those accelerating? And how should we think about the earnings growth potential in that segment from rising rates?\nKen Tanji: Elyse, it's Ken. I'll start. And we have seen as the rise in rates and the rising yields have played out a better opportunity to invest at more attractive terms. And you see that leading to earnings improvement. But probably more importantly, will be the business growth, particularly with the with the pension risk transfer business that we just put on the books at the end of the third quarter.\nAndy Sullivan: Yeah. And Elyse, it's Andy. I would just add, we have a lot of momentum in our institutional retirement business. We have exceptional people, great capabilities, great brand and distribution systems, that's really second to none. And obviously, you've heard about that from a pension risk transfer perspective. But we had $13.5 billion in sales and institutional retirement. So it goes well beyond just pension risk transfer. We also had $1.5 billion in investment-only stable value and $1.2 billion in longevity reinsurance. So we have very good momentum, and it was a banner quarter for us in Institutional Retirement.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Erik Bass from Autonomous Research. Your line is now live.\nErik Bass: Hi. Thank you. Your outlook implies higher seasonal expenses of, I think, $115 million in the fourth quarter, which is less than the $125 million to $175 million range that you typically expect. Is this a function of just being disciplined on expenses given the environment, or should we think of this as a more permanent trend given the cost-saving actions that you've highlighted?\nKen Tanji: Hey Erik, it's Ken. We are being more disciplined, but it's really timing. We see a lot of that coming into the fourth quarter as usual. And I wouldn't read too much into that. It's -- yes, we are being disciplined, but there's also timing considerations.\nErik Bass: Got it. Thank you. And then can you talk about how the yen movements are affecting demand for US dollar-denominated products in Japan? Does this materially change the consumer value proposition and the outlook for demand or persistency?\nScott Sleyster: Thanks, Erik. This is Scott. I'll go ahead and take that. There are several things that go on from the strength of the US dollar. On the one hand, you will have a cohort of customers who have bought kind of investment products, and they may want to terminate to take a gain if it's a net positive versus any surrender charge. And for people that have permanent life they may be thinking about reducing coverage because a certain dollar amount will provide more yen coverage, which is ultimately typically what they're looking for.  I think your question focused more on the sales side. With the dollar being this strong, we think people that will be looking for US dollar products will be sizing down their purchase again because in general, they are looking back to the coverage of the -- of ultimately how it covers them in yen. That being said, two other good things, I think, are going on with higher rates, US dollar investment products do look more attractive. And ultimately, overtime, while we have some short-term headwinds because we use swaps to hedge. In the long fall, this will add to our net investment income, which we view is a tailwind in that market.\nErik Bass: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Wilma Burdis from Raymond James. Your line is now live. \nWilma Burdis: Good morning. Could you clarify how the Lotus Re Bermuda entity works to create capital efficiencies? And is there a plan to bring in third-party capital in Bermuda?\nKen Tanji: Yes. The Lotus Re is an internal reinsurance capability that's based in Bermuda. And we find that certain products in our initial use of it was with variable life that we find that the regime there, which is a very robust reserving standard is more principle-based and is better aligned with the economics of that business.  And as a result, by transferring that to reinsuring that to that regime, we get releases of reserves and capital in PICA. And again, it's our efforts to really align the economics of our businesses with reserve and capital standards that are robust and risk sensitive, recognize the nature of the business and are a better fit for that type of business.\nRob Falzon: Wilma, it's Rob. Just sort of following on the second part of your question. So in that particular entity, no, our intent is not to bring in third-party capital. As Ken alluded to, it's a kind of a captive vehicle. Having said that, we are keenly aware of the increased institutional appetite coming into this sector. And as we've said before, we don't think that there's a firm who's better positioned to figure out how to satisfy the intersection of demand for our customers on the liability origination side with appetite for funding into those sorts of investments from the institutional side. So, nothing to talk about near term there, but we think we're particularly well positioned in order to be able to exploit that.\nWilma Burdis: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\nAlex Scott: Hi, I had a follow-up on some of the questions on capital and the holdco cash balance. When I think about growth. I appreciate that there's the PRT. Ex maybe some heightened PRT growth, I would think PICA would be a bit more self-funding -- and I'm just trying to understand if maybe some of the need to fund growth from the holdco balance has to do with the expectation of what's going to happen in 4Q around the UL review. And the reason I ask is just if that is part of the contemplation that that's fine, and it's actually good because it means maybe you don't need to contribute any more in 4Q. And that's really what I'm trying to figure out is when you go through that review in 4Q, would this need to occur again? Like will there need to be more cash from the holdco that goes down into PICA to help fund that that impact?\nKen Tanji: Yes. So Alex, the -- PICA is generating statutory capital with its business profile. But the size of the business growth that we experienced this quarter was pretty high and unique. And that's why -- we thought it was a very attractive use of capital and deployed capital for that purpose. We acknowledged that the assumption update would require funding needs, and that was a use of capital as well. But we had -- at the time of the second quarter, we had -- we're well-positioned to absorb that capital requirement within PICA, including the -- using the cash flow and statutory surplus that's being generated by our businesses. We'll be looking at the fourth quarter and evaluating again -- well, and I should mention, as I also described, we have had some short-term capital that is being held in reserves potentially for what we consider non-economic reserving given the rise in rates. And then we'll, again, as we always do in the fourth quarter, look at our capital position, our opportunities to deploy capital attractively and make sure we're maintaining PICA at our AA financial strength standards.\nAlex Scott: Got it, that's helpful. And then maybe a little bit of a more broad question on Japan. Could you talk about how a weaker yen impacts your business? And if that should be something we contemplate as we think about cash flow in 2023, either positive or negative?\nScott Sleyster: Thanks Alex. This is Scott. We've been operating in Japan for a long time. And in my many years here, I've seen the yen as low as in the high 70s to as high as it is today. So, as that happens, customer preferences will shift, and so we'll see more yen sales, for example, if dollar products get priced too high. On the other hand, we may see more dollar deposit type products that will be more attractive in the bank or other parts of the Gib channel related to where the dollar is. So, I'd say fundamentally, we have the ability to adapt and we've demonstrated that we've done that over time. I guess, what I would come back to is, I would say, we're very disciplined in how we price our business in Japan. Part of the reason you've seen the bank channel down is we are \u2013 we've maintained our discipline around profitability. We haven't been chasing deposit products when the margins were really tight. So I feel very good about the franchise we have there. We see less price sensitivity in channels where we have a preferred position like Life Planners and some of the affinity groups. And we'll adapt the product mix based off of customer demand, but we're always going to keep our pricing discipline front and center.\nKen Tanji: And Alex, I'll just add. We also have a very established hedging program with our Japanese business that hedges both earnings and the net equity position. And given the strength of the dollar that has a $1.8 billion gain at the end of the third quarter.\nAlex Scott: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Mike Ward from Citi. Your line is now live.\nMike Ward: Thank you, guys. So you mentioned potentially reinsurance as one lever for a source of capital. Just wondering if that means we should sort of be expecting an annuities reinsurance deal, or could it be life or anywhere else? Any color there?\nCharlie Lowrey: Sure. Let me take that. This is Charlie. First, I'll deal with both annuities and then talk a little bit about life. We're really pleased with the valuation for the block of traditional variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits that we sold as evidenced by the gain on sale we reported. And we'll continue to explore possible additional opportunities to de-risk in-force blocks of traditional VA business. We expect to reach our goal of reducing market sensitivity through the pallet transaction we just completed and through the natural runoff of traditional variable annuities business over time and as we're not in a position of having to do another transaction. But having said this, we'll continue to explore possible additional opportunities, but we'll only do something, as we've said before, if it's in the best interest of stakeholders. So that's on the annuity side. On the Life block side, as we've noted in the past, we've dedicated resources to looking at various opportunities aligned with our strategy of becoming a higher growth and less market-sensitive company. And as a result, we'd certainly consider opportunities for a life sub-block if they came our way, but with the caveat that it has to make sense for shareholders. So we're going to be disciplined in our approach as the individual life business continues to be core to our purpose.\nMike Ward: Great. Thank you. That's very helpful. And then maybe on PRT, just wondering if there's kind of a benchmark that maybe you could give in terms of how you think about earnings per $1 billion of PRT business or something like that. I guess one of your larger peers has given this in the past, I think it's around $7 million, $8 million of earnings per $1 billion of PRT, wondering if that sounds ballpark accurate?\nKen Tanji: Yeah. Hey, Mike, this is Ken. All the deals are a little different. I don't think putting out a benchmark is \u2013 would be appropriate.\nMike Ward: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is a follow-up from Tracy Benguigui from Barclays. Your line is now live.\nTracy Benguigui: Thank you. I just wanted to revisit the statutory reserve charge you'll be taking in the fourth quarter. Just help me understand better why it would be comparable in size on the GAAP side? Because as you mentioned, statutory reserves are more conservative. I mean, I would imagine there'd be some cushion there, if you could elaborate on the compatibility.\nKen Tanji: Yes. Tracy, it will be higher. But again -- and because generally because the stat is more conservative and it's also -- it's just different. But again, we have capacity to absorb that, and we still hold that view.\nTracy Benguigui: Okay. When you say higher, you mean on absolute terms or the contribution will be higher, a little bit confused.\nKen Tanji: No, I'm sorry. When we took the charge, we believe that we had and we continue to believe we have capacity to absorb that within PICA's excess capital position as a result.\nTracy Benguigui: Okay. But I think last quarter, I think it was something like $1.4 billion pretax. So, are we talking the same dollar amount for stat?\nKen Tanji: It would be higher again. We're still finalizing those. That will be finalized in our fourth quarter results. But again, we have the capacity to absorb that within PICA, and we'll continue to maintain RBC ratios consistent with our AA standards.\nTracy Benguigui: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up from Ryan Krueger. Your line is now live from KBW.\nRyan Krueger: Thanks. I figured I just asked this since it wasn't asked last quarter. Would you be able to say what your ULSG stat reserve total is and what you moved to the ultimate lapse rate assumption to when you did the review last quarter.\nKen Tanji: I think we need to follow up on both of those. They're pretty specific, if that's all right.\nRyan Krueger: Yes, no problem. I just figured I'd give it a shot. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is a follow-up from Tom Gallagher from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live.\nTom Gallagher: Thanks. Just one question on the holding company cash, again, to come back to the -- the $5.1 billion, I believe, includes $1.5 billion that we should think about for prefunding a debt maturity in the middle part of 2023. I just wanted to confirm that, that's the intention. And should we think about the holding company cash really as $3.6 billion on a net basis? Thanks.\nKen Tanji: Yes, Tom, in our holding company, cash position will vary depending upon the timing of when we issue debt or debt matures or we call it. We've consistently made it a good practice to prefund maturing and callable debt 12 to 18 months in advance. And this -- what this does is it reduces our refinancing risk and enables us to be selective in the timing of debt funding relative to particular market conditions. In August, we issued $1.5 billion of debt and we've earmarked that for debt that's callable next year. The timing was good. We're happy with the outcome. And we're going to continue to prefund debt as a good practice. And overall, though, if you looked at our level of debt over the last three years, it's been at a fairly consistent level. It will vary depending on timing of maturities and issuance. But overall, it hasn't changed that much. We also have, as we continue to highlight contingent sources of debt. So overall, we feel very good about the level of our debt that's consistent with our AA financial strength rating and how we manage refinancings of our debt very well as well.\nCharlie Lowrey: Hey, Tom, it's Charlie. I'd just reiterate what I said in the beginning as well. We believe we have other levers and resources by which to execute on our plan. So there are -- you can look at it in the one way you did. But on the other hand, as Ken said, and as we've reiterated throughout the call, we have other means by which to execute on our plan as well.\nEnd of Q&A:\nOperator: Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Lowrey for any further closing comments.\nCharlie Lowrey: Okay. Thank you, operator, and thank you for joining us today. Before I conclude, I want to acknowledge the unexpected passing of George Paz last week, a member of Prudential's Board of Directors for the past six years. George was an integral member of our Board, with a unique perspective and deep business experience that helped us shape our thinking on a multitude of issues. He will be greatly missed and remembered as both a trusted adviser and as a friend. I hope we demonstrated during this call, the progress we're making to transform Prudential to deliver sustainable long-term growth and meet the evolving needs of our customers. Looking ahead, we remain confident in our strategy and the strength of our company. For nearly 150 years, Prudential has been there for its customers and other stakeholders, who we will continue to serve as we strive to be a global leader in expanding access to investing insurance and retirement security. Thank you again for joining us today.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

            "name": "Rob Falzon",
            "content": "Thank you, Charlie. I'll provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for our PGIM, US and international businesses. I'll begin on Slide 6 with our financial results for the third quarter of 2022. Pre-tax adjusted operating income was $1 billion or $2.13 per share on an after-tax basis and reflected lower variable investment income driven by market conditions and an elevated level of Japan COVID-19 hospitalization claims, partially offset by underlying business growth, including a benefit from rising interest rates. Our GAAP net loss per share was $0.78 on an after-tax basis, primarily reflecting realized investment losses, largely driven by higher interest rates. Turning to the operating results from our businesses compared to the year ago quarter. PGIM, our Global Investment Manager reported lower asset management fees, resulting from a reduction in assets under management reflecting higher interest rates, widening credit spreads and declines in equity markets. Results of our US businesses were lower than the year-ago quarter, reflecting lower spread income due to less favorable variable investment income and lower fee income resulting from the sale of a portion of the legacy variable annuities business, the decline in equity markets and net outflows, partially offset by more favorable underwriting as COVID-19 transitions to an endemic level in the US. The decrease in earnings in our international businesses reflected elevated COVID-19 hospitalization claims in Japan and lower spread income driven by less favorable variable investment income. Turning to Slide 7. PGIM, our global active investment manager, has diversified capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed income, alternatives, real estate and equities. PGIM's long-term investment performance remains attractive with more than 80% of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last five and 10-year periods. PGM experienced retail outflows, primarily in fixed income, consistent with industry trends due to the rising rate environment, while institutional net flows continue to be positive. As the investment engine of Prudential, the success and growth of PGIM and of our US and international insurance and retirement businesses are mutually enhancing. PGIM's asset origination capabilities, investment management expertise and access to institutional and other sources of private capital or a competitive advantage. This helps our businesses bring enhanced solutions and create more value for our customers. Our insurance and retirement businesses, in turn, provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated flows and unique access to insurance liabilities that complement its track record of third-party growth. PGIM's annual fee rate increased due to the continued shift toward higher fee strategies, including our alternatives and private credit business. We continue to grow our alternatives in private credit business, which has assets under management of nearly $230 billion across private credit, real estate equity and debt and private equity secondaries and benefits from our global scale and market-leading positions. Across PGIM's private platform, we deployed $9.6 billion of capital this quarter. As we continue to invest in growth areas that are aligned with the needs of our clients, we also remain disciplined in finding opportunities to protect operating margins by managing the business more efficiently. Turning to Slide 8. Our US businesses produced diversified earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income and benefit from our complementary mix of longevity and mortality businesses. We continue to shift our business mix towards higher growth and less market-sensitive products in markets, transform our capabilities and cost structure and further expand our addressable markets.  Retirement Strategies achieved robust sales in the third quarter across its institutional and individual lines of business. Institutional Retirement closed nearly $10 billion of pension risk transfer transactions in the third quarter including being selected by IBM for a 50% participation in a $16 billion pension risk transfer transaction. Our focus on superior execution, supported by the experience of our high-quality PRT team and our continued market leadership in the US pension risk transfer market contributed to IBM selecting us. We continue to see a significant opportunity in the growing PRT market. In individual retirement, product pits have resulted solutions with $1 billion of FlexGuard and FlexGuard income sales in the third quarter, as well as increased fixed annuity sales. Our individual life sales also reflect our earlier product pivot strategy with variable life products representing approximately 70% of sales for the quarter. Group Insurance experienced a 50% increase in sales compared to the year ago quarter, reflecting higher national account life and disability sales and execution of our product growth strategy to drive supplemental health. Turning to Slide 9. Our international businesses include our Japanese life insurance companies, where we have a differentiated multichannel distribution model as well as other businesses aimed at expanding our presence in high-growth emerging markets. In Japan, we are focused on providing high-quality service and expanding our geographic coverage and product offerings. Our needs-based approach and protection product focus continue to provide important value to our customers as we expand our product offerings to meet their evolving needs. For example, we launched a yen-denominated investment product with a joint survivorship feature in the bank channel in the third quarter. In emerging markets, we are focused on creating a carefully selected portfolio of businesses and regions where customer needs are growing, where there are compelling opportunities to build market-leading businesses and where the Prudential enterprise can add value. In the third quarter, we continued to focus on expanding product and business capabilities to meet the evolving needs of customers. In Brazil, we expanded our digital sales application and achieved record sales for the second consecutive quarter driven by strong performance across all distribution channels. We further expanded our product offerings on the Mercado Libre platform in Brazil and successfully launched the sales platform in Argentina, as Charlie mentioned. In addition, we completed our tender offer for Alex Forbes, expanding our ownership to 33% of a leading provider of integrated retirement, investment and wealth management services in South Africa. As we look ahead, we're well positioned across our businesses to be a global leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security. We continue to invest in growth businesses and markets, deliver industry-leading customer experiences and create the next generation of financial solutions to better serve the diverse needs of a broad range of customers. And now with that, I'll hand it over to Ken. Wilma, it's Rob. Just sort of following on the second part of your question. So in that particular entity, no, our intent is not to bring in third-party capital. As Ken alluded to, it's a kind of a captive vehicle. Having said that, we are keenly aware of the increased institutional appetite coming into this sector. And as we've said before, we don't think that there's a firm who's better positioned to figure out how to satisfy the intersection of demand for our customers on the liability origination side with appetite for funding into those sorts of investments from the institutional side. So, nothing to talk about near term there, but we think we're particularly well positioned in order to be able to exploit that."

            "name": "Andy Sullivan",
            "content": "So, Tracy, it's Andy. And first, let me thanks for -- I appreciate the congratulations. You probably could tell we're exceptionally proud of our team and of our capabilities in our pension risk transfer business. The fact that we conducted the second largest transaction in history is second only to the ground breakage transaction we did with General Motors about a decade ago for $29 billion. This transaction, we did split 50-50 between us and another provider. And for clarity, the decision to split a deal is made by the plan sponsor versus carriers bidding together. As we look forward, we don't think deal splitting will be atypical and we will always be open to that type of situation depending on the deal's characteristics. Overall, the market in pension risk transfer remains very robust. The industry experienced a third successive record-breaking quarter. Third quarter came in at $28 billion, which was a 60% increase from last year. Funded status remains near record levels at 106%. So, we now expect this year, as you heard in Charlie's remarks to come in above $50 billion for the industry, and we believe that we'll consistently see about $40 billion going forward. Given the size of that market, despite that it's a competitive market, we expect, given our industry-leading track record and our capabilities, we're going to continue to find success at picking our spots. And net-net, this will be a nice organic growth area for us over time. Yes. So, Ryan, it's Andy again. Good morning. Thanks for your question on the Individual Retirement business. We're very pleased with the momentum that we're seeing this quarter. Let me speak first about our core earnings progress, and then I'll talk about our continued success at FlexGuard. We saw a material lift in our core earnings, thanks primarily to the change in the interest rate environment. And that's both on the short and long end of the curve. We get lift from interest rates on our collateral on the short end, and we're getting lift on the long-term side in our portfolio as well. And we're seeing the FlexGuard block grow. That's why you saw the step-up in our core earnings. And I would just kind of go back to what Ken said earlier, higher rates are a good thing overall for Prudential. Additionally, we're very pleased with the continued progress at building a very healthy FlexGuard block of business. Quarter in and quarter out, we remain a top share player in the market. We've achieved $11 billion in sales life to date. We very much like the profitability of the block that we've brought into the organization. And at the end of the day, kind of back to the organic growth discussion, we see the retirement decumulation opportunity in the country as a very good growth opportunity and we have all the right stuff to capture it. Hey, John, good morning, it's Andy. I'll talk about our COVID. We intentionally, as we've talked about many times in the past, manage our business mix to have a good balance between longevity and mortality. That absolutely paid us dividends all throughout the pandemic. During 3Q, the US experienced 42,000 deaths, which was 17,000 more than our estimate. But the fact is we continue to see a declining impact from COVID in the US. Let me just hit a little bit about each business. In Group Insurance, our life benefit ratio was 91.4%. It did reflect pre-pandemic mortality. That was slightly elevated due to accidental death and dismemberment claims that we very much see just as a natural quarter-to-quarter variability, nothing more. We're very pleased that we continue to see working age guests and its impact on working as continuing to decline. In Individual Life, we saw our mortality actual to expect it at the low end of our range, 97%. And we saw particularly good performance in the smaller face amount bands, and that is typically where we would see the COVID experience show up. In Institutional Retirement, we did see underwriting gains above our seasonalized expectations, particularly in pension risk transfer, but again, not surprising given the average age of that block of business. So the bottom line is, given the balanced mix of businesses that we have, we very much expect this will be very manageable as COVID continues to shift into an endemic state. Yeah, John, it's Andy. I'll take your question on flows. As we've always talked about, flows will vary quarter-to-quarter. So we stay very focused on our long-term track record. In Q3, we experienced third-party net outflows of $4 billion, driven on the retail side. Institutional net flows remained positive with strong positive flows into both Jennison equity and real estate debt. So showing the benefit of our diversified portfolio. We're very pleased with our positive $9 billion in institutional flows year-to-date. I would also note that, we experienced good affiliated flows. So from our insurance transactions, like the IBM transaction, we saw $7 billion in affiliated flows in Q3 and $14 billion year-to-date. That is a very important part of our strategy, and it reflects the synergies between our liability generation capability as well as our asset management capability. To your specific question about retail outflows were $4.6 billion that was a marked improvement from the $8.3 billion last quarter. Much like the rest of the industry, we continue to be impacted by headwinds in both active fixed income and growth equity. As far as where are the flows going, the flows are tending to go into passive, and in the short-duration strategies, we're obviously not a passive player. As far as FX impacts, we really haven't seen anything material to speak of. At the end of the day, we're highly confident that our diversified product portfolio has us well positioned that as the environment settles down and stabilize and flows start to shift back in, we have the experience to succeed and will be a net winner as we always have been. As we've talked about before, we've experienced 18 out of 19 years of positive inflows. Yeah. And Elyse, it's Andy. I would just add, we have a lot of momentum in our institutional retirement business. We have exceptional people, great capabilities, great brand and distribution systems, that's really second to none. And obviously, you've heard about that from a pension risk transfer perspective. But we had $13.5 billion in sales and institutional retirement. So it goes well beyond just pension risk transfer. We also had $1.5 billion in investment-only stable value and $1.2 billion in longevity reinsurance. So we have very good momentum, and it was a banner quarter for us in Institutional Retirement."

            "name": "Ken Tanji",
            "content": "Thanks, Rob. I'll begin on Slide 10, which provides insight into earnings for the fourth quarter of 2022 relative to our third quarter results. As noted, pretax adjusted operating income in the third quarter was $1 billion, and resulted in earnings per share of $2.13 on an after-tax basis.  To get a sense for how our fourth quarter results might develop, we suggest adjustments for the following items: First, variable investment income was below expectations in the third quarter by $295 million; next, we adjust underwriting experience by a net $165 million. This adjustment includes a placeholder for COVID-19 claims experience in the fourth quarter of $20 million for our International Insurance businesses. We expect a lower level of hospitalization claims due to the recent government supported industry revision of eligible benefits policyholders recovering from COVID-19 at home in Japan; and last, we expect seasonal and other items to reduce adjusted operating income by $166 million, primarily driven by the seasonally elevated expenses expected in the fourth quarter. These items combined get us to a baseline of $2.71 per share for the fourth quarter. I'll note that if you exclude items specific to the fourth quarter, earnings per share would be $2.96. The key takeaway is that our underlying earnings power improved due to business growth, including the benefit of higher interest rates that more than offset equity market depreciation. While we have provided these items to consider, please note that there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the fourth quarter. Turning to slide 11. Our capital position supports our AA financial strength rating. Our cash and liquid assets were $5 billion at the high end of our liquidity target range after investing in our businesses to support long-term growth, including the capital to support our IBM pension risk transfer transaction. We have substantial off-balance sheet resources, including contingent capital and liquidity facilities. Over the long-term, a higher interest rate environment is economically beneficial. In the near-term, the current market environment and the annual assumption update reduce our regulatory capital and excess liquidity. We will remain prudent in our capital deployment, balancing the preservation of financial strength, investment in our businesses for sustainable long-term growth and shareholder distributions. Turning to slide 12 and in summary. We are executing our plans to reposition our businesses, we achieved our targeted cost savings one year ahead of plan, and we are navigating the current macro environment with the financial strength of our rock solid balance sheet. Now I'll turn it over to the operator for your questions. Yeah. Hey Tom, sure. I'll cover that. We did make a capital contribution of $1 billion to PICA, our main US life insurance company. And that is to support a high volume of business growth, including the IBM and other pension risk transfer transactions that we did. We also made a $200 million of contributions to fund a few international joint venture investments that's part of our programmatic M&A into emerging markets. And then as we mentioned and highlighted that we funded shareholder distributions of $800 million. The $500 million of net debt increase that we had as we refinance our debt profile was essentially offset by holding company costs, including interest. We did not have dividends from our subs in this quarter, the timing of dividends from our subs to the holdco tend to vary and tend to be greater in the fourth quarter and first quarter. Putting that all together, we ended with highly liquid assets, $5.1 billion, still above our target range. So in some, the primary reason our holdco HLA declined or highlight liquid assets declined was due to the $1.2 billion of business growth. I also -- I just thought it would be helpful to remind people what I said on our last call is that we expect the statutory funding needs for our US Life Insurance business, including our assumption updates to be comparable to our GAPP -- the GAAP impact that we recorded in 2Q. The reserve strengthening will be higher, stat is more conservative, and that's going to be fully reflected in our stat results in the fourth quarter. As I also mentioned on our last call, we have excess capacity already in Pika available to meet that need. So the combination of the capital that we contributed to support business growth this quarter and the excess capacity we had in Pika within Pika will remain with RBC ratios consistent with our AA financial strength target. In terms of shareholder distributions, we will complete our shareholder distributions for this year in the fourth quarter with both dividends and share repurchases. And as Charlie mentioned in his remarks, our capital plan for 2023 will be approved by the Board early next year. And as always, they'll consider our capital position, opportunities to invest in our businesses and now increasingly so, the volatility uncertainty of the economy and markets looking ahead. So we'll factor that all in. But we'll continue with our philosophy of being thoughtful and disciplined with our capital and balance investment in our businesses with long-term growth and maintaining financial strength and returning capital to shareholders. Yes. Yes. Again, we're will complete -- we've already returned $7 billion through the third quarter. We'll complete our plans for this year. And again, our Board will factor in all the considerations that I mentioned into their decisions in early part of next year. Yes, Ryan. Yes, the Bermuda sub that we launched earlier in the year is a good example of the levers that Charlie referenced. We have a new reinsurer in Bermuda. It's called Lotus Re. We did capitalize it with $800 million earlier this year, and we've reinsured a block of variable life business to it. So it will create capital efficiency, and it's a reinsurance capability that's sort of another tool in our toolbox going forward. Yes. Hey, Suneet, yes, 65%, if you looked at our -- what we've generated in free cash flow from our businesses over time, that's been the average. It's been in some years higher than that and in some years, lower than that. Cash flow from our businesses this year is below our historical average. That's both as we continue to invest in our businesses for long-term growth, but also work through the statutory reserve increases in our life insurance businesses that we updated this year. So it will vary over time, but we think given our growth rates and our business profile, that's what our historical average has been. Yes. I don't know what rule of thumb you're using on specific business lines, but it was -- for us, it was primarily related to not just the IBM transaction but the other deals that we did as well. And the growth in our FlexGuard business. And we continue to see good profitability and cash flows from our existing VA business as well. Yes. There is, Suneet, is the rise in interest rates has been very swift. And over time, that will allow us to invest our insurance reserves at higher yields and improving profitability and cash flows. But in the near-term, our statutory surplus in the US business -- for our US business is reduced by what we consider a non-economic statutory reserve method that tends to manifest itself when rates rise, and we experienced unrealized and realized losses on our fixed income and derivatives. This is not unique to us. We believe it's an issue for the broader industry and it's uneconomic in nature and should be addressed. And there's a lot of discussions going on with regulators in the industry about this. So we'll manage the change in the rate environment, and we'll maintain regulatory capital is consistent with our AA financial strength objectives, but there is a short-term impact on our statutory capital. It's still -- it's going to be subject to where the rates move. And so that's still dynamic. Elyse, it's Ken. I'll start. And we have seen as the rise in rates and the rising yields have played out a better opportunity to invest at more attractive terms. And you see that leading to earnings improvement. But probably more importantly, will be the business growth, particularly with the with the pension risk transfer business that we just put on the books at the end of the third quarter. Hey Erik, it's Ken. We are being more disciplined, but it's really timing. We see a lot of that coming into the fourth quarter as usual. And I wouldn't read too much into that. It's -- yes, we are being disciplined, but there's also timing considerations. Yes. The Lotus Re is an internal reinsurance capability that's based in Bermuda. And we find that certain products in our initial use of it was with variable life that we find that the regime there, which is a very robust reserving standard is more principle-based and is better aligned with the economics of that business.  And as a result, by transferring that to reinsuring that to that regime, we get releases of reserves and capital in PICA. And again, it's our efforts to really align the economics of our businesses with reserve and capital standards that are robust and risk sensitive, recognize the nature of the business and are a better fit for that type of business. Yes. So Alex, the -- PICA is generating statutory capital with its business profile. But the size of the business growth that we experienced this quarter was pretty high and unique. And that's why -- we thought it was a very attractive use of capital and deployed capital for that purpose. We acknowledged that the assumption update would require funding needs, and that was a use of capital as well. But we had -- at the time of the second quarter, we had -- we're well-positioned to absorb that capital requirement within PICA, including the -- using the cash flow and statutory surplus that's being generated by our businesses. We'll be looking at the fourth quarter and evaluating again -- well, and I should mention, as I also described, we have had some short-term capital that is being held in reserves potentially for what we consider non-economic reserving given the rise in rates. And then we'll, again, as we always do in the fourth quarter, look at our capital position, our opportunities to deploy capital attractively and make sure we're maintaining PICA at our AA financial strength standards. And Alex, I'll just add. We also have a very established hedging program with our Japanese business that hedges both earnings and the net equity position. And given the strength of the dollar that has a $1.8 billion gain at the end of the third quarter. Yeah. Hey, Mike, this is Ken. All the deals are a little different. I don't think putting out a benchmark is \u2013 would be appropriate. Yes. Tracy, it will be higher. But again -- and because generally because the stat is more conservative and it's also -- it's just different. But again, we have capacity to absorb that, and we still hold that view. No, I'm sorry. When we took the charge, we believe that we had and we continue to believe we have capacity to absorb that within PICA's excess capital position as a result. It would be higher again. We're still finalizing those. That will be finalized in our fourth quarter results. But again, we have the capacity to absorb that within PICA, and we'll continue to maintain RBC ratios consistent with our AA standards. I think we need to follow up on both of those. They're pretty specific, if that's all right. Yes, Tom, in our holding company, cash position will vary depending upon the timing of when we issue debt or debt matures or we call it. We've consistently made it a good practice to prefund maturing and callable debt 12 to 18 months in advance. And this -- what this does is it reduces our refinancing risk and enables us to be selective in the timing of debt funding relative to particular market conditions. In August, we issued $1.5 billion of debt and we've earmarked that for debt that's callable next year. The timing was good. We're happy with the outcome. And we're going to continue to prefund debt as a good practice. And overall, though, if you looked at our level of debt over the last three years, it's been at a fairly consistent level. It will vary depending on timing of maturities and issuance. But overall, it hasn't changed that much. We also have, as we continue to highlight contingent sources of debt. So overall, we feel very good about the level of our debt that's consistent with our AA financial strength rating and how we manage refinancings of our debt very well as well."

            "name": "Charlie Lowrey",
            "content": "Thank you, Bob, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our third quarter financial results reflect the impact of market conditions, including the variability in alternative investment returns and lower fee income, as well as an elevated level of COVID-19 hospitalization claims in Japan, partially offset by underlying business growth, including the benefit from rising interest rates. We continue to transform our businesses to be less market-sensitive and better positioned to deliver sustainable long-term growth. This includes investing in products and solutions that meet the evolving needs of our customers and achieving our $750 million cost savings target one year ahead of schedule. Our rock-solid balance sheet provides the financial strength to navigate the current macroeconomic environment and support our customers, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders. Turning to slide three. I'll start off today with an update on how we are investing in long-term growth opportunities that meet the evolving needs of our customers and support our vision to be a global leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security. In September, Prudential was selected by IBM for a 50% participation in the second largest pension risk transfer transaction in US market history, with a total value of over $16 billion. This transaction builds upon our leadership role in this market, where we have helped employers safeguard their workers' retirements since pioneering the first jumbo PRT transaction a decade ago. We are well positioned to continue to benefit from the growing PRT market, which is expected to have over $50 billion of total industry transactions in 2022. In the individual retirement market, our FlexGuard suite continues to grow in both sales volume and product scope, with an additional $1 billion in sales, bringing the total to nearly $12 billion since its launch in 2020. Building upon FlexGuard's tremendous success, we plan to introduce FlexGuard Life, an index variable universal life product later this month. We expect our businesses will benefit from the increased demand for retirement decumulation products over the next decade, as we strengthen our role as a leader in the $300 billion annuities market. We're making similar growth investments on behalf of our international customers as well. During the third quarter, we expanded into Argentina, our partnership with Mercado Libre, Latin America's largest e-commerce platform with approximately 200 million users. Our expanded partnership follows our initial launch with Mercado Libre in Brazil earlier this year, which delivers life insurance and accident and health products tailored to the platform's mass market customer base. Moving to slide 4. As I noted earlier, we have now achieved $765 million of annual run rate cost savings, exceeding our target of $750 million and completed this one year ahead of schedule. This includes $180 million realized in the third quarter. To achieve these cost savings, we carefully assessed all aspects of our business and operations from our physical office space, to how we leverage technology to deliver more efficient customer experiences. For example, by embracing a hybrid work model, we reduced our office space footprint in the US by approximately 50%, which results in an annual run rate savings of about $50 million. On the customer experience front, our use of artificial intelligence accelerated our individual life underwriting from 22 days to 22 seconds. And our new digital claims processing capability can now deliver funds to most customers in six hours as opposed to six days. We also automated and reduced the timing of fund verification and processing on about one-third of new annuity sales from what was two to three weeks to now two to three days. And our group insurance claims processing is now three times faster, thanks to new data systems we have installed. Turning now to slide 5. Our rock-solid balance sheet and disciplined approach to capital deployment has helped Prudential navigate financial and macroeconomic challenges for nearly 150 years. Consistent with our AA financial strength rating, we have a strong capital position, a high-quality, well-diversified investment portfolio and approximately $5 billion in highly liquid assets at the end of the third quarter. We continue to balance investing in our businesses for long-term growth, with shareholder distributions. In addition to the investments in our businesses that I previously mentioned, we also returned over $800 million to shareholders during the third quarter through dividends and share repurchases and for a total of $7 billion since the beginning of 2021. Looking ahead, we expect higher interest rates will economically benefit our business over time. We have the financial strength to continue to navigate the current economic and market environment. As we monitor developments, we will maintain our disciplined approach to capital management and redeployment, and our Board will review our 2023 capital plan early next year. Before turning it over to Rob, I'd like to touch upon the leadership transition we announced last week as part of our thoughtful approach to creating a sustainable long-term leadership structure. Beginning early next year, Andy Sullivan will move from his current role as Head of our US Businesses, including PGIM, to lead our international businesses and PGIM. Caroline Feeney who currently leads our US Insurance & Retirement Businesses, will take on an expanded role as Head of our Business Portfolio in the US and will join our executive leadership team. Scott Sleyster, who currently leads our international businesses, will retire in the first quarter of 2023. We thank Scott for his tremendous contributions to Prudential over the course of the 35-year career with the company. And look forward to working closely with Andy and Caroline in their new roles. I'll now turn it over to Rob for an update on our business performance. Hey, Tom, it's Charlie. Let me just add one thing because I think part of your question is about can we execute on a long-term plan. And I'll just take it up a level and say we have additional levers we can pull and resources that we can use to do just that, to execute on our long-term plan. Yes. Ken, do you want to comment on that? Sure, Tracy, it's Charlie. Let me take that one. So let me start by saying we remain totally focused on executing on our transformation strategy to become a less market-sensitive and higher-growth company. As you've seen, we've made a number of programmatic acquisitions in PGIM and emerging markets and in the second quarter, we completed two key divestitures that reduced our overall market sensitivity by 20%, so we're well on our way. Now, our path may not be linear as different growth opportunities present themselves at different times. And I would note that our diverse set of businesses provides opportunities to grow in different market environments as we've seen with this market environment, and we're well-positioned to benefit from this diversification. For instance, in the third quarter, our Retirement Strategies business did nearly $15 billion of sales, including a significant PRT transaction that demonstrate our leadership position in this market where we believe there's just tremendous growth potential going forward. But our business system is also self-reinforcing and as an example, the recent IBM PRT -- with the recent IBM PRT transaction, which is in the institutional retirement business. That also brought in over $8 billion in AUM to PGIM. So by saying we're focused on our high-growth businesses, naming PGIM and emerging markets, doesn't mean we're not looking to grow our other businesses as well. So, in summary, what I'd say is we're definitely committed to becoming a higher growth, less market-sensitive company. But our progress will depend upon a couple of things. One is the opportunities that arise, and the second is the macroeconomic conditions. Sure. Let me take the first part of that and then turn it over to Ken. I'll just give you a couple of quick examples. One would be sort of ongoing reinsurance transactions that we continue to review. And the other would be, we have levers both on and off balance sheet that we can pull. So we have lots of different levers and resources that we can use and regularly look at them in order to access additional capital. And Ken, do you want to talk about Bermuda? Sure. Let me take that. This is Charlie. First, I'll deal with both annuities and then talk a little bit about life. We're really pleased with the valuation for the block of traditional variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits that we sold as evidenced by the gain on sale we reported. And we'll continue to explore possible additional opportunities to de-risk in-force blocks of traditional VA business. We expect to reach our goal of reducing market sensitivity through the pallet transaction we just completed and through the natural runoff of traditional variable annuities business over time and as we're not in a position of having to do another transaction. But having said this, we'll continue to explore possible additional opportunities, but we'll only do something, as we've said before, if it's in the best interest of stakeholders. So that's on the annuity side. On the Life block side, as we've noted in the past, we've dedicated resources to looking at various opportunities aligned with our strategy of becoming a higher growth and less market-sensitive company. And as a result, we'd certainly consider opportunities for a life sub-block if they came our way, but with the caveat that it has to make sense for shareholders. So we're going to be disciplined in our approach as the individual life business continues to be core to our purpose. Hey, Tom, it's Charlie. I'd just reiterate what I said in the beginning as well. We believe we have other levers and resources by which to execute on our plan. So there are -- you can look at it in the one way you did. But on the other hand, as Ken said, and as we've reiterated throughout the call, we have other means by which to execute on our plan as well. Okay. Thank you, operator, and thank you for joining us today. Before I conclude, I want to acknowledge the unexpected passing of George Paz last week, a member of Prudential's Board of Directors for the past six years. George was an integral member of our Board, with a unique perspective and deep business experience that helped us shape our thinking on a multitude of issues. He will be greatly missed and remembered as both a trusted adviser and as a friend. I hope we demonstrated during this call, the progress we're making to transform Prudential to deliver sustainable long-term growth and meet the evolving needs of our customers. Looking ahead, we remain confident in our strategy and the strength of our company. For nearly 150 years, Prudential has been there for its customers and other stakeholders, who we will continue to serve as we strive to be a global leader in expanding access to investing insurance and retirement security. Thank you again for joining us today."

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Bob McLaughlin. Please go ahead, sir.\nBob McLaughlin: Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. Representing Prudential on today's call are Charlie Lowrey, Chairman and CEO; Rob Falzon, Vice Chairman; Andy Sullivan, Head of US Businesses; Scott Sleyster, Head of International Businesses; Ken Tanji, Chief Financial Officer; and Rob Axel, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer.

And now I'll turn it over to Charlie.\nCharlie Lowrey: Thank you, Bob, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our second quarter financial results reflect the impact of macroeconomic environments, including the unusual confluence and magnitude of rising interest rates, widening credit spreads, and equity market declines. In addition, we strengthened our individual life reserves as part of our annual review of assumptions, which had a significant impact on our results. This was primarily driven by an increase in our guaranteed universal life reserves. As a reminder, we discontinued single life guaranteed universal life sales in 2020 as part of our strategy to derisk our product mix and we continue to make strategic progress in transforming our businesses to be less market-sensitive and more nimble. We also made additional investments to enhance our long-term sustainable growth. We did this in several ways. First, we significantly reduced our market sensitivity by completing our planned divestitures. Second, we invested in growth businesses and partnerships to address customer needs and expand access to our products and solutions. And third, we continue to advance our cost savings program and now expect to reach our $75 0 million target one year ahead of schedule. We executed on these strategic initiatives with the support of our solid balance sheet. Our strong financial position provides us with the flexibility to navigate through the current macroeconomic conditions, while continuing to invest in the long-term growth of our businesses and return capital to shareholders. We're also confident that our higher rate environment will benefit our businesses over time despite the short-term impacts on our financial performance. I'll now provide an update on the progress of our strategic initiatives. Turning to slide three. We plans to reposition the businesses by reducing market sensitivity and making investments to support long-term sustainable growth. We completed the sales of our full service business and a portion of our traditional variable annuities in April. Together, these divestitures resulted in a $1.5 billion pre-tax gain and further reduce the overall market sensitivity of our businesses by approximately 20%. Moving to our growth investments. We are investing in programmatic acquisitions and partnerships that will help us grow in emerging markets and expand access to investing, insurance and retirement security around the world. In Africa, we completed our acquisition of an initial minority stake in Alex Forbes, a leading provider of financial advice, retirement, investment and wealth management in South Africa. We are now in the process of increasing our stake in the company by up to an additional 18% through a tender offer. In June, we established a partnership with Mercado Libre, the largest e-commerce platform in Latin America with approximately 200 million users. This will enable us to deliver life insurance and accident and health products, tailored to the platform's mass market customer base. At the same time, we are investing in the growth of our products that meet the evolving needs of our customers. Our FlexGuard buffered annuity product recently surpassed $10 billion in sales since launching two years ago. We are also experiencing strong sales from our more recently launched FlexGuard Income offering. Turning to our cost savings initiative on slide four. We now expect to achieve our full $750 million cost savings target in 2022, one year ahead of schedule. We recorded $175 million in cost savings during the second quarter for a total of $725 million of run rate savings to date since 2019. We've also implemented a process of continuous improvement to identify and execute on additional cost savings opportunities in the future. Turning now to slide five. Our robust balance sheet is at the core of all our efforts to transform Prudential to be a leader in expanding access to investing insurance and retirement security around the world. This financial strength also provides the flexibility to balance investing in our businesses with delivering attractive returns to our shareholders. Our robust financial position includes a high-quality, well-diversified investment portfolio, our capital position supports a AA financial strength rating and we had $7 billion in highly liquid assets at the end of the second quarter. During the second quarter, we returned over $800 million to shareholders. And since the beginning of 2021, we have returned a total of $6 billion towards our objective of $11 billion by the end of 2023. Finally, a comment on the environmental, social and governance front. In June, we published our third Annual Sustainability Report, which details the progress of our ESG initiatives, including information on our EEO-1 and pay equity disclosures, commitments to racial equity and achieving net-zero emissions. We believe in transparency and hold ourselves accountable to the commitments detailed in our report. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob for an update on our business performance.\nRob Falzon: Thank you, Charlie. I'll provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for our PGIM, US and International Businesses. I'll begin on slide six with our financial results for the second quarter of 2022. Pre-tax adjusted operating income was $872 million or $1.74 per share on an after-tax basis and included a $1.4 billion increase in reserves from our annual assumption update and other refinements. We strengthened our Individual Life reserves, primarily reflecting updates to policyholder behavior and revised mortality assumptions. These updates were based on several industry studies; emerging practices and our own experience, following our well-established annual assumption update process. Current quarter results also included an $852 million gain from completing the sale of PALAC, a legacy block of Variable Annuities. Our GAAP net loss was $1.4 billion lower than our after-tax adjusted operating income, primarily driven by the mark-to-market impact from higher interest rates on derivatives that are used for asset liability management, partially offset by a gain on the full -- on the sale of our full service business. Turning to the operating results of our businesses, excluding the impacts of the annual assumption update and the gain on the sale of PALAC. PGIM, our global investment manager reported lower other related revenues driven by a decrease in seed and co-investment income and incentive fees, as well as lower asset management fees compared to the year ago quarter. Results of our US businesses were lower than the year ago quarter, reflecting lower spread income due to less favorable variable investment income and lower fee income resulting from the decline in equity markets, partially offset by more favorable underwriting. The decrease in earnings in our International Businesses primarily reflected lower earnings from joint venture investments, lower net investment results driven by less favorable variable investment income and less favorable underwriting results, partially offset by business growth. Turning to Slide 7. PGIM, our global active investment manager, has diversified capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed income, alternatives, real estate and equities. PGIM's long-term investment performance remains attractive with 75% to 85% of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last three, five and ten-year periods. PGIM benefited from its diversified business mix, as strong institutional net inflows of $8.1 billion, primarily driven by fixed income, offset retail outflows as investors repositioned their portfolios in a rising rate environment. As the investment engine of Prudential, the success and growth of PGIM and of our US and international insurance and retirement businesses are mutually enhancing. PGIM's asset origination capabilities, investment management expertise and access to institutional and other sources of private capital are our competitive advantage, helping our businesses bring enhanced solutions, innovation and create more value for our customers. Our insurance and retirement businesses in turn, provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated flows and unique access to insurance liabilities that complement its successful third-party track record of growth. PGIM's average fee rate increased due to the successful execution of our strategy, including the continued mix shift toward higher fee strategies in our alternatives and private credit business. As a result, asset management fees decreased by only 6% despite assets under management declining by 11% due to rising rates, widening spreads and equity market depreciation. We continue to grow our alternatives in private credit business, which has assets under management of approximately $230 billion across private credit, real estate equity and debt and private equity secondaries and benefits from our global scale and market-leading positions. Notably, across PGIM's private platform, we deployed nearly $15 billion of capital, up nearly 40% from the year ago quarter, reflecting the continued strong environment for private credit. PGIM also raised nearly $3 billion in new private capital commitments across real estate and private credit. Turning to Slide 8. Our US businesses produced diversified earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income and benefit from our complementary mix of longevity and mortality businesses. We continue to shift our business mix towards higher growth and less market-sensitive products and businesses to transform our capabilities and cost structure and to further expand our addressable markets.  Retirement Strategies achieved solid sales in the second quarter across its institutional and individual lines of business. Institutional stable value sales were $1.6 billion. International reinsurance closed $1.4 billion of longevity reinsurance transactions during the quarter, and US pension risk transfer closed several transactions totaling more than $725 million. Our product pivots in individual retirement have resulted in strong sales of more simplified solutions with nearly $1.5 billion of FlexGuard and FlexGuard Income sales in the second quarter. Our strong FlexGuard sales benefited from implementing a fully digital and automated new business experience. This tech-forward approach helps to maintain our record pace of sales. Our Individual Life sales also reflect our earlier product pivot strategy, with variable life products representing approximately 71% of sales for the quarter. The improved group insurance benefits ratio for the quarter reflects the transition from a pandemic to an endemic phase of COVID, as well as favorable experience in both group life and disability. In addition, we're focused on creating the next generation of financial solutions to serve the diverse needs of a broader range of customers and clients. This quarter, we launched the Prudential simplified issue final expense product on the Assurance platform. Turning to slide nine. Our International Businesses include our Japanese life insurance companies, where we have a differentiated multi-channel distribution model, as well as other businesses aimed at expanding our presence in high-growth emerging markets. In Japan, we are focused on providing high-quality service and expanding our geographic coverage and product offerings. Our needs-based approach and mortality protection focus continue to provide important value to our customers, as we expand our product offerings to meet their evolving needs. And we continue to enhance customer experience and agent support, including through digital tools. For example, this quarter, Gibraltar launched an exclusive website dedicated to teachers to help serve this market. In emerging markets, we are focused on creating a carefully selected portfolio of businesses in regions where customer needs are growing, where there are compelling opportunities to build market-leading businesses and where the Prudential enterprise can add value. In the second quarter, we continued to focus on expanding product and business capabilities in emerging markets to meet the evolving needs of customers. In Brazil, we achieved record sales, driven by the expansion of our third-party distribution channel, where sales increased 120% compared to the year ago quarter, as well as by the continued strength of the Life Planner channel. We established a partnership with Mercado Libre in Latin America to expand access to customers in the region. In the first two weeks following the launch in June, we have sold Life and A&H policies in every state in Brazil. This was accomplished through a fully digital sales, customer service and claims experience. We also continue to expand our wellness platform across Latin America by establishing a partnership with Medif\u00e9, a health service provider to 300,000 customers in Argentina. In addition, we are expanding our presence in Africa through an investment in South African-based Alex Forbes, as Charlie discussed earlier. As we look ahead, we're well positioned across our businesses to be a global leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security. We continue to invest in growth businesses and markets, deliver industry-leading customer experiences and create the next generation of financial solutions to better serve the diverse needs of a broad range of customers. And with that, I'll hand it over to Ken.\nKen Tanji: Thanks, Rob. I'll begin on slide 10, which provides insight into earnings for the third quarter of 2022 relative to our second quarter results. As noted, pre-tax adjusted operating income in the second quarter was $872 million and resulted in earnings per share of $1.74 on an after-tax basis. To get a sense for how our third quarter results might develop, we suggest adjustments for the following items. First is an adjustment for two one-time items that net to a charge of $571 million in the second quarter. Our annual assumption update and other refinements resulted in a net charge of $1.4 billion, primarily driven by our Individual Life business, as Rob previously described. This was partially offset by a $852 million gain from the sale of a block of legacy variable annuities. Next, variable investment income outperformed expectations in the second quarter by $80 million. Third, we adjust underwriting experience by a net $25 million. This adjustment includes a placeholder for COVID-19 claims experience in the third quarter of $5 0 million for our International Businesses, primarily due to hospitalization benefits for policyholders recovering from COVID-19 at home in accordance with the special regulatory provision in Japan that is currently in effect. We have also updated our mortality assumptions for the US Businesses to include continued COVID-19 mortality with an expected gradual transition to an endemic phase over time. While we have attempted to reflect COVID-19-related claims experience, the actual impact will depend on a variety of factors such as infection and fatality rates, geographic and demographic mix, and the effectiveness of vaccines. And last, we expect other items to be $30 million lower in the third quarter, primarily due to lower than typical expenses in the second quarter that were partially offset by lower other related revenues in PGIM and lower joint venture earnings. These items combined get us to a baseline of $2.63 per share for the third quarter. I'll note that if you exclude items specific to the third quarter, earnings per share would be $2.75, a modest decline primarily due to lower fee income as a result of market depreciation, lower underwriting income due to the updated actuarial assumptions, and continued COVID-19 mortality that is now reflected in our US Businesses expected results. While we have provided these items to consider, please note there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the third quarter. Turning to slide 11. I will now comment on the upcoming adoption of the new accounting standard for long-duration insurance contracts, also known as LDTI, which goes into effect on January 1st, 2023. The new accounting standard applies to our GAAP financial statements and will have no direct effect on our statutory financial statements, cash flows or dividend capacity. We estimate that adjusted book value, which excludes accumulated other comprehensive income, or AOCI, will be reduced by $1 billion to $2 billion as of December 31st, 2021. This reflects the reclassification of non-performance risk gains from retained earnings to AOCI and other changes in reserves. We believe adjusted book value, which excludes AOCI, remains a relevant measure as AOCI and GAAP equity will continue to lack symmetry in the valuation of invested assets and insurance liabilities. We estimate that AOCI will be reduced by approximately $28 billion to $33 billion as of December 31st, 2021, primarily due to the remeasurement of long-duration liabilities with a lower discount rates, primarily in our Japan business. Also of note, GAAP equity and adjusted book value will continue to exclude certain unrealized insurance margins from products subject to LDTI. As of December 31st, 2021, the estimated after-tax unrealized insurance margins related to those products are expected to be $60 billion to $65 billion, primarily in our Japan business. These margins represent an important factor in determining financial strength. Turning to Slide 12. We continue to maintain a robust capital position and adequate sources of funding. Our capital position continues to support a AA financial strength rating and we have substantial sources of funding. Our cash and liquid assets were $7 billion and above our $3 billion to $5 billion liquidity target range, due to the receipt of proceeds from the sales of our full service retirement business and a block of legacy Variable Annuities and other sources of funds include free cash flow from our businesses as well as contingent capital facilities. Turning to Slide 13 and in summary, we are executing on our plans to reposition our businesses. We are expecting to reach our targeted cost savings one year ahead of plan and our rock-solid balance sheet provides financial flexibility to execute on our transformation and thoughtfully deploy capital. Now I'll turn it to your operator for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Tom Gallagher from Evercore. Your line is now live.\nTom Gallagher: Good morning. I'd like to start on the mortality assumption review, the charge. Can you talk a little bit about what drove it? Was it more the mortality side? Was it more the lapse side? Was it mainly mortality assumptions pre-pandemic? Was there a meaningful adjustment from the experience that you've seen through the pandemic? A little bit of color there would be helpful? Thanks.\nKen Tanji: Yes. Hey Tom, it's Ken. Let me give you a little bit of background on the assumption update. As I think most people know, each year in the second quarter, we examined our updated experience that's available from our own business, but we also look at information that's available from industry studies and other surveys.  And again, this year, we followed our process that's quite comprehensive and well established. We did make updates to our individual life insurance actuarial assumptions, primarily for policyholder persistency and mortality. Let me start with the policy persistency changes, that was mainly with our guaranteed Universal Life products, where we lowered our lapse and surrender assumptions and that revision reflected information, we gained from recently released studies and surveys, as well as our recent emerging experience. And so, we essentially refined into a more dynamic lapse assumptions for that portion of the business. In terms of mortality, we also included the impact of COVID-19 claims with the expectation of shifting from endemic to -- or from a pandemic to endemic phase. And we also lowered future mortality improvement, as well given recent trends. Now the majority of the reserve strengthening was the result of the policyholder persistency assumption. The mortality updates were more modest and across all of our businesses.\nTom Gallagher: That's really helpful, Ken. Appreciate that color. My follow-up is just, will the -- will this also result in a statutory impact in addition to the GAAP impact? And if so, can you help quantify that and talk about how that could impact capital management, if at all?\nKen Tanji: Yes. The updated assumptions are applied to our statutory reserves as well. It will have a comparable magnitude of impact but we're well positioned to maintain strong regulatory capital ratios. We have a strong capital position overall, and we continue to have diverse sources of free cash flow going forward as well.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Ryan Krueger from KBW. Your line is now live.\nRyan Krueger: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Would you expect much of an impact from updated Q2 factors for longevity risk, which I don't think was in the RBC ratio previously and an updated mortality risk factor when that is implemented, I believe, which may be at year-end?\nKen Tanji: Yes. Ryan, it's Ken again. I'll take those. No, we don't expect a significant overall impact for either of those. The longevity factors were incorporated, I believe, last year and including some correlation benefits between longevity and mortality and given the updated -- the updates to mortality that have been proposed, those will be manageable and again, reflective of the good combination of business that we have that is both longevity-based and mortality-based.\nRyan Krueger: Got it. Thanks. And then I had a question on the Bermuda subsidiary that you had established earlier this year and contributed capital to last year -- or last quarter. Can you give any more color on kind of what your longer-term plans are for that? And what -- to what extent you may be able to start shifting US Business into Bermuda to get an offsetting benefit from the capital you had contributed last quarter. Thanks.\nKen Tanji: Okay. Yes, Ryan, yes. The -- we did launch a new company last quarter. It's a new reinsurance company that's based in Bermuda, which we call LOTUS Re. We think it's a really good capability to have. We've reinsured a block of variable life policies to that company. We're obviously following the BMA standards. The business is well reserved and capitalized, including the capital that we put in, in it last quarter. But it's also very well aligned with the economics of that business. So going forward, we do believe this will be a more efficient capital framework for our Variable Life business that's well aligned with the economics of that business as well.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from John Barnidge from Piper Sandler. Your line is now live.\nJohn Barnidge: Thank you very much. Can you maybe talk about persistency trends in group life and visibility? There's been increased lapse activity seen by other market participants, given kind of the movements in the war on talent among employees. It looks like persistency did go down in 2Q for disability, but not life. Thank you.\nAndy Sullivan: Hey, John, good morning, it's Andy. Ill take your question. Maybe I'll bring it up a level and say that the general effect that we saw during the pandemic was companies really pulled back on switching their benefit plans. As we've come through the pandemic and as hopefully we're coming out the other side, and it's becoming more endemic, we've seen, basically, in the marketplace, a normal level of RFP activity. So things have gotten sort of back to normal. When we talk about our persistency, we're very pleased with our persistency results. And as you would imagine, we track very closely the profitability of the business that we retain versus the profitability of the business that we lose. And part of the secret sauce of managing group insurance businesses is, sometimes addition by subtraction. If we can't get the rates that we want to get to move a case to profitability, we -- our plan and our intention and our follow-through is always to let it go. But we're quite pleased at the persistency levels in the business.\nJohn Barnidge: Great. Thank you very much. And then, my follow-up question, if I may. That unrealized insurance margin in Japan, is that a gain that can be harvested through a risk transfer, or how should we be thinking about Pru realizing those?\nKen Tanji: Yes. Hey, John, it's Ken. Let me just -- the unrealized insurance margin is -- that we're referencing here and quantified is under the GAAP constructs. And you can think of it as basically the present value of future premiums less the amounts of the premiums needed to provide claims -- to provide for claims. So it's margin above and beyond what's needed to support the expected claims. It is indicative of the profitability of the business, and the majority is from our Japan business, and it's reflective of what we think is the strong profitability of our Japan business. It's -- there is good embedded profits there and value, and it is a potential source of free cash flow over time. And if we choose to reinsure a block of it as well, we could release capital that way.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi. Thanks. My first question, going back to Individual Life. When we normalize for the assumption review, VII and underwriting, it looks like the underlying earnings power of that segment is in the range of $100 million. And I think in the slides, you guys put the Q3 baseline at $96 million. So can you talk about if there are any ongoing earnings impact from the assumption review? And is roughly $100 million pre-tax a good quarterly level run rate earnings for that segment?\nAndy Sullivan: Yes, Elyse, this is Andy. I'll take your question. The assumption update does have an ongoing impact on our Individual Life business. It reduces our core earnings capability in the neighborhood of $30 million per quarter. So our core run rate was about $105 million before, so it brings it down to $75 million. What you're seeing in our walk on the slide, remember that we expect to have $20 million of higher underwriting gains seasonally in third quarter of 2022. So if you make that adjustment, that gets you to that 96 baseline.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. Thank you. And then my second question is on Assurance IQ, if you guys can just give us some color on the upcoming enrollment season. And then revenues declined there roughly 30% in the second quarter. Were revenues, for some reason, impacted by the assumption review, or should we just think about that $78 million perhaps indicating a lower baseline for that segment?\nAndy Sullivan: Yes, Elyse, it's Andy. I'll take the question. Let me start by reiterating that we're still very focused on scaling up revenue in each of the distinct product lines in the Assurance IQ platform, as that really is what's required to get the business to achieve profitability. With that said and you sort of pointed to this, there are a number of things that are important to discuss this quarter as we've made really good progress in Medicare Advantage that was somewhat masked. First, we did have a $17 million negative LTV adjustment, that is a direct impact on revenue, that was an adjustment -- assumption adjustment based on our persistency. Second, we saw an impact on the under 65 healthcare business versus the year ago quarter as the Biden administration did not open up a special enrollment period like they did last year. Those two factors really masked a 64% improvement in Medicare Advantage enrollments and a resulting 35% increase in Medicare Advantage Commission revenue versus a year ago quarter. So, we are pleased with the continued underlying fundamental strengthening in the Medicare Advantage product line. The first part of your question is, how we're feeling about our preparation. We're making very good progress in becoming ready for the fourth quarter open enrollment season from an agent preparedness perspective specifically. We've now -- we'll be entering our third year, so we have the benefit of two full cycles underneath us. And candidly, we're seeing great success in hiring agents, partly due to the difficult time that some of the smaller players in the space are having.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. \nJimmy Bhullar: Hi, good morning. I just had a question first on the actuarial review and its impact on future income. I think you mentioned $120 million on GAAP. Should we assume a commensurate impact on stat income going forward as well?\nKen Tanji: It would have a similar impact on GAAP earnings. I'm not -- we'll have to get back to on the quantum of that, but there would be a future impact to strengthening going forward. \nQ \u2013 Jimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then can you talk about your \u2013 the decline in the Life Planner Count and Gibraltar Life Consultants and whether it's sort of -- and what your expectations are for growth in both of those agency channels? Is the decline being caused more by sort of COVID-related factors right now or should we assume modest growth going forward in both of those?\nScott Sleyster: Hi Jimmy, this is Scott. The LP count has been essentially flat with new recruits roughly offsetting LP resignations and our LC count has actually been slightly negative. As you might expect, it's been more challenging to recruit in a pandemic environment. It's actually a little bit harder to mentor new hires in this kind of environment. We expect this situation to remain challenging until the pandemic eases. But we would then expect to see improvement in kind of a return to normal beyond the pandemic. I think it's also worth noting that we continue to focus a great deal of energy on expanding our third-party distribution channels across all of our markets.\nOperator: Thanks. The next question is coming from Suneet Kamath from Jefferies. Your line is now live. \nSuneet Kamath: Thanks. Just wanted to come back to the assumption review and the impact on statutory. Just given the size of the charge, does this suggest that you're going to need to infuse capital into PICA or is there enough excess RBC in there to sort of absorb the similar charge that you took on a GAAP basis?\nKen Tanji: Yeah, overall this will be very manageable, as I mentioned, where we think we're well positioned to maintain strong RBC statutory ratios. And right now, we're not expecting to have to infuse additional capital as a result.\nSuneet Kamath: Okay. Got it. And then I guess for, Charlie, I'll ask the same question I always ask on the strategy. And this idea of improving the earnings contribution from growth businesses to over 30%, it still seems like you'll need pretty sizable inorganic M&A to get there. So just curious, what you're seeing out there in the landscape? Are you seeing opportunities to put some of the $7 billion of liquid assets at the holding company to work? I mean, just thinking about inorganic growth, what are you seeing out there? Thanks.\nCharlie Lowrey: Yea, sure. We\u2019re seeing a number of different opportunities at this point in the cycle. You're beginning to see other things or some things free up that wouldn't have been there before and at reduced multiple. So it's a good time to have flexibility in order to be able to think about that kind of acquisition. What I would say is, I'll make a couple of observations. The first is our strong balance sheet provides us with the flexibility to manage through whatever macroeconomic conditions we may face as we look forward. And that's going to be an important consideration for us as we go forward. But second, to your point, having a strong balance sheet in a dislocated market means that we can take advantage of opportunities that present themselves. So we're going to be -- we do have a strong balance sheet. We're going to remain flexible with that balance sheet, and we're going to look for opportunities that may present themselves in the current economic environment.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\nAlex Scott: Hi. First question I had was on the Annuities business. Now that the transaction is closed, I was just wondering if you could help us think through earnings power there and just given a lot of moving parts to the transaction, equity markets. And then I think, maybe, the runoff of the block, how should we think of that over the next several quarters?\nAndy Sullivan: So, Alex -- \nKen Tanji: Go ahead, Andy. All right. I was talking about that. Maybe I'll just comment. The -- we did close the PALAC transaction. And it was -- it came in as we were expecting and would reduce our earnings by about $75 million a quarter, and that is very consistent with what we had announced at the time of the transaction.\nAndy Sullivan: Yes, Ken, maybe I'll just jump in and add. I just may bring it up a level back to our intentional strategy to reduce our exposure to traditional variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits to be less than 10% of our enterprise earnings. And so that reduction is very intentional, and it was the two-step process of pivoting and runoff that remains on track. We saw $2.9 billion in runoff this quarter. And then, obviously, the derisking transaction. But the other major part of that was pivot to our FlexGuard chassis, a more simpler design, less volatile design. And we're certainly pleased with the continued strength of those sales.\nAlex Scott: Got it. And the second one I had for you was on the LDTI. You gave some good disclosure on the book value impact. And I know you mentioned that there's a lot of margin that's sort of left in the reserve, because of the pivot sort of approach to LDTI. What does that mean to the earnings power? Can you help us think through that, particularly in Japan, where it's a lot of 60, I assume that a lot of that margin probably has to do with that business. Will this materially change the earnings power?\nKen Tanji: Yes. Overall -- and we'll be providing more disclosure around the whole transition to the new accounting standard as we -- around the time that it is implemented. But let me provide some overall thoughts on earnings. First, overall, we don't expect a significant impact on the level of core operating earnings. Certain businesses have little or no impact like PGIM and group insurance. And from our insurance and retirement businesses in the US and internationally, some will be a bit higher, some will be a bit lower. But overall, that's generally offsetting. So again, overall, we don't expect a significant change in the level of our core operating earnings.\nOperator: Thanks. Our next question today is from Tracy Benguigui from Barclays. Your line is now live.\nTracy Benguigui: Good morning. I have another question on the assumption of that you mentioned industry study. We're in the cheap speed tier. Is that something that is widely available or if you could provide context regarding who participated in that study and who conducted the study, that would be very helpful.\nKen Tanji: Yes. Tracy, that was done by a private party, and it did involve a number of people in the industry. We're not at liberty to disclose who was in there. That's proprietary information of the study. So that's about what I can tell you.\nTracy Benguigui: Okay. Got it. Also noticed that your corporate expenses were low in the quarter compared to the baseline you provided last year. And I'm just wondering how you're thinking about the full year of $1.65 billion guidance.\nKen Tanji: Yes. During the quarter, we did have some favorable items. We did have an FX gain that was helpful this quarter. We did have some other lower expenses and then there is some timing. And we do expect to have seasonally higher expenses in the second half of the year. But given where we are in the first half, we would expect to be modestly below the 1.650 billion guidance that we originally gave.\nOperator: Thanks. Our next question is coming from Jack Maton [ph] from Wolfe Research. Your line is now live.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning. I wanted to ask on the investment portfolio. Are there any metrics you can provide regarding new money rates relative to current portfolio yields? And then what percentage of the portfolio turns over on average in a given year?\nRob Axel: Jack, it's Rob. I can provide that for you. In the -- if you compare the new money rates to our portfolio yields, they're up about 20 basis points in the US and 50 basis points in terms of a positive spread in Japan. So the rise in rates means we're no longer having a drag on our earnings when we measure our new money rates against that portfolio yield. In terms of rollover, it's somewhere between 5% and 10% on an annual basis.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you. And then just a question on the drivers and the outlook for net flows in the PGIM business. And clearly, this quarter, there was a strong recovery in institutional flows, but some pressure on retail flows. I guess could you just talk about what's driving some of the divergence across those customer types and maybe your outlook moving forward?\nAndy Sullivan: Yes, Jack, it's Andy. I'll take your question on flows. As we've talked about in the past, flows at PGIM will vary quarter-to-quarter. So we stay very focused on the long-term track record. In Q2, third-party net flows were roughly flat as very strong institutional inflows of $8.1 billion were offset by the retail outflows of $8.3 billion. Let me give you some color on that. So the $8.1 billion of institutional inflows represented our best quarter since 2018, and those flows were positive across every geography that we operate in. The real drivers where we continue to see clients, their algorithms, institutional clients algorithm shifting into fixed income as the rates rise, and we also see those clients continuing to seek yield in our private and alternative strategies. On the retail side, I would say the story is we were impacted like the rest of the industry by headwinds in the active fixed income and growth equity space. The industry experienced $305 billion in outflows across active US mutual funds as individual investors continue to reposition. Every top 10 fixed income manager and nine of the top 10 active growth equity managers posted negative flows. So, -- but despite that environment, our PGIM investments moved up to the number 16 US mutual fund family in the quarter by assets under management. I'll end the way I typically do, which is we're confident that we're going to be a net flow winner over time. As we look at our business, we have a broad and diversified product portfolio. We continue to put up very strong long-term investment performance, and we have great distribution. So, we'll continue to build on our track record of 18 of the last 19 years of positive flows, and we're quite proud of that.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Mike Ward from Citi. Your line is now live.\nMike Ward: Thanks guys. Just wanted to follow up on Suneet's question about the transformation. And I think you touched on your strategy in terms of acquisitions. But to his point, it seems like that would require a very decent chunk of inorganic growth. So, I guess just wondering, should we assume from here that the strategy is primarily around organic growth acquisitions or opportunistic buys, or do you still look at material kind of divestments or reinsurance from your existing business mix?\nCharlie Lowrey: Yes. This is Charlie. Let me take that one. It's going to be a combination of both, right? Because in the -- as we've done in the past, we're going to continue to be thoughtful about the deployment of proceeds, especially in light of the macroeconomic conditions, and we've always said we're going to be good stewards of capital. But we're going to -- what we're going to do is to continue to demonstrate a discipline, a consistent and a balanced approach to the redeployment of capital within our businesses for acquisitions and to our shareholders, while fulfilling a commitment to our financial strength by maintaining a strong balance sheet. So, we're going to look at a combination of, again, investment in our businesses, acquisitions, returns to shareholders, but also divestitures if they make sense. And we've always said we'll look at additional divestitures of blocks of business, but only if they make sense. And that's what we're going to do as we go forward. So, it will be -- we'll get to our goals through both addition and potentially subtraction, but it has to make sense on both sides for shareholders.\nMike Ward: Okay. Thanks very much. And so I guess, kind of relatedly, it sounds like a pretty comprehensive review in the Life business, just thinking about some of the difficulties that segment has faced over the last few years. I guess, does this have any impact on your strategic view of the Life business? It almost seems like at this point, even if you were to sell it or offload it at a loss, it might be beneficial, or is the diversification benefit, mortality longevity offset? Is that important to the extent that you're going to hang on to Life? Thanks.\nCharlie Lowrey: Yes. Let me start, and then Andy, you may want to add some commentary on it. But for the Life business, we still think there's a significant potential for growth in the industry. You have a $12 trillion insurance -- life insurance gap. You have increasing sales as shown by last year's industry, with sales being the best they have been in about two decades. And from an enterprise perspective, the Life business continues to be a really helpful component in balancing our longevity with our mortality. So there's a lot of interconnection with the other businesses along with PGIM, and it's a business that we would like to remain in, but we'll do so very, very carefully as we go forward. Andy?\nAndy Sullivan: Yes, Charlie, I would just add that we've had a very explicit strategy that we remain committed to, and the path forward is clear. We recognize the disappointing and volatile aspects of GUL. But remember that our strategy has been about pivoting and derisking the business. We see selling GUL -- single life GUL in third quarter of 2020 and we began to rotate the product portfolio towards simpler designs, inclusive of variable universal life final expense and simply term. We also have been very much leaned into reducing expenses to make the business more efficient. So as we're doing that, we're seeing the new business sales, where we have a lot of pricing power and we like the positive returns of that block of business that we're putting on, and we're filling that gap that Charlie talked about.\nOperator: Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Lowrey for any further closing comments.\nCharlie Lowrey: Okay. Thank you very much, and thank you for joining us today. We've made significant progress reducing our market sensitivity, while investing in sustainable long-term growth, advancing our cost savings program and returning capital to shareholders. Looking ahead, we are confident that our strategy, along with our solid financial position will help us deliver an even more meaningful difference in the lives of our customers and delivering value to all our stakeholders, including providing attractive returns to our shareholders, while enabling us to fulfill our vision to become a global leader in expanding access to investing insurance and retirement security. Thank you again for joining us and for your time today.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

            "name": "Ken Tanji",
            "content": "Thanks, Rob. I'll begin on slide 10, which provides insight into earnings for the third quarter of 2022 relative to our second quarter results. As noted, pre-tax adjusted operating income in the second quarter was $872 million and resulted in earnings per share of $1.74 on an after-tax basis. To get a sense for how our third quarter results might develop, we suggest adjustments for the following items. First is an adjustment for two one-time items that net to a charge of $571 million in the second quarter. Our annual assumption update and other refinements resulted in a net charge of $1.4 billion, primarily driven by our Individual Life business, as Rob previously described. This was partially offset by a $852 million gain from the sale of a block of legacy variable annuities. Next, variable investment income outperformed expectations in the second quarter by $80 million. Third, we adjust underwriting experience by a net $25 million. This adjustment includes a placeholder for COVID-19 claims experience in the third quarter of $5 0 million for our International Businesses, primarily due to hospitalization benefits for policyholders recovering from COVID-19 at home in accordance with the special regulatory provision in Japan that is currently in effect. We have also updated our mortality assumptions for the US Businesses to include continued COVID-19 mortality with an expected gradual transition to an endemic phase over time. While we have attempted to reflect COVID-19-related claims experience, the actual impact will depend on a variety of factors such as infection and fatality rates, geographic and demographic mix, and the effectiveness of vaccines. And last, we expect other items to be $30 million lower in the third quarter, primarily due to lower than typical expenses in the second quarter that were partially offset by lower other related revenues in PGIM and lower joint venture earnings. These items combined get us to a baseline of $2.63 per share for the third quarter. I'll note that if you exclude items specific to the third quarter, earnings per share would be $2.75, a modest decline primarily due to lower fee income as a result of market depreciation, lower underwriting income due to the updated actuarial assumptions, and continued COVID-19 mortality that is now reflected in our US Businesses expected results. While we have provided these items to consider, please note there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the third quarter. Turning to slide 11. I will now comment on the upcoming adoption of the new accounting standard for long-duration insurance contracts, also known as LDTI, which goes into effect on January 1st, 2023. The new accounting standard applies to our GAAP financial statements and will have no direct effect on our statutory financial statements, cash flows or dividend capacity. We estimate that adjusted book value, which excludes accumulated other comprehensive income, or AOCI, will be reduced by $1 billion to $2 billion as of December 31st, 2021. This reflects the reclassification of non-performance risk gains from retained earnings to AOCI and other changes in reserves. We believe adjusted book value, which excludes AOCI, remains a relevant measure as AOCI and GAAP equity will continue to lack symmetry in the valuation of invested assets and insurance liabilities. We estimate that AOCI will be reduced by approximately $28 billion to $33 billion as of December 31st, 2021, primarily due to the remeasurement of long-duration liabilities with a lower discount rates, primarily in our Japan business. Also of note, GAAP equity and adjusted book value will continue to exclude certain unrealized insurance margins from products subject to LDTI. As of December 31st, 2021, the estimated after-tax unrealized insurance margins related to those products are expected to be $60 billion to $65 billion, primarily in our Japan business. These margins represent an important factor in determining financial strength. Turning to Slide 12. We continue to maintain a robust capital position and adequate sources of funding. Our capital position continues to support a AA financial strength rating and we have substantial sources of funding. Our cash and liquid assets were $7 billion and above our $3 billion to $5 billion liquidity target range, due to the receipt of proceeds from the sales of our full service retirement business and a block of legacy Variable Annuities and other sources of funds include free cash flow from our businesses as well as contingent capital facilities. Turning to Slide 13 and in summary, we are executing on our plans to reposition our businesses. We are expecting to reach our targeted cost savings one year ahead of plan and our rock-solid balance sheet provides financial flexibility to execute on our transformation and thoughtfully deploy capital. Now I'll turn it to your operator for questions. Yes. Hey Tom, it's Ken. Let me give you a little bit of background on the assumption update. As I think most people know, each year in the second quarter, we examined our updated experience that's available from our own business, but we also look at information that's available from industry studies and other surveys.  And again, this year, we followed our process that's quite comprehensive and well established. We did make updates to our individual life insurance actuarial assumptions, primarily for policyholder persistency and mortality. Let me start with the policy persistency changes, that was mainly with our guaranteed Universal Life products, where we lowered our lapse and surrender assumptions and that revision reflected information, we gained from recently released studies and surveys, as well as our recent emerging experience. And so, we essentially refined into a more dynamic lapse assumptions for that portion of the business. In terms of mortality, we also included the impact of COVID-19 claims with the expectation of shifting from endemic to -- or from a pandemic to endemic phase. And we also lowered future mortality improvement, as well given recent trends. Now the majority of the reserve strengthening was the result of the policyholder persistency assumption. The mortality updates were more modest and across all of our businesses. Yes. The updated assumptions are applied to our statutory reserves as well. It will have a comparable magnitude of impact but we're well positioned to maintain strong regulatory capital ratios. We have a strong capital position overall, and we continue to have diverse sources of free cash flow going forward as well. Yes. Ryan, it's Ken again. I'll take those. No, we don't expect a significant overall impact for either of those. The longevity factors were incorporated, I believe, last year and including some correlation benefits between longevity and mortality and given the updated -- the updates to mortality that have been proposed, those will be manageable and again, reflective of the good combination of business that we have that is both longevity-based and mortality-based. Okay. Yes, Ryan, yes. The -- we did launch a new company last quarter. It's a new reinsurance company that's based in Bermuda, which we call LOTUS Re. We think it's a really good capability to have. We've reinsured a block of variable life policies to that company. We're obviously following the BMA standards. The business is well reserved and capitalized, including the capital that we put in, in it last quarter. But it's also very well aligned with the economics of that business. So going forward, we do believe this will be a more efficient capital framework for our Variable Life business that's well aligned with the economics of that business as well. Yes. Hey, John, it's Ken. Let me just -- the unrealized insurance margin is -- that we're referencing here and quantified is under the GAAP constructs. And you can think of it as basically the present value of future premiums less the amounts of the premiums needed to provide claims -- to provide for claims. So it's margin above and beyond what's needed to support the expected claims. It is indicative of the profitability of the business, and the majority is from our Japan business, and it's reflective of what we think is the strong profitability of our Japan business. It's -- there is good embedded profits there and value, and it is a potential source of free cash flow over time. And if we choose to reinsure a block of it as well, we could release capital that way. It would have a similar impact on GAAP earnings. I'm not -- we'll have to get back to on the quantum of that, but there would be a future impact to strengthening going forward. \nQ \u2013 Jimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then can you talk about your \u2013 the decline in the Life Planner Count and Gibraltar Life Consultants and whether it's sort of -- and what your expectations are for growth in both of those agency channels? Is the decline being caused more by sort of COVID-related factors right now or should we assume modest growth going forward in both of those? Yeah, overall this will be very manageable, as I mentioned, where we think we're well positioned to maintain strong RBC statutory ratios. And right now, we're not expecting to have to infuse additional capital as a result. Go ahead, Andy. All right. I was talking about that. Maybe I'll just comment. The -- we did close the PALAC transaction. And it was -- it came in as we were expecting and would reduce our earnings by about $75 million a quarter, and that is very consistent with what we had announced at the time of the transaction. Yes. Overall -- and we'll be providing more disclosure around the whole transition to the new accounting standard as we -- around the time that it is implemented. But let me provide some overall thoughts on earnings. First, overall, we don't expect a significant impact on the level of core operating earnings. Certain businesses have little or no impact like PGIM and group insurance. And from our insurance and retirement businesses in the US and internationally, some will be a bit higher, some will be a bit lower. But overall, that's generally offsetting. So again, overall, we don't expect a significant change in the level of our core operating earnings. Yes. Tracy, that was done by a private party, and it did involve a number of people in the industry. We're not at liberty to disclose who was in there. That's proprietary information of the study. So that's about what I can tell you. Yes. During the quarter, we did have some favorable items. We did have an FX gain that was helpful this quarter. We did have some other lower expenses and then there is some timing. And we do expect to have seasonally higher expenses in the second half of the year. But given where we are in the first half, we would expect to be modestly below the 1.650 billion guidance that we originally gave."

As you might expect, it's been more challenging to recruit in a pandemic environment. It's actually a little bit harder to mentor new hires in this kind of environment. We expect this situation to remain challenging until the pandemic eases. But we would then expect to see improvement in kind of a return to normal beyond the pandemic. I think it's also worth noting that we continue to focus a great deal of energy on expanding our third-party distribution channels across all of our markets."

            "content": "Hey, John, good morning, it's Andy. Ill take your question. Maybe I'll bring it up a level and say that the general effect that we saw during the pandemic was companies really pulled back on switching their benefit plans. As we've come through the pandemic and as hopefully we're coming out the other side, and it's becoming more endemic, we've seen, basically, in the marketplace, a normal level of RFP activity. So things have gotten sort of back to normal. When we talk about our persistency, we're very pleased with our persistency results. And as you would imagine, we track very closely the profitability of the business that we retain versus the profitability of the business that we lose. And part of the secret sauce of managing group insurance businesses is, sometimes addition by subtraction. If we can't get the rates that we want to get to move a case to profitability, we -- our plan and our intention and our follow-through is always to let it go. But we're quite pleased at the persistency levels in the business. Yes, Elyse, this is Andy. I'll take your question. The assumption update does have an ongoing impact on our Individual Life business. It reduces our core earnings capability in the neighborhood of $30 million per quarter. So our core run rate was about $105 million before, so it brings it down to $75 million. What you're seeing in our walk on the slide, remember that we expect to have $20 million of higher underwriting gains seasonally in third quarter of 2022. So if you make that adjustment, that gets you to that 96 baseline. Yes, Elyse, it's Andy. I'll take the question. Let me start by reiterating that we're still very focused on scaling up revenue in each of the distinct product lines in the Assurance IQ platform, as that really is what's required to get the business to achieve profitability. With that said and you sort of pointed to this, there are a number of things that are important to discuss this quarter as we've made really good progress in Medicare Advantage that was somewhat masked. First, we did have a $17 million negative LTV adjustment, that is a direct impact on revenue, that was an adjustment -- assumption adjustment based on our persistency. Second, we saw an impact on the under 65 healthcare business versus the year ago quarter as the Biden administration did not open up a special enrollment period like they did last year. Those two factors really masked a 64% improvement in Medicare Advantage enrollments and a resulting 35% increase in Medicare Advantage Commission revenue versus a year ago quarter. So, we are pleased with the continued underlying fundamental strengthening in the Medicare Advantage product line. The first part of your question is, how we're feeling about our preparation. We're making very good progress in becoming ready for the fourth quarter open enrollment season from an agent preparedness perspective specifically. We've now -- we'll be entering our third year, so we have the benefit of two full cycles underneath us. And candidly, we're seeing great success in hiring agents, partly due to the difficult time that some of the smaller players in the space are having. So, Alex -- Yes, Ken, maybe I'll just jump in and add. I just may bring it up a level back to our intentional strategy to reduce our exposure to traditional variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits to be less than 10% of our enterprise earnings. And so that reduction is very intentional, and it was the two-step process of pivoting and runoff that remains on track. We saw $2.9 billion in runoff this quarter. And then, obviously, the derisking transaction. But the other major part of that was pivot to our FlexGuard chassis, a more simpler design, less volatile design. And we're certainly pleased with the continued strength of those sales. Yes, Jack, it's Andy. I'll take your question on flows. As we've talked about in the past, flows at PGIM will vary quarter-to-quarter. So we stay very focused on the long-term track record. In Q2, third-party net flows were roughly flat as very strong institutional inflows of $8.1 billion were offset by the retail outflows of $8.3 billion. Let me give you some color on that.

But remember that our strategy has been about pivoting and derisking the business. We see selling GUL -- single life GUL in third quarter of 2020 and we began to rotate the product portfolio towards simpler designs, inclusive of variable universal life final expense and simply term. We also have been very much leaned into reducing expenses to make the business more efficient. So as we're doing that, we're seeing the new business sales, where we have a lot of pricing power and we like the positive returns of that block of business that we're putting on, and we're filling that gap that Charlie talked about."

            "name": "Rob Falzon",
            "content": "Thank you, Charlie. I'll provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for our PGIM, US and International Businesses. I'll begin on slide six with our financial results for the second quarter of 2022. Pre-tax adjusted operating income was $872 million or $1.74 per share on an after-tax basis and included a $1.4 billion increase in reserves from our annual assumption update and other refinements. We strengthened our Individual Life reserves, primarily reflecting updates to policyholder behavior and revised mortality assumptions. These updates were based on several industry studies; emerging practices and our own experience, following our well-established annual assumption update process. Current quarter results also included an $852 million gain from completing the sale of PALAC, a legacy block of Variable Annuities. Our GAAP net loss was $1.4 billion lower than our after-tax adjusted operating income, primarily driven by the mark-to-market impact from higher interest rates on derivatives that are used for asset liability management, partially offset by a gain on the full -- on the sale of our full service business. Turning to the operating results of our businesses, excluding the impacts of the annual assumption update and the gain on the sale of PALAC. PGIM, our global investment manager reported lower other related revenues driven by a decrease in seed and co-investment income and incentive fees, as well as lower asset management fees compared to the year ago quarter. Results of our US businesses were lower than the year ago quarter, reflecting lower spread income due to less favorable variable investment income and lower fee income resulting from the decline in equity markets, partially offset by more favorable underwriting. The decrease in earnings in our International Businesses primarily reflected lower earnings from joint venture investments, lower net investment results driven by less favorable variable investment income and less favorable underwriting results, partially offset by business growth. Turning to Slide 7. PGIM, our global active investment manager, has diversified capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed income, alternatives, real estate and equities. PGIM's long-term investment performance remains attractive with 75% to 85% of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last three, five and ten-year periods. PGIM benefited from its diversified business mix, as strong institutional net inflows of $8.1 billion, primarily driven by fixed income, offset retail outflows as investors repositioned their portfolios in a rising rate environment. As the investment engine of Prudential, the success and growth of PGIM and of our US and international insurance and retirement businesses are mutually enhancing. PGIM's asset origination capabilities, investment management expertise and access to institutional and other sources of private capital are our competitive advantage, helping our businesses bring enhanced solutions, innovation and create more value for our customers. Our insurance and retirement businesses in turn, provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated flows and unique access to insurance liabilities that complement its successful third-party track record of growth. PGIM's average fee rate increased due to the successful execution of our strategy, including the continued mix shift toward higher fee strategies in our alternatives and private credit business. As a result, asset management fees decreased by only 6% despite assets under management declining by 11% due to rising rates, widening spreads and equity market depreciation. We continue to grow our alternatives in private credit business, which has assets under management of approximately $230 billion across private credit, real estate equity and debt and private equity secondaries and benefits from our global scale and market-leading positions. Notably, across PGIM's private platform, we deployed nearly $15 billion of capital, up nearly 40% from the year ago quarter, reflecting the continued strong environment for private credit. PGIM also raised nearly $3 billion in new private capital commitments across real estate and private credit. Turning to Slide 8. Our US businesses produced diversified earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income and benefit from our complementary mix of longevity and mortality businesses. We continue to shift our business mix towards higher growth and less market-sensitive products and businesses to transform our capabilities and cost structure and to further expand our addressable markets.  Retirement Strategies achieved solid sales in the second quarter across its institutional and individual lines of business. Institutional stable value sales were $1.6 billion. International reinsurance closed $1.4 billion of longevity reinsurance transactions during the quarter, and US pension risk transfer closed several transactions totaling more than $725 million. Our product pivots in individual retirement have resulted in strong sales of more simplified solutions with nearly $1.5 billion of FlexGuard and FlexGuard Income sales in the second quarter. Our strong FlexGuard sales benefited from implementing a fully digital and automated new business experience. This tech-forward approach helps to maintain our record pace of sales. Our Individual Life sales also reflect our earlier product pivot strategy, with variable life products representing approximately 71% of sales for the quarter. The improved group insurance benefits ratio for the quarter reflects the transition from a pandemic to an endemic phase of COVID, as well as favorable experience in both group life and disability. In addition, we're focused on creating the next generation of financial solutions to serve the diverse needs of a broader range of customers and clients. This quarter, we launched the Prudential simplified issue final expense product on the Assurance platform. Turning to slide nine. Our International Businesses include our Japanese life insurance companies, where we have a differentiated multi-channel distribution model, as well as other businesses aimed at expanding our presence in high-growth emerging markets. In Japan, we are focused on providing high-quality service and expanding our geographic coverage and product offerings. Our needs-based approach and mortality protection focus continue to provide important value to our customers, as we expand our product offerings to meet their evolving needs. And we continue to enhance customer experience and agent support, including through digital tools. For example, this quarter, Gibraltar launched an exclusive website dedicated to teachers to help serve this market. In emerging markets, we are focused on creating a carefully selected portfolio of businesses in regions where customer needs are growing, where there are compelling opportunities to build market-leading businesses and where the Prudential enterprise can add value. In the second quarter, we continued to focus on expanding product and business capabilities in emerging markets to meet the evolving needs of customers. In Brazil, we achieved record sales, driven by the expansion of our third-party distribution channel, where sales increased 120% compared to the year ago quarter, as well as by the continued strength of the Life Planner channel. We established a partnership with Mercado Libre in Latin America to expand access to customers in the region. In the first two weeks following the launch in June, we have sold Life and A&H policies in every state in Brazil. This was accomplished through a fully digital sales, customer service and claims experience. We also continue to expand our wellness platform across Latin America by establishing a partnership with Medife\u0301, a health service provider to 300,000 customers in Argentina. In addition, we are expanding our presence in Africa through an investment in South African-based Alex Forbes, as Charlie discussed earlier. As we look ahead, we're well positioned across our businesses to be a global leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security. We continue to invest in growth businesses and markets, deliver industry-leading customer experiences and create the next generation of financial solutions to better serve the diverse needs of a broad range of customers. And with that, I'll hand it over to Ken."

            "content": "Thank you, Bob, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our second quarter financial results reflect the impact of macroeconomic environments, including the unusual confluence and magnitude of rising interest rates, widening credit spreads, and equity market declines. In addition, we strengthened our individual life reserves as part of our annual review of assumptions, which had a significant impact on our results. This was primarily driven by an increase in our guaranteed universal life reserves. As a reminder, we discontinued single life guaranteed universal life sales in 2020 as part of our strategy to derisk our product mix and we continue to make strategic progress in transforming our businesses to be less market-sensitive and more nimble. We also made additional investments to enhance our long-term sustainable growth. We did this in several ways. First, we significantly reduced our market sensitivity by completing our planned divestitures. Second, we invested in growth businesses and partnerships to address customer needs and expand access to our products and solutions. And third, we continue to advance our cost savings program and now expect to reach our $75 0 million target one year ahead of schedule. We executed on these strategic initiatives with the support of our solid balance sheet. Our strong financial position provides us with the flexibility to navigate through the current macroeconomic conditions, while continuing to invest in the long-term growth of our businesses and return capital to shareholders. We're also confident that our higher rate environment will benefit our businesses over time despite the short-term impacts on our financial performance. I'll now provide an update on the progress of our strategic initiatives. Turning to slide three. We plans to reposition the businesses by reducing market sensitivity and making investments to support long-term sustainable growth. We completed the sales of our full service business and a portion of our traditional variable annuities in April. Together, these divestitures resulted in a $1.5 billion pre-tax gain and further reduce the overall market sensitivity of our businesses by approximately 20%. Moving to our growth investments. We are investing in programmatic acquisitions and partnerships that will help us grow in emerging markets and expand access to investing, insurance and retirement security around the world. In Africa, we completed our acquisition of an initial minority stake in Alex Forbes, a leading provider of financial advice, retirement, investment and wealth management in South Africa. We are now in the process of increasing our stake in the company by up to an additional 18% through a tender offer. In June, we established a partnership with Mercado Libre, the largest e-commerce platform in Latin America with approximately 200 million users. This will enable us to deliver life insurance and accident and health products, tailored to the platform's mass market customer base. At the same time, we are investing in the growth of our products that meet the evolving needs of our customers. Our FlexGuard buffered annuity product recently surpassed $10 billion in sales since launching two years ago. We are also experiencing strong sales from our more recently launched FlexGuard Income offering. Turning to our cost savings initiative on slide four. We now expect to achieve our full $750 million cost savings target in 2022, one year ahead of schedule. We recorded $175 million in cost savings during the second quarter for a total of $725 million of run rate savings to date since 2019. We've also implemented a process of continuous improvement to identify and execute on additional cost savings opportunities in the future. Turning now to slide five. Our robust balance sheet is at the core of all our efforts to transform Prudential to be a leader in expanding access to investing insurance and retirement security around the world. This financial strength also provides the flexibility to balance investing in our businesses with delivering attractive returns to our shareholders. Our robust financial position includes a high-quality, well-diversified investment portfolio, our capital position supports a AA financial strength rating and we had $7 billion in highly liquid assets at the end of the second quarter. During the second quarter, we returned over $800 million to shareholders. And since the beginning of 2021, we have returned a total of $6 billion towards our objective of $11 billion by the end of 2023. Finally, a comment on the environmental, social and governance front. In June, we published our third Annual Sustainability Report, which details the progress of our ESG initiatives, including information on our EEO-1 and pay equity disclosures, commitments to racial equity and achieving net-zero emissions. We believe in transparency and hold ourselves accountable to the commitments detailed in our report. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob for an update on our business performance. Yea, sure. We're seeing a number of different opportunities at this point in the cycle. You're beginning to see other things or some things free up that wouldn't have been there before and at reduced multiple. So it's a good time to have flexibility in order to be able to think about that kind of acquisition. What I would say is, I'll make a couple of observations. The first is our strong balance sheet provides us with the flexibility to manage through whatever macroeconomic conditions we may face as we look forward. And that's going to be an important consideration for us as we go forward. But second, to your point, having a strong balance sheet in a dislocated market means that we can take advantage of opportunities that present themselves. So we're going to be -- we do have a strong balance sheet. We're going to remain flexible with that balance sheet, and we're going to look for opportunities that may present themselves in the current economic environment. Yes. This is Charlie. Let me take that one. It's going to be a combination of both, right? Because in the -- as we've done in the past, we're going to continue to be thoughtful about the deployment of proceeds, especially in light of the macroeconomic conditions, and we've always said we're going to be good stewards of capital. But we're going to -- what we're going to do is to continue to demonstrate a discipline, a consistent and a balanced approach to the redeployment of capital within our businesses for acquisitions and to our shareholders, while fulfilling a commitment to our financial strength by maintaining a strong balance sheet. So, we're going to look at a combination of, again, investment in our businesses, acquisitions, returns to shareholders, but also divestitures if they make sense. And we've always said we'll look at additional divestitures of blocks of business, but only if they make sense. And that's what we're going to do as we go forward. So, it will be -- we'll get to our goals through both addition and potentially subtraction, but it has to make sense on both sides for shareholders. Yes. Let me start, and then Andy, you may want to add some commentary on it. But for the Life business, we still think there's a significant potential for growth in the industry. You have a $12 trillion insurance -- life insurance gap. You have increasing sales as shown by last year's industry, with sales being the best they have been in about two decades. And from an enterprise perspective, the Life business continues to be a really helpful component in balancing our longevity with our mortality. So there's a lot of interconnection with the other businesses along with PGIM, and it's a business that we would like to remain in, but we'll do so very, very carefully as we go forward. Andy? Okay. Thank you very much, and thank you for joining us today. We've made significant progress reducing our market sensitivity, while investing in sustainable long-term growth, advancing our cost savings program and returning capital to shareholders. Looking ahead, we are confident that our strategy, along with our solid financial position will help us deliver an even more meaningful difference in the lives of our customers and delivering value to all our stakeholders, including providing attractive returns to our shareholders, while enabling us to fulfill our vision to become a global leader in expanding access to investing insurance and retirement security. Thank you again for joining us and for your time today."

Now, I'll turn it over to Charlie.\nCharlie Lowrey: Thank you, Bob, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. We delivered solid operating earnings for the first quarter, including strong variable investment income that more than offset the impact of elevated mortality from COVID-19. We have also recently achieved multiple significant milestones in our transformation process to become a higher growth, less market-sensitive and more nimble company. These milestones included continued execution on our plans to reposition our businesses. We completed two key divestitures and announced another programmatic acquisition. We continue to invest in our businesses to further enhance the customer experience and expand solutions to support sustainable long-term growth. And we also further advanced the progress on our $750 million cost savings program. We are pleased with the pace of these initiatives, which are well supported by our rock-solid balance sheet and help us expand access to investing insurance and retirement security for our customers and clients around the world. I'll provide an update on each of these areas before turning it over to Rob and Ken. Moving to Slide 3. At the beginning of April, we successfully completed the divestiture of our full service retirement business and the sale of a significant portion of our legacy variable annuities block. Together, these dispositions reduced the overall market sensitivity of our businesses by approximately 20%, while enabling us to further sharpen our focus on higher growth opportunities, including programmatic M&A and asset management and emerging markets. To that end, we agreed during the quarter to acquire a minority stake in Alexander Forbes, a leading provider of financial advice, retirement, investment and wealth management in South Africa. This deal provides access to essential financial tools and further expands our footprint in a strategically important market. We also continue to focus on enhancing customer experiences and creating solutions to drive sustainable growth across our businesses and to address the evolving needs of our customers. For example, FlexGuard continued to build momentum, and we are excited about its future and our broader suite of complementary annuity products, including FlexGuard Income. In Individual Life, we continue to expand our reach to a broader range of customers and further address the $12 trillion life insurance coverage gap with the introduction of a final expense product. And we are also making similar growth investments to further enhance customer experience and expand solutions across our international businesses. In Japan, we are focusing on evolving our product suite to meet the increasing retirement and inheritance needs of the aging Japan population. In Brazil, we are diversifying our customer offerings with the introduction of a new stand-alone accident and health product. And in China, we introduced Grow Partners, a digital sales platform that we are extending to distribution partners and directly to consumers, beginning with a medical cash benefit plan. Turning to Slide 4. We continue to make steady progress towards achieving our cost savings target of $750 million at the end of 2023, while improving customer experience. During the first quarter, we realized $170 million in cost savings for a total of $680 million of run rate savings to date since 2019. Turning now to Slide 5. Prudential's rock solid balance sheet provides significant financial flexibility to execute on our transformation strategy while returning substantial capital to shareholders. Our robust financial position includes: a high-quality, well-diversified investment portfolio; a capital position that supports a AA financial strength rating; and $3.6 billion in highly liquid assets at the end of the first quarter, as well as over $4 billion of additional proceeds from divestitures that we have already received in the second quarter. In addition to supporting our strategy for sustainable, profitable growth, we remain committed to returning $11 billion of capital to shareholders between 2021 and the end of 2023. As part of this program, we have increased our dividend by 4% in the first quarter of 2022, our 14th consecutive annual dividend increase. Before turning it over to Rob, I'd like to update you on a few of our recent ESG initiatives, which we consider integral to our purpose of solving the financial challenges of our changing world. First, relating to the war in Ukraine. In addition to providing financial assistance to humanitarian and non-profit organizations supporting people impacted by the war, we divested our modest level of Russian financial assets in our investment portfolio. Closer to home, we've adopted a hybrid working model that combines the benefits of in-person collaboration and remote work flexibility to support our employees and help us attract and retain talent. Our hybrid work model will enable us to reduce our total home office properties in the U.S. by approximately 50% over time as we invest in the redesign of 600,000 square feet of office space that will be optimized for collaborative and hybrid work, most of which was completed during the past two years. In addition to helping us achieve our cost savings targets, our real estate and hybrid work strategies are one of the several factors that will contribute to a 2050 net zero emissions target. Alongside these efforts, we are also finding new opportunities to support our home city in Newark, New Jersey, including new investments in local commerce, Live Workspaces for resident small business owners and additional opportunities to foster local home ownership. We look forward to continuing to support the city's revitalization. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob for more specific details on our business performance.\nRob Falzon: Thank you, Charlie. I'll provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for our PGIM, U.S. and international businesses. I'll begin on Slide 6 with our financial results for the first quarter of 2022. Our pretax adjusted operating income was $1.6 billion or $3.17 per share on an after-tax basis and reflected a benefit from variable investment income, which exceeded the net mortality impact from COVID-19. PGIM, our global investment manager had higher asset management fees than the year ago quarter. However, these were more than offset by lower other related revenues as well as investments made to support business growth. Results of our U.S. businesses increased 12% from the year ago quarter and reflected higher net investment spread, including benefits from variable investment income and rising interest rates, more favorable underwriting, primarily due to declining COVID-19-related mortality experience and lower expenses, primarily driven by our cost savings initiatives, partially offset by lower fee income resulting from the runoff of our legacy variable annuities. Earnings in our international businesses decreased by 8%, reflecting lower net investment results, less favorable underwriting results and lower earnings from joint venture investments, partially offset by continued business growth. Turning to Slide 7. PGIM, our top 10 global investment manager has diversified capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed income, alternatives, real estate and equities. PGIM's long-term investment performance remains attractive with more than 84% of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last 3-, 5- and 10-year periods. PGIM experienced third-party net outflows of $4.3 billion in the quarter as institutional net inflows, driven by fixed income and real estate, were more than offset by retail outflows, driven by mutual fund investors rebalancing out of fixed income due to rising rates and inflation expectations. As the investment engine of Prudential, the success and growth of PGIM and of our U.S. and international insurance and retirement businesses are mutually enhancing. PGIM's asset origination capabilities, investment management expertise and access to institutional and other sources of private capital or a competitive advantage, helping our businesses bring enhanced solutions, innovation and more value to our customers. And our insurance and retirement businesses, in turn, provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated flows and unique access to insurance liabilities that complement its successful third-party track record of growth. PGIM's asset management fees increased by 2% compared to the year ago quarter, reflecting positive third-party flows and a continued shift towards higher fee-yielding strategies, including the benefits from recent acquisitions over the past year, partially offset by the impact of rising rates. As rates rise in the near term, investor demand for some fixed income strategies could continue to moderate. However, over the longer term, a stabilized higher rate environment would be a positive for fixed income demand and PGIM's business. We continue to grow our alternatives in private credit business, which has assets under management of approximately $240 billion, across private credit, real estate equity and debt and private equity secondaries, and benefits from our global scale and market-leading capabilities. Notably, across PGIM's private platform, we deployed nearly $10 billion of capital, up 20% from the year ago quarter, reflecting the continued strong environment for both real estate and private credit. Now turning to Slide 8. Our U.S. businesses produced diversified earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income and benefit from our complementary mix of longevity and mortality businesses. We continue to shift our business mix towards higher growth and less market-sensitive products and businesses to transform our capabilities and cost structure and to further expand our addressable markets. Our product pivots have worked well, as demonstrated by strong sales of recently launched simplified solutions. Our FlexGuard and FlexGuard income products represented $1.4 billion or over 90% of total individual annuity sales in the first quarter. We continue to exercise pricing discipline informed by changing market conditions and our sales benefit from having a strong and trusted brand and a highly effective distribution team. Our individual life sales also reflect our earlier product pivot strategy with variable life products representing approximately 70% of sales for the quarter. We also successfully completed the national rollout of our Individual Life Express terms product with a large national distributor and recently launched a final expense product continuing to expand our middle market presence. And we are focused on enhancing customer experience through digital tools, including automated underwriting, resulting in more than 90% utilization for eligible policies in the first quarter of 2022. Our retirement business has market-leading capabilities, which drove funded pension risk transfer sales of $700 million in the quarter. And our group insurance business reflected sales growth of 5% compared to the prior year quarter driven by an increase in supplemental health sales. Turning to Slide 9. Our international businesses include our Japanese life insurance companies, where we have a differentiated multichannel distribution model as well as other businesses aimed at expanding in high-growth emerging markets. In Japan, we are focused on providing high-quality service and expanding our geographic coverage and product offerings. Our needs-based approach and mortality protection focus continue to provide important value to our customers as we expand our product offerings to meet their evolving needs. We continue to enhance customer experience and agent support, including through digital tools. The value we provide customers was recently recognized by the 2022 J.D. Power life insurance customer satisfaction survey. Prudential of Japan was ranked number one in all three categories: contract; servicing; and claims. In emerging markets, we are focused on creating a carefully selected portfolio of businesses in regions where customer needs are growing, where there are compelling opportunities to build market-leading businesses and partnerships and where the Prudential enterprise can add value. In the first quarter, we continued to focus on expanding product and business capabilities in emerging markets to meet the evolving needs of our customers. We launched a new accident and health product in the large and growing Brazil market, and continue to expand our wellness platform across Latin America. In addition, as Charlie discussed earlier, we are pleased to expand our presence in Africa with the announcement to acquire a minority interest in Alexander Forbes through our existing partnership with leapfrog investments. As we look ahead, we're well positioned across our businesses to be a global leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security. We plan to continue to invest in growth businesses and markets, deliver industry-leading customer experiences and create the next generation of financial solutions to better serve the diverse needs of a broad range of customers. And with that, I'll hand it over to Ken.\nKen Tanji: Thanks, Rob. I'll begin on Slide 10, which provides insight into earnings for the second quarter of 2022 relative to our first quarter results. Pretax adjusted operating income in the first quarter was $1.6 billion, and resulted in earnings per share of $3.17 on an after-tax basis. To get a sense of how our second quarter results might develop, we suggest adjustments for the following items: first, variable investment income outperformed expectations in the first quarter by $275 million; next, we adjust underwriting experience by a net $165 million. This adjustment includes a placeholder for COVID-19 claims experienced in the second quarter of $40 million for our U.S. businesses based on 25,000 COVID-19-related fatalities in the U.S. and a placeholder of $25 million for our international businesses. While we have provided this placeholder for COVID-19-related claims experience, the actual impact will depend on a variety of factors such as infection and fatality rates, geographic and demographic mix and the effectiveness of vaccines; and last, we expect other items to be $95 million lower in the second quarter, primarily as a result of completing the sales of both our full service retirement business and a block of legacy variable annuities. These items combined get us to a baseline of $2.75 per share for the second quarter. I'll note that if you exclude items specific to the second quarter, earnings per share would be $2.91. A modest decline from recent quarters, primarily from the completed sales of businesses, and the proceeds from these sales will provide flexibility for future capital deployment. I would also note a few other items: first, due to the rise in interest rates, we no longer anticipate a reduction in net investment income from portfolio reinvestment. The benefit from a rising rate environment on our investment income compounds over time as we reinvest our portfolio. However, the reductions in assets under management and related income and our fee-based businesses occurs more immediately. In addition, as a result of our derisking actions, the sensitivity of our adjusted operating income to markets will be reduced by approximately 20% on an annual basis. We also expect to report a gain on the sale of the legacy variable annuity block and adjusted operating income in the second quarter. Impacts from the annual review of actuarial and economic assumptions will also be reported in the second quarter. In accordance with our established practice, we have a comprehensive process that will include, among other things, the review of long-term interest rates, inflation, COVID mortality experience and updated industry data that may impact our assumptions. And finally, as a result of new foreign tax credit regulations, we are expecting an effective tax rate in the range of 21% to 23% for 2022. While we have provided these items to consider, please note there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the second quarter. Turning to Slide 11. We continue to maintain a robust capital position and adequate sources of funding. Our capital position continues to support a AA financial strength rating, and we have substantial sources of funding. Our cash and liquid assets were $3.6 billion and within our $3 billion to $5 billion liquidity target range. And other sources of funds include free cash flow from our businesses, proceeds from divested businesses and contingent capital facilities. Turning to Slide 12 and in summary. We are executing on our plans to reposition our businesses. We are on track to achieve our targeted cost savings and our rock solid balance sheet provides financial flexibility to execute on our transformation and thoughtfully deploy capital. Now, I'll turn it to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Erik Bass from Autonomous Research. Your line is now live.\nErik Bass: Can you provide some more color on the net flow drivers for PGIM in the quarter? And with interest rates continuing to move higher, can you talk about how this is affecting fixed income demand from both retail and institutional clients?\nAndy Sullivan: Sure. Eric, it's Andy. As we've discussed in the past, PGIM flows are going to vary from quarter-to-quarter, and we're very focused and stay focused on our long-term track record. We're very proud of the fact that 18 of the last 19 years, we've had positive third-party flows. In the first quarter, we did experience $4.3 billion in net outflows. It was a challenging quarter for the fixed income U.S. mutual fund industry in general, and we were similarly affected. We saw $4.6 billion of retail outflows, almost entirely driven by retail investor repositioning out of fixed income. On the institutional side, we saw a positive $300 million driven by flows into public fixed income and real estate. We continue to think this is a good proof of our diversification. And on the institutional side, we see algorithms actually positioning into fixed income given the rising rate environment. As we step back, our long-term track record remains very strong. We saw $55 billion in flows between 2017 and 2021, with $27 billion of that being on the retail side. That being said, we do think it's fair to expect continued pressure on the retail fixed income industry as the rates and spreads continue to rise, but that's a near-term effect. As Rob said upfront, higher rates are good after the transitory period for the fixed income business. We're very confident in the fact that we have the right products, the right strategies, exceptional long-term investment performance and great distribution and will be a net winner over time. One thing I wanted to add today, when we talk about flows is more around the private business that Rob talked about given that those are higher fee rate businesses. We continue to benefit from a very strong market for real estate and private credit. We were able to put $9.6 billion to work in the first quarter across real estate at PGIM Private Capital raise another $1.8 billion. So, we are confident in PGIM and confident in a long-term track record.\nErik Bass: I appreciate all the color there. And then, I was hoping that you could talk about the implications of the weaker yen for your Japan business in terms of earnings, capital and the demand for foreign currency-denominated products? And I realize that you're hedged for 2022, but can you just remind us what percentage of your earnings are in yen?\nKen Tanji: Yes. Erik, it's Ken. I'll start off on sort of the financial implications. And you're right, we do have a pretty established and, we think, a very effective hedging program. But first, it's important to know that of our -- because of the success of us in the Japan market with U.S. dollar products, a substantial portion of our reserves and our assets backing those reserves are U.S. dollar-denominated. And that in combination with the fact that as a Japanese company, our expenses are almost exclusively denominated in yen. The combination of that results in our income from our Japan business being mostly -- nearly all of our U.S. -- our income in Japan is U.S. dollar denominated. What income we have denominated in yen, we hedged over three years. And we have a net equity capital hedge position as well. So, it's a long-established hedging approach, and we think it performs well, both from an accounting and economic standpoint.\nErik Bass: Got it. And for the product demand with just -- you sell a lot of foreign countries denominated products start\u2026\nKen Tanji: I'll hand that over to Scott.\nScott Sleyster: Eric, this is Scott. Yes, in the -- it's a little bit of a mixed bag or a dislocation, if you will. But for the most part, the higher U.S. interest rates, which I think are related to the currency is good for demand, as Rob said, and I think it's good for Prudential overall. But as investors in Japan are looking for more attractive yielding products, that's good. In the short run, though, and when the currency moves, it does make the price tag of the purchase a little more expensive. And we have found in the bank channel where there's an intermediary in there. You may see slightly higher surrenders because of the run-up in the dollar. But net-net, we think it's generally a positive for us.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Tom Gallagher from Evercore. Your line is now live.\nTom Gallagher: Ken, a question on the holdco cash and just overall capital generation in the quarter, if I look at the -- it looks like you issued $1 billion of junior debt in the quarter, so that would be an inflow, and you got $300 million of cash from the dispositions, and I guess, $4 billion-plus is still closed after the quarter, but that's $1.3 billion. And then, I look at your holdco cash balance, it didn't change versus 4Q. So, just curious, how I should think about that? It doesn't -- looking at it that way, it doesn't look like there were much in the way of dividends that came up during the quarter. Were there capital needs that came up in the subs? Or is it a timing issue? Can you help us think through like the capital generation in the quarter and what that should look like going forward?\nKen Tanji: Yes, Tom. Yes, we did issue $1 billion of hybrid debt is actually early in the quarter and before the rise in rates and before the spreads widened out. So we're happy with that execution. And that's part of our process to prefund upcoming debt that we would like to either -- that's either maturing or we're going to call. And we do have about $1 billion of hybrid debt that's going to be callable in September. So, we sort of earmarked that $1 billion for that purpose. Liquid assets at the holding company will fluctuate due to timing. Typically, that's within our $3 billion to $5 billion target. But in the first quarter, as is in typical with most first quarters for us, subsidiary dividends and cash flow were low, and then they tend to be greater in the second part of the year. And so, part of that is just timing. But we also did make a capital contribution to a new reinsurance subsidiary that we have -- that we've established in Bermuda in the first quarter. And that will give us the ability to reinsure policies from PICA, our U.S. insurance company to that new subsidiary, to give us more economic reserving and greater capital efficiency over time. So, over time, it was -- it did require some capital to initially fund -- but over time, we feel good about that in terms of giving us much more balance sheet efficiency going forward? And then also just keep in mind, we did receive $4 billion from the sale of full service and PALAC in April.\nTom Gallagher: Got you. And just a follow-up there, Ken. Can you comment on the size of the new reinsurance vehicle that's, I guess, ranged on the captive that you referenced?\nKen Tanji: Yes. We initially capitalized it with $800 million. So that was the amount of initial capital that we put in. And although it's a requirement now, it's actually going to provide capital efficiency in the future. So you can think about that as a net positive to our capital efficiency over time.\nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Suneet Kamath from Jefferies. Your line is now live.\nSuneet Kamath: Great. First question just on strategy. I guess, Charlie, we've been talking about this objective of improving the earnings contribution from growth businesses to, I guess, over 30%. And we're a year into the strategy and haven't really seen that move all that much, at least based on the way we're calculating it. So my question is, is the plan to still sort of get there over the next couple of years? And is it going to take something more than programmatic M&A in order to accomplish that?\nCharlie Lowrey: Sure. So, we can't control the markets, but this is -- we look at it as both a numerator and a denominator issue. And we're continuing to make progress on both -- through both the acquisitions we've made, the four acquisitions we've made over the past year and the dispositions that we just completed. And so, you've seen that we've made progress with the four acquisitions and the two major dispositions. And we'll continue to execute on the strategy. We have a sense of urgency. We're going to make progress as we go forward, and we'll make progress in both ways.\nSuneet Kamath: And can you give us a sense on the timing of the use of the $4 billion of proceeds? Obviously, we could think about a couple of different buckets, right, M&A and/or capital return to shareholders. But now that these deals have closed, sort of over what time frame would you like to use that capital?\nCharlie Lowrey: Yes. Sure. So as I hope you've seen, we are operating with a sense of urgency, right? Speed is important, but we don't have a specific time ban per se. So, we're going to remain prudent stewards of capital, as we've said, and continue to evaluate programmatic acquisitions. But as we've also said and as we've done in the past, we'll return capital to shareholders if we can't find the appropriate opportunities over time. So, we're going to continue on our process. But as you've seen, we have returned capital to shareholders, and we'll continue to operate in that fashion.\nSuneet Kamath: Got it. If I could just sneak one more in for Ken or Rob. When we think about the individual annuity business, I think in the past, specifically thinking about the highest daily value product, I think the commentary you guys gave in the past is a rising interest rate environment, coupled with a falling equity market environment is generally not great for that business, which is the environment, obviously, we're sitting in today. So can you just talk about from a risk management perspective, how that business is holding up in this environment?\nKen Tanji: Yes. Suneet, this is Ken. We've very well capitalized and reserved our business, and we have a highly effective hedging program. And that has been very effective of mitigating market impacts, both from equity markets and interest rates. And so, -- and it continues -- it was continued to be very effective in the quarter. So no change there.\nOperator: Your next question today is coming from John Barnidge from Piper Sandler. Your line is now live.\nJohn Barnidge: Expense ratios in both group disability and group life insurance decline. I know that some of the source of the expense saves programs, but you're also building the service COVID claims. Can you maybe dimension some of the improvement in admin expenses there between those two?\nAndy Sullivan: Sure, John. It's Andy. So our admin expense ratio for the quarter was 15.6%. That was almost a 4% improvement from Q4, but was basically flat from Q1 of last year. I would just keep in mind, fourth quarter was elevated by some one-time compensation expenses, so there's some seasonality effects going on. We are starting to see the beginnings of our core expense improvement of impacting our businesses. When I think about that, I would say the expense saves are more attributable to the overall expense work. The incidents and severity in the business remain elevated, even though they have started to come back towards normal, they remain elevated, and we maintain the higher level of staffing in both our claim and our call centers. So, we would expect that the admin ratio will stay elevated for the remainder of the year.\nJohn Barnidge: Great. And then my follow-up question. Can you talk about maybe how higher rates have changed the conversation around pension risk transfer activity with potential counterparties?\nAndy Sullivan: So, John, it's Andy. So, we -- maybe let me talk about the current quarter and then I'll go into looking forward. So, as you're aware, this is a very transaction-oriented business. And first quarter tends to be light, and that's kind of what we saw with the industry. We think the first quarter was somewhere around $5.3 billion. We were very pleased, as Rob said, that we did two deals for $700 million. Overall, as we look forward for the rest of the year, we believe it's going to be a strong year, and I think the overall industry level should clock in around $40 billion. The fact is, funded status hit a record high in February of 102%. And if you add on top of that, the rise in rates and then the volatile environment that we're in, all of that bolsters sponsors' desire and proclivity to transact. So this is a big market that it has become more competitive, but we know that we could pick our spots and be disciplined and net-net, will grow over time.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Tracy Benguigui from Barclays. Your line is now live.\nTracy Benguigui: I'm wondering if your intolerance of interest rate sensitive business changed at all considering the 10-year is nearly 3% may go up from here? Like are you thinking at all about increasing the portion of spread-based business going forward?\nRob Falzon: Tracy, it's Rob. Let me take a stab at that. First, to your point, yes, rising interest rates are a good thing. They're a good thing for the industry and they're a good thing for us as a company, both because it allows us to be more competitive in providing a value proposition to our customers and our products and also because it has a positive impact on our portfolio yield. Having said that, it is our desire to have a mix of businesses and products that are less market-sensitive and less market-sensitive across market cycles. So our focus is on trying to operate at the intersection of both shareholder and customer value propositions that are sustainable throughout cycles. If you're asking about how we think about the impact of higher interest rates on the long-term reversion rate that we have in our assumptions, obviously, that drives pricing and valuation. We do our assumption updates in the second quarter, probably not something -- anything specific we can say about that. But maybe I'll turn it over to Ken and he can comment more generally.\nKen Tanji: Yes. Thanks, Rob. Yes. The long-term interest rates and our assumptions are something that we do look at in our assumption updates annually. We do that by looking at multiple perspectives sort of from an array of economists and banks and asset managers. We also look at the forward curve, which as you know, has increased recently. And we set our assumption kind of close to the median of that. And also with our assumption update, inflation has risen. We factor near-term inflation into our reserve setting as well as for long-term inflation as well. And then part of our assumption update will obviously cover mortality and other policyholder behavior as well, including not just our own experience, but anything we get in terms of new data from other sources in the industry. We did recently receive a new industry study that indicates experience is more adverse in some of our assumptions of our U.S. life insurance business. We're evaluating this information and its applicability to our business. And to the extent that it would cause an increase in reserves or a decline in earnings. So, that -- all that work is underway, it will conclude later in the quarter, and that will be part of what we report in the second quarter.\nTracy Benguigui: Okay. Great. I'm also wondering as unfavorable FX impacts change your view right now on increasing international business through M&A.\nScott Sleyster: Tracy, this is Scott. I'll go ahead and take that one. I guess in the short answer, I'd say, not really. We're seeking to build out a well-diversified emerging markets portfolio of businesses. And we see local currency weakness as an opportunity to improve our U.S. dollar purchase economics, if you will. But that being said, we do factor in the potential for currency risk over time by using risk-adjusted discount rates in our valuation estimates when we think about these businesses. So I would say if you take a step back, we'd actually say, it's a net positive.\nTracy Benguigui: Okay. Sorry, if I could just sneak one quick one, that mention of that reinsurance entity established in Bermuda for the type of business. I'm just wondering, is that reinsurance flow or the back book? Is that being reinsured?\nKen Tanji: Initially, we're going to use it for reinsuring some of our in-force business, but we are gaining experience in Bermuda and our ability to use it -- we will be considering strategies, potentially, for flow in the future.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\nAlex Goldman: I had a follow-up just on Suneet's question and the answer there. And when you mentioned that the business mix shift, part of it's the denominator, I guess -- I think part of that is also being communicated is the runoff of the annuities business over time or at least the sort of more legacy piece of the annuities business. And now that, that transaction is closed, I was just wondering if you could give us a more firm way to think about how we should expect the earnings power to run off or whether some of the new product growth can offset that?\nKen Tanji: Alex, it's Ken. Yes, our traditional -- we've -- we're no longer issuing traditional variable annuities. So it is running off. And after our -- the sale of about 20% of our block of business with PALAC, it will continue to run off at about $3 billion a quarter is what you saw in the quarter. So, you can kind of think about that as kind of $12 billion to $15 billion a year, and that's about an 8% runoff a year. So that, combined with the PALAC business that was 20%, that over time will get us very close to our objective to reducing our income from traditional variable annuities, and having said that, we would think about other ways to do that as well.\nAlex Goldman: Got it. And then I had one more follow-up to the response on the impact of interest rates, particularly your comments on the actuarial review. The inflation impact that you mentioned, I assume that's probably long-term care and the reimbursement style policies. Could you help us think through the sensitivity to that? I mean, you've provided a lot of sensitivity around long-term care. And so, we have all of that around changes in discount rates and new money yields and so forth. But the inflation one, I've struggled to put my finger on. So even if it's just relative to rates, which is the bigger factor, any kind of commentary you can provide to help us think through that would be useful.\nKen Tanji: Yes, Alex. Yes, long-term care is probably where that's most relevant in terms of inflation. We have factored in inflation, obviously, into our reserves including increases in near term, it's -- long-term inflation would be where it's more sensitive. We have provided some of those sensitivities. So -- and overall, we think it's very manageable for us.\nOperator: Your next question today is coming from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\nElyse Greenspan: My first question is on Assurance IQ. You guys took a goodwill impairment there in the fourth quarter. And I believe at the time, you mentioned that part of the rationale for that was the lower valuation of the public peers. I noticed you didn't take another charge this quarter, and the peers have rerated subsequently lower from a few months ago. Was that to contemplate it when you took the charge in the fourth quarter? Or any update you can give us there?\nKen Tanji: Yes. The charge that we took in the fourth quarter was relevant to the environment at the end of the fourth quarter. We again did a qualitative review of our -- the value of our insurance goodwill and assurance, and we did not need any further impairment. So that's where that stands.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. And then my second question, the group disability loss ratio was pretty strong in the quarter. Can we just get some more color there and just how you expect that to trend over the balance of the year?\nAndy Sullivan: Yes. Elyse, it's Andy. We very much obviously like the improvement that we saw in the disability business this quarter. It was our best benefit ratio since 2018 at 73.4%. I would frame this as what we've seen in disability, it continues to behave as we would expect and what we have been preparing for. And you always need to split this into the two different impacts. The one impact on the absence and STD side, on that side, we do continue to see a very high level of COVID-related claims. That, in general, turns into the need for the elevated staffing and claim and call. And because those are fee-oriented businesses, it shows up in our more from an elevated admin ratio perspective. We're going to stay the course on that staffing because being there for our customers is critically important in job one. On the long-term disability side, as I mentioned earlier, we are beginning to see both incidents and severity trend back downward in the business. You'll recall the previous two quarters both of those were up about 10% in Q3 and Q4. But on top of that, our claims teams are also experiencing very good claims resolutions. And what we're hearing from our claims managers is the combination of very low unemployment at 3.8% and wage inflation accelerating, there's a strong desire for claimants to get back to the productive workforce. So, in all, we're very pleased with the claims team's performance, and we're obviously happy to see the beginnings of an improvement in the environment.\nOperator: We reach end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Charlie for any further closing comments.\nCharlie Lowrey: All right. Thank you very much, and thank you all for joining us today. We continue to make significant progress on repositioning our business mix and advancing our cost savings program to transform Prudential into a higher growth, less market-sensitive and more nimble company. We're confident this strategy will help us deliver an even more meaningful difference in the lives of our customers and sustain value for our shareholders, while enabling us to fulfill our vision of becoming a global leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security. Thanks again for your time today.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Charlie Lowrey",
            "content": "Thank you, Bob, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. We delivered solid operating earnings for the first quarter, including strong variable investment income that more than offset the impact of elevated mortality from COVID-19. We have also recently achieved multiple significant milestones in our transformation process to become a higher growth, less market-sensitive and more nimble company. These milestones included continued execution on our plans to reposition our businesses. We completed two key divestitures and announced another programmatic acquisition. We continue to invest in our businesses to further enhance the customer experience and expand solutions to support sustainable long-term growth. And we also further advanced the progress on our $750 million cost savings program. We are pleased with the pace of these initiatives, which are well supported by our rock-solid balance sheet and help us expand access to investing insurance and retirement security for our customers and clients around the world. I'll provide an update on each of these areas before turning it over to Rob and Ken. Moving to Slide 3. At the beginning of April, we successfully completed the divestiture of our full service retirement business and the sale of a significant portion of our legacy variable annuities block. Together, these dispositions reduced the overall market sensitivity of our businesses by approximately 20%, while enabling us to further sharpen our focus on higher growth opportunities, including programmatic M&A and asset management and emerging markets. To that end, we agreed during the quarter to acquire a minority stake in Alexander Forbes, a leading provider of financial advice, retirement, investment and wealth management in South Africa. This deal provides access to essential financial tools and further expands our footprint in a strategically important market. We also continue to focus on enhancing customer experiences and creating solutions to drive sustainable growth across our businesses and to address the evolving needs of our customers. For example, FlexGuard continued to build momentum, and we are excited about its future and our broader suite of complementary annuity products, including FlexGuard Income. In Individual Life, we continue to expand our reach to a broader range of customers and further address the $12 trillion life insurance coverage gap with the introduction of a final expense product. And we are also making similar growth investments to further enhance customer experience and expand solutions across our international businesses. In Japan, we are focusing on evolving our product suite to meet the increasing retirement and inheritance needs of the aging Japan population. In Brazil, we are diversifying our customer offerings with the introduction of a new stand-alone accident and health product. And in China, we introduced Grow Partners, a digital sales platform that we are extending to distribution partners and directly to consumers, beginning with a medical cash benefit plan. Turning to Slide 4. We continue to make steady progress towards achieving our cost savings target of $750 million at the end of 2023, while improving customer experience. During the first quarter, we realized $170 million in cost savings for a total of $680 million of run rate savings to date since 2019. Turning now to Slide 5. Prudential's rock solid balance sheet provides significant financial flexibility to execute on our transformation strategy while returning substantial capital to shareholders. Our robust financial position includes: a high-quality, well-diversified investment portfolio; a capital position that supports a AA financial strength rating; and $3.6 billion in highly liquid assets at the end of the first quarter, as well as over $4 billion of additional proceeds from divestitures that we have already received in the second quarter. In addition to supporting our strategy for sustainable, profitable growth, we remain committed to returning $11 billion of capital to shareholders between 2021 and the end of 2023. As part of this program, we have increased our dividend by 4% in the first quarter of 2022, our 14th consecutive annual dividend increase. Before turning it over to Rob, I'd like to update you on a few of our recent ESG initiatives, which we consider integral to our purpose of solving the financial challenges of our changing world. First, relating to the war in Ukraine. In addition to providing financial assistance to humanitarian and non-profit organizations supporting people impacted by the war, we divested our modest level of Russian financial assets in our investment portfolio. Closer to home, we've adopted a hybrid working model that combines the benefits of in-person collaboration and remote work flexibility to support our employees and help us attract and retain talent. Our hybrid work model will enable us to reduce our total home office properties in the U.S. by approximately 50% over time as we invest in the redesign of 600,000 square feet of office space that will be optimized for collaborative and hybrid work, most of which was completed during the past two years. In addition to helping us achieve our cost savings targets, our real estate and hybrid work strategies are one of the several factors that will contribute to a 2050 net zero emissions target. Alongside these efforts, we are also finding new opportunities to support our home city in Newark, New Jersey, including new investments in local commerce, Live Workspaces for resident small business owners and additional opportunities to foster local home ownership. We look forward to continuing to support the city's revitalization. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob for more specific details on our business performance. Sure. So, we can't control the markets, but this is -- we look at it as both a numerator and a denominator issue. And we're continuing to make progress on both -- through both the acquisitions we've made, the four acquisitions we've made over the past year and the dispositions that we just completed. And so, you've seen that we've made progress with the four acquisitions and the two major dispositions. And we'll continue to execute on the strategy. We have a sense of urgency. We're going to make progress as we go forward, and we'll make progress in both ways. Yes. Sure. So as I hope you've seen, we are operating with a sense of urgency, right? Speed is important, but we don't have a specific time ban per se. So, we're going to remain prudent stewards of capital, as we've said, and continue to evaluate programmatic acquisitions. But as we've also said and as we've done in the past, we'll return capital to shareholders if we can't find the appropriate opportunities over time. So, we're going to continue on our process. But as you've seen, we have returned capital to shareholders, and we'll continue to operate in that fashion. All right. Thank you very much, and thank you all for joining us today. We continue to make significant progress on repositioning our business mix and advancing our cost savings program to transform Prudential into a higher growth, less market-sensitive and more nimble company. We're confident this strategy will help us deliver an even more meaningful difference in the lives of our customers and sustain value for our shareholders, while enabling us to fulfill our vision of becoming a global leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security. Thanks again for your time today."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Ken Tanji",
            "content": "Thanks, Rob. I'll begin on Slide 10, which provides insight into earnings for the second quarter of 2022 relative to our first quarter results. Pretax adjusted operating income in the first quarter was $1.6 billion, and resulted in earnings per share of $3.17 on an after-tax basis. To get a sense of how our second quarter results might develop, we suggest adjustments for the following items: first, variable investment income outperformed expectations in the first quarter by $275 million; next, we adjust underwriting experience by a net $165 million. This adjustment includes a placeholder for COVID-19 claims experienced in the second quarter of $40 million for our U.S. businesses based on 25,000 COVID-19-related fatalities in the U.S. and a placeholder of $25 million for our international businesses. While we have provided this placeholder for COVID-19-related claims experience, the actual impact will depend on a variety of factors such as infection and fatality rates, geographic and demographic mix and the effectiveness of vaccines; and last, we expect other items to be $95 million lower in the second quarter, primarily as a result of completing the sales of both our full service retirement business and a block of legacy variable annuities. These items combined get us to a baseline of $2.75 per share for the second quarter. I'll note that if you exclude items specific to the second quarter, earnings per share would be $2.91. A modest decline from recent quarters, primarily from the completed sales of businesses, and the proceeds from these sales will provide flexibility for future capital deployment. I would also note a few other items: first, due to the rise in interest rates, we no longer anticipate a reduction in net investment income from portfolio reinvestment. The benefit from a rising rate environment on our investment income compounds over time as we reinvest our portfolio. However, the reductions in assets under management and related income and our fee-based businesses occurs more immediately. In addition, as a result of our derisking actions, the sensitivity of our adjusted operating income to markets will be reduced by approximately 20% on an annual basis. We also expect to report a gain on the sale of the legacy variable annuity block and adjusted operating income in the second quarter. Impacts from the annual review of actuarial and economic assumptions will also be reported in the second quarter. In accordance with our established practice, we have a comprehensive process that will include, among other things, the review of long-term interest rates, inflation, COVID mortality experience and updated industry data that may impact our assumptions. And finally, as a result of new foreign tax credit regulations, we are expecting an effective tax rate in the range of 21% to 23% for 2022. While we have provided these items to consider, please note there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the second quarter. Turning to Slide 11. We continue to maintain a robust capital position and adequate sources of funding. Our capital position continues to support a AA financial strength rating, and we have substantial sources of funding. Our cash and liquid assets were $3.6 billion and within our $3 billion to $5 billion liquidity target range. And other sources of funds include free cash flow from our businesses, proceeds from divested businesses and contingent capital facilities. Turning to Slide 12 and in summary. We are executing on our plans to reposition our businesses. We are on track to achieve our targeted cost savings and our rock solid balance sheet provides financial flexibility to execute on our transformation and thoughtfully deploy capital. Now, I'll turn it to the operator for your questions. Yes. Erik, it's Ken. I'll start off on sort of the financial implications. And you're right, we do have a pretty established and, we think, a very effective hedging program. But first, it's important to know that of our -- because of the success of us in the Japan market with U.S. dollar products, a substantial portion of our reserves and our assets backing those reserves are U.S. dollar-denominated. And that in combination with the fact that as a Japanese company, our expenses are almost exclusively denominated in yen. The combination of that results in our income from our Japan business being mostly -- nearly all of our U.S. -- our income in Japan is U.S. dollar denominated. What income we have denominated in yen, we hedged over three years. And we have a net equity capital hedge position as well. So, it's a long-established hedging approach, and we think it performs well, both from an accounting and economic standpoint. I'll hand that over to Scott. Yes, Tom. Yes, we did issue $1 billion of hybrid debt is actually early in the quarter and before the rise in rates and before the spreads widened out. So we're happy with that execution. And that's part of our process to prefund upcoming debt that we would like to either -- that's either maturing or we're going to call. And we do have about $1 billion of hybrid debt that's going to be callable in September. So, we sort of earmarked that $1 billion for that purpose. Liquid assets at the holding company will fluctuate due to timing. Typically, that's within our $3 billion to $5 billion target. But in the first quarter, as is in typical with most first quarters for us, subsidiary dividends and cash flow were low, and then they tend to be greater in the second part of the year. And so, part of that is just timing. But we also did make a capital contribution to a new reinsurance subsidiary that we have -- that we've established in Bermuda in the first quarter. And that will give us the ability to reinsure policies from PICA, our U.S. insurance company to that new subsidiary, to give us more economic reserving and greater capital efficiency over time. So, over time, it was -- it did require some capital to initially fund -- but over time, we feel good about that in terms of giving us much more balance sheet efficiency going forward? And then also just keep in mind, we did receive $4 billion from the sale of full service and PALAC in April. Yes. We initially capitalized it with $800 million. So that was the amount of initial capital that we put in. And although it's a requirement now, it's actually going to provide capital efficiency in the future. So you can think about that as a net positive to our capital efficiency over time. Yes. Suneet, this is Ken. We've very well capitalized and reserved our business, and we have a highly effective hedging program. And that has been very effective of mitigating market impacts, both from equity markets and interest rates. And so, -- and it continues -- it was continued to be very effective in the quarter. So no change there. Yes. Thanks, Rob. Yes. The long-term interest rates and our assumptions are something that we do look at in our assumption updates annually. We do that by looking at multiple perspectives sort of from an array of economists and banks and asset managers. We also look at the forward curve, which as you know, has increased recently. And we set our assumption kind of close to the median of that. And also with our assumption update, inflation has risen. We factor near-term inflation into our reserve setting as well as for long-term inflation as well. And then part of our assumption update will obviously cover mortality and other policyholder behavior as well, including not just our own experience, but anything we get in terms of new data from other sources in the industry. We did recently receive a new industry study that indicates experience is more adverse in some of our assumptions of our U.S. life insurance business. We're evaluating this information and its applicability to our business. And to the extent that it would cause an increase in reserves or a decline in earnings. So, that -- all that work is underway, it will conclude later in the quarter, and that will be part of what we report in the second quarter. Initially, we're going to use it for reinsuring some of our in-force business, but we are gaining experience in Bermuda and our ability to use it -- we will be considering strategies, potentially, for flow in the future. Alex, it's Ken. Yes, our traditional -- we've -- we're no longer issuing traditional variable annuities. So it is running off. And after our -- the sale of about 20% of our block of business with PALAC, it will continue to run off at about $3 billion a quarter is what you saw in the quarter. So, you can kind of think about that as kind of $12 billion to $15 billion a year, and that's about an 8% runoff a year. So that, combined with the PALAC business that was 20%, that over time will get us very close to our objective to reducing our income from traditional variable annuities, and having said that, we would think about other ways to do that as well. Yes, Alex. Yes, long-term care is probably where that's most relevant in terms of inflation. We have factored in inflation, obviously, into our reserves including increases in near term, it's -- long-term inflation would be where it's more sensitive. We have provided some of those sensitivities. So -- and overall, we think it's very manageable for us. Yes. The charge that we took in the fourth quarter was relevant to the environment at the end of the fourth quarter. We again did a qualitative review of our -- the value of our insurance goodwill and assurance, and we did not need any further impairment. So that's where that stands."

            "name": "Andy Sullivan",
            "content": "Sure. Eric, it's Andy. As we've discussed in the past, PGIM flows are going to vary from quarter-to-quarter, and we're very focused and stay focused on our long-term track record. We're very proud of the fact that 18 of the last 19 years, we've had positive third-party flows. In the first quarter, we did experience $4.3 billion in net outflows. It was a challenging quarter for the fixed income U.S. mutual fund industry in general, and we were similarly affected. We saw $4.6 billion of retail outflows, almost entirely driven by retail investor repositioning out of fixed income. On the institutional side, we saw a positive $300 million driven by flows into public fixed income and real estate. We continue to think this is a good proof of our diversification. And on the institutional side, we see algorithms actually positioning into fixed income given the rising rate environment. As we step back, our long-term track record remains very strong. We saw $55 billion in flows between 2017 and 2021, with $27 billion of that being on the retail side. That being said, we do think it's fair to expect continued pressure on the retail fixed income industry as the rates and spreads continue to rise, but that's a near-term effect. As Rob said upfront, higher rates are good after the transitory period for the fixed income business. We're very confident in the fact that we have the right products, the right strategies, exceptional long-term investment performance and great distribution and will be a net winner over time. One thing I wanted to add today, when we talk about flows is more around the private business that Rob talked about given that those are higher fee rate businesses. We continue to benefit from a very strong market for real estate and private credit. We were able to put $9.6 billion to work in the first quarter across real estate at PGIM Private Capital raise another $1.8 billion. So, we are confident in PGIM and confident in a long-term track record. Sure, John. It's Andy. So our admin expense ratio for the quarter was 15.6%. That was almost a 4% improvement from Q4, but was basically flat from Q1 of last year. I would just keep in mind, fourth quarter was elevated by some one-time compensation expenses, so there's some seasonality effects going on. We are starting to see the beginnings of our core expense improvement of impacting our businesses. When I think about that, I would say the expense saves are more attributable to the overall expense work. The incidents and severity in the business remain elevated, even though they have started to come back towards normal, they remain elevated, and we maintain the higher level of staffing in both our claim and our call centers. So, we would expect that the admin ratio will stay elevated for the remainder of the year. So, John, it's Andy. So, we -- maybe let me talk about the current quarter and then I'll go into looking forward. So, as you're aware, this is a very transaction-oriented business. And first quarter tends to be light, and that's kind of what we saw with the industry. We think the first quarter was somewhere around $5.3 billion. We were very pleased, as Rob said, that we did two deals for $700 million. Overall, as we look forward for the rest of the year, we believe it's going to be a strong year, and I think the overall industry level should clock in around $40 billion. The fact is, funded status hit a record high in February of 102%. And if you add on top of that, the rise in rates and then the volatile environment that we're in, all of that bolsters sponsors' desire and proclivity to transact. So this is a big market that it has become more competitive, but we know that we could pick our spots and be disciplined and net-net, will grow over time. Yes. Elyse, it's Andy. We very much obviously like the improvement that we saw in the disability business this quarter. It was our best benefit ratio since 2018 at 73.4%. I would frame this as what we've seen in disability, it continues to behave as we would expect and what we have been preparing for. And you always need to split this into the two different impacts. The one impact on the absence and STD side, on that side, we do continue to see a very high level of COVID-related claims. That, in general, turns into the need for the elevated staffing and claim and call. And because those are fee-oriented businesses, it shows up in our more from an elevated admin ratio perspective. We're going to stay the course on that staffing because being there for our customers is critically important in job one. On the long-term disability side, as I mentioned earlier, we are beginning to see both incidents and severity trend back downward in the business. You'll recall the previous two quarters both of those were up about 10% in Q3 and Q4. But on top of that, our claims teams are also experiencing very good claims resolutions. And what we're hearing from our claims managers is the combination of very low unemployment at 3.8% and wage inflation accelerating, there's a strong desire for claimants to get back to the productive workforce. So, in all, we're very pleased with the claims team's performance, and we're obviously happy to see the beginnings of an improvement in the environment."

            "content": "Thank you, Charlie. I'll provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for our PGIM, U.S. and international businesses. I'll begin on Slide 6 with our financial results for the first quarter of 2022. Our pretax adjusted operating income was $1.6 billion or $3.17 per share on an after-tax basis and reflected a benefit from variable investment income, which exceeded the net mortality impact from COVID-19. PGIM, our global investment manager had higher asset management fees than the year ago quarter. However, these were more than offset by lower other related revenues as well as investments made to support business growth. Results of our U.S. businesses increased 12% from the year ago quarter and reflected higher net investment spread, including benefits from variable investment income and rising interest rates, more favorable underwriting, primarily due to declining COVID-19-related mortality experience and lower expenses, primarily driven by our cost savings initiatives, partially offset by lower fee income resulting from the runoff of our legacy variable annuities. Earnings in our international businesses decreased by 8%, reflecting lower net investment results, less favorable underwriting results and lower earnings from joint venture investments, partially offset by continued business growth. Turning to Slide 7. PGIM, our top 10 global investment manager has diversified capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed income, alternatives, real estate and equities. PGIM's long-term investment performance remains attractive with more than 84% of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last 3-, 5- and 10-year periods. PGIM experienced third-party net outflows of $4.3 billion in the quarter as institutional net inflows, driven by fixed income and real estate, were more than offset by retail outflows, driven by mutual fund investors rebalancing out of fixed income due to rising rates and inflation expectations. As the investment engine of Prudential, the success and growth of PGIM and of our U.S. and international insurance and retirement businesses are mutually enhancing. PGIM's asset origination capabilities, investment management expertise and access to institutional and other sources of private capital or a competitive advantage, helping our businesses bring enhanced solutions, innovation and more value to our customers. And our insurance and retirement businesses, in turn, provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated flows and unique access to insurance liabilities that complement its successful third-party track record of growth. PGIM's asset management fees increased by 2% compared to the year ago quarter, reflecting positive third-party flows and a continued shift towards higher fee-yielding strategies, including the benefits from recent acquisitions over the past year, partially offset by the impact of rising rates. As rates rise in the near term, investor demand for some fixed income strategies could continue to moderate. However, over the longer term, a stabilized higher rate environment would be a positive for fixed income demand and PGIM's business. We continue to grow our alternatives in private credit business, which has assets under management of approximately $240 billion, across private credit, real estate equity and debt and private equity secondaries, and benefits from our global scale and market-leading capabilities. Notably, across PGIM's private platform, we deployed nearly $10 billion of capital, up 20% from the year ago quarter, reflecting the continued strong environment for both real estate and private credit. Now turning to Slide 8. Our U.S. businesses produced diversified earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income and benefit from our complementary mix of longevity and mortality businesses. We continue to shift our business mix towards higher growth and less market-sensitive products and businesses to transform our capabilities and cost structure and to further expand our addressable markets. Our product pivots have worked well, as demonstrated by strong sales of recently launched simplified solutions. Our FlexGuard and FlexGuard income products represented $1.4 billion or over 90% of total individual annuity sales in the first quarter. We continue to exercise pricing discipline informed by changing market conditions and our sales benefit from having a strong and trusted brand and a highly effective distribution team. Our individual life sales also reflect our earlier product pivot strategy with variable life products representing approximately 70% of sales for the quarter. We also successfully completed the national rollout of our Individual Life Express terms product with a large national distributor and recently launched a final expense product continuing to expand our middle market presence. And we are focused on enhancing customer experience through digital tools, including automated underwriting, resulting in more than 90% utilization for eligible policies in the first quarter of 2022. Our retirement business has market-leading capabilities, which drove funded pension risk transfer sales of $700 million in the quarter. And our group insurance business reflected sales growth of 5% compared to the prior year quarter driven by an increase in supplemental health sales. Turning to Slide 9. Our international businesses include our Japanese life insurance companies, where we have a differentiated multichannel distribution model as well as other businesses aimed at expanding in high-growth emerging markets. In Japan, we are focused on providing high-quality service and expanding our geographic coverage and product offerings. Our needs-based approach and mortality protection focus continue to provide important value to our customers as we expand our product offerings to meet their evolving needs. We continue to enhance customer experience and agent support, including through digital tools. The value we provide customers was recently recognized by the 2022 J.D. Power life insurance customer satisfaction survey. Prudential of Japan was ranked number one in all three categories: contract; servicing; and claims. In emerging markets, we are focused on creating a carefully selected portfolio of businesses in regions where customer needs are growing, where there are compelling opportunities to build market-leading businesses and partnerships and where the Prudential enterprise can add value. In the first quarter, we continued to focus on expanding product and business capabilities in emerging markets to meet the evolving needs of our customers. We launched a new accident and health product in the large and growing Brazil market, and continue to expand our wellness platform across Latin America. In addition, as Charlie discussed earlier, we are pleased to expand our presence in Africa with the announcement to acquire a minority interest in Alexander Forbes through our existing partnership with leapfrog investments. As we look ahead, we're well positioned across our businesses to be a global leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security. We plan to continue to invest in growth businesses and markets, deliver industry-leading customer experiences and create the next generation of financial solutions to better serve the diverse needs of a broad range of customers. And with that, I'll hand it over to Ken. Tracy, it's Rob. Let me take a stab at that. First, to your point, yes, rising interest rates are a good thing. They're a good thing for the industry and they're a good thing for us as a company, both because it allows us to be more competitive in providing a value proposition to our customers and our products and also because it has a positive impact on our portfolio yield. Having said that, it is our desire to have a mix of businesses and products that are less market-sensitive and less market-sensitive across market cycles. So our focus is on trying to operate at the intersection of both shareholder and customer value propositions that are sustainable throughout cycles. If you're asking about how we think about the impact of higher interest rates on the long-term reversion rate that we have in our assumptions, obviously, that drives pricing and valuation. We do our assumption updates in the second quarter, probably not something -- anything specific we can say about that. But maybe I'll turn it over to Ken and he can comment more generally."

            "content": "Eric, this is Scott. Yes, in the -- it's a little bit of a mixed bag or a dislocation, if you will. But for the most part, the higher U.S. interest rates, which I think are related to the currency is good for demand, as Rob said, and I think it's good for Prudential overall. But as investors in Japan are looking for more attractive yielding products, that's good. In the short run, though, and when the currency moves, it does make the price tag of the purchase a little more expensive. And we have found in the bank channel where there's an intermediary in there. You may see slightly higher surrenders because of the run-up in the dollar. But net-net, we think it's generally a positive for us. Tracy, this is Scott. I'll go ahead and take that one. I guess in the short answer, I'd say, not really. We're seeking to build out a well-diversified emerging markets portfolio of businesses. And we see local currency weakness as an opportunity to improve our U.S. dollar purchase economics, if you will. But that being said, we do factor in the potential for currency risk over time by using risk-adjusted discount rates in our valuation estimates when we think about these businesses. So I would say if you take a step back, we'd actually say, it's a net positive."

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. Later, we\u2019ll conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Bob McLaughlin. Please go ahead.\nRobert McLaughlin: Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. Representing Prudential on today's call are Charlie Lowrey, Chairman and CEO; Rob Falzon, Vice Chairman; Andy Sullivan, Head of International Businesses; and PGIM, our global investment manager; Caroline Feeney, Head of US Businesses; Ken Tanji, Chief Financial Officer; and Rob Axel, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer. We will start with prepared comments by Charlie, Rob and Ken, and then we will take your questions. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from those predictions we make today. In addition, this presentation may include references to non-GAAP measures.

Now, I'll turn it over to Charlie.\nCharles Lowrey: Thank you, Bob, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Before we begin, I'd like to comment on our CFO transition. As you saw from yesterday's news release, Yanela Frias, President of Prudential's Group Insurance Business has been named Executive Vice President and CFO of Prudential, succeeding Ken Tanji, has a 27-year veteran of Prudential. Yanela is a seasoned executive who brings a deep understanding of our business and industry, as well as significant finance, operations and leadership experience. I'm sure you'll enjoy getting to know her as she starts her new role. Yanela will become CFO effective March 15, and Ken will stay on for a six-month period to ensure a smooth transition. Ken has been a great partner and friend and has had a distinguished 35-year career at Prudential. I don't need to go back far to articulate his impact. Most recently, as CFO, Ken guided Prudential through the financial challenges of the COVID pandemic and the market volatility that followed. During the same time, his leadership on strategic initiatives meaningfully contributed to our goals of becoming less market-sensitive and more nimble. We are grateful to Ken for his many contributions over more than three decades and wish him well. Now, let's turn to my remarks for the quarter. Our financial results for 2023 reflect continued strong sales momentum across our insurance and retirement businesses and solid underlying earnings growth. The fourth quarter capped a productive year of continued transformation to make Prudential a higher growth, more capital-efficient and more nimble company. Our strategic progress and financial strength position us well to navigate the current macroeconomic environment, maintain a disciplined approach to capital deployment and deliver long-term sustainable growth. Turning to Slide 3. I will begin today by sharing a few examples of how we are transforming our business to drive future growth and unlock value for all our stakeholders. Over the course of 2023, we executed several attractive transactions adding to our capital efficiency. We reinsure the $10 billion block of traditional variable annuities, reducing our market sensitivity. We closed a $10 billion transaction of structured settlement annuities with Prismic, a life and annuity reinsurance company we launched. Prismic will enhance our mutually reinforcing business system and drive future growth by leveraging our differentiated brands, global asset and liability origination capabilities and multichannel distribution. In addition, we entered into a reinsurance agreement with Somerset Re for a $12.5 billion block of guaranteed universal life reserves, which will release capital and increase earnings. We continue to strengthen the capabilities of our market-leading businesses through strategic M&A, expanded distribution channels and created new products and solutions to meet the evolving needs of our customers across the globe and to support future growth. In PGIM, we enhanced our capabilities in the attractive area of private credit and direct lending by acquiring a majority stake in Dearpath Capital, which closed in December. To further provide investors with a cohesive offering, we brought together PGIM's private alternatives capabilities into one global team with the formation of PGIM private alternatives. Internationally, we continue to expand third-party distribution in Latin America through Mercado Libre, reaching a milestone of close to 300,000 policies in force last quarter. In Japan, we launched expanded inheritance and new investment products to diversify our portfolio and meet a broader range of customer needs. Our Institutional Retirement Strategies business secured its second largest longevity risk transfer transaction ever with one of the biggest life insurance companies in the Netherlands. This marks our first international reinsurance deal in the Dutch market. Retirement strategies also worked with Fidelity Investments to address growing consumer demand for a workplace retirement income solution. Our Prudential Simply Income product, a new single premium immediate annuity is now available to employer-based retirement plans administered by Fidelity. In addition, to solidify our leadership and expand our addressable market and structured settlements, we launched a new index structured settlement annuity product. We also continue to create a more nimble and efficient company to meet the changing needs of our customers and maintain a competitive position in the marketplace. This included evolving our operating model and organizational structure to better support customers at the business level and leveraging technology to bring products to market faster. Our business and technology teams together launched an average of one new or enhanced product every two weeks in 2023. Additionally, we are strategically leaning into partnerships with cutting-edge technology firms within our group business to increase the speed of innovation, add capabilities and enhance customer experience. We entered 2024 with momentum and optimism as we have expanded and diversified our product offerings, enhanced customer and client experiences and continued to reinvest in our businesses for sustainable long-term growth. Moving to Slide 4. Our transformation strategy and growth initiatives are supported by Prudential's rock solid balance sheet and robust risk and capital management framework, which have allowed us to confidently navigate the macroeconomic environment. Our AA rated financial strength, includes a strong capital position, including approximately $50 billion of unrealized insurance margins, $4.1 billion in highly liquid assets at the end of the fourth quarter, and a high-quality, well-diversified investment portfolio and disciplined approach to asset liability management. Turning to Slide 5, our disciplined approach to capital deployment enables us to effectively balance investing in the long-term growth of our businesses with returning capital to shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we returned over $700 million of capital to shareholders.  For 2024, our board has authorized up to $1 billion in share repurchases as well as a 4% dividend increase beginning in the first quarter. This represents our 16th consecutive annual dividend increase.  And now I will turn it over to Rob.\nRobert Falzon: Thank you, Charlie. I'll provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for our PGIM, US and International businesses. I'll begin on Slide 6 with our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023. Our pre-tax adjusted operating income was $5.5 billion or $11.62 per share for 2023 and $1.3 billion or $2.58 per share in the fourth quarter. These results reflect an increase in the underlying earnings power of our businesses, including the benefits of strong sales growth and higher interest rates. This was partially offset by pressure on variable investment income and higher expenses, primarily due to a $200 million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter. Our GAAP net income for the quarter was $374 million higher than our after-tax AOI primarily driven by net investment gains due to declining rates. Turning to the quarterly operating results of our businesses compared to the year ago quarter. PGIM, our global investment manager, had lower other related revenues driven by lower incentive fees and agency income and higher expenses. This was partially offset by higher asset management fees, including the benefits from our acquisition of Deerpath Capital and of launching Prismic. Results of our US businesses primarily reflected higher spread income driven by business growth and the benefit of higher interest rates and lower expenses. This was partially offset by lower legacy traditional variable annuity fee income as we pivot to less market-sensitive products. The earnings in our international businesses primarily reflected less favorable underwriting results, including unfavorable policyholder behavior partially offset by lower expenses. Turning to Slide 7, PGIM, our global active investment manager, has diversified capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed income, equities and alternatives. PGIM's strong investment performance over the past year has also driven attractive long-term performance with over 80% of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last five- and 10-year periods. PGIM's assets under management increased 6% to $1.3 trillion from the year ago quarter, primarily resulting from market appreciation. Third-party net outflows in the fourth quarter totaled $13.5 billion. Institutional outflows of $6.3 billion were driven primarily by a large redemption of a low fee equity index mandate and redemptions in public fixed income resulting from client rebalancing and liquidity needs. Retail outflows of $7.2 billion were primarily driven by equity, sub-advised mandates and fixed income outflows. As the investment engine of Prudential, the success and growth of PGIM and of our US and International insurance and Retirement businesses are mutually reinforcing. PGIM's asset origination capabilities, investment management expertise and access to institutional and other sources of private capital, including through the recently launched reinsurer Prismic or a competitive advantage, helping our businesses to bring enhanced solutions and create more value for our customers. Our insurance and retirement businesses, in turn, provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated net flows as well as unique access to insurance liabilities. In addition, we continue to grow both organically and through acquisitions, our PGIM Private Alternatives business, which has assets of approximately $240 billion across private, corporate and infrastructure credit, real estate equity and debt and secondary private equity. Capital deployment across PGIM's private assets platform of $9 billion during the quarter benefited from robust private placement and direct lending originations. Turning to Slide 8, our US businesses produced diversified earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income and benefit from our complementary mix of longevity and mortality businesses. We continue to drive growth by transforming our capabilities to improve customer experiences and expanding our addressable market with new financial solutions leveraging the capabilities across Prudential. Retirement strategies generated strong sales of $16.4 billion in the fourth quarter across its institutional and individual lines of business. Institutional Retirement sales of $14.3 billion in the fourth quarter were driven by strong international reinsurance sales and our best quarter for structured settlements since 2016. International Reinsurance sales included a $9.2 billion transaction in the Netherlands and with the recently passed Dutch Pension Reform Legislation, we anticipate this market will continue to grow over time. Individual Retirement posted $2.1 billion in sales, reaching the highest level since the third quarter of 2019. Our product pivots have resulted in continued strong sales of FlexGuard and FlexGuard Income, which increased about 20% from the year ago quarter, while fixed annuity sales have doubled. Our Individual Life sales increased 33% from the year ago quarter, reflecting our product pivot strategy towards more capital-efficient products. Variable life protection and accumulation products represented approximately 70% of sales for the year, including a benefit from our recently launched FlexGuard Life product. In group Insurance, we continue to execute on our strategy of product and client segment diversification while leveraging technology to increase operating efficiency and enhance the customer experience. Our full year sales were up 11% compared to the prior year, driven by growth in disability and supplemental health. Group's full year adjusted operating income was the highest in the past 15 years and included favorable underwriting experience. As a result, we are lowering our benefits ratio target range by 2 percentage points to 83% to 87%. Turning to Slide 9, our international businesses include our Japanese life insurance companies, where we have a differentiated multichannel distribution model as well as other businesses aimed at expanding our presence in targeted high-growth emerging markets. In Japan, we are focused on providing high-quality service and expanding our distribution and product offerings. Our needs-based approach and protection product focus continue to provide important value to our customers as we expand our product offerings to meet their evolving needs. In emerging markets, we are focused on creating a selective portfolio of businesses in regions where customer needs are growing, where there are compelling opportunities to build market-leading businesses and where the Prudential enterprise can add value. Sales in our international businesses were up 24% compared to the year ago quarter. Life Planner sales were up 21%, including the benefits of recent product launches in Japan to diversify our product offering. In addition, Brazil sales were up 24%, reflecting growth across all channels and leading to a full year record. Gibraltar sales were up 27%, primarily driven by higher independent agency sales and growth in the bank channel. As we look ahead, we are well positioned across our businesses to be a global leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security. We continue to focus on investing in growth businesses and markets, delivering industry-leading customer experiences and creating the next generation of financial solutions to serve the diverse needs of a broad range of customers. And with that, I'll now hand it over to Ken.\nKenneth Tanji: Thanks Rob. I'll begin on Slide 10, which provides insight into earnings for the first quarter of 2024 relative to our fourth quarter results. As noted, pre-tax adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter was $1.3 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $2.58 on an after-tax basis. To get a sense for how our first quarter results might develop, we suggest adjustments for the following items; first, variable investment income was below expectations in the fourth quarter by $95 million. Second, underwriting experience was below expectations by $15 million in the fourth quarter, and we expect $30 million of unfavorable seasonality in the first quarter. And last, we included an adjustment of $240 million for expenses and other items. This includes the $200 million restructuring charge related to changes in our organizational structure as well as adjustments for typical seasonality related to the timing of expenses and premium. These adjustments combined get us to a baseline of $3.36 per share for the first quarter. I'll note that if we exclude items specific to the first quarter, earnings per share would be $3.50. The key takeaway is that our underlying earnings power has increased significantly over the past year, while we have also made strategic progress improving our risk profile. While we have provided these items to consider, please note that there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the first quarter. As we look forward, we have included other considerations for 2024 in the appendix. Turning to Slide 11. Our capital position continues to support our AA financial strength rating. Our regulatory capital ratios are above our targets, and we expect PICA's year-end RBC ratio to be greater than 425%. Our cash and liquid assets were $4.1 billion within our liquidity target range of $3 billion to $5 billion, and we have substantial off-balance sheet resources. We remain thoughtful in our capital deployment, balancing the preservation of financial strength and flexibility, investment in our businesses for long-term growth and shareholder distributions. Turning to Slide 12, and in summary, we are transforming our business for sustainable growth. We continue to confidently navigate the macro environment with the financial strength of our rock-solid balance sheet, and we are maintaining a balanced and disciplined approach to capital deployment. Now, I'll turn it to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Tom Gallagher from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live.\nTom Gallagher: Good morning, and Ken, good luck. Just looking at the 65% free cash flow conversion, I know that bullet was removed from the capital slides. I just want to make sure that, that's still the target? And then relatedly, when thinking about Japan economic solvency implementation, can you comment on how you see that impacting sources and uses of capital and capital generation over the next few years? Thanks.\nKenneth Tanji: Yes. Hey, Tom, it's Ken and thanks for the good luck. I appreciate it. We didn't remove that comment. I think it's pretty well understood that our free cash flow ratio has been about 65% over time and that's reflective of our business mix and our growth. It's going to vary period-to-period, but it will be about -- it's been about 65% on average. And we think that's reflective of our approach to balance growth with sustainable and diversified sources of cash flow. Actually, in2023, you'll see that cash flows were actually higher than that for a variety of reasons, so no change there. In terms of ESR in Japan, again, we believe our businesses in Japan are well capitalized and financially strong. And that would be evident in any reasonable capital standard. We're certainly working with the FSA, advocating for reasonable and responsible standards, but we also have strategies to adapt to that new regime as well. We could reinsure business internally, to the US or Bermuda, we could reinsure externally. So we have a number of strategies to manage in the new regime. And that's something that we're working on.\nTom Gallagher: Got you. Thanks. And then just a follow-up, if I could. The strength in Japan and International sales more broadly, I thought was kind of notable in the quarter. Can you comment on the competition in those markets what's driving the stronger sales? And do you think that's going to translate into stronger top line? Because I know it's been sort of flattish, but do you expect that to inflect at all in 2024 or 2025?\nAndrew Sullivan: So, Tom, its Andy. I'll take your question. And thank you for noting that. You've heard me say this before. Sales are an outcome of strong brand, great product and outstanding distribution we feel that we clearly have a competitive advantage in those areas, particularly as it relates to Japan and Brazil. As you heard from Rob, we are very pleased that our sales were up 24% year-over-year, up 21% in Life Planner and 27% in Gibraltar. Once again, that success was very broad-based as we saw growth in every channel in Brazil and across life planners, independent agents and the bank channel in Japan. In Japan, we continue to see lift from higher sales of our US dollar product, really supported by the higher US interest rate. But also clearly, our work on, innovating our product designs and enhancing our customer experience, in particular, in digital is paying off. If you look at Brazil and the results there, we saw double-digit year-over-year growth in every channel. Our Life Planner channel outperformed throughout all of last year with high Life Planner retention and strong productivity. On top of that, we continue to expand and strengthen our third-party distribution. Once again, we saw really strong results flowing from Itau Bank. And we also remain quite pleased that the expansion of our partnership with Mercado Libre. So, you asked about the outlook. As always, our priority is going to be to deliver strong value to our customers, while achieving healthy levels of profitability, but we are optimistic about our ability to grow both the top and bottom-line of our business.\nTom Gallagher: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ryan Krueger from KBW. Your line is now live.\nRyan Krueger: Hey. Thanks. Good morning. First, can you provide some more color on the key drivers of the RBC ratio improvement in the quarter? I know you had given us the exact RBC during the year, but it seems like it increased a fair amount in the quarter.\nKenneth Tanji: Yes. Hey Ryan, it's Ken. Just to remind people, RBC is something that is reported annually. And so the greater than 25% is where we believe RBC will be at the end of the year. But again, that will be filed in much greater detail, at the end of the month. And so yes, we did have an improvement in our RBC ratio in 2023, and it's really a combination of a few things. One, our in-force businesses are generating free surplus, that's part of it. We had the benefit of admitting negative IMR with the regulatory change that was adopted during the year. We also had a reduction in our AAT reserves, generally from reaggregation of policies and investment portfolios, which created some efficiency. So it was a combination of that. And so overall, our capital position and flexibility has improved in 2023. And again, you'll see all that when we file our report at the end of February.\nRyan Krueger: Thanks. And then can you help us understand your sensitivity to short-term interest rates, specifically as we get closer to a potential Fed cutting cycle? \nKenneth Tanji: Yes. Sure, Ryan. The bottom line is that there's -- we don't expect much net impact from short-term rates. We have cash and collateral balances that earn short-term yields. And that would generally be offset by interest rate derivatives from our investment portfolio, where we're actually paying short-term rates and receiving fixed to manage duration. The two generally offset each other. \nRyan Krueger: Okay. Thanks. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\nAlex Scott: Hi. So, I wanted to touch on the capital as well. I mean you're in a much stronger position sort of going into 2024 compared to a year ago. I just wanted to get an update on how you're thinking about priorities for deploying that capital? I know at times you've talked about finding some ways to enhance growth. I mean, certainly, organic growth across some of your businesses has begun to pick up as well. But how are you thinking about all of that? And how do you look at driving more growth into the business? \nCharles Lowrey: Sure. Alex, it's Charlie. I'll take that. Thanks for the question. We have said that we've always wanted -- that we want to be good stewards of capital. And as a result, we want to have a consistent disciplined and balanced approach to the redeployment of capital within our businesses, as you said, and to shareholders. And there are really three aspects to our approach on which we focus. First and foremost is maintaining our rock-solid balance sheet and financial strength, which is critical to fulfilling the promises we make to our customers and clients. Second is investing both organically and through programmatic acquisitions to support sustainable long-term growth of our businesses. And the third is returning excess capital to shareholders as we have in the past. And in this quarter, we've done all three. We've deployed capital to support strong sales across our businesses, including several new products to meet the evolving needs of our customers. We closed on the Deerpath acquisition for PGIM, and we returned over $700 million to shareholders. So we'll continue to have this consistent and disciplined approach as we go forward\nAlex Scott: Thank you. The second question I had is on PGIM flows. I was hoping you could just provide a little more color on what you expect going into 2024 as some of these headwinds begin to abate that have driven some outflows.\nAndrew Sullivan: Yes. Alex, it's Andy. Thanks for your question. We're not satisfied with the recent flow performance of the business, and we have been, and we're going to continue to take the appropriate actions to restore that performance to historical norms. That really starts with ensuring that we have a range of strategies and vehicles so that we can broadly serve our customers. You've seen us continue to intentionally invest into the business to accomplish just that. So we've continued our expansion into private alternatives with the acquisitions of Montana Capital Partners and Deerpath. You've also seen us launch new vehicles like exchange traded funds and ESG strategies. All that work adds to an already broad and diversified portfolio. The second thing I would tell you is flows and active management are correlated with investment performance. And our performance strengthened throughout all of 2023, but flows can lag. So that's one of the reasons we're constructive on the outlook looking forward. Third, we've continued -- we've not taken our foot off the gas on investing in distribution because of those three things, product breadth, investment results and distribution lead to active flows over the longer term. Let me also add that like others, I'm sure you're hearing, we believe that the record money market assets that are sitting on the sideline will flow back into fixed income once inflation and rates are stabilized and the rate trajectory, people are more confident in it. we're ready to capitalize on that given the strength of our investment performance with 81% of our assets outperforming benchmark over five and 10 years. So, clearly not satisfied about the recent flow performance, but optimistic looking forward. I would just end by noting we saw a pickup in gross inflows towards the end of 4Q, and that has continued into this year. So we're optimistic.\nAlex Scott: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi. Thanks. My first question is on, I guess, sticking with PGIM. In the slides, you still call out -- you call out programmatic M&A there. You just provide an update just on the pipeline of transactions, and what you might be thinking about there?\nAndrew Sullivan: So, thanks, Elyse. It's Andy. So I won't get obviously specific around pipeline, but maybe just bring it up a level, we've demonstrated our strong ability to grow PGIM organically over a long period of time. So we certainly don't look at it as we need M&A to grow. That said, we do remain interested in augmenting our organic growth with mergers and acquisitions. Montana Capital Partners, PGIM Custom Harvest and then obviously, our closure of Deerpath in December. Those are great examples of us adding capabilities in higher growth, higher fee areas of the industry. So, as we look forward, we're going to continue to look to globalize the business. and we're going to focus on higher growth, higher fee areas, so areas like private alternatives and real asset capabilities. Clearly, periods of time like this that are disruptive can lead to opportunities, so we're making sure that we're in the know and in the flow on what's going on. We've also seen an uptick in activity in the marketplace. But as always, we're going to remain patient and disciplined in our approach.\nElyse Greenspan: Thanks. And then my second one is on the RBC. So it's now greater than 425, right? And you guys saw a nice lift in the quarter. you look to maintain Pega's RBC ratio around this level? Or is that something that you would maybe manage down over time and look to bring more capital to parent?\nKenneth Tanji: Yes, Elyse, it's Ken. We're well within our AA financial objectives on an RBC basis. Now, it's not the only thing that matters for our credit rating. But on that measure, we're where we need to be, and we have flexibility. So, we -- again, we'll balance maintaining financial strength, which is obviously important to our value proposition growth and also distribution to shareholders. So, we're balancing all three of those objectives.\nElyse Greenspan: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Suneet Kamath from Jefferies. Your line is now live.\nSuneet Kamath: Thanks. Good morning. First of all, thank you to Ken for all of your help over the years. I really appreciate it. My first question is just on the SGUL deal with Somerset Re. If I remember correctly, that was supposed to close in the fourth quarter. Obviously, we haven't seen an announcement on that yet. So, maybe just an update there? And are you still expecting $450 million of proceeds when that deal closes?\nRobert Falzon: Suneet, it's Rob. Yes, the deal continues to proceed toward closing. Our counterparty has actually received its regulatory approval. We've got one or two final steps on our end, but we expect a closing in this quarter. Just a couple of reminders. One is, recall it is retrospective to the beginning of the year, so 1/1/24. And with respect to the financial impacts, annual earnings as well as one-time closing costs and capital, we'll update that in an announcement once we close.\nSuneet Kamath: Got it. And then I guess on PGIM, totally appreciate the strong five and 10-year numbers, but it looks like the three-year number, 63% outperforming is a little bit lower. Is that something that we should -- that could have an impact on kind of the flow dynamics, or is there something maybe that will drop off? Or -- I just want to get some color on how you're thinking about that three-year number?\nAndrew Sullivan: Yes, Suneet, I would focus on how much our investment performance has strengthened here in the near term. We did have a period of time. We're an active manager. We have many high conviction strategies designed to produce alpha. We went through a brief period in 2021, 2022, where we did see a dip in performance is specifically in our fixed income business, but that performance has strengthened quite nicely and is very, very strong right now. So, we don't expect that to have a major impact on us looking forward.\nSuneet Kamath: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.\nJimmy Bhullar: Hi. Good morning. So first, a question for Charlie, maybe on capital and just capital deployment overall. Can you talk about what your priorities are and where do -- and how do you think about M&A and/or share buybacks? Because it seems like you certainly have the capacity to do more in buybacks given your capital generation than you've been doing, but not sure if you're prioritizing other things instead as well.\nCharles Lowrey: Sure. As I mentioned to Alex earlier, we do -- we have a consistent and balanced approach. And -- as a result, Jimmy, we really look for, again, the three things. One is to make sure that we have a very strong balance sheet, which we do, as Ken was talking about. The second is to invest organically in our businesses, and you've seen us do that, and we will continue to do that to support sales growth, to support the growth of all our businesses as we go forward and then to look for acquisitions that make sense. Those would be in higher growth areas. It could be in distribution, it could be in geography as well. We also see tremendous opportunities right now in the marketplace in places like PRT, right, where we are one of the leaders in this business. We think there's going to be tremendous volume there, and that's a really good business for us as we go forward. And Caroline, you may want to talk about that in one moment. The final thing, as we've talked about, is returning excess capital to shareholders. We've done that in the past. And if we think we have excess capital, we'll do so. But we're going to evaluate that relative to our investment in our businesses and the opportunities that come along. And Caroline, you might want to talk about one in particular.\nCaroline Feeney: Yes, absolutely. So Jimmy, we did finish another strong year in pension transfer. We closed 11 transactions worth almost $6 billion finishing as the number two pensioners transfer writer. And we've already built on that positive momentum this year, with a $5 billion deal with Shell. It's our largest first quarter pensioners' transfer ever. And with this win, Prudential now has completed seven of the top 10 US PRT transactions on record. We also see that strong sales trend continuing. It's driven by healthy pipelines due to favorable funding positions of over 100%. And last year's market volume was roughly $45 billion. And we do expect to see that healthy pipeline continue this year. And although the market is highly with more new entrants, very few competitors have executed transactions exceeding $1 billion. And while transactions will continue to be episodic in our PRT, business our expertise and our ability to handle large complex transactions and our leadership position in service delivery, we believe will position us well to remain a leader in the market.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then just in Latin America, can you share what your views are in terms of potential pension reform in the Chilean market, and what the reasonable case or sort of a worst-case impact would be on Prudential's business there?\nAndrew Sullivan: Yes. So Jimmy its Andy. Thank you for your question. As we've talked about before, our priority is always delivering for our customers' day-in and day-out. We're very leaned into what's in their best interest. As you would expect, because of that, we believe in being very proactive on advocating on their behalf. We're going to continue to advocate for reform and improve the pension outcomes in Latin America and specifically for the citizens of Chile. Just to give you an update, in Chile, the constitutional referendum was rejected on December 17, but after two failed attempts. So President Ports really has moved on and is now focused squarely on pension reform. And there is a proposal that's advancing through Congress. That bill proposes to eliminate AFPs and to increase employer contributions to 6%, and we\u2019re closely monitoring that situation, as a package would impact our Habitat JV. But I would say just a couple of things. Our Habitat JV is a high-quality, very well-run business. It's been working to actively diversify across countries and into voluntary savings offerings. And if you take a step back, just recognize that Joint Venture, while it's obviously a larger component of our emerging markets. It's not a material contributor to PFI earnings. So we'll obviously stay very close to it, and we'll let you know when we have any more clarity.\nJimmy Bhullar: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Joel Hurwitz from Dowling & Partners. Your line is now live.\nJoel Hurwitz: Hey. Good morning. So, I know lapses have periodically been an issue in Japan just given exchange rates. It looks like there were a pretty sizable quarter-over-quarter reduction in the in-force of main both international businesses in the quarter. Can you just talk about what you saw in terms of [Indiscernible] there?\nAndrew Sullivan: Yes. So thanks, Joel, its Andy. So let me just talk about the decline in the in-force. First, as I always start, we're exceptionally proud of our Japanese businesses. They've been very consistent and stable contributors to Prudential for a very long time. With that, there are a few factors, though, that are impacting the life insurance in-force amounts. First, this is important to note, a significant portion of our recent sales are investment contracts, and that really reflects what customers are looking to buy. Those sales do not include a material life component, but are contributing to our earnings. Second, we are seeing natural runoff in the older life blocks, particularly in the legacy yen business in Gibraltar. And then as we've talked about in previous quarters, with the recent yen depreciation, we've seen a modestly elevated level of surrenders. But all that said, we are confident in our ability to grow and diversify our Japanese businesses across insurance, investment and retirement security, and we're continuing to invest in them.\nJoel Hurwitz: Okay, helpful. And then switching gears to group. So you reduced the benefit ratio target there. Can you just talk about the overall drivers to the reduction there? And what's the growth outlook for that business? It looks like top line for full year was roughly flat. Just any color on growth expectations there. \nCaroline Feeney: Yes, absolutely, Joel. It's Caroline. Thank you so much for your question. So first of all, I'll start off by saying we had another very strong quarter for group insurance and we're very pleased with the full year results of this business. And we believe we're in that strong position in group given the progress we've made in executing on our strategy and our future earnings power will reflect the efforts we've made to grow in a disciplined and profitable manner. We continue to focus on diversifying our business by expanding in the under 5,000 live market and the association segment. We're adding new products like supplemental health and continuing our growth and disability. And we made progress in that diversification effort, increasing our disability premiums and fees at a higher rate than before and our supplemental health premiums also grew at strong double-digit annual growth rates. And this diversification is driving stronger core earnings with higher margins. So, as for our performance, our full year benefits ratio was just over 83 percentage points. It includes very strong performance in our Life block in the second and third quarters of last year and record disability results in the first half of the year. While we don't expect that record performance to continue and definitely, there are certainly other factors to consider. So, overall, Joel, I'd say that our group business is growing. It's doing so at attractive margins with COVID having transitioned to an endemic state combined with our diversification strategy I just walked you through as well as investments we've made in improving our claims management capabilities and strategic partnerships. We believe we'll see that underwriting performance and earnings power continue to improve. And that is why we are confident with our decision in lowering our benefit ratio guidance to be 83% to 87% for the year. And in terms of just future earnings power as well, I gave you some color there as well, Joel. We believe the future earnings power and group insurance will continue to be strong as we continue to grow and execute on our strategy.\nJoel Hurwitz: Very helpful. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Wilma Burdis from Raymond James. Your line is now live.\nWilma Burdis: Hey. Good morning. I'm just wondering if there's been any activity with Prismic? Seeing that you guys have focused on the sales of [indiscernible] and also with this large PRT deals. So if you can give us an update there, please?\nRobert Falzon: Hi, Wilma, it's Rob. So as we've articulated before, we're quite enthusiastic about Prisma and more broadly about what we see to be the opportunities that are coming out of the intersection between asset management and insurance and specifically the role that Prismic can play and helping us to execute against that opportunity. We believe it will create avenues of growth across our businesses, not specifically for the PRT transaction that we recently announced, but the opportunity to be a source of financing for sales growth, both in the retirement marketplace and our other businesses on a go-forward basis. Our investors, which are extremely large global institutional investors share our aspirations, both from a directional standpoint and from a quantum standpoint. So our expectation is to go well beyond the initial $10 billion structured securities or structured settlements transaction that we completed. It's going to include some level of ongoing balance sheet optimization. It's going to include, as I noted, financing the growth across our businesses. I think what's unique in a way about Prismic is the appetite by it and its investors for longer duration and more complex liabilities. And we're also going to look to do third-party blocks as well in Prismic, all of which will in order the benefit of increasing the assets under management for our PGIM business.\nWilma Burdis: Thank you. Could you talk a little bit about the buyback? I think you guys talk with the $1 billion authorization for 2024. Certainly, when you guys sell blocks and run off earnings a little bit, it's good to see more capital returns. So can you just talk about how you guys are thinking through that? Thank you.\nKenneth Tanji: Yes, it's Ken. Yes, we've had a very consistent approach to shareholder distributions using both dividends and share repurchases as a way to return capital. It's our share repurchases for this year was approved by the board, and they had considered our capital position, our outlook for free cash flow, but also opportunities to deploy that capital into organic growth, as Charlie discussed, in particular, the very robust PRT market. So, all those things factored into it. We increased our dividend again. That's -- now we've increased that 16 years in a row. So again, it all factors into what we think is a very consistent approach, balancing all our objectives as well. So I hope that color helps. \nWilma Burdis: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from John Barnidge from Piper Sandler. Your line is now live.\nJohn Barnidge: Good morning. Thank you for the opportunity. And best of luck, Ken. My first question, I appreciate -- if we could go to the Group Insurance business, I appreciate the benefit ratio guidance. But is there an expense savings storing disability coming up I can't help, but notice improvement in administrative expenses in recent quarters. And with COVID moving endemic, the ramping up of expenses, should that fall to the side. Thank you.\nCaroline Feeney: Yes. So John, it's Caroline. Thank you so much for your question. In terms of our overall expense management, you may have seen we saw 100 basis point improvement in our admin ratio from the year ago quarter. That is driven by both business growth and continued expense discipline. And we will continue to focus on expense efficiencies and obviously then would regularly adjust our operating models to ensure the appropriate levels of service going forward. In terms of disability overall, I would say across group disability results were driven by our focus on effective claims management, including those short- and long-term disability as well as absence in family leave. We also benefited from the continued tailwinds of strong employment and high interest rate environment and our disability business had an outstanding year. I would also just want to point out something else strategically, we're doing on the disability side as we continue to grow that area. We've actually invested, John, in improving our claims management process through a strategic partnership with Evolution IQ. This is a provider of AI-driven technology that provides real-time monitoring leading to increased recoveries. So, overall, I'd say in terms of expense management, we remain highly disciplined and also, obviously, very much focused in terms of our pricing discipline. The evidence there is our ability to accomplish all this growth in maintaining our price competitiveness. But the fact that as we continue to grow our book, we're also not afraid to walk away if the pricing just doesn't make sense on any particular case. So, overall, we remain confident in our decision to lower benefit ratio guidance and feel very comfortable with our expense management and our pricing discipline.\nJohn Barnidge: Thank you for that answer. My follow-up question. When you talk about globalizing the PGIM business, are there markets you're not large in size that you want to get bigger in? Where does Prismic sit within that growth opportunity for PGIM internationally?\nAndrew Sullivan: So, John, I'll start out and then, Rob, if you want to tail in, you can jump in. So when we talk about globalizing the business, I think it's important to recognize that a majority of our assets under management today are in the United States. So, we've been actively, for many years now, working to expand across Europe and Asia and have invested quite heavily in distribution on both the institutional and retail side of the business. That said, as we look to continue to broaden and diversify our mix of both asset classes, but geographies, we would look to Europe and Asia as key geographies that we're most interested in growing.\nRobert Falzon: John, it's Rob. Just following up on Andy. Within Asia and with respect to Prismic, I think what I'd note is we see a huge opportunity in Japan, both with regard to, as Ken alluded to earlier, in the call, optimizing our own book, but also with respect to the sort of opportunities we see with third parties in that marketplace as well.\nJohn Barnidge: Appreciate that. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael Ward from Citi. Your line is now live.\nMichael Ward: Hey, guys. Good morning. Sorry to be the one just curious if there's any update on commercial real estate side for you guys. It looked like the LTV deteriorated a little bit. Just kind of wondering how you feel about any kind of watch list or resolutions that you've made last year too.\nRobert Falzon: This is Rob. So I'll take your question, Mike. So a couple of thoughts. One, from an overall market standpoint, let me start there. From a peak to trough, what we've seen is across the market, about a 16% correction, and that number relates to, what I'll call, institutional quality real estate, the sort of things that we invest in or we lend against, and that's on an unlevered basis. Our estimate is that the peak to trough in this cycle across real estate types is going to probably be a little over 20%. So we've got 5% or 6% probably left in the way of price correction yet to experience. Now, within that, office, obviously, has corrected much more severely closer to 30% to date, and probably has another 10%, 15% yet to go. Because the construction of our portfolio is significantly underweight office, and because the overall quality of the portfolio and the diversification of it across geography and property types, and importantly, because this is a portfolio that's directly originated by PGIM with the team that's deep and averages some 25 years of industry experience, we're actually finding that our portfolio is holding up quite well. So loan to values across the portfolio were about 58% and our discount -- our debt service coverage ratios remain right around 2.5%. Within our overall portfolio, our actual valuations increased about 6% during the course of 2023 despite the fact that we saw a double-digit decline in the office component of our portfolio. But again, because that office component is only 2% of our assets or 50% -- about 14% of our mortgages, the performance of the rest of the portfolio has offset that. So, with regard to portfolio performance, we're actually feeling quite good. The last thing that you asked about was sort of what we're seeing in watch list, et cetera. I guess the way I would describe that, Mike, is that, first, if we look at our experience with maturities during 2023, we had about $2 billion worth of scheduled maturities. Of those, we provided modifications for four -- less than $400 million of that $2 billion with those modifications providing longer-term extensions. The remainder of all of those maturities was resolved favorably through refinancing payoffs or short-term extensions that then led or leading to subsequent payoffs. In the upcoming year 2024, we've got about $3 billion of maturities coming on. That's about 6% of the portfolio that's maturing. And while we don't expect to be immune from this cycle by any means, we do expect that on a relative basis, we'll be quite resilient. We increased our reserves in the real estate portfolio to around $370 million as of the end of the year and that represents about 72 basis points, and we think that that's well provisioned against the portfolio, again, given what we've experienced in the underlying quality of that portfolio.\nMichael Ward: Awesome. Really helpful. Thanks, Rob.\nOperator: Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Lowrey for any further closing comments.\nCharles Lowrey: So, thank you again for joining us today. The fourth quarter capped a year of continued growth and evolution for Prudential. Our strategy, coupled with our mutually reinforcing business system positions us well to deliver long-term sustainable growth to all our stakeholders. Our fundamentals are strong, and we are confident about our momentum going into 2024. We will continue to lead the way in expanding access to investing insurance and retirement security across the globe, as we seek to help current and future generations build a secure financial future. Thank you again for joining us, and have a good day.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kenneth Tanji",
            "content": "Thanks Rob. I'll begin on Slide 10, which provides insight into earnings for the first quarter of 2024 relative to our fourth quarter results. As noted, pre-tax adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter was $1.3 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $2.58 on an after-tax basis. To get a sense for how our first quarter results might develop, we suggest adjustments for the following items; first, variable investment income was below expectations in the fourth quarter by $95 million. Second, underwriting experience was below expectations by $15 million in the fourth quarter, and we expect $30 million of unfavorable seasonality in the first quarter. And last, we included an adjustment of $240 million for expenses and other items. This includes the $200 million restructuring charge related to changes in our organizational structure as well as adjustments for typical seasonality related to the timing of expenses and premium. These adjustments combined get us to a baseline of $3.36 per share for the first quarter. I'll note that if we exclude items specific to the first quarter, earnings per share would be $3.50. The key takeaway is that our underlying earnings power has increased significantly over the past year, while we have also made strategic progress improving our risk profile. While we have provided these items to consider, please note that there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the first quarter. As we look forward, we have included other considerations for 2024 in the appendix. Turning to Slide 11. Our capital position continues to support our AA financial strength rating. Our regulatory capital ratios are above our targets, and we expect PICA's year-end RBC ratio to be greater than 425%. Our cash and liquid assets were $4.1 billion within our liquidity target range of $3 billion to $5 billion, and we have substantial off-balance sheet resources. We remain thoughtful in our capital deployment, balancing the preservation of financial strength and flexibility, investment in our businesses for long-term growth and shareholder distributions. Turning to Slide 12, and in summary, we are transforming our business for sustainable growth. We continue to confidently navigate the macro environment with the financial strength of our rock-solid balance sheet, and we are maintaining a balanced and disciplined approach to capital deployment. Now, I'll turn it to the operator for your questions. Yes. Hey, Tom, it's Ken and thanks for the good luck. I appreciate it. We didn't remove that comment. I think it's pretty well understood that our free cash flow ratio has been about 65% over time and that's reflective of our business mix and our growth. It's going to vary period-to-period, but it will be about -- it's been about 65% on average. And we think that's reflective of our approach to balance growth with sustainable and diversified sources of cash flow. Actually, in2023, you'll see that cash flows were actually higher than that for a variety of reasons, so no change there. In terms of ESR in Japan, again, we believe our businesses in Japan are well capitalized and financially strong. And that would be evident in any reasonable capital standard. We're certainly working with the FSA, advocating for reasonable and responsible standards, but we also have strategies to adapt to that new regime as well. We could reinsure business internally, to the US or Bermuda, we could reinsure externally. So we have a number of strategies to manage in the new regime. And that's something that we're working on. Yes. Hey Ryan, it's Ken. Just to remind people, RBC is something that is reported annually. And so the greater than 25% is where we believe RBC will be at the end of the year. But again, that will be filed in much greater detail, at the end of the month. And so yes, we did have an improvement in our RBC ratio in 2023, and it's really a combination of a few things. One, our in-force businesses are generating free surplus, that's part of it. We had the benefit of admitting negative IMR with the regulatory change that was adopted during the year. We also had a reduction in our AAT reserves, generally from reaggregation of policies and investment portfolios, which created some efficiency. So it was a combination of that. And so overall, our capital position and flexibility has improved in 2023. And again, you'll see all that when we file our report at the end of February. Yes. Sure, Ryan. The bottom line is that there's -- we don't expect much net impact from short-term rates. We have cash and collateral balances that earn short-term yields. And that would generally be offset by interest rate derivatives from our investment portfolio, where we're actually paying short-term rates and receiving fixed to manage duration. The two generally offset each other. Yes, Elyse, it's Ken. We're well within our AA financial objectives on an RBC basis. Now, it's not the only thing that matters for our credit rating. But on that measure, we're where we need to be, and we have flexibility. So, we -- again, we'll balance maintaining financial strength, which is obviously important to our value proposition growth and also distribution to shareholders. So, we're balancing all three of those objectives. Yes, it's Ken. Yes, we've had a very consistent approach to shareholder distributions using both dividends and share repurchases as a way to return capital. It's our share repurchases for this year was approved by the board, and they had considered our capital position, our outlook for free cash flow, but also opportunities to deploy that capital into organic growth, as Charlie discussed, in particular, the very robust PRT market. So, all those things factored into it. We increased our dividend again. That's -- now we've increased that 16 years in a row. So again, it all factors into what we think is a very consistent approach, balancing all our objectives as well. So I hope that color helps."

            "content": "So, Tom, its Andy. I'll take your question. And thank you for noting that. You've heard me say this before. Sales are an outcome of strong brand, great product and outstanding distribution we feel that we clearly have a competitive advantage in those areas, particularly as it relates to Japan and Brazil. As you heard from Rob, we are very pleased that our sales were up 24% year-over-year, up 21% in Life Planner and 27% in Gibraltar. Once again, that success was very broad-based as we saw growth in every channel in Brazil and across life planners, independent agents and the bank channel in Japan. In Japan, we continue to see lift from higher sales of our US dollar product, really supported by the higher US interest rate. But also clearly, our work on, innovating our product designs and enhancing our customer experience, in particular, in digital is paying off. If you look at Brazil and the results there, we saw double-digit year-over-year growth in every channel. Our Life Planner channel outperformed throughout all of last year with high Life Planner retention and strong productivity. On top of that, we continue to expand and strengthen our third-party distribution. Once again, we saw really strong results flowing from Itau Bank. And we also remain quite pleased that the expansion of our partnership with Mercado Libre. So, you asked about the outlook. As always, our priority is going to be to deliver strong value to our customers, while achieving healthy levels of profitability, but we are optimistic about our ability to grow both the top and bottom-line of our business. Yes. Alex, it's Andy. Thanks for your question. We're not satisfied with the recent flow performance of the business, and we have been, and we're going to continue to take the appropriate actions to restore that performance to historical norms. That really starts with ensuring that we have a range of strategies and vehicles so that we can broadly serve our customers. You've seen us continue to intentionally invest into the business to accomplish just that. So we've continued our expansion into private alternatives with the acquisitions of Montana Capital Partners and Deerpath. You've also seen us launch new vehicles like exchange traded funds and ESG strategies. All that work adds to an already broad and diversified portfolio. The second thing I would tell you is flows and active management are correlated with investment performance. And our performance strengthened throughout all of 2023, but flows can lag. So that's one of the reasons we're constructive on the outlook looking forward. Third, we've continued -- we've not taken our foot off the gas on investing in distribution because of those three things, product breadth, investment results and distribution lead to active flows over the longer term. Let me also add that like others, I'm sure you're hearing, we believe that the record money market assets that are sitting on the sideline will flow back into fixed income once inflation and rates are stabilized and the rate trajectory, people are more confident in it. we're ready to capitalize on that given the strength of our investment performance with 81% of our assets outperforming benchmark over five and 10 years. So, clearly not satisfied about the recent flow performance, but optimistic looking forward. I would just end by noting we saw a pickup in gross inflows towards the end of 4Q, and that has continued into this year. So we're optimistic. So, thanks, Elyse. It's Andy. So I won't get obviously specific around pipeline, but maybe just bring it up a level, we've demonstrated our strong ability to grow PGIM organically over a long period of time. So we certainly don't look at it as we need M&A to grow. That said, we do remain interested in augmenting our organic growth with mergers and acquisitions. Montana Capital Partners, PGIM Custom Harvest and then obviously, our closure of Deerpath in December. Those are great examples of us adding capabilities in higher growth, higher fee areas of the industry. So, as we look forward, we're going to continue to look to globalize the business. and we're going to focus on higher growth, higher fee areas, so areas like private alternatives and real asset capabilities. Clearly, periods of time like this that are disruptive can lead to opportunities, so we're making sure that we're in the know and in the flow on what's going on. We've also seen an uptick in activity in the marketplace. But as always, we're going to remain patient and disciplined in our approach. Yes, Suneet, I would focus on how much our investment performance has strengthened here in the near term. We did have a period of time. We're an active manager. We have many high conviction strategies designed to produce alpha. We went through a brief period in 2021, 2022, where we did see a dip in performance is specifically in our fixed income business, but that performance has strengthened quite nicely and is very, very strong right now. So, we don't expect that to have a major impact on us looking forward. Yes. So Jimmy its Andy. Thank you for your question. As we've talked about before, our priority is always delivering for our customers' day-in and day-out. We're very leaned into what's in their best interest. As you would expect, because of that, we believe in being very proactive on advocating on their behalf. We're going to continue to advocate for reform and improve the pension outcomes in Latin America and specifically for the citizens of Chile. Just to give you an update, in Chile, the constitutional referendum was rejected on December 17, but after two failed attempts. So President Ports really has moved on and is now focused squarely on pension reform. And there is a proposal that's advancing through Congress. That bill proposes to eliminate AFPs and to increase employer contributions to 6%, and we're closely monitoring that situation, as a package would impact our Habitat JV. But I would say just a couple of things. Our Habitat JV is a high-quality, very well-run business. It's been working to actively diversify across countries and into voluntary savings offerings. And if you take a step back, just recognize that Joint Venture, while it's obviously a larger component of our emerging markets. It's not a material contributor to PFI earnings. So we'll obviously stay very close to it, and we'll let you know when we have any more clarity. Yes. So thanks, Joel, its Andy. So let me just talk about the decline in the in-force. First, as I always start, we're exceptionally proud of our Japanese businesses. They've been very consistent and stable contributors to Prudential for a very long time. With that, there are a few factors, though, that are impacting the life insurance in-force amounts. First, this is important to note, a significant portion of our recent sales are investment contracts, and that really reflects what customers are looking to buy. Those sales do not include a material life component, but are contributing to our earnings. Second, we are seeing natural runoff in the older life blocks, particularly in the legacy yen business in Gibraltar. And then as we've talked about in previous quarters, with the recent yen depreciation, we've seen a modestly elevated level of surrenders. But all that said, we are confident in our ability to grow and diversify our Japanese businesses across insurance, investment and retirement security, and we're continuing to invest in them. So, John, I'll start out and then, Rob, if you want to tail in, you can jump in. So when we talk about globalizing the business, I think it's important to recognize that a majority of our assets under management today are in the United States. So, we've been actively, for many years now, working to expand across Europe and Asia and have invested quite heavily in distribution on both the institutional and retail side of the business. That said, as we look to continue to broaden and diversify our mix of both asset classes, but geographies, we would look to Europe and Asia as key geographies that we're most interested in growing."

            "name": "Caroline Feeney",
            "content": "Yes, absolutely. So Jimmy, we did finish another strong year in pension transfer. We closed 11 transactions worth almost $6 billion finishing as the number two pensioners transfer writer. And we've already built on that positive momentum this year, with a $5 billion deal with Shell. It's our largest first quarter pensioners' transfer ever. And with this win, Prudential now has completed seven of the top 10 US PRT transactions on record. We also see that strong sales trend continuing. It's driven by healthy pipelines due to favorable funding positions of over 100%. And last year's market volume was roughly $45 billion. And we do expect to see that healthy pipeline continue this year. And although the market is highly with more new entrants, very few competitors have executed transactions exceeding $1 billion. And while transactions will continue to be episodic in our PRT, business our expertise and our ability to handle large complex transactions and our leadership position in service delivery, we believe will position us well to remain a leader in the market. Yes, absolutely, Joel. It's Caroline. Thank you so much for your question. So first of all, I'll start off by saying we had another very strong quarter for group insurance and we're very pleased with the full year results of this business. And we believe we're in that strong position in group given the progress we've made in executing on our strategy and our future earnings power will reflect the efforts we've made to grow in a disciplined and profitable manner. We continue to focus on diversifying our business by expanding in the under 5,000 live market and the association segment. We're adding new products like supplemental health and continuing our growth and disability. And we made progress in that diversification effort, increasing our disability premiums and fees at a higher rate than before and our supplemental health premiums also grew at strong double-digit annual growth rates. And this diversification is driving stronger core earnings with higher margins. So, as for our performance, our full year benefits ratio was just over 83 percentage points. It includes very strong performance in our Life block in the second and third quarters of last year and record disability results in the first half of the year. While we don't expect that record performance to continue and definitely, there are certainly other factors to consider. So, overall, Joel, I'd say that our group business is growing. It's doing so at attractive margins with COVID having transitioned to an endemic state combined with our diversification strategy I just walked you through as well as investments we've made in improving our claims management capabilities and strategic partnerships. We believe we'll see that underwriting performance and earnings power continue to improve. And that is why we are confident with our decision in lowering our benefit ratio guidance to be 83% to 87% for the year. And in terms of just future earnings power as well, I gave you some color there as well, Joel. We believe the future earnings power and group insurance will continue to be strong as we continue to grow and execute on our strategy. Yes. So John, it's Caroline. Thank you so much for your question. In terms of our overall expense management, you may have seen we saw 100 basis point improvement in our admin ratio from the year ago quarter. That is driven by both business growth and continued expense discipline. And we will continue to focus on expense efficiencies and obviously then would regularly adjust our operating models to ensure the appropriate levels of service going forward. In terms of disability overall, I would say across group disability results were driven by our focus on effective claims management, including those short- and long-term disability as well as absence in family leave. We also benefited from the continued tailwinds of strong employment and high interest rate environment and our disability business had an outstanding year. I would also just want to point out something else strategically, we're doing on the disability side as we continue to grow that area. We've actually invested, John, in improving our claims management process through a strategic partnership with Evolution IQ. This is a provider of AI-driven technology that provides real-time monitoring leading to increased recoveries. So, overall, I'd say in terms of expense management, we remain highly disciplined and also, obviously, very much focused in terms of our pricing discipline. The evidence there is our ability to accomplish all this growth in maintaining our price competitiveness. But the fact that as we continue to grow our book, we're also not afraid to walk away if the pricing just doesn't make sense on any particular case. So, overall, we remain confident in our decision to lower benefit ratio guidance and feel very comfortable with our expense management and our pricing discipline."

            "name": "Charles Lowrey",
            "content": "Thank you, Bob, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Before we begin, I'd like to comment on our CFO transition. As you saw from yesterday's news release, Yanela Frias, President of Prudential's Group Insurance Business has been named Executive Vice President and CFO of Prudential, succeeding Ken Tanji, has a 27-year veteran of Prudential. Yanela is a seasoned executive who brings a deep understanding of our business and industry, as well as significant finance, operations and leadership experience. I'm sure you'll enjoy getting to know her as she starts her new role. Yanela will become CFO effective March 15, and Ken will stay on for a six-month period to ensure a smooth transition. Ken has been a great partner and friend and has had a distinguished 35-year career at Prudential. I don't need to go back far to articulate his impact. Most recently, as CFO, Ken guided Prudential through the financial challenges of the COVID pandemic and the market volatility that followed. During the same time, his leadership on strategic initiatives meaningfully contributed to our goals of becoming less market-sensitive and more nimble. We are grateful to Ken for his many contributions over more than three decades and wish him well. Now, let's turn to my remarks for the quarter. Our financial results for 2023 reflect continued strong sales momentum across our insurance and retirement businesses and solid underlying earnings growth. The fourth quarter capped a productive year of continued transformation to make Prudential a higher growth, more capital-efficient and more nimble company. Our strategic progress and financial strength position us well to navigate the current macroeconomic environment, maintain a disciplined approach to capital deployment and deliver long-term sustainable growth. Turning to Slide 3. I will begin today by sharing a few examples of how we are transforming our business to drive future growth and unlock value for all our stakeholders. Over the course of 2023, we executed several attractive transactions adding to our capital efficiency. We reinsure the $10 billion block of traditional variable annuities, reducing our market sensitivity. We closed a $10 billion transaction of structured settlement annuities with Prismic, a life and annuity reinsurance company we launched. Prismic will enhance our mutually reinforcing business system and drive future growth by leveraging our differentiated brands, global asset and liability origination capabilities and multichannel distribution. In addition, we entered into a reinsurance agreement with Somerset Re for a $12.5 billion block of guaranteed universal life reserves, which will release capital and increase earnings. We continue to strengthen the capabilities of our market-leading businesses through strategic M&A, expanded distribution channels and created new products and solutions to meet the evolving needs of our customers across the globe and to support future growth. In PGIM, we enhanced our capabilities in the attractive area of private credit and direct lending by acquiring a majority stake in Dearpath Capital, which closed in December. To further provide investors with a cohesive offering, we brought together PGIM's private alternatives capabilities into one global team with the formation of PGIM private alternatives. Internationally, we continue to expand third-party distribution in Latin America through Mercado Libre, reaching a milestone of close to 300,000 policies in force last quarter. In Japan, we launched expanded inheritance and new investment products to diversify our portfolio and meet a broader range of customer needs. Our Institutional Retirement Strategies business secured its second largest longevity risk transfer transaction ever with one of the biggest life insurance companies in the Netherlands. This marks our first international reinsurance deal in the Dutch market. Retirement strategies also worked with Fidelity Investments to address growing consumer demand for a workplace retirement income solution. Our Prudential Simply Income product, a new single premium immediate annuity is now available to employer-based retirement plans administered by Fidelity. In addition, to solidify our leadership and expand our addressable market and structured settlements, we launched a new index structured settlement annuity product. We also continue to create a more nimble and efficient company to meet the changing needs of our customers and maintain a competitive position in the marketplace. This included evolving our operating model and organizational structure to better support customers at the business level and leveraging technology to bring products to market faster. Our business and technology teams together launched an average of one new or enhanced product every two weeks in 2023. Additionally, we are strategically leaning into partnerships with cutting-edge technology firms within our group business to increase the speed of innovation, add capabilities and enhance customer experience. We entered 2024 with momentum and optimism as we have expanded and diversified our product offerings, enhanced customer and client experiences and continued to reinvest in our businesses for sustainable long-term growth. Moving to Slide 4. Our transformation strategy and growth initiatives are supported by Prudential's rock solid balance sheet and robust risk and capital management framework, which have allowed us to confidently navigate the macroeconomic environment. Our AA rated financial strength, includes a strong capital position, including approximately $50 billion of unrealized insurance margins, $4.1 billion in highly liquid assets at the end of the fourth quarter, and a high-quality, well-diversified investment portfolio and disciplined approach to asset liability management. Turning to Slide 5, our disciplined approach to capital deployment enables us to effectively balance investing in the long-term growth of our businesses with returning capital to shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we returned over $700 million of capital to shareholders.  For 2024, our board has authorized up to $1 billion in share repurchases as well as a 4% dividend increase beginning in the first quarter. This represents our 16th consecutive annual dividend increase.  And now I will turn it over to Rob. Sure. Alex, it's Charlie. I'll take that. Thanks for the question. We have said that we've always wanted -- that we want to be good stewards of capital. And as a result, we want to have a consistent disciplined and balanced approach to the redeployment of capital within our businesses, as you said, and to shareholders. And there are really three aspects to our approach on which we focus. First and foremost is maintaining our rock-solid balance sheet and financial strength, which is critical to fulfilling the promises we make to our customers and clients. Second is investing both organically and through programmatic acquisitions to support sustainable long-term growth of our businesses. And the third is returning excess capital to shareholders as we have in the past. And in this quarter, we've done all three. We've deployed capital to support strong sales across our businesses, including several new products to meet the evolving needs of our customers. We closed on the Deerpath acquisition for PGIM, and we returned over $700 million to shareholders. So we'll continue to have this consistent and disciplined approach as we go forward Sure. As I mentioned to Alex earlier, we do -- we have a consistent and balanced approach. And -- as a result, Jimmy, we really look for, again, the three things. One is to make sure that we have a very strong balance sheet, which we do, as Ken was talking about. The second is to invest organically in our businesses, and you've seen us do that, and we will continue to do that to support sales growth, to support the growth of all our businesses as we go forward and then to look for acquisitions that make sense. Those would be in higher growth areas. It could be in distribution, it could be in geography as well. We also see tremendous opportunities right now in the marketplace in places like PRT, right, where we are one of the leaders in this business. We think there's going to be tremendous volume there, and that's a really good business for us as we go forward. And Caroline, you may want to talk about that in one moment. The final thing, as we've talked about, is returning excess capital to shareholders. We've done that in the past. And if we think we have excess capital, we'll do so. But we're going to evaluate that relative to our investment in our businesses and the opportunities that come along. And Caroline, you might want to talk about one in particular. So, thank you again for joining us today. The fourth quarter capped a year of continued growth and evolution for Prudential. Our strategy, coupled with our mutually reinforcing business system positions us well to deliver long-term sustainable growth to all our stakeholders. Our fundamentals are strong, and we are confident about our momentum going into 2024. We will continue to lead the way in expanding access to investing insurance and retirement security across the globe, as we seek to help current and future generations build a secure financial future. Thank you again for joining us, and have a good day."

        "speaker5": {
            "name": "Robert Falzon",
            "content": "Thank you, Charlie. I'll provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for our PGIM, US and International businesses. I'll begin on Slide 6 with our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023. Our pre-tax adjusted operating income was $5.5 billion or $11.62 per share for 2023 and $1.3 billion or $2.58 per share in the fourth quarter. These results reflect an increase in the underlying earnings power of our businesses, including the benefits of strong sales growth and higher interest rates. This was partially offset by pressure on variable investment income and higher expenses, primarily due to a $200 million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter. Our GAAP net income for the quarter was $374 million higher than our after-tax AOI primarily driven by net investment gains due to declining rates. Turning to the quarterly operating results of our businesses compared to the year ago quarter. PGIM, our global investment manager, had lower other related revenues driven by lower incentive fees and agency income and higher expenses. This was partially offset by higher asset management fees, including the benefits from our acquisition of Deerpath Capital and of launching Prismic. Results of our US businesses primarily reflected higher spread income driven by business growth and the benefit of higher interest rates and lower expenses. This was partially offset by lower legacy traditional variable annuity fee income as we pivot to less market-sensitive products. The earnings in our international businesses primarily reflected less favorable underwriting results, including unfavorable policyholder behavior partially offset by lower expenses. Turning to Slide 7, PGIM, our global active investment manager, has diversified capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed income, equities and alternatives. PGIM's strong investment performance over the past year has also driven attractive long-term performance with over 80% of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last five- and 10-year periods. PGIM's assets under management increased 6% to $1.3 trillion from the year ago quarter, primarily resulting from market appreciation. Third-party net outflows in the fourth quarter totaled $13.5 billion. Institutional outflows of $6.3 billion were driven primarily by a large redemption of a low fee equity index mandate and redemptions in public fixed income resulting from client rebalancing and liquidity needs. Retail outflows of $7.2 billion were primarily driven by equity, sub-advised mandates and fixed income outflows. As the investment engine of Prudential, the success and growth of PGIM and of our US and International insurance and Retirement businesses are mutually reinforcing. PGIM's asset origination capabilities, investment management expertise and access to institutional and other sources of private capital, including through the recently launched reinsurer Prismic or a competitive advantage, helping our businesses to bring enhanced solutions and create more value for our customers. Our insurance and retirement businesses, in turn, provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated net flows as well as unique access to insurance liabilities. In addition, we continue to grow both organically and through acquisitions, our PGIM Private Alternatives business, which has assets of approximately $240 billion across private, corporate and infrastructure credit, real estate equity and debt and secondary private equity. Capital deployment across PGIM's private assets platform of $9 billion during the quarter benefited from robust private placement and direct lending originations. Turning to Slide 8, our US businesses produced diversified earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income and benefit from our complementary mix of longevity and mortality businesses. We continue to drive growth by transforming our capabilities to improve customer experiences and expanding our addressable market with new financial solutions leveraging the capabilities across Prudential. Retirement strategies generated strong sales of $16.4 billion in the fourth quarter across its institutional and individual lines of business. Institutional Retirement sales of $14.3 billion in the fourth quarter were driven by strong international reinsurance sales and our best quarter for structured settlements since 2016. International Reinsurance sales included a $9.2 billion transaction in the Netherlands and with the recently passed Dutch Pension Reform Legislation, we anticipate this market will continue to grow over time. Individual Retirement posted $2.1 billion in sales, reaching the highest level since the third quarter of 2019. Our product pivots have resulted in continued strong sales of FlexGuard and FlexGuard Income, which increased about 20% from the year ago quarter, while fixed annuity sales have doubled. Our Individual Life sales increased 33% from the year ago quarter, reflecting our product pivot strategy towards more capital-efficient products. Variable life protection and accumulation products represented approximately 70% of sales for the year, including a benefit from our recently launched FlexGuard Life product. In group Insurance, we continue to execute on our strategy of product and client segment diversification while leveraging technology to increase operating efficiency and enhance the customer experience. Our full year sales were up 11% compared to the prior year, driven by growth in disability and supplemental health. Group's full year adjusted operating income was the highest in the past 15 years and included favorable underwriting experience. As a result, we are lowering our benefits ratio target range by 2 percentage points to 83% to 87%. Turning to Slide 9, our international businesses include our Japanese life insurance companies, where we have a differentiated multichannel distribution model as well as other businesses aimed at expanding our presence in targeted high-growth emerging markets. In Japan, we are focused on providing high-quality service and expanding our distribution and product offerings. Our needs-based approach and protection product focus continue to provide important value to our customers as we expand our product offerings to meet their evolving needs. In emerging markets, we are focused on creating a selective portfolio of businesses in regions where customer needs are growing, where there are compelling opportunities to build market-leading businesses and where the Prudential enterprise can add value. Sales in our international businesses were up 24% compared to the year ago quarter. Life Planner sales were up 21%, including the benefits of recent product launches in Japan to diversify our product offering. In addition, Brazil sales were up 24%, reflecting growth across all channels and leading to a full year record. Gibraltar sales were up 27%, primarily driven by higher independent agency sales and growth in the bank channel. As we look ahead, we are well positioned across our businesses to be a global leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security. We continue to focus on investing in growth businesses and markets, delivering industry-leading customer experiences and creating the next generation of financial solutions to serve the diverse needs of a broad range of customers. And with that, I'll now hand it over to Ken. Suneet, it's Rob. Yes, the deal continues to proceed toward closing. Our counterparty has actually received its regulatory approval. We've got one or two final steps on our end, but we expect a closing in this quarter. Just a couple of reminders. One is, recall it is retrospective to the beginning of the year, so 1/1/24. And with respect to the financial impacts, annual earnings as well as one-time closing costs and capital, we'll update that in an announcement once we close. Hi, Wilma, it's Rob. So as we've articulated before, we're quite enthusiastic about Prisma and more broadly about what we see to be the opportunities that are coming out of the intersection between asset management and insurance and specifically the role that Prismic can play and helping us to execute against that opportunity. We believe it will create avenues of growth across our businesses, not specifically for the PRT transaction that we recently announced, but the opportunity to be a source of financing for sales growth, both in the retirement marketplace and our other businesses on a go-forward basis. Our investors, which are extremely large global institutional investors share our aspirations, both from a directional standpoint and from a quantum standpoint. So our expectation is to go well beyond the initial $10 billion structured securities or structured settlements transaction that we completed. It's going to include some level of ongoing balance sheet optimization. It's going to include, as I noted, financing the growth across our businesses. I think what's unique in a way about Prismic is the appetite by it and its investors for longer duration and more complex liabilities. And we're also going to look to do third-party blocks as well in Prismic, all of which will in order the benefit of increasing the assets under management for our PGIM business. John, it's Rob. Just following up on Andy. Within Asia and with respect to Prismic, I think what I'd note is we see a huge opportunity in Japan, both with regard to, as Ken alluded to earlier, in the call, optimizing our own book, but also with respect to the sort of opportunities we see with third parties in that marketplace as well. This is Rob. So I'll take your question, Mike. So a couple of thoughts. One, from an overall market standpoint, let me start there. From a peak to trough, what we've seen is across the market, about a 16% correction, and that number relates to, what I'll call, institutional quality real estate, the sort of things that we invest in or we lend against, and that's on an unlevered basis. Our estimate is that the peak to trough in this cycle across real estate types is going to probably be a little over 20%. So we've got 5% or 6% probably left in the way of price correction yet to experience. Now, within that, office, obviously, has corrected much more severely closer to 30% to date, and probably has another 10%, 15% yet to go. Because the construction of our portfolio is significantly underweight office, and because the overall quality of the portfolio and the diversification of it across geography and property types, and importantly, because this is a portfolio that's directly originated by PGIM with the team that's deep and averages some 25 years of industry experience, we're actually finding that our portfolio is holding up quite well. So loan to values across the portfolio were about 58% and our discount -- our debt service coverage ratios remain right around 2.5%. Within our overall portfolio, our actual valuations increased about 6% during the course of 2023 despite the fact that we saw a double-digit decline in the office component of our portfolio. But again, because that office component is only 2% of our assets or 50% -- about 14% of our mortgages, the performance of the rest of the portfolio has offset that. So, with regard to portfolio performance, we're actually feeling quite good. The last thing that you asked about was sort of what we're seeing in watch list, et cetera. I guess the way I would describe that, Mike, is that, first, if we look at our experience with maturities during 2023, we had about $2 billion worth of scheduled maturities. Of those, we provided modifications for four -- less than $400 million of that $2 billion with those modifications providing longer-term extensions. The remainder of all of those maturities was resolved favorably through refinancing payoffs or short-term extensions that then led or leading to subsequent payoffs. In the upcoming year 2024, we've got about $3 billion of maturities coming on. That's about 6% of the portfolio that's maturing. And while we don't expect to be immune from this cycle by any means, we do expect that on a relative basis, we'll be quite resilient. We increased our reserves in the real estate portfolio to around $370 million as of the end of the year and that represents about 72 basis points, and we think that that's well provisioned against the portfolio, again, given what we've experienced in the underlying quality of that portfolio."

And now I'll turn it over to Charlie.\nCharles Lowrey: Thank you, Bob, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our third quarter results reflect continued momentum across our businesses, excluding the benefits from strong sales and the fifth consecutive quarter of underlying earnings growth. We continue to execute on our strategy to become a higher growth, less market-sensitive and more nimble company. This quarter, we increased our capital efficiency and enhanced our capabilities in mutually reinforcing business system.  We are also optimizing our operating model to drive both efficiency and growth. Our strategic progress and financial strength position us well to navigate the current macroeconomic environment and maintain a disciplined approach to capital deployment.  Turning to Slide 3. During the quarter, we launched Prismic, a life and annuity reinsurance company alongside Warburg Pincus and other investors. It is one of our most exciting opportunities to drive sustainable long-term growth across our investment management, insurance and retirement businesses. Through Prismic, we can ensure portions of our life and annuity in-force and new business to reduce market sensitivity, free up capital and invest in growth opportunities. Prismic can also offer its services to other insurance companies in need of reinsurance support, tapping into additional sources of third-party capital to drive further growth.  In addition, Prismic expands PGIM's assets under management. Prismic is a great example of how Prudential can unlock value for customers, shareholders and other stakeholders with our mutually reinforcing business system, which combines the power of our brand, global asset and liability origination capabilities and multichannel distribution. We're also growing and investing in our businesses to better serve our customers through both the products and services we offer and through the ways we do business.  Our distribution channels continue to evolve and expand to provide more people around the world with our products and services in the way they want them. I'll provide a few examples from the third quarter. In Brazil, we achieved the second consecutive quarter of record sales, driven by continued expansion in the third-party distribution channel and the strong performance of our Life Planner channel.  In the U.S., individual retirement strategies posted its strongest sales quarter in 3 years, driven by the continued success of FlexGuard as well as the expansion of our fixed annuity suite with the launch of our new Wealth Guard multiyear guaranteed annuity. Within the Institutional market, retirement strategy secured $2.5 billion in new pension risk transfer transactions to the health savings account space by securing a $1.2 billion transaction with a top HSA provider, expanding our addressable market.  And in our Prudential Advisors distribution channel, we announced a strategic relationship with LPL Financial, which upon completion in the latter part of next year, will enhance both our adviser and customer experience by leveraging LPL's expertise, industry-leading technology and robust broker dealer and registered investment adviser services.  Alongside these investments in our businesses, we continue to focus on customer service through enhanced sales and claims platforms. For example, this year, we have announced 7 customer experience technology partnerships within group insurance. These include Enrolofy, an innovative platform transforming the enrollment experience for millions of employees and Evolution IQ, an AI-driven platform that will streamline the disability claims process.  We're also working to create a leaner, faster and more agile company so that we can better meet the changing needs and expectations of our customers around the world while driving growth and efficiency to further strengthen our competitive position. We're taking new steps to simplify our organizational structure by reducing management layers, complexity and costs while making investments in technology and data platforms.  Our goal is to empower faster decision-making and bring our integrated business teams closer to our customers and clients. Turning now to Slide 4. Prudential's rock solid balance sheet and robust risk and capital management frameworks have allowed us to confidently navigate the current macroeconomic environment. Our AA financial strength is supported by our strong capital position, including approximately $48 billion of unrealized insurance margins, $4.3 billion in highly liquid assets at the end of the third quarter and a high-quality, well-diversified investment portfolio and disciplined approach to asset liability management.  Moving to Slide 5. Our disciplined approach to capital deployment, coupled with the added capital efficiency from the Prismic transaction enables us to effectively balance investing in the long-term growth of our businesses with returning capital to shareholders. In the third quarter, we returned over $700 million of capital to shareholders.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob.\nRobert Falzon: Thank you, Charlie. I'll provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for our PGIM U.S. and International businesses. I'll begin on Slide 6 with our financial results for the third quarter of 2023. Our pretax adjusted operating income was $1.6 billion $3.44 per share on an after-tax basis, up 45% from the year ago quarter. These results reflect underlying business growth, including the benefits from a higher interest rate environment, more favorable variable investment income and underwriting experience, partially offset by lower fee income. . Our GAAP net loss was $2.1 billion lower than our after-tax adjusted operating income, primarily driven by mark-to-market losses on interest rate derivatives due to the higher rates. Turning to the operating results from our businesses compared to the year ago quarter. PGIM, our global investment manager, had lower other related revenues driven by lower agency and seed and co-investment earnings and higher expenses.  Results of our U.S. businesses primarily reflected higher spread income, including more favorable variable investment income and lower expenses, partially offset by lower fee income and the increase in earnings in our International businesses primarily reflected higher spread income.  Turning to Slide 7. PGIM, our global active investment manager has diversified capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed income, equities and alternatives. PGIM's long-term investment performance remains attractive with 80% or more of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last 5- and 10-year periods.  In addition, our short-term performance continues to improve with 83% of assets exceeding their benchmarks over a 1-year period. PGIM experienced third-party net outflows of $5.7 billion in the quarter, Institutional outflows were primarily driven by lower than normal fixed income inflows and a large client outflow. Retail outflows were driven by sub-advised equity mandates.  As the investment engine of Prudential, the success and growth of PGIM end of our U.S. and International insurance and retirement businesses are mutually reinforcing. PGIM's asset origination capabilities, investment management expertise and access to institutional and other sources of private capital, including through the recently launched reinsurer of Prismic, our competitive advantage, helping our businesses bring enhanced solutions and create more value for our customers.  Our insurance and retirement businesses, in turn, provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated net flows as well as unique access to insurance liabilities. In addition, we continue to grow both organically and through acquisitions, our private alternatives and credit business, which has assets of approximately $230 billion across private corporate and infrastructure credit real estate equity and debt and secondary private equity.  Capital deployment across PGIM's private assets platform of $8 billion during the quarter benefited from robust private placement and direct lending originations. Turning to Slide 8. Our U.S. businesses produced diversified earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income and benefit from our complementary mix of longevity and mortality businesses. We continue to drive towards a higher value, higher growth and less market-sensitive mix of earnings, invest in our businesses to deliver best-in-class customer experiences and expand our addressable market with new financial solutions leveraging the capabilities across Prudential.  Retirement strategies generated strong sales of $6.7 billion in the third quarter across its institutional and individual lines of business. Our institutional retirement business has leading market capabilities, which helped to produce third quarter sales of $4.7 billion, including $2.5 billion of pension risk transfer transactions as well as strong stable value sales.  Individual Retirement posted $2 billion in sales, up 40% from the prior year quarter. Our product pivots have resulted in continued strong sales of FlexGuard and FlexGuard income, which represented about 2/3 of sales and fixed annuities that accounted for approximately 1/3 of sales this quarter. Our Individual Life sales increased 24% from the year ago quarter, reflecting our earlier product pivot strategy with variable life products representing approximately 73% of sales in the quarter, including the benefit from our recently launched FlexGuard Life product.  And in Group Insurance, we continue to execute on our strategy of product and client segment diversification while leveraging technology to increase operating efficiency and enhance the customer experience. Our strong results this quarter included favorable group life underwriting experience, which resulted in a benefit ratio of 82.4%.  Turning to Slide 9. Our International businesses include our Japanese life insurance companies where we have a differentiated multichannel distribution model as well as other businesses aimed at expanding our presence in targeted high-growth emerging markets. In Japan, we are focused on providing high-quality service and expanding our distribution and product offerings. Our needs-based approach and protection product focus continue to provide important value to our customers as we expand our product offerings to meet their evolving needs.  During the third quarter, we launched a new U.S. dollar indexed annuity product and Prudential of Japan was ranked as the #1 Japanese life insurer in the Forbes world best life insurance companies this year. We are proud to be recognized for the value we provide to our customers. In emerging markets, we are focused on creating a select portfolio of businesses in regions where our customer needs are growing, where there are compelling opportunities to build market-leading businesses and where the Prudential enterprise can add value. Our International business sales were up 19% compared to the year ago quarter. Life Planner sales were up 18%, driven by our second consecutive quarter of record sales in Brazil as well as higher sales in Japan.  Gibraltar sales were up 20%, primarily driven by growth in the bank channel. As we look ahead, we are well positioned to cross our businesses to be a global leader in expanding access to investing insurance and retirement security. We continue to focus on investing in growth businesses and markets, delivering industry-leading customer experiences and creating the next generation of financial solutions to serve the diverse needs of a broad range of customers.  And with that, I'll now turn it over to Ken.\nKenneth Tanji: Thanks, Rob. I'll begin on Slide 10, which provides insight into earnings for the fourth quarter of 2023 relative to our third quarter results. As noted, pretax adjusted operating income in the third quarter was $1.6 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $3.44 on an after-tax basis. To get a sense of how our fourth quarter results might develop we suggest adjustments for the following items: First, variable investment income was below expectations in the third quarter by $25 million. Second, we adjust underwriting experience by $10 million to normalize for third quarter experience. . And last, we include an adjustment of $350 million for expenses and other items. This includes elevated seasonal expenses and lower international earnings due to timing of seasonal premiums in the fourth quarter. In addition, as Charlie mentioned, we are implementing changes to our organizational structure as part of our continuous improvement process, and we have included an estimated restructuring charge of approximately $200 million that will be incurred in the fourth quarter.  We expect these actions will create operating efficiencies and provide reinvestment capacity to build capabilities. This will allow us to realize additional efficiencies, strengthen our competitiveness and fuel future growth. These adjustments combined get us to a baseline of $2.75 per share for the fourth quarter.  I'll note that if you exclude items specific to the fourth quarter, earnings per share would be $3.48. The key takeaway is that our underlying earnings power continued to improve due to business growth, including the benefit of higher interest rates. While we have provided these items to consider, please note that there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the fourth quarter.  Turning to Slide 11. Our capital position continues to support our AA financial strength rating. Our cash and liquid assets were $4.3 billion within our liquidity target range of $3 billion to $5 billion. Regulatory capital ratios are above our targets, and we have substantial off-balance sheet resources, including approximately $9 billion of contingent capital and liquidity facilities. We remain thoughtful in our capital deployment, balancing the preservation of financial strength and flexibility, investment in our businesses for long-term growth and shareholder distributions.  Turning to Slide 12 and in summary. We are transforming our business for sustainable growth. We continue to navigate the current macro environment with the financial strength of our rock solid balance sheet, and we are maintaining a balanced and disciplined approach to capital deployment. Now I'll turn it to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from Tom Gallagher from Evercore ISI.\nThomas Gallagher: Just a couple of questions on capital. Did the GAAP net income loss you had this quarter also impacts statutory capital at all? And if so, did that require any contributions to subsidiaries or otherwise?\nKenneth Tanji: Tom, it's Ken. Our GAAP results included the mark-to-market on interest rate hedges and a portion of that increased our negative IMR balance for stat. But our RBC ratios remain above our target and didn't require a capital contribution.\nThomas Gallagher: Okay. And then the follow-up is when I think about the transition that lies ahead to ESR from SMR in Japan. Do you have enough clarity at this point to know how you should be positioned? Is it likely to consume capital, release capital? What do you think it should mean for Pru?\nKenneth Tanji: Yes. Sure. First, let me start with our Japan businesses financial profile, which the businesses are high quality profitable, financially strong, generating earnings, strong earnings and have good solvency margin ratios under the current regime. The FSA is taking steps to implement new capital standards and that's underway with adoption still now a couple of years away.  But generally, we still believe our businesses are well capitalized, financially strong, and that would be evident under any reasonable capital standard. We also have ways to manage the outcomes we can reinsure business internally or externally to better match the economics of the business if we need to do that. And so we're -- it's something that we're looking at and working on. We're also advocating for reasonable and responsible standards and we'll have strategies to adapt to the new potential regime.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Ryan Krueger from KBW.\nRyan Krueger: My first question was on the restructuring charge. Can you talk a little bit about the potential economic benefits of that on a go-forward basis in terms of potential expense reduction?\nCharles Lowrey: Ryan, it's Charlie. Let me take that at a high level and provide you some context and then turn it over to Ken to specifically answer your question. But in terms of the restructuring program, we made good progress towards becoming a higher growth, less market-sensitive and more nimble company. . And if you think about what we've done, that's including releasing a significant amount of capital through the disposition of market-sensitive and/or low-growth businesses and products executing a series of programmatic acquisitions to expand our investment capabilities and growth potential. Launching Prismic, another arrow in our quiver, if you will, enhancing our mutual reinforcing business system and then exceeding our initial expense goal that we established a number of years ago.  But we've also said that we plan to continuously improve and build upon the progress we've made to further accelerate our vision and our growth objectives. We operate in an increasingly competitive environment. And in order to remain competitive and grow sales and earnings, we will continue to focus on further investing in our businesses and technology, reducing our cost of capital, enhancing the risk-adjusted returns we earn on our products and investments and transforming our operations to produce efficiencies while enhancing both our customer and employee experience.  So we're taking steps to create a leaner, faster and more agile company, including simplifying our management structure by reducing management layers, complexities and costs with the goal of bringing our integrated teams closer to our customers and our clients. We're also empowering our employees with faster decision-making in part through investments in technology and data platforms. And as we make progress in each of these areas, we'll update you as we have in the past. So with that as context, Ken, let me turn it over to you to answer the specific question Ryan had.\nKenneth Tanji: Yes. So I think, Ryan, we expect, as you just heard from Charlie, a number of benefits in the way we're transforming but also financially, the restructuring will result in annual cost savings that will be greater than the restructuring charge of $200 million. And those savings will provide expense capacity to invest in capabilities and gain further efficiencies sort of, as Charlie described there to help offset inflation and also to grow our businesses. And the way we think when we put that all together is we'll be keeping expenses flat over the near term. . And that's, again, how we think of things holistically, not just the saves but also combined with the investments in growing our businesses while keeping operating expenses flat and improving margins. And that's the continuous improvement mindset that we're striving for.\nRyan Krueger: And then a question on Prismic, you launched it with $1 billion of capital. I assume that the structured settlements transaction consumed a good amount of that. Can you give us any color on how much committed capital that you have already in place for future growth?\nRobert Axel: Ryan, Rob, maybe let me give a perspective about that. If you're asking that from the perspective of sort of the Prismic standpoint in terms of the appetite there. A couple of thoughts. One is, as Charlie actually indicated in opening remarks, we see very interesting opportunities, growth opportunities that are at the intersection of asset management and insurance, and we expect Prismic to play a material role in executing against that. And we think the benefit of that is it's going to actually accelerate growth across all of our businesses. . And in the course of doing so, actually helped to shift the business mix so that it's higher growth, less market-sensitive and more highly valued at the end of the day. With respect to Prismic itself, I think what we've articulated before is that we and our investors share operations that go well beyond the initial $10 billion structured settlement transaction. So we anticipate that, that will include opportunities to further optimize our balance sheet. It's going to include what's closed. So the reserve and capital financing for our new sales across our businesses and importantly, third-party blocks that will be -- we're looking to reinsure into Prismic as well.\nOperator: Next question is coming from John Barnidge from Piper Sandler.\nJohn Barnidge: Great. Appreciate the opportunity. The restructuring program, you talked about a portion being there to invest. Can you talk about human capital versus automation and then the offshoring opportunity as well?\nCharles Lowrey: Sure. It's Charlie again. As part of the continuous improvement process, we'll be simplifying our operating model and organizational structure, as you said, really streamlining decision-making to create a leaner, faster and more agile company so we can better meet the needs -- better meet the needs of our customers while driving growth and efficiency.  So we are far more focused on optimizing organizational structure through organizational design and investments in technology as opposed to offshoring. That is the predominant direction in which we're going. .\nJohn Barnidge: Fantastic. And my follow-up question, can you maybe talk about M&A interest? Do you have what you need to grow organically from a product perspective? And is there opportunities for PGIM to get larger insurances?\nCharles Lowrey: Yes. It's Charlie again. Let me take that. We've done many acquisitions that have significantly grown the company over time. And these acquisitions include companies of various sizes as well as teams of specialists. And programmatic M&A, to your point, will continue to play a role as we think about the development of the -- of what we want to do going forward and a series of well-executed programmatic M&A transactions will become material over time. As a result, we continue to look at a variety of opportunities and different sizes. . But we're continuing to be thoughtful about the deployment of capital, especially in light of the current macroeconomic conditions. And our M&A interest continue to be focused on mature companies that support our strategy of growing PGIM and emerging markets by which we can expand our capabilities or our distribution and continue to increase the scale of our existing businesses. But regardless of size, we're going to be thoughtful about evaluating the strategic and the financial merits of each transaction.\nAndrew Sullivan: John, it's Andy. Maybe I'll just add in because you asked about PGIM we're going to continue to work to globalize the business. And as we've talked about before, focus on higher growth, higher fee areas. So you should think about private alternatives and real asset capabilities.\nOperator: Next question is coming from Wes Carmichael from Wells Fargo.\nWesley Carmichael: I had a question on RBC. I think your slide showed that PICA's RBC ratio is in excess of 3.75. I just wanted to confirm, is the benefit of negative IMR within that RBC ratio? And could you maybe just size that for us?\nKenneth Tanji: Yes, sure. It's Ken. Yes, that -- the benefit of admitting the negative IMR as part of the new standard is -- has been adopted and is in effect for our third quarter results. We were able to admit $1.3 billion, which is at the cap level relative to our surplus, so that is already reflected in there.\nWesley Carmichael: And maybe just a follow-up on an earlier question on Japan and ESR. Could you maybe just help us understand how your USD-denominated products are proposed to be treated under ESR versus the current SMR framework?\nRobert Falzon: It's Wes. Let me take that question. The -- first of all, this is a regulatory framework that's still in development, and I want to emphasize that. It's a regulatory framework that to date has been based on the international, the ICS capital standards that have been developed, and those standards are actually not -- don't necessarily reflect the underlying economics of more iteration product, particularly in the U.S.  So we continue to work on the international front on the ICS, and we continue to work with Japan as well in terms of how that ultimately gets reflected into their regime, whether it's modified at the international level or not. But what we found is one of the coming of the current set of proposals is that they don't quite get the economics right when you get into the -- the types of long duration products that are typically sold in the U.S., both on the life side and on the retirement side.  So that's an area where industry continues to work with the regulators and we're hopeful of making progress there. As Ken mentioned earlier, to the extent that's challenged any way that we do have alternatives that are available to us to think about how we would then manage that product on a go-forward basis.  There's a strong demand for the products in the Japan marketplace. So for Japanese consumers like the U.S. dollar-denominated products. And so the industry will want to continue to sell those products in the marketplace, and we'll come up with solutions for being able to do that and be able to finance that on an economic basis. .\nAndrew Sullivan: This is Andy. I was just going to add in. We have a lot of ability and flexibility to navigate those changes that are coming at us. We obviously have incredibly strong distribution, both captive and third party. We have a very wide product portfolio from both a yen and U.S. dollar perspective and single premium and recurring premium and we've been very successful at delivering a top-notch, great customer experience that we've been recognized for. So the strength of that business complex will really enable us to navigate the changes that are coming down the road.\nOperator: Next question is coming from Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan.\nJimmy Bhullar: First a question on PGIM flows. If you could just talk about what drove the negative flows in both retail and institutional funds? And to what extent do you think it's a function of just industry-wide issues that asset managers are seeing versus maybe the slight dip that you saw in your performance? And then relatedly, the impact on fees, should it be considered to the assets? Or are the fees lower or higher on the assets that you've lost?\nAndrew Sullivan: So Jimmy, it's Andy. I'll take your question. So this quarter, we experienced third-party outflows of $5.7 billion. On the retail end, outflows were $1.9 billion. That was predominantly an equity story. We've seen clients rebound for a variety of reasons, including to recognize gains as the funds have performed well.  We have produced strong equity performance with 89% of our equity asset performing benchmark in the last year. On institutional side, outflows were $3.8 billion. Net outflows were primarily fixed income. We are seeing a lower level of gross inflows into this asset class. Investors are hesitant to come back in until it's clear rates have stabilized.  We also saw 1 large low fee rate mandate lapse in institutional. As to your question, industry or specific, these are consistent with the industry. And in particular, the fixed income headwinds are consistent. As far as our outlook looking forward, a stable higher rate environment will be good for our flow. So we know that once rates stabilize, we expect to benefit flow-wise.  Your question around fees, obviously, it depends very much on the mix of assets, but we're being very successful in bringing inflows into higher fee rate strategies, in particular, into the private alts areas of our business.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then on Individual Life, that's a business where the results have been weak the past several quarters, but this quarter was actually a good quarter. I think you mentioned in the presentation, there's a benefit from lower expenses and a legal reserve release. Can you quantify how much each was so that one gets an idea on sort of the underlying earnings in the business? And what your outlook is for individual Life earnings? .\nCaroline Feeney: Yes. So Jimmy, it's Caroline, and I'll take your question. So as you mentioned, this quarter, Individual Life did see favorable expense experience and that includes a number of onetime items, but it also, as you mentioned, does include the release of a legal reserve.  So Jimmy, it's our practice to regularly review our legal reserves and then make appropriate adjustments reflecting activity within the quarter. And the release this quarter reflects the results of that review. In terms of the outlook for life overall, I would say, in addition to what you saw in favorable expenses on the life side, we also saw strong investment results and also underwriting results that were largely aligned to our expectations and overall fundamentals of the business continue to remain very solid, and we're very optimistic about the growth there.\nJimmy Bhullar: And just any color on the size of the legal reserve because that I view that more as sort of a onetime versus expenses tend to move around. .\nCaroline Feeney: Jimmy, I would not comment on the specific size of a particular legal reserve, as I said. We saw favorable expenses overall and part of that was the release of a league overserved, but we do not comment on the specific size of a case.\nOperator: Next question is coming from Tracy Benguigui from Barclays.\nTracy Benguigui: I know it's early, but I was wondering if you could just share your thoughts on DOL and the impact on your FIA business.\nCaroline Feeney: Sure, Tracy, it's Caroline, and I'll take your question. So I'll first start off by saying, Tracy, we've been a long-time support of regulations that provide consumer protections while ensuring that all Americans continue to have access to quality advice and the solutions they need for a secure retirement.  So the proposal was just released 2 days ago, and so we're very much still in the midst of thoroughly reviewing and analyzing it so we can assess any potential impact on our customers and specifically their ability to access critical retirement products.  And you specifically strike you about. So we do realize that in the proposal, there appears to be a focus on fixed indexed annuities, which today, for us, accounts for less than 20% of our total annuity sales, but are also part of a well diversified suite of annuity solutions as we continue to focus on delivering valuable solutions to help our customers meet their retirement savings needs -- that being said, I will just reiterate that we're still in the process of reviewing the proposed rule. And finally, I'll just add that under the last proposed rule change, we implemented policies and procedures to comply with the final prohibited transaction exemption in a timely fashion, and we'd expect to do the same here.\nTracy Benguigui: Do you think that evolution also took place in the IMO channel or they could comply with new standards? .\nCaroline Feeney: I'm sorry, Tracy, I want to make sure I heard your question.\nTracy Benguigui: The IMO channel independent agents Yes, would they also be well equipped since the last proposal?\nCaroline Feeney: So what I could improve on Yes. So Tracy, what I couldn't comment on is others in terms of their IMO channels and whether they'd be prepared or not. What I will say, particularly, and I'll just reiterate with the last DOL-proposed rule, we were very much ready as an entire enterprise across all of the various businesses where there was any impact, and we are ready to comply with the rule. And as I mentioned, we would expect to do the same here. That would include all of the distribution channels that would, in any way, be impacted by the new proposed rule.\nTracy Benguigui: Got it. I want to touch on Prismic and thinking about the investor consortium. Could you let me know like what they're thinking in terms of an investment time horizon? Will there be like a call option being arbitrary here but, let's say, like in 10 years, would prune to provide liquidity to those investors after a set period of time? Or do you envision raising new funds?\nRobert Falzon: Tracy, it's Rob. So we're partnering with a group of very large global institutional investors. Their intent is to operate with scale. And their investment horizon very much aligned with our own is quite long term. Prismic itself has an independent Board of Directors, and that will govern the route toward growth and otherwise. But there are no put or call provisions embedded in the agreement that we've got with Prismic.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is coming from Wilma Burdis from Raymond James.\nWilma Burdis: A couple of earnings-related questions. First, I think you guys previously cited $65 million of deal closing costs with Somerset Re. I just want to know if that would lower the 275 baseline for 4Q? Or maybe just an update on timing there? And then the other is, if you could walk us through the trajectory of benefits from the restructuring. Will we see a benefit in 1Q? Or is it going to take a little bit longer?\nKenneth Tanji: Yes. It's Ken. The deal-related costs for the reinsurance with Summerset Re will be incurred at the time of closing, and those have not been included in the baseline. And I'm sorry. And obviously, I think your second part of the question was the benefits of the restructuring or the benefits of the reinsurance will occur subsequent to close, obviously. .\nWilma Burdis: Yes, the restructuring, should we start to see some benefits coming in 1Q? Or is it going to take some time?\nKenneth Tanji: Are you say the organizational restructuring, is that what you're referring to or the reinsurer. I'm sorry. We will see benefits in 2020 for pretty soon thereafter, there will be a portion that's highly -- that's effective in the first quarter and then thereafter.\nWilma Burdis: And could you talk about the impact of Prismic on Pages RBC -- just -- I know there was a little bit of a holdco liquidity impact from the initial investments. So could you just talk about that aspect as well?\nKenneth Tanji: Sure. The initial impact of the reinsurance of the structured settlement the Prismic was modest, and that was impact -- that was in our RBC ratio for September. And so we had the impact of the initial portion of that. But over time, it will also enable capital benefits as we reallocate the retained investment portfolio. And so it will -- we had some impact immediately, but they also will have continued impact as we reallocate the investment portfolio.\nOperator: Next question today is coming from Suneet Kamath from Jefferies.\nSuneet Kamath: Great. I wanted to go to Prismic again. Charlie, I think in your prepared remarks, you talked about further optimization of your in-force block. And I think you specifically referred to life and annuity blocks. Is that sort of the extent to where we should be thinking about in terms of where you'd optimize? I guess where I'm going with this is there an opportunity for something like a long-term care in terms of your in-force and reinsuring that to Prismic?\nCharles Lowrey: Sure. Let me take a step back and just tell you generally how we're thinking about this. This makes really an example of our open architecture solutions and is a very important additional component of our strategy to become a higher growth, less market-sensitive and more nimble company. We formed Prismic with Warburg Pincus and other global investors because we see significant opportunities that exist at the intersection, as Rob said, of asset management and insurance.  And we're perfectly positioned to take advantage of those opportunities in the business which we have. And we're excited about our ability to leverage third-party capital and reinsurance to drive the incremental growth in our insurance, retirement and asset management businesses. And Prismic, to get, to your point, really reinforces and enhances our mutually reinforcing business system in 3 ways.  First, we can reinsure portions of our in-force business like the structural settlements transaction we just completed and have PGIM continue to manage the majority of assets locking up capital to become less market sensitive. And to your point, we'll look to our retirement and life businesses for those assets.  Secondly, we can write new business that could be reinsured to Prismic, so forward flow. And since Prismic is mainly supported by third-party capital, we can write additional retirement and insurance business to further accelerate our growth and at the same time, increase PGIM's assets under management.  And finally, Prismic can reinsure third-party blocks, which would again increased PGIM's AUM. So there's a lot of potential we see for Prismic, and we're being thoughtful about how we execute against these opportunities and have recently reallocated resources to further optimize and cap our will further optimize our capabilities since Prismic is such an important component of our mutually reinforcing business system. So it's going to be in the life and retirement businesses mainly that we think about reinsuring other blocks, but we could think about others as we go forward.\nRobert Falzon: Suneet, it's Robert. I'd sort of add as sort of a general market observation to Charlie's remarks is that we've seen investors that are behind many of the reinsurance vehicles in partnership and otherwise, having an increasingly higher appetite for a variety of different products. So this started out very much if you look at the early reinsurance transactions in the sort of very vanilla insurance space and in the very vanilla annuity space of fixed annuities.  And over time, what you've seen on our own transactions as well as others is that now is expanded into variable annuities. It's expanded into GUL, and we do see that that's a trend that's likely to continue. There's a robust appetite and that appetite as it gets -- as investors get more comfortable with the dynamics of the insurance marketplace and business model that their appetite will continue to grow. So we see interesting opportunities, both domestically and importantly internationally as well.\nSuneet Kamath: Okay. Got it. And then I guess on the VA deal, the proceeds from that transaction still in PICA and is the expectation that they'll just sort of stay there and be used to support organic growth? Or would you expect to take those proceeds up to holdco for other uses?\nKenneth Tanji: Yes, it's Ken. So the reinsurance of our variable annuity block closed in April. And so we had the benefit of that effective April 1, and it is one of the considerations we made as we looked at our RBC and our dividend capacity and factored into the dividends that we made in the third quarter, which was $1 billion from PICA.  So we did get the benefit. It's one of the things we thought about when we looked at the overall level of our RBC and then decided to make a dividend to PICA of $1 billion in the third quarter.\nSuneet Kamath: Sorry, dividend out of PICA.\nKenneth Tanji: Yes, I'm sorry, yes.\nSuneet Kamath: So just a quick follow-up there. I was just trying to track the holdco cash because it looked like it went down a little bit sequentially. Can you just kind of give us some of the bigger moving pieces there?\nKenneth Tanji: Sure. Yes. The bigger moving pieces, like I just mentioned, was the $1 billion that the holding company received from PICA as a dividend. And then we also made a $200 million investment in Prismic and then the other would be ordinary course, interest expense and shareholder distributions. And those are the main components that led to a very small change in our HLA.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Michael Ward from Citi.\nMichael Ward: Another one on Prismic. But for the third-party component and the mechanics, if PGIM could get the AUM of new blocks being reinsured, wouldn't the general account of the external blocks go on your balance sheet? Because I wouldn't have thought that you're targeting exposure to third-party capital intensive business.\nRobert Falzon: Mike, it's Rob. So yes, PGIM will have an appetite for doing both flow and balance sheet from Prudential as well as third parties. We will look to put -- and yes, we will get the asset management on those blocks as they're brought into Prismic. So that's part of the arrangement that we have with Prismic. And then separately, we'll make a decision as to how much we invest in Prismic on a go-forward basis. . As of now, our ownership in Prismic is at a 20% level. It's not a contractual application for us to stay at that level. But having said that, we think that the returns that we get for a capital that could be deployed through Prismic when you think about the returns on the underlying blocks enhanced by the fees that we get from from our asset management business could be quite attractive on a risk-reward basis.  And so we would have some appetite for continuing to invest in those sorts of business when they significantly enhance the fee components that we get out of that business, which on an overall basis with a reduced risk profile of the earnings stream on a go forward.\nMichael Ward: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe one thing we didn't touch on CRE, commercial real estate. Any developments for you guys in the office area?\nRobert Falzon: No, I would say that -- it's Rob again. Sorry, Mike, that nothing material to update you on from last quarter. We have a very high-quality overall real estate portfolio, including the office components to that or component of that. And we continue to see resiliency within that portfolio, as you would expect, given the experience that we have there, the dedicated team that we have from an underwriting standpoint and the quality of the overall portfolio.  So while on the -- from a valuation standpoint, but updating our valuations and the valuations of the collateral supporting office loans continues to come down, but our LTV still remain quite low on a relative basis, and we feel very comfortable with the overall portfolio exposure there.\nOperator: Our next question is a follow-up from Wes Carmichael from Wells Fargo.\nWesley Carmichael: Just had a couple of earnings ones should be quick. But on the baseline for Q4, the $2.75 that includes normal variable investment income. So I was just hoping if you could help us with your outlook in the near term. It's a pretty modest headwind in the third quarter, but just wondering if you expect that to be a bit challenged going forward.\nRobert Falzon: See, from a VII standpoint, Wes, it's Rob. I think about that as having 2 components to it. One is the returns that we get from our alternatives portfolio and the second being the level of prepayment income that we get from the fixed income portfolio. I think we've guided to the fact that we expect lower levels of prepayment income on a go-forward basis. That was the primary contributor to the below expectations in the current quarter.  So I think you should expect to see that. On a go-forward basis, we generally don't provide an outlook. What I would say is that as even the current quarter, we have a good portfolio that's very well diversified. And so while there are different components of it that performed up and down in the current quarter, we would expect that to continue in future quarters as well. In this particular quarter, real estate performance was off, as you would expect.  But actually, our private equity portfolio performed quite well. And just to be very clear, within our private equity portfolio, we have a very small exposure to sort of the DC area. So it's more core private equity. And even within that, it's a fairly significant component of that that's in high yield and debt strategies. And so that sort of caused some stabilization within that private equity portfolio.  So I think that we will vary as markets do, but we continue to believe that we'll perform on a relevant basis quite well.\nWesley Carmichael: Got it. And then on PGIM, I think you lowered your expected range for other related revenues by about $10 million on a quarterly basis. Just curious if you can provide us some color on what's driving that there.\nAndrew Sullivan: Yes, Wes, it's Andy. I'll take your question. So ORR came in at the quarter at $37 million. It was predominantly driven by the real estate space. So this is a pretty consistent story. That's been the last few quarters.  Our agency earning decline from the real estate slowdown, and we saw lower real estate valuations and transactions. As far as the go-forward look, you are correct. We now expect our ORR to average about $40 million per quarter. That lower run rate, again, is flowing directly from the slowdown in the real estate markets. we're expecting to see lower agency earnings as well as lower private incentive fees. And while this will vary quarter-to-quarter as always, we expect the patterns that we've been seeing to be more muted in this environment.\nOperator: We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Lowrey for any further closing comments.\nCharles Lowrey: Okay. Thank you again for joining us today. We're entering into the next chapter of our evolution with a unique business model and growth strategy that positions Prudential to help current and future generation secure financial future. We are confident that our strategy and mutually reimbursing business model will enable Prudential to be a global leader in expanding access to investing insurance and retirement security. Thank you again, and stay well.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

            "name": "Kenneth Tanji",
            "content": "Thanks, Rob. I'll begin on Slide 10, which provides insight into earnings for the fourth quarter of 2023 relative to our third quarter results. As noted, pretax adjusted operating income in the third quarter was $1.6 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $3.44 on an after-tax basis. To get a sense of how our fourth quarter results might develop we suggest adjustments for the following items: First, variable investment income was below expectations in the third quarter by $25 million. Second, we adjust underwriting experience by $10 million to normalize for third quarter experience. . And last, we include an adjustment of $350 million for expenses and other items. This includes elevated seasonal expenses and lower international earnings due to timing of seasonal premiums in the fourth quarter. In addition, as Charlie mentioned, we are implementing changes to our organizational structure as part of our continuous improvement process, and we have included an estimated restructuring charge of approximately $200 million that will be incurred in the fourth quarter.  We expect these actions will create operating efficiencies and provide reinvestment capacity to build capabilities. This will allow us to realize additional efficiencies, strengthen our competitiveness and fuel future growth. These adjustments combined get us to a baseline of $2.75 per share for the fourth quarter.  I'll note that if you exclude items specific to the fourth quarter, earnings per share would be $3.48. The key takeaway is that our underlying earnings power continued to improve due to business growth, including the benefit of higher interest rates. While we have provided these items to consider, please note that there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the fourth quarter.  Turning to Slide 11. Our capital position continues to support our AA financial strength rating. Our cash and liquid assets were $4.3 billion within our liquidity target range of $3 billion to $5 billion. Regulatory capital ratios are above our targets, and we have substantial off-balance sheet resources, including approximately $9 billion of contingent capital and liquidity facilities. We remain thoughtful in our capital deployment, balancing the preservation of financial strength and flexibility, investment in our businesses for long-term growth and shareholder distributions.  Turning to Slide 12 and in summary. We are transforming our business for sustainable growth. We continue to navigate the current macro environment with the financial strength of our rock solid balance sheet, and we are maintaining a balanced and disciplined approach to capital deployment. Now I'll turn it to the operator for your questions. Tom, it's Ken. Our GAAP results included the mark-to-market on interest rate hedges and a portion of that increased our negative IMR balance for stat. But our RBC ratios remain above our target and didn't require a capital contribution. Yes. Sure. First, let me start with our Japan businesses financial profile, which the businesses are high quality profitable, financially strong, generating earnings, strong earnings and have good solvency margin ratios under the current regime. The FSA is taking steps to implement new capital standards and that's underway with adoption still now a couple of years away.  But generally, we still believe our businesses are well capitalized, financially strong, and that would be evident under any reasonable capital standard. We also have ways to manage the outcomes we can reinsure business internally or externally to better match the economics of the business if we need to do that. And so we're -- it's something that we're looking at and working on. We're also advocating for reasonable and responsible standards and we'll have strategies to adapt to the new potential regime. Yes. So I think, Ryan, we expect, as you just heard from Charlie, a number of benefits in the way we're transforming but also financially, the restructuring will result in annual cost savings that will be greater than the restructuring charge of $200 million. And those savings will provide expense capacity to invest in capabilities and gain further efficiencies sort of, as Charlie described there to help offset inflation and also to grow our businesses. And the way we think when we put that all together is we'll be keeping expenses flat over the near term. . And that's, again, how we think of things holistically, not just the saves but also combined with the investments in growing our businesses while keeping operating expenses flat and improving margins. And that's the continuous improvement mindset that we're striving for. Yes, sure. It's Ken. Yes, that -- the benefit of admitting the negative IMR as part of the new standard is -- has been adopted and is in effect for our third quarter results. We were able to admit $1.3 billion, which is at the cap level relative to our surplus, so that is already reflected in there. Yes. It's Ken. The deal-related costs for the reinsurance with Summerset Re will be incurred at the time of closing, and those have not been included in the baseline. And I'm sorry. And obviously, I think your second part of the question was the benefits of the restructuring or the benefits of the reinsurance will occur subsequent to close, obviously. . Are you say the organizational restructuring, is that what you're referring to or the reinsurer. I'm sorry. We will see benefits in 2020 for pretty soon thereafter, there will be a portion that's highly -- that's effective in the first quarter and then thereafter. Sure. The initial impact of the reinsurance of the structured settlement the Prismic was modest, and that was impact -- that was in our RBC ratio for September. And so we had the impact of the initial portion of that. But over time, it will also enable capital benefits as we reallocate the retained investment portfolio. And so it will -- we had some impact immediately, but they also will have continued impact as we reallocate the investment portfolio. Yes, it's Ken. So the reinsurance of our variable annuity block closed in April. And so we had the benefit of that effective April 1, and it is one of the considerations we made as we looked at our RBC and our dividend capacity and factored into the dividends that we made in the third quarter, which was $1 billion from PICA.  So we did get the benefit. It's one of the things we thought about when we looked at the overall level of our RBC and then decided to make a dividend to PICA of $1 billion in the third quarter. Yes, I'm sorry, yes. Sure. Yes. The bigger moving pieces, like I just mentioned, was the $1 billion that the holding company received from PICA as a dividend. And then we also made a $200 million investment in Prismic and then the other would be ordinary course, interest expense and shareholder distributions. And those are the main components that led to a very small change in our HLA."

            "content": "John, it's Andy. Maybe I'll just add in because you asked about PGIM we're going to continue to work to globalize the business. And as we've talked about before, focus on higher growth, higher fee areas. So you should think about private alternatives and real asset capabilities. This is Andy. I was just going to add in. We have a lot of ability and flexibility to navigate those changes that are coming at us. We obviously have incredibly strong distribution, both captive and third party. We have a very wide product portfolio from both a yen and U.S. dollar perspective and single premium and recurring premium and we've been very successful at delivering a top-notch, great customer experience that we've been recognized for. So the strength of that business complex will really enable us to navigate the changes that are coming down the road. So Jimmy, it's Andy. I'll take your question. So this quarter, we experienced third-party outflows of $5.7 billion. On the retail end, outflows were $1.9 billion. That was predominantly an equity story. We've seen clients rebound for a variety of reasons, including to recognize gains as the funds have performed well.  We have produced strong equity performance with 89% of our equity asset performing benchmark in the last year. On institutional side, outflows were $3.8 billion. Net outflows were primarily fixed income. We are seeing a lower level of gross inflows into this asset class. Investors are hesitant to come back in until it's clear rates have stabilized.  We also saw 1 large low fee rate mandate lapse in institutional. As to your question, industry or specific, these are consistent with the industry. And in particular, the fixed income headwinds are consistent. As far as our outlook looking forward, a stable higher rate environment will be good for our flow. So we know that once rates stabilize, we expect to benefit flow-wise.  Your question around fees, obviously, it depends very much on the mix of assets, but we're being very successful in bringing inflows into higher fee rate strategies, in particular, into the private alts areas of our business. Yes, Wes, it's Andy. I'll take your question. So ORR came in at the quarter at $37 million. It was predominantly driven by the real estate space. So this is a pretty consistent story. That's been the last few quarters.  Our agency earning decline from the real estate slowdown, and we saw lower real estate valuations and transactions. As far as the go-forward look, you are correct. We now expect our ORR to average about $40 million per quarter.

            "name": "Robert Axel",
            "content": "Ryan, Rob, maybe let me give a perspective about that. If you're asking that from the perspective of sort of the Prismic standpoint in terms of the appetite there. A couple of thoughts. One is, as Charlie actually indicated in opening remarks, we see very interesting opportunities, growth opportunities that are at the intersection of asset management and insurance, and we expect Prismic to play a material role in executing against that. And we think the benefit of that is it's going to actually accelerate growth across all of our businesses. . And in the course of doing so, actually helped to shift the business mix so that it's higher growth, less market-sensitive and more highly valued at the end of the day. With respect to Prismic itself, I think what we've articulated before is that we and our investors share operations that go well beyond the initial $10 billion structured settlement transaction. So we anticipate that, that will include opportunities to further optimize our balance sheet. It's going to include what's closed. So the reserve and capital financing for our new sales across our businesses and importantly, third-party blocks that will be -- we're looking to reinsure into Prismic as well."
        },
        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Caroline Feeney",
            "content": "Yes. So Jimmy, it's Caroline, and I'll take your question. So as you mentioned, this quarter, Individual Life did see favorable expense experience and that includes a number of onetime items, but it also, as you mentioned, does include the release of a legal reserve.  So Jimmy, it's our practice to regularly review our legal reserves and then make appropriate adjustments reflecting activity within the quarter. And the release this quarter reflects the results of that review. In terms of the outlook for life overall, I would say, in addition to what you saw in favorable expenses on the life side, we also saw strong investment results and also underwriting results that were largely aligned to our expectations and overall fundamentals of the business continue to remain very solid, and we're very optimistic about the growth there. Jimmy, I would not comment on the specific size of a particular legal reserve, as I said. We saw favorable expenses overall and part of that was the release of a league overserved, but we do not comment on the specific size of a case. Sure, Tracy, it's Caroline, and I'll take your question. So I'll first start off by saying, Tracy, we've been a long-time support of regulations that provide consumer protections while ensuring that all Americans continue to have access to quality advice and the solutions they need for a secure retirement.  So the proposal was just released 2 days ago, and so we're very much still in the midst of thoroughly reviewing and analyzing it so we can assess any potential impact on our customers and specifically their ability to access critical retirement products.  And you specifically strike you about. So we do realize that in the proposal, there appears to be a focus on fixed indexed annuities, which today, for us, accounts for less than 20% of our total annuity sales, but are also part of a well diversified suite of annuity solutions as we continue to focus on delivering valuable solutions to help our customers meet their retirement savings needs -- that being said, I will just reiterate that we're still in the process of reviewing the proposed rule. And finally, I'll just add that under the last proposed rule change, we implemented policies and procedures to comply with the final prohibited transaction exemption in a timely fashion, and we'd expect to do the same here. I'm sorry, Tracy, I want to make sure I heard your question. So what I could improve on Yes. So Tracy, what I couldn't comment on is others in terms of their IMO channels and whether they'd be prepared or not. What I will say, particularly, and I'll just reiterate with the last DOL-proposed rule, we were very much ready as an entire enterprise across all of the various businesses where there was any impact, and we are ready to comply with the rule. And as I mentioned, we would expect to do the same here. That would include all of the distribution channels that would, in any way, be impacted by the new proposed rule."

        "speaker5": {
            "name": "Charles Lowrey",
            "content": "Thank you, Bob, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our third quarter results reflect continued momentum across our businesses, excluding the benefits from strong sales and the fifth consecutive quarter of underlying earnings growth. We continue to execute on our strategy to become a higher growth, less market-sensitive and more nimble company. This quarter, we increased our capital efficiency and enhanced our capabilities in mutually reinforcing business system.  We are also optimizing our operating model to drive both efficiency and growth. Our strategic progress and financial strength position us well to navigate the current macroeconomic environment and maintain a disciplined approach to capital deployment.  Turning to Slide 3. During the quarter, we launched Prismic, a life and annuity reinsurance company alongside Warburg Pincus and other investors. It is one of our most exciting opportunities to drive sustainable long-term growth across our investment management, insurance and retirement businesses. Through Prismic, we can ensure portions of our life and annuity in-force and new business to reduce market sensitivity, free up capital and invest in growth opportunities. Prismic can also offer its services to other insurance companies in need of reinsurance support, tapping into additional sources of third-party capital to drive further growth.  In addition, Prismic expands PGIM's assets under management. Prismic is a great example of how Prudential can unlock value for customers, shareholders and other stakeholders with our mutually reinforcing business system, which combines the power of our brand, global asset and liability origination capabilities and multichannel distribution. We're also growing and investing in our businesses to better serve our customers through both the products and services we offer and through the ways we do business.  Our distribution channels continue to evolve and expand to provide more people around the world with our products and services in the way they want them. I'll provide a few examples from the third quarter. In Brazil, we achieved the second consecutive quarter of record sales, driven by continued expansion in the third-party distribution channel and the strong performance of our Life Planner channel.  In the U.S., individual retirement strategies posted its strongest sales quarter in 3 years, driven by the continued success of FlexGuard as well as the expansion of our fixed annuity suite with the launch of our new Wealth Guard multiyear guaranteed annuity. Within the Institutional market, retirement strategy secured $2.5 billion in new pension risk transfer transactions to the health savings account space by securing a $1.2 billion transaction with a top HSA provider, expanding our addressable market.  And in our Prudential Advisors distribution channel, we announced a strategic relationship with LPL Financial, which upon completion in the latter part of next year, will enhance both our adviser and customer experience by leveraging LPL's expertise, industry-leading technology and robust broker dealer and registered investment adviser services.  Alongside these investments in our businesses, we continue to focus on customer service through enhanced sales and claims platforms. For example, this year, we have announced 7 customer experience technology partnerships within group insurance. These include Enrolofy, an innovative platform transforming the enrollment experience for millions of employees and Evolution IQ, an AI-driven platform that will streamline the disability claims process.  We're also working to create a leaner, faster and more agile company so that we can better meet the changing needs and expectations of our customers around the world while driving growth and efficiency to further strengthen our competitive position. We're taking new steps to simplify our organizational structure by reducing management layers, complexity and costs while making investments in technology and data platforms.  Our goal is to empower faster decision-making and bring our integrated business teams closer to our customers and clients. Turning now to Slide 4. Prudential's rock solid balance sheet and robust risk and capital management frameworks have allowed us to confidently navigate the current macroeconomic environment. Our AA financial strength is supported by our strong capital position, including approximately $48 billion of unrealized insurance margins, $4.3 billion in highly liquid assets at the end of the third quarter and a high-quality, well-diversified investment portfolio and disciplined approach to asset liability management.  Moving to Slide 5. Our disciplined approach to capital deployment, coupled with the added capital efficiency from the Prismic transaction enables us to effectively balance investing in the long-term growth of our businesses with returning capital to shareholders. In the third quarter, we returned over $700 million of capital to shareholders.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob. Ryan, it's Charlie. Let me take that at a high level and provide you some context and then turn it over to Ken to specifically answer your question. But in terms of the restructuring program, we made good progress towards becoming a higher growth, less market-sensitive and more nimble company. . And if you think about what we've done, that's including releasing a significant amount of capital through the disposition of market-sensitive and/or low-growth businesses and products executing a series of programmatic acquisitions to expand our investment capabilities and growth potential. Launching Prismic, another arrow in our quiver, if you will, enhancing our mutual reinforcing business system and then exceeding our initial expense goal that we established a number of years ago.  But we've also said that we plan to continuously improve and build upon the progress we've made to further accelerate our vision and our growth objectives. We operate in an increasingly competitive environment. And in order to remain competitive and grow sales and earnings, we will continue to focus on further investing in our businesses and technology, reducing our cost of capital, enhancing the risk-adjusted returns we earn on our products and investments and transforming our operations to produce efficiencies while enhancing both our customer and employee experience.  So we're taking steps to create a leaner, faster and more agile company, including simplifying our management structure by reducing management layers, complexities and costs with the goal of bringing our integrated teams closer to our customers and our clients. We're also empowering our employees with faster decision-making in part through investments in technology and data platforms. And as we make progress in each of these areas, we'll update you as we have in the past. So with that as context, Ken, let me turn it over to you to answer the specific question Ryan had. Sure. It's Charlie again. As part of the continuous improvement process, we'll be simplifying our operating model and organizational structure, as you said, really streamlining decision-making to create a leaner, faster and more agile company so we can better meet the needs -- better meet the needs of our customers while driving growth and efficiency.  So we are far more focused on optimizing organizational structure through organizational design and investments in technology as opposed to offshoring. That is the predominant direction in which we're going. . Yes. It's Charlie again. Let me take that. We've done many acquisitions that have significantly grown the company over time. And these acquisitions include companies of various sizes as well as teams of specialists. And programmatic M&A, to your point, will continue to play a role as we think about the development of the -- of what we want to do going forward and a series of well-executed programmatic M&A transactions will become material over time. As a result, we continue to look at a variety of opportunities and different sizes. . But we're continuing to be thoughtful about the deployment of capital, especially in light of the current macroeconomic conditions. And our M&A interest continue to be focused on mature companies that support our strategy of growing PGIM and emerging markets by which we can expand our capabilities or our distribution and continue to increase the scale of our existing businesses. But regardless of size, we're going to be thoughtful about evaluating the strategic and the financial merits of each transaction. Sure. Let me take a step back and just tell you generally how we're thinking about this. This makes really an example of our open architecture solutions and is a very important additional component of our strategy to become a higher growth, less market-sensitive and more nimble company. We formed Prismic with Warburg Pincus and other global investors because we see significant opportunities that exist at the intersection, as Rob said, of asset management and insurance.  And we're perfectly positioned to take advantage of those opportunities in the business which we have. And we're excited about our ability to leverage third-party capital and reinsurance to drive the incremental growth in our insurance, retirement and asset management businesses. And Prismic, to get, to your point, really reinforces and enhances our mutually reinforcing business system in 3 ways.  First, we can reinsure portions of our in-force business like the structural settlements transaction we just completed and have PGIM continue to manage the majority of assets locking up capital to become less market sensitive. And to your point, we'll look to our retirement and life businesses for those assets.  Secondly, we can write new business that could be reinsured to Prismic, so forward flow. And since Prismic is mainly supported by third-party capital, we can write additional retirement and insurance business to further accelerate our growth and at the same time, increase PGIM's assets under management.  And finally, Prismic can reinsure third-party blocks, which would again increased PGIM's AUM. So there's a lot of potential we see for Prismic, and we're being thoughtful about how we execute against these opportunities and have recently reallocated resources to further optimize and cap our will further optimize our capabilities since Prismic is such an important component of our mutually reinforcing business system. So it's going to be in the life and retirement businesses mainly that we think about reinsuring other blocks, but we could think about others as we go forward. Okay. Thank you again for joining us today. We're entering into the next chapter of our evolution with a unique business model and growth strategy that positions Prudential to help current and future generation secure financial future. We are confident that our strategy and mutually reimbursing business model will enable Prudential to be a global leader in expanding access to investing insurance and retirement security. Thank you again, and stay well."

            "name": "Robert Falzon",
            "content": "Thank you, Charlie. I'll provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for our PGIM U.S. and International businesses. I'll begin on Slide 6 with our financial results for the third quarter of 2023. Our pretax adjusted operating income was $1.6 billion $3.44 per share on an after-tax basis, up 45% from the year ago quarter. These results reflect underlying business growth, including the benefits from a higher interest rate environment, more favorable variable investment income and underwriting experience, partially offset by lower fee income. . Our GAAP net loss was $2.1 billion lower than our after-tax adjusted operating income, primarily driven by mark-to-market losses on interest rate derivatives due to the higher rates. Turning to the operating results from our businesses compared to the year ago quarter. PGIM, our global investment manager, had lower other related revenues driven by lower agency and seed and co-investment earnings and higher expenses.  Results of our U.S. businesses primarily reflected higher spread income, including more favorable variable investment income and lower expenses, partially offset by lower fee income and the increase in earnings in our International businesses primarily reflected higher spread income.  Turning to Slide 7. PGIM, our global active investment manager has diversified capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed income, equities and alternatives. PGIM's long-term investment performance remains attractive with 80% or more of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last 5- and 10-year periods.  In addition, our short-term performance continues to improve with 83% of assets exceeding their benchmarks over a 1-year period. PGIM experienced third-party net outflows of $5.7 billion in the quarter, Institutional outflows were primarily driven by lower than normal fixed income inflows and a large client outflow. Retail outflows were driven by sub-advised equity mandates.  As the investment engine of Prudential, the success and growth of PGIM end of our U.S. and International insurance and retirement businesses are mutually reinforcing. PGIM's asset origination capabilities, investment management expertise and access to institutional and other sources of private capital, including through the recently launched reinsurer of Prismic, our competitive advantage, helping our businesses bring enhanced solutions and create more value for our customers.  Our insurance and retirement businesses, in turn, provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated net flows as well as unique access to insurance liabilities. In addition, we continue to grow both organically and through acquisitions, our private alternatives and credit business, which has assets of approximately $230 billion across private corporate and infrastructure credit real estate equity and debt and secondary private equity.  Capital deployment across PGIM's private assets platform of $8 billion during the quarter benefited from robust private placement and direct lending originations. Turning to Slide 8. Our U.S. businesses produced diversified earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income and benefit from our complementary mix of longevity and mortality businesses. We continue to drive towards a higher value, higher growth and less market-sensitive mix of earnings, invest in our businesses to deliver best-in-class customer experiences and expand our addressable market with new financial solutions leveraging the capabilities across Prudential.  Retirement strategies generated strong sales of $6.7 billion in the third quarter across its institutional and individual lines of business. Our institutional retirement business has leading market capabilities, which helped to produce third quarter sales of $4.7 billion, including $2.5 billion of pension risk transfer transactions as well as strong stable value sales.  Individual Retirement posted $2 billion in sales, up 40% from the prior year quarter. Our product pivots have resulted in continued strong sales of FlexGuard and FlexGuard income, which represented about 2/3 of sales and fixed annuities that accounted for approximately 1/3 of sales this quarter. Our Individual Life sales increased 24% from the year ago quarter, reflecting our earlier product pivot strategy with variable life products representing approximately 73% of sales in the quarter, including the benefit from our recently launched FlexGuard Life product.  And in Group Insurance, we continue to execute on our strategy of product and client segment diversification while leveraging technology to increase operating efficiency and enhance the customer experience. Our strong results this quarter included favorable group life underwriting experience, which resulted in a benefit ratio of 82.4%.  Turning to Slide 9. Our International businesses include our Japanese life insurance companies where we have a differentiated multichannel distribution model as well as other businesses aimed at expanding our presence in targeted high-growth emerging markets. In Japan, we are focused on providing high-quality service and expanding our distribution and product offerings. Our needs-based approach and protection product focus continue to provide important value to our customers as we expand our product offerings to meet their evolving needs.  During the third quarter, we launched a new U.S. dollar indexed annuity product and Prudential of Japan was ranked as the #1 Japanese life insurer in the Forbes world best life insurance companies this year. We are proud to be recognized for the value we provide to our customers. In emerging markets, we are focused on creating a select portfolio of businesses in regions where our customer needs are growing, where there are compelling opportunities to build market-leading businesses and where the Prudential enterprise can add value. Our International business sales were up 19% compared to the year ago quarter. Life Planner sales were up 18%, driven by our second consecutive quarter of record sales in Brazil as well as higher sales in Japan.  Gibraltar sales were up 20%, primarily driven by growth in the bank channel. As we look ahead, we are well positioned to cross our businesses to be a global leader in expanding access to investing insurance and retirement security. We continue to focus on investing in growth businesses and markets, delivering industry-leading customer experiences and creating the next generation of financial solutions to serve the diverse needs of a broad range of customers.  And with that, I'll now turn it over to Ken. It's Wes. Let me take that question. The -- first of all, this is a regulatory framework that's still in development, and I want to emphasize that. It's a regulatory framework that to date has been based on the international, the ICS capital standards that have been developed, and those standards are actually not -- don't necessarily reflect the underlying economics of more iteration product, particularly in the U.S.  So we continue to work on the international front on the ICS, and we continue to work with Japan as well in terms of how that ultimately gets reflected into their regime, whether it's modified at the international level or not. But what we found is one of the coming of the current set of proposals is that they don't quite get the economics right when you get into the -- the types of long duration products that are typically sold in the U.S., both on the life side and on the retirement side.  So that's an area where industry continues to work with the regulators and we're hopeful of making progress there. As Ken mentioned earlier, to the extent that's challenged any way that we do have alternatives that are available to us to think about how we would then manage that product on a go-forward basis.  There's a strong demand for the products in the Japan marketplace. So for Japanese consumers like the U.S. dollar-denominated products. And so the industry will want to continue to sell those products in the marketplace, and we'll come up with solutions for being able to do that and be able to finance that on an economic basis. . Tracy, it's Rob. So we're partnering with a group of very large global institutional investors. Their intent is to operate with scale. And their investment horizon very much aligned with our own is quite long term. Prismic itself has an independent Board of Directors, and that will govern the route toward growth and otherwise. But there are no put or call provisions embedded in the agreement that we've got with Prismic. Suneet, it's Robert. I'd sort of add as sort of a general market observation to Charlie's remarks is that we've seen investors that are behind many of the reinsurance vehicles in partnership and otherwise, having an increasingly higher appetite for a variety of different products. So this started out very much if you look at the early reinsurance transactions in the sort of very vanilla insurance space and in the very vanilla annuity space of fixed annuities.  And over time, what you've seen on our own transactions as well as others is that now is expanded into variable annuities. It's expanded into GUL, and we do see that that's a trend that's likely to continue. There's a robust appetite and that appetite as it gets -- as investors get more comfortable with the dynamics of the insurance marketplace and business model that their appetite will continue to grow. So we see interesting opportunities, both domestically and importantly internationally as well. Mike, it's Rob. So yes, PGIM will have an appetite for doing both flow and balance sheet from Prudential as well as third parties. We will look to put -- and yes, we will get the asset management on those blocks as they're brought into Prismic. So that's part of the arrangement that we have with Prismic. And then separately, we'll make a decision as to how much we invest in Prismic on a go-forward basis. . As of now, our ownership in Prismic is at a 20% level. It's not a contractual application for us to stay at that level. But having said that, we think that the returns that we get for a capital that could be deployed through Prismic when you think about the returns on the underlying blocks enhanced by the fees that we get from from our asset management business could be quite attractive on a risk-reward basis.  And so we would have some appetite for continuing to invest in those sorts of business when they significantly enhance the fee components that we get out of that business, which on an overall basis with a reduced risk profile of the earnings stream on a go forward. No, I would say that -- it's Rob again. Sorry, Mike, that nothing material to update you on from last quarter. We have a very high-quality overall real estate portfolio, including the office components to that or component of that. And we continue to see resiliency within that portfolio, as you would expect, given the experience that we have there, the dedicated team that we have from an underwriting standpoint and the quality of the overall portfolio.  So while on the -- from a valuation standpoint, but updating our valuations and the valuations of the collateral supporting office loans continues to come down, but our LTV still remain quite low on a relative basis, and we feel very comfortable with the overall portfolio exposure there. See, from a VII standpoint, Wes, it's Rob. I think about that as having 2 components to it. One is the returns that we get from our alternatives portfolio and the second being the level of prepayment income that we get from the fixed income portfolio. I think we've guided to the fact that we expect lower levels of prepayment income on a go-forward basis. That was the primary contributor to the below expectations in the current quarter.  So I think you should expect to see that. On a go-forward basis, we generally don't provide an outlook. What I would say is that as even the current quarter, we have a good portfolio that's very well diversified. And so while there are different components of it that performed up and down in the current quarter, we would expect that to continue in future quarters as well. In this particular quarter, real estate performance was off, as you would expect.  But actually, our private equity portfolio performed quite well. And just to be very clear, within our private equity portfolio, we have a very small exposure to sort of the DC area. So it's more core private equity. And even within that, it's a fairly significant component of that that's in high yield and debt strategies. And so that sort of caused some stabilization within that private equity portfolio.  So I think that we will vary as markets do, but we continue to believe that we'll perform on a relevant basis quite well."

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. Later, we\u2019ll conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. I will now turn the floor over to Mr. Bob McLaughlin.

And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Charlie.\nCharlie Lowrey: Thank you, Bob. And thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our second quarter results reflect continued momentum across our businesses, including the fourth consecutive quarter of underlying earnings growth and record operating earnings for group insurance. We continue to execute on our strategy by reducing market sensitivity and increasing our capital flexibility, enhancing our capabilities and optimizing operating efficiency to support long-term growth. Our strategic progress and financial strength position us well to navigate the current macroeconomic environment, and maintain our disciplined approach to capital deployment. Turning to slide 3. I\u2019ll start this morning by noting two significant milestones demonstrating how we are reducing market sensitivity and increasing our capital flexibility. During the second quarter, we completed a reinsurance transaction for a $10 billion block of traditional variable annuities and received proceeds of $650 million. With this transaction, I\u2019m pleased that we have achieved our objective of lowering the proportion of traditional variable annuities, while continuing our progress in pivoting to less market sensitive and higher growth products. Additionally, last week, we announced another transaction to reinsure a $12.5 billion block of guaranteed universal life policies, which will be accretive to earnings. We expect to receive approximately $450 million of proceeds when the transaction closes, which is expected to be in the fourth quarter of this year. We also continue to deliver on our vision to increase access to investing insurance and retirement security by enhancing our capabilities and customer experiences and by expanding our distribution channels and products to more people around the world. In Latin America, we continued to expand our distribution through the Mercado Libre platform and added 150,000 new customers last quarter. Also, Prudential of Brazil achieved a record sales quarter, driven by strong performance by Life Planner and continued expansion of the third-party distribution channel. Prudential of Brazil is now the third largest life insurance company in the country, growing at twice the market average and reaching more than 3.5 million customers. In addition, we see continued opportunity and feel we are well-positioned in the international longevity risk transfer market, as we completed more than $3.5 billion of transaction in the second quarter. In the U.S. our individual retirement strategies business achieved annuity sales of $1.9 billion in the second quarter, a 20% increase year-over-year, and the highest since the fourth quarter of 2020. Our FlexGuard suite has reached $15 billion of sales over the past three years. And our fixed annuity sales in the quarter represented over one-third of new business, as we innovate our portfolio of annuity solutions to meet customer needs. As we look ahead, we are well-positioned as a global leader at the intersection of asset management and insurance. We are confident that our strategy in mutually reinforcing business mix, which leverages the combined strength of our brand, global asset and liability origination capabilities, and multichannel distribution will enable us to drive future growth and continue to expand access to investing insurance and retirement security. At the same time, we continued to enhance the ways we leverage technology to improve customer experiences and optimize operating efficiency. One recent example is, Model My Retirement, a new digital tool designed to help institutional pension customers gain a better understanding of their retirement benefits and adjust their financial planning accordingly. Customers can now quickly and seamlessly get an estimate of their available annuity benefits through our self-service website. We also announced a strategic partnership with Nayya, a leading benefits experience platform. The new partnership will allow group insurance clients to harness AI and data science capabilities to make more informed workplace benefit decisions. And we are also using chatbot technology and robotic process automation to reduce transaction processing time across our U.S. businesses. As part of our continuous improvement framework, we are focusing on creating a linear, faster and more agile company, so that we can better meet the needs of our customers, while driving growth and efficiency. We have made good progress in this area, having exceeded the target we established two years ago, but we think there is more work we can do. We are evaluating additional opportunities including further evolving our operating model, simplifying our organizational structure and streamlining decision making. Turning now to slide 4. Prudential\u2019s rock solid balance sheet and robust risk and capital management frameworks have allowed us to confidently navigate the current macro environment. Our AA financial strength is supported by: our strong capital position, including approximately $50 billion of unrealized insurance margin; $4.5 billion in highly liquid assets at the end of the second quarter, which does not include the $650 million of proceeds from the traditional variable annuities reinsurance transaction that was completed this quarter; and a high-quality, well-diversified investment portfolio and disciplined approach to asset liability management. Moving to slide 5. Our disciplined approach to capital deployment coupled with the added capital flexibility achieved through our de-risking transactions enables us to effectively balance investing in the long-term growth of our businesses, with returning capital to shareholders. In the second quarter, we returned approximately $700 million in capital to shareholders. And with that, Rob will now provide an overview of our second quarter financial results and an update on our business performance.\nRob Falzon: Thank you, Charlie. I\u2019ll provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for our PGIM, U.S. and International businesses. I\u2019ll begin on slide 6 with our financial results the second quarter of 2023. Our pre-tax adjusted operating income was $1.4 billion or $2.94 per share on an after tax basis. These results reflect underlying business growth, including the benefits from a higher interest rate environment and favorable underwriting experience, partially offset by elevated expenses and lower variable investment and fee income. Our GAAP net income was $576 million lower than our after tax adjusted operating income, primarily driven by mark-to-market losses on currency and interest rate derivatives, and losses on fixed maturity sales, driven by higher rates. Turning to the operating results from our businesses compared to the year ago quarter. PGIM, our global investment manager, had lower asset management fees, driven by rising rates and net outflows and higher expenses to support growth initiatives, while other related revenues increased primarily from higher seed and co-investment earnings. Results of our U.S. businesses primarily reflected a more favorable, comparable impact from our annual assumption update, higher spread income and more favorable underwriting, partially offset by the absence of one-time gain from the sale of PALAC in the prior year quarter and lower fee income. The increase in earnings in our International businesses primarily reflected higher emerging markets earnings and a favorable impact from our annual assumption update and other refinements. Turning to slide 7. PGIM, our global active investment manager has diversified capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed income, equities, and alternatives. PGIM\u2019s long-term investment performance remains attractive with 80% or more of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last 5 and 10 year periods. In addition, our short-term performance has improved since the last quarter, with 80% of assets exceeding their benchmarks over a one year period. PGIM experienced third-party net outflows of $5.2 billion in the quarter, primarily from public equity strategies. Institutional outflows were primarily driven by client redemptions for liquidity needs and retail outflows were driven by sub-advised equity mandates. As the investment engine of Prudential, the success and growth of PGIM end of our U.S. and international insurance and retirement businesses are mutually reinforcing. PGIM\u2019s asset origination capabilities, investment management expertise, and access to institutional and other sources of private capital are a competitive advantage, helping our businesses bring enhanced solutions and create more value for our customers. Our insurance and retirement businesses in turn provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated net flows, as well as unique access to insurance liabilities. In addition, we continue to grow both organically and through acquisitions, our private alternatives and credit business, which has assets of approximately $234 billion across private, corporate and infrastructure credit, real estate equity and debt, and secondary private equity. Capital deployment across PGIM\u2019s private assets platform increased from the prior quarter to $8 billion, benefiting from strong private placement and direct lending originations. Turning to slide 8, our U.S. businesses produce diversified earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income, and benefit from our complimentary mix of longevity and mortality businesses. We continued to drive towards a higher value, higher growth, and less market sensitive mix of earnings, as evidenced by the de-risking transactions that Charlie mentioned, invest in our businesses to deliver best in class customer experiences and expand our addressable market with new financial solutions, leveraging the capabilities across Prudential. Retirement strategies generated strong sales of $7.6 billion in the second quarter across its institutional and individual lines of business. Our institutional retirement business has leading market capabilities, which helped to produce second quarter sales of $5.7 billion, including $3.6 billion of international reinsurance transactions, as well as strong stable value sales. Retirement account values were a record high at the end of the second quarter. In individual retirement, our product pivots have resulted in contingent strong sales of more simplified solutions like FlexGuard and FlexGuard Income, representing approximately 65% of sales and increased fixed annuity sales that accounted for approximately one third of sales this quarter. Our individual life sales increased 27% from the year ago quarter, reflecting our earlier product pivot strategy with variable life products representing approximately 74% of sales in the quarter. And group insurance sales were up 33% compared to the year ago quarter, driven by growth in disability and supplemental health. We\u2019ve been very pleased with the momentum we are seeing in our group insurance business as we execute our strategy of product and segment diversification, while leveraging technology to increase operating efficiency and enhance the customer experience. Our record results this quarter include favorable group life and disability underwriting experience, which resulted in a benefits ratio of 81%. Turning to slide 9, our international businesses include our Japanese Life Insurance companies, where we have a differentiated multi-channel distribution model, as well as other businesses aimed at expanding our presence in targeted high growth emerging markets. In Japan, we are focused on providing high quality service and expanding our distribution and product offerings. Our needs based approach and protection product focus continue to provide important value to our customers as we expand our product offerings to meet their evolving needs. In emerging markets, we\u2019re focused on creating a selective portfolio of businesses in regions where customer needs are growing, where there are compelling opportunities to build market leading businesses, and where the financial enterprise can add value. Our international business sales were up 9%, compared to the year ago quarter. Life Planner sales were up 12% driven by record sales in Brazil, as well as higher single premium U.S. dollar sales in Japan. Gibraltar sales were up 6%, primarily driven by growth in the bank channel. As we look ahead, we are well positioned across our businesses to be a global leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security. We continue to focus on investing in growth businesses and markets, delivering industry leading customer experiences, and creating the next generation of financial solutions to serve the diverse needs of a broad range of customers. And with that, I\u2019ll now hand it over to Ken.\nKen Tanji: Thanks Rob. I\u2019ll begin on slide 10, which provides insight into earnings for the third quarter of 2023 relative to our second quarter results. As noted, pre-tax adjusted operating income in the second quarter was $1.4 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $2.94 on an after tax basis. To get a sense of how our third quarter results might develop, we suggest adjustments for the following items. First, our annual assumption update and other refinements resulted in a net benefit of $16 million in the second quarter, not [ph] included an adjustment for the third quarter. The potential exists for continued revaluation of real estate investments and lower prepayment activity due to the current market and economic conditions. Variable investment income will vary from period to period, however, over time, it has exceeded our expectations. Third, underwriting experience was below expectations by $5 million in the second quarter, and we expect $20 million of favorable seasonality in the third quarter. And last, we include an adjustment of $90 million for other items, primarily due to elevated expenses in the second quarter. These adjustments combined get us to a baseline of $3.26 per share for the third quarter. I\u2019ll note if you exclude items specific to the third quarter, earnings per share would be $3.35. The key takeaway is that our underlying earnings power continued to improve due to business growth, including the benefit of higher interest rates, partially offset by higher investments in our capabilities and growth initiatives. I would also note that due to continued opportunities to build capabilities, pursue growth initiatives and gain efficiency, we expect an increased level of investments in these areas that will be reflected in corporate and other. While we have provided these items to consider, please note that there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the third quarter. Turning to slide 11. Our capital position continues to support our AA financial strength rating. Our cash and liquid assets were $4.5 billion at the high-end of our liquidity target range. Our regulatory capital ratios were well above our targets and we have substantial off-balance sheet resources, including $9 billion of contingent capital and liquidity facilities. We remain thoughtful in our capital deployment, balancing preservation of financial strength and flexibility, investment in our businesses and shareholder distributions. Turning to slide 12 and in summary, we are transforming our business for sustainable growth. We continue to navigate the current macro environment with the financial strength of our rock solid balance sheet, and we maintain a balanced and disciplined approach to capital deployment. Now I\u2019ll turn it to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Tom Gallagher from Evercore ISI.\nTom Gallagher: Good morning. First question is, can you talk a little bit about the dividend flows, the dividends that were paid up in the quarter from the subs, it seemed like a pretty strong capital generation quarter. So, a little bit behind what drove that. And relatedly, the capital that you\u2019re going to be -- that you received for the VA transaction or the freed up capital and the SGUL deals later this year, would you expect to be able to dividend those up and use the proceeds? And then, finally, the IMR rule change, can you comment on whether that affected your RBC this quarter? Do you expect that to affect it later in the year? Thanks.\nKen Tanji: Ys. Hey Tom, it\u2019s Ken. Yes, we executed planned distributions from our businesses in the second quarter. That cash flow reflected dividends from PICA and Japan and other affiliated cash flows from subsidiaries as well. And again, it was all part of our plans for the year. Our capital position as a result is very healthy. Our regulatory capital ratios are above our AA objectives that would include the benefit of the recent VA reinsurance transaction, but does not yet reflect the GUL transaction, which will be subject to close later. And again, our Holdco assets were $4.5 billion, relatively flat from the prior quarter and a high end of our target range. So again, we\u2019ll benefit from the GUL transaction when it closes and the NAIC IMR proposal when that is adopted. So that\u2019s not yet in our RBC ratios. And these will all be key considerations for dividends from PICA to PFI in the second half of the year, again, with the close of GUL and NAIC\u2019s decision on negative IMR. So overall, we feel very good about our capital position and the outlook for our flexibility looking ahead.\nTom Gallagher: Okay. Thank, Ken. And then just a follow-up. On the potential IMR changes, I think the limitation is now looking like 10% of surplus. Can you give a little bit of color for -- I think you had had something like $1.8 billion negative impact from that in 2022. Would you expect to be able to reverse most of that, some of that? And would we still be looking at potential limitations or future losses if rates keep going up here, I guess, is the other follow-up on that. Thanks.\nKen Tanji: Yes. So you\u2019re right, Tom. The proposal is subject to a limitation of 10% of statutory surplus with adjusted for some exclusions. And for us, that\u2019s about $1.3 billion or that you can think of that as about 26 RBC points. So, that\u2019s what it would represent for us where we sit and where interest rate sits right now.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Jimmy Bhullar from JP Morgan.\nJimmy Bhullar: So first, just a question on your Japan business and how do you -- how are you thinking about potential changes in your new sales mix given changes in the capital regime and also just fluctuations recently we\u2019ve seen in terms of interest rates and currencies in Japan?\nAndy Sullivan: Hey Jimmy, it\u2019s Andy. I\u2019ll take your question. Our Japan operation, as you know, is competitively advantaged with outstanding distribution, great product and a strong brand. And we\u2019ve been quite pleased with the sales results this quarter as we experienced year-over-year growth in our LP, our LC and our bank channels. That growth was aided by higher U.S. dollar product sales. But we\u2019ve also been investing into the business. Clearly, our work on innovating our product designs and enhancing our customer experience is paying off. As we look at the interest rate changes, as we always say, overall higher interest rates are good for Prudential and are good for our Japanese businesses. We do believe that those higher interest rates will obviously give us greater flexibility in our product design and then delivering value back to our customers. So, while we may see a shift of the mix between U.S. dollar and yen denominated, we think we\u2019ll still see strong demand. And as we look forward, we\u2019re optimistic about our ability to continue to grow the Japan business and deliver shareholder value.\nJimmy Bhullar: Does the change in capital affect your sort of the economics of your products between U.S. dollar and yen denominated?\nRob Falzon: Hey Jimmy, it\u2019s Rob. So, a couple of thoughts as you\u2019re referring to the eventual adoption of ESR First point ESR is still a work in process and is not scheduled for adoption until like 2025. And so, we continue to work with the JFSA and with the industry to fine-tune the ESR regime, which is, to date, largely mirrored the regime that\u2019s been established on the international side. As currently constructed, it would cause us to look creatively at how we manage our book of business and our sales. So, I don\u2019t think it would necessarily change our distribution and our sales, but where we hold the assets against those sales could be in Japan or it could be reinsured to other jurisdictions in order to be able to make sure that we\u2019re matching the economics of the products that we\u2019re selling into the economics of the statutory regimes in which they reside. So, we\u2019re comfortable that either through a combination of efficacy and getting sort of the right economic outcomes and/or the other levers that we have available to us that we\u2019ll be able to sort of continue the balance of sales that we have and sort of manage the way in which we capitalize and reserve those sales.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then just shifting on to PGIM. The negative flows this quarter, how much of that is something that\u2019s maybe Prudential related that might continue into the second half versus maybe just overall industry-wide issues that a lot of your peers have had in asset management recently as well?\nAndy Sullivan: So Jimmy, it\u2019s Andy. I\u2019ll take your question, and I\u2019ll just hit it broadly to talk about flows for the quarter. As we\u2019ve talked about, flows are outcome of having great distribution, broadly diversified products and strong investment results. And we\u2019ve been a net flow winner over a multiyear period in PGIM, and we\u2019re quite confident in the strength of our capabilities. And as always, we\u2019re going to continue to manage this for the long term. That said, this quarter, we did see a material reduction in our outflows versus the previous quarters. On the retail end, outflows were $2.2 billion and were predominantly an equity story. We\u2019ve seen retail clients rebalancing their portfolios based on the heels of strong equity market appreciation. On the institutional side, the outflows were $3 billion for the quarter. Again, that\u2019s a material improvement over the previous quarters. These outflows included both equity and fixed income. The equity story for Institutional is the same as that for retail. It\u2019s client rebalancing. For fixed income, we saw some of our clients make asset allocation changes and other shift to passive. As far as an outlook, near term, we expect that this current investor behavior is going to continue. And to your question, our trend is consistent with what we\u2019re seeing across the rest of the industry. Over the longer term, we have a lot of confidence in our PGIM platform, and we know that we\u2019re going to return to strong positive flows and gain market share.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from John Barnidge from Piper Sandler.\nJohn Barnidge: Question on PGIM. I know they\u2019re an investment manager on some of these risk transferred assets. How long does that -- those agreements last? Can you talk about how the wind down of those assets would work? Thank you.\nAndy Sullivan: So John, it\u2019s Andy. I\u2019ll take it. Maybe I\u2019ll bring it up a level, just talk about in general as we do de-risking transactions. And in particular, the recent de-risking transactions we did in Individual Retirement Strategies and Individual Life. It is true, we\u2019ll lose some assets under management from the general account. But we -- as you\u2019ve noted, we worked hard and got an IMA. That is deal specific, how long they -- those IMAs go, depending deal to deal. But it does give us the ability to continue to manage a majority of the assets. And at the end of the day, if you look across the risk transactions that we\u2019ve done recently, it\u2019s not really going to have a material impact on PGIM earnings.\nRob Falzon: Hey John, it\u2019s Rob. Maybe just a little further elaboration. In the reinsurance of the PDI transaction, recall that those are individual sort of client separate accounts. And so those -- the separate account business there is something that PGIM will continue to manage. With regard to the GUL business, the agreement that we have there is actually a 7-year initial IMA. And obviously, with good performance, we would expect to continue to be able to manage that even over a longer period of time.\nJohn Barnidge: And then my follow-up question, sticking with asset management business, do industry-wide headwinds lead to inorganic opportunities? And are there products or geographies you\u2019d want to get greater scale in?\nAndy Sullivan: John, it\u2019s Andy again. I\u2019ll take that. So -- and I\u2019ll start where I always start when we talk about this. We\u2019ve demonstrated a strong ability over a couple of decades to grow PGIM organically. So, we -- certainly, as we look at the programmatic M&A, we don\u2019t need it to grow. That being said, we do remain interested in augmenting the organic growth plans with programmatic M&A. If you look at what we\u2019ve done recently, Montana Capital Partners, PGIM Custom Harvest and now Deerpath, those are really good examples of the areas that we said we are going to lean into higher fee, higher growth. As we look forward, we\u2019re going to continue to work to globalize the business and lean into areas like private alternatives and real assets. Clearly, any disruptive environment can lead to opportunities. So, we make sure that we stay in the know and in the flow of what\u2019s going on in the industry. But as always, we will remain very patient and be disciplined in our approach.\nOperator: Your next question today is coming from Ryan Krueger from KBW.\nRyan Krueger: I was hoping you could discuss the new open architecture platform that was referenced in the June press release and give some more specifics on really what you\u2019re looking to do there?\nRob Falzon: Ryan, it\u2019s Rob. I\u2019ll take that. As we\u2019ve talked about in the past, we see really interesting opportunities that exist in the intersection of asset management and insurance you see evolving in the industry. And we\u2019re quite excited about what that implies for our ability to create avenues of growth, both in our insurance and our asset management businesses. So, we\u2019re being thoughtful about how we execute against that opportunity. And that includes organizing ourselves in a way so as to institutionalize our ongoing balance sheet optimization capability. So, think about that on the liability side as we\u2019re looking at reinsurance solutions to balance the use of captives, affiliates and third-party reinsurance, to continue to actively evaluate additional blocks, existing blocks of business for reinsurance and then also looking at flow or new sales solutions. On the asset side, it\u2019s about expanding our lens on the available assets or investments that can generate greater outlook for us. We\u2019re also expanding our capabilities to source those investments either directly or in partnership with others, including things like acquiring capabilities as we did with Deerpath. This is an important component of our broader strategy, which is around enhancing valuation by becoming higher growth, less market-sensitive and more nimble.\nRyan Krueger: Just one follow-up there. I mean, should we think of this as also including a potential to bring in more third-party capital in a sidecar-like structured to back some of your new business in the future?\nRob Falzon: I think we\u2019re looking at the full range of opportunities that would exist there. And so going from captive to third party and hybrid solutions that would exist in between that.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Wes Carmichael from Wells Fargo.\nWes Carmichael: I just had a follow-up on Tom\u2019s question on the Holdco liquidity. So I think in the first quarter, that was roughly around $4.5 billion, ended this quarter at $4.5 billion. But if I kind of add up all the uses of capital in the quarter, from buybacks, dividends, I think there was $1.5 billion of callable debt. I think there were around $2.5 billion of uses in the period. So I\u2019m just curious, like were dividends accelerated? I know you said that they were planned, but was there any other affiliated borrowings? I\u2019m just trying to square that because it\u2019s a pretty sizable use of capital. and I\u2019m just trying to figure out where that came from.\nKen Tanji: Yes. Hey Wes, it\u2019s Ken. No, it was all planned. So, the distributions we received were all planned, and we didn\u2019t issue any debt in the quarter either. In fact, as you recognize, we called some debt, which again was all planned. So -- and we didn\u2019t pull forward anything. So, it was all part of what our plans were for the year. So, I hope that helps.\nWes Carmichael: And just maybe any thoughts around your kind of PRT pipeline? And just maybe how you think about that versus balancing that with like the longevity business and deploying capital to those two in the institutional retirement business?\nCaroline Feeney: Yes. Hi Wes. It\u2019s Caroline, and I\u2019ll take your question. So first of all, I\u2019d say, overall, we\u2019re very pleased with the strong results we saw across our entire Retirement Strategies business, with just over $7.5 billion in total sales and record institutional account values of $259 billion. This included $5.7 billion in our Institutional Retirement Strategies business, highlighted by a strong quarter in international reinsurance transactions. In terms of the pipeline overall, Wes, we continue to see strong opportunity in both the U.S. and global risk transfer markets with strong funding positions, both above 100%, and also high intent to transact. And I would be remiss not to mention what was just announced yesterday that we were selected to secure the pension benefits for about 2,000 of PSV and Gs retirees and their beneficiaries. And so far, we\u2019ve seen a record first half of the year in PRT. And while we expect to see a strong second half, we don\u2019t expect to surpass last year\u2019s record pipeline. We also see an extremely strong pipeline in the UK with funded positions that were 110%. And Wes, finally, I\u2019d say that given our expertise and our ability to manage large complex transactions along with our financial strength, we are well positioned to remain a leader in both markets.\nOperator: Your next question today is coming from Suneet Kamath from Jefferies.\nSuneet Kamath: I wanted to go back to the risk transfer deals just for a second. I think, Charlie, in your comments that you talked about achieving your goal on the VA side. And obviously, you\u2019ve done an SGUL transaction of late. Should we think about this as still ongoing activity for you, or are you sort of declaring victory here and kind of moving on to some of the more growth-oriented areas of your strategy?\nCharlie Lowrey: So, I would say, yes, to both of those. So, let me go through yes and, Suneet. So first, I\u2019ll go through each one sort of GUL and then the VA business. But, first, we are very pleased with the valuation we received for reinsuring the $12.5 billion block of guaranteed universal life policies that we announced last week. And as we said, we expect to receive approximately $450 million of proceeds when the transaction closes. The transaction will be accretive to earnings and will also reduce our market sensitivity and increase our capital flexibility. But would we consider an additional de-risking opportunity for Life sub block? Absolutely. As long as it met the strategic financial objectives and made sense to all our stakeholders. However, we\u2019re going to be disciplined in our approach as the individual life business continues to be core to our purpose. There\u2019s still significant potential for growth in the industry with a $12 trillion life insurance gap. And I think our strong Individual Life sales in the second quarter reflects our product pivot to less market-sensitive products. And from an enterprise perspective, our Life business helps balance our longevity with our mortality, so it remains important to us. On the VA side, it\u2019s a little bit of a different story, but there are some similarities. So we\u2019ve made considerable progress in reducing the market sensitivity and increasing our capital flexibility through the two transactions we\u2019ve done, and we\u2019re pleased with the valuations, again, that we received for reinsuring the $10 billion block of traditional variable annuities in the second quarter as well as the valuation for the $30 billion block we sold last year. But as a result of these transactions, as we\u2019ve said, and the natural runoff of this business, we have achieved the original objective that we established two years ago of blowing the proportion of traditional variable annuities. So, we\u2019re not in a position of having to do another transaction. Having said that, I want to be very clear that we\u2019ll continue to explore additional opportunities. But again, to state the obvious, but I\u2019ll state it, we\u2019ll only do something if it\u2019s in the best interest of all our stakeholders. But these transactions aren\u2019t only about de-risking. As you said, they\u2019re also about growth. So, while we\u2019ve been quite successful in our de-risking efforts as part of our strategy, we\u2019ve also been equally focused on growing with less market-sensitive products in our businesses, which you\u2019ve seen over the past few quarters. So, let me turn it over to Caroline for a minute because -- Caroline, would you want to talk about some of the progress we\u2019ve made with that part of our strategy?\nCaroline Feeney: Yes. Sure, Charlie. I\u2019d be happy to talk about how we\u2019re growing both these businesses. So first of all, in the Life business, as you said, we have a $12 trillion insurance gap. So we have a strong growth path forward, particularly when you think about the 50 million Americans who are currently underinsured. And as you mentioned, Charlie, we\u2019ve been very successful in pivoting our businesses to products that have a more favorable risk profile. Our new solutions have less embedded guarantees, they\u2019re less capital intensive, and we\u2019re writing new business at attractive returns. And as part of that, we saw strong sales in the quarter, up more than 25% over the prior year. And then on the individual retirement strategy side, we also continue to deliver strong sales and earnings. And in fact, we had our strongest sales quarter since the fourth quarter of 2020 and roughly a 20% increase over the prior year, and that\u2019s anchored by our FlexGuard suite of index variable annuities where we now have over $15 billion in cumulative sales, reinforcing our leadership position as a top 5 player and we also saw strong growth in our fixed annuity solutions, which were roughly one-third of our sales in the quarter and a significant increase over the prior year. So, I\u2019d say that our de-risking transactions along with our product pivots, have put us in a position to be more nimble with less market sensitivity and we see a meaningful opportunity for strong growth in both businesses going forward.\nSuneet Kamath: Got it. That makes sense. And then I just want to follow up. I think, Ken, in your prepared remarks, towards the end of your commentary, you talked about an increased level of investment, I think, in the corporate segment. I was just wondering if you could maybe size that and then some thoughts around for how long should we expect this incremental investment to be impacting that line. Thanks.\nKen Tanji: Sure. The -- what I mentioned there was we have found new opportunities to invest in our capabilities and including growth opportunities and to gain efficiency. It\u2019s building on the programs that we\u2019ve executed in the past and we have increased our investment level there. We\u2019ve put a placeholder in there in terms of our run rate of about -- increase of about $25 million a quarter. And so that\u2019s -- given our plans now, we think that\u2019s appropriate planned increase in the pace of that. I just want to mention that the way we look at these opportunities is they\u2019re often company-wide, and that\u2019s why you see the expenses occurring in corporate, but the benefits then are reflected in our business segments. And then overall, from an expense level standpoint, we\u2019ve maintained basically a flat level of expenses, while we\u2019ve increased the level of capacity to invest in growth and capabilities and efficiencies, the efficiencies that we\u2019ve gained there of giving us that capacity. And so overall, we\u2019ve seen a flat level of expenses, improved level of capabilities, gained efficiencies and improve margins.\nSuneet Kamath: Got it. So you\u2019re not signaling that we need to reflect this $25 million in our corporate forecast going forward, it\u2019s more -- you\u2019re going to have this, but it\u2019s going to be offset by efficiencies and other things?\nKen Tanji: Well, yes. But if you think about corporate, you should think about that as being an ongoing level of spend in corporate.\nSuneet Kamath: Got it. Just offset at the segments?\nKen Tanji: Yes.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Erik Bass from Autonomous Research.\nErik Bass: Can you provide an update on your emerging markets businesses and what they\u2019re currently contributing to earnings and how they\u2019re growing from a bottom line perspective?\nAndy Sullivan: So Erik, it\u2019s Andy. I\u2019ll take the question. Let me just start by kind of reminding everyone of the strategy. Our focus on emerging markets is part of shifting our overall business mix to be higher growth. And we\u2019re quite pleased with the performance of our EM portfolio, which is obviously, and as you could see steadily growing and positively contributing to our earnings profile. I would highlight a couple of areas. We\u2019re very pleased with our results in Brazil and quite optimistic about our prospects. Brazil posted strong double-digit year-over-year sales growth with success across basically every channel Life Planner, Third-party and Group, and we had another record quarter. Second, I would highlight our Habitat joint venture has contributed steady growth since the acquisition in 2016. As of the end of the second quarter, total Habitat assets under management is $67 million. That makes us number one in Chile and number two overall in Latin America. Third, we\u2019re continuing to invest in emerging Asia and Africa. And then finally, and Charlie mentioned this sort of at the top of the call was this really exciting partnership we have with Mercado Pago, which is for financial subsidiary of Mercado Libre. Mercado Libre is the largest e-commerce system in Latin America and has given us access to the mass market in Latin America, and we\u2019re seeing really nice growth there. So, we don\u2019t necessarily break out the specific growth rates, but this is a portfolio that\u2019s becoming quite meaningful, with our particular emphasis being on how Brazil and Latin America are growing. And as we look forward, we really do believe we\u2019re in the right spot at the right time, and that growth will continue.\nErik Bass: And then on PGIM, I was just hoping you could talk about the drivers of the other related revenues and your outlook for the second half of the year? I think the baseline outlook assumes that these normalize. So, is that an expectation or just a modeling assumption?\nAndy Sullivan: So thanks, Erik, it\u2019s Andy again. I will talk about the quarter, and then I\u2019ll talk about the outlook. In the second quarter, ORR came in at $31 million, which was about $20 million below our average expectation. The bottom line there is the slowdown in the real estate market is playing through as we predicted, and we\u2019ve seen lower agency earnings, lower real estate transactions fees and lower incentive fees. As far as looking forward, we would expect near term to see pressure remain on the ORR line really until the market experiences a rebound in the real estate transaction volumes.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Tracy Benguigui from Barclays.\nTracy Benguigui: Let\u2019s talk about RBC improvements. I appreciate that you quantify the IMR relief. How many RBC points are you expecting from your VA deal and ULSG [ph] deal?\nKen Tanji: Yes. Hey Tracy, it\u2019s Ken. The VA deal, it\u2019s -- the 650 is about 13 RBC points and the 450 from the GUL deal is about 9 RBC points. So, that\u2019s the quantum expressed in RBC.\nTracy Benguigui: Okay. Awesome. When I\u2019m thinking about these transactions and the counterparty credit risk, do you look at the size of capital by reinsurer, let\u2019s just put the ratings aside, like the Somerset Re capital base feels a little bit light. You did say there was over collateralization, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a comfort trust. What mechanisms do you put in place to reduce recapture risk? And if you could also share any assumptions at Somerset like with that deal?\nKen Tanji: Sure, Tracy. It\u2019s Ken. A number of things there. So, let me cover them if I miss them, make sure I come back to them. But overall, we utilize reinsurance and our counterparties very carefully. We spread our reinsurance across a select group of high-quality third-party reinsurers. And as you would expect, we have standards for that reinsurance that we certainly applied to these transactions. While they\u2019re entering into the business, they do have experience, the management team of these reinsurers have a lot of industry experience and are committed to the business in the long term. But beyond that, we have contractual provisions, some of which you alluded to. But I also want to highlight that we\u2019ll be doing the administration of the business. So, we have complete control over that. And the reserves for the business in one instance will be in a comfort trust and the other to the structure, segregated account, but they provide similar assurances and protections. And again, will be over-collateralized with the procedures for timely settlement. We also -- I want to highlight that have investment guidelines for the investment portfolios for the investments that are held in these trusts or accounts. So overall, when we put that all together, we think the counterparty risk is well positioned for us. I think I covered your questions there, but hopefully, that helps.\nTracy Benguigui: It definitely does. If I could just slip in, if there was any assumptions, like mortality or lapse rates that Somerset like looking at the deal?\nKen Tanji: Yes. Obviously, those are their assumptions. Again, they have the people there on the other side with Somerset. They have a lot of experience, but they make their own assumptions. But also, they obviously are going to be subject to their own regulatory standards in the jurisdictions of which they operate. So, this got a lot of regulatory attention on both their side and our side. And we think that\u2019s also in good standing.\nOperator: Next question is coming from Mike Ward from Citi.\nMike Ward: I really appreciate all the commentary around the de-risking and simplification. I\u2019m just curious, should we think about this as you guys are sort of saying you\u2019re open for considering more block deals or internal reinsurance restructure and whatnot? Or should we think about it as potentially more significant like a more material split or divestiture within the organization to unlock value?\nCharlie Lowrey: Hi. Mike, this is Charlie. I think it\u2019s really the former. In other words, if you think about what we\u2019re trying to do, if we take a step back and think about strategy of becoming a higher growth, less market-sensitive and more nimble company, this clearly falls as Caroline and I talked about in the first and second bucket. So we are de-risking and have de-risked and would consider further de-risking transactions if they made sense to stakeholders, but at the same time, using that as a way to pivot to becoming a higher-growth company.\nMike Ward: That\u2019s very helpful. Maybe on Group Insurance, it hasn\u2019t gotten much airtime. Results were pretty favorable as they have been for peers. Just curious if there\u2019s any sort of updated kind of annual go-forward earnings power for Group now?\nCaroline Feeney: Yes. So Mike, it\u2019s Caroline, and I\u2019ll take your question. So certainly, I\u2019ll start by saying it was indeed a great quarter for Group Insurance. And as Charlie mentioned upfront, we saw record earnings and an overall benefit ratio of 81%. That reflects the execution of our strategy of product and segment diversification and our continued focus on profitability. Total disability new business premiums grew 24% year-to-date compared to the same period last year and our supplemental health business, a core component of our product diversification strategy also saw a strong double-digit growth. And our segment diversification strategy is focused on growing in the under 5,000 lives market. We\u2019ve got great momentum with that segment now comprising about a quarter of our block. We\u2019re also pleased to be achieving that diversification and growth without sacrificing profitability and pricing discipline. The current quarter also reflects favorable mortality experience in the working age population, driven primarily from lower incidents and the impact from positive rate actions on renewals. And also disability continued to see strong results as well. That was driven by lower incidents, strong employment numbers and our continued focus on effective claim management. The disability benefits ratio we saw was our second best reported ever trailing only last quarter. So, moving forward, Mike, we are confident in our Group business. We believe we\u2019re in a great position to continue executing on our strategy while continuing to grow in a disciplined and profitable manner. Because of this, you\u2019ll note that we\u2019ve already increased our expectations for core earnings going forward.\nCharlie Lowrey: Hey Mike, one other thing. It\u2019s Charlie. We talk a lot about the investments we\u2019re making in technology, processes, infrastructure and other things. And this is -- what\u2019s pleasing about this is, this is a tangible -- you can see a tangible outcome of some of the investments we\u2019re making, specifically in Group this time, but there are tangible outcomes we\u2019re beginning to see.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ve reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Lowrey for any further or closing comments.\nCharlie Lowrey: All right. Thank you again for joining us today. We are making progress, transforming Prudential to deliver sustainable long-term growth and to meet the evolving needs of our customers. We are confident that our strategy and mutually reinforcing business mix will enable Prudential to become a leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security. Thank you again, and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ken Tanji",
            "content": "Thanks Rob. I'll begin on slide 10, which provides insight into earnings for the third quarter of 2023 relative to our second quarter results. As noted, pre-tax adjusted operating income in the second quarter was $1.4 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $2.94 on an after tax basis. To get a sense of how our third quarter results might develop, we suggest adjustments for the following items. First, our annual assumption update and other refinements resulted in a net benefit of $16 million in the second quarter, not [ph] included an adjustment for the third quarter. The potential exists for continued revaluation of real estate investments and lower prepayment activity due to the current market and economic conditions. Variable investment income will vary from period to period, however, over time, it has exceeded our expectations. Third, underwriting experience was below expectations by $5 million in the second quarter, and we expect $20 million of favorable seasonality in the third quarter. And last, we include an adjustment of $90 million for other items, primarily due to elevated expenses in the second quarter. These adjustments combined get us to a baseline of $3.26 per share for the third quarter. I'll note if you exclude items specific to the third quarter, earnings per share would be $3.35. The key takeaway is that our underlying earnings power continued to improve due to business growth, including the benefit of higher interest rates, partially offset by higher investments in our capabilities and growth initiatives. I would also note that due to continued opportunities to build capabilities, pursue growth initiatives and gain efficiency, we expect an increased level of investments in these areas that will be reflected in corporate and other. While we have provided these items to consider, please note that there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the third quarter. Turning to slide 11. Our capital position continues to support our AA financial strength rating. Our cash and liquid assets were $4.5 billion at the high-end of our liquidity target range. Our regulatory capital ratios were well above our targets and we have substantial off-balance sheet resources, including $9 billion of contingent capital and liquidity facilities. We remain thoughtful in our capital deployment, balancing preservation of financial strength and flexibility, investment in our businesses and shareholder distributions. Turning to slide 12 and in summary, we are transforming our business for sustainable growth. We continue to navigate the current macro environment with the financial strength of our rock solid balance sheet, and we maintain a balanced and disciplined approach to capital deployment. Now I'll turn it to the operator for your questions. Ys. Hey Tom, it's Ken. Yes, we executed planned distributions from our businesses in the second quarter. That cash flow reflected dividends from PICA and Japan and other affiliated cash flows from subsidiaries as well. And again, it was all part of our plans for the year. Our capital position as a result is very healthy. Our regulatory capital ratios are above our AA objectives that would include the benefit of the recent VA reinsurance transaction, but does not yet reflect the GUL transaction, which will be subject to close later. And again, our Holdco assets were $4.5 billion, relatively flat from the prior quarter and a high end of our target range. So again, we'll benefit from the GUL transaction when it closes and the NAIC IMR proposal when that is adopted. So that's not yet in our RBC ratios. And these will all be key considerations for dividends from PICA to PFI in the second half of the year, again, with the close of GUL and NAIC's decision on negative IMR. So overall, we feel very good about our capital position and the outlook for our flexibility looking ahead. Yes. So you're right, Tom. The proposal is subject to a limitation of 10% of statutory surplus with adjusted for some exclusions. And for us, that's about $1.3 billion or that you can think of that as about 26 RBC points. So, that's what it would represent for us where we sit and where interest rate sits right now. Yes. Hey Wes, it's Ken. No, it was all planned. So, the distributions we received were all planned, and we didn't issue any debt in the quarter either. In fact, as you recognize, we called some debt, which again was all planned. So -- and we didn't pull forward anything. So, it was all part of what our plans were for the year. So, I hope that helps. Sure. The -- what I mentioned there was we have found new opportunities to invest in our capabilities and including growth opportunities and to gain efficiency. It's building on the programs that we've executed in the past and we have increased our investment level there. We've put a placeholder in there in terms of our run rate of about -- increase of about $25 million a quarter.

And so overall, we've seen a flat level of expenses, improved level of capabilities, gained efficiencies and improve margins. Well, yes. But if you think about corporate, you should think about that as being an ongoing level of spend in corporate. Yes. Yes. Hey Tracy, it's Ken. The VA deal, it's -- the 650 is about 13 RBC points and the 450 from the GUL deal is about 9 RBC points. So, that's the quantum expressed in RBC. Sure, Tracy. It's Ken. A number of things there.

            "name": "Andy Sullivan",
            "content": "Hey Jimmy, it's Andy. I'll take your question. Our Japan operation, as you know, is competitively advantaged with outstanding distribution, great product and a strong brand. And we've been quite pleased with the sales results this quarter as we experienced year-over-year growth in our LP, our LC and our bank channels. That growth was aided by higher U.S. dollar product sales. But we've also been investing into the business. Clearly, our work on innovating our product designs and enhancing our customer experience is paying off. As we look at the interest rate changes, as we always say, overall higher interest rates are good for Prudential and are good for our Japanese businesses. We do believe that those higher interest rates will obviously give us greater flexibility in our product design and then delivering value back to our customers. So, while we may see a shift of the mix between U.S. dollar and yen denominated, we think we'll still see strong demand. And as we look forward, we're optimistic about our ability to continue to grow the Japan business and deliver shareholder value. So Jimmy, it's Andy. I'll take your question, and I'll just hit it broadly to talk about flows for the quarter. As we've talked about, flows are outcome of having great distribution, broadly diversified products and strong investment results. And we've been a net flow winner over a multiyear period in PGIM, and we're quite confident in the strength of our capabilities. And as always, we're going to continue to manage this for the long term. That said, this quarter, we did see a material reduction in our outflows versus the previous quarters. On the retail end, outflows were $2.2 billion and were predominantly an equity story. We've seen retail clients rebalancing their portfolios based on the heels of strong equity market appreciation. On the institutional side, the outflows were $3 billion for the quarter. Again, that's a material improvement over the previous quarters. These outflows included both equity and fixed income. The equity story for Institutional is the same as that for retail. It's client rebalancing. For fixed income, we saw some of our clients make asset allocation changes and other shift to passive. As far as an outlook, near term, we expect that this current investor behavior is going to continue. And to your question, our trend is consistent with what we're seeing across the rest of the industry. Over the longer term, we have a lot of confidence in our PGIM platform, and we know that we're going to return to strong positive flows and gain market share. So John, it's Andy. I'll take it. Maybe I'll bring it up a level, just talk about in general as we do de-risking transactions. And in particular, the recent de-risking transactions we did in Individual Retirement Strategies and Individual Life. It is true, we'll lose some assets under management from the general account. But we -- as you've noted, we worked hard and got an IMA. That is deal specific, how long they -- those IMAs go, depending deal to deal. But it does give us the ability to continue to manage a majority of the assets. And at the end of the day, if you look across the risk transactions that we've done recently, it's not really going to have a material impact on PGIM earnings. John, it's Andy again. I'll take that. So -- and I'll start where I always start when we talk about this. We've demonstrated a strong ability over a couple of decades to grow PGIM organically. So, we -- certainly, as we look at the programmatic M&A, we don't need it to grow. That being said, we do remain interested in augmenting the organic growth plans with programmatic M&A. If you look at what we've done recently, Montana Capital Partners, PGIM Custom Harvest and now Deerpath, those are really good examples of the areas that we said we are going to lean into higher fee, higher growth. As we look forward, we're going to continue to work to globalize the business and lean into areas like private alternatives and real assets. Clearly, any disruptive environment can lead to opportunities. So, we make sure that we stay in the know and in the flow of what's going on in the industry. But as always, we will remain very patient and be disciplined in our approach. So Erik, it's Andy. I'll take the question. Let me just start by kind of reminding everyone of the strategy. Our focus on emerging markets is part of shifting our overall business mix to be higher growth. And we're quite pleased with the performance of our EM portfolio, which is obviously, and as you could see steadily growing and positively contributing to our earnings profile. I would highlight a couple of areas. We're very pleased with our results in Brazil and quite optimistic about our prospects. Brazil posted strong double-digit year-over-year sales growth with success across basically every channel Life Planner, Third-party and Group, and we had another record quarter. Second, I would highlight our Habitat joint venture has contributed steady growth since the acquisition in 2016. As of the end of the second quarter, total Habitat assets under management is $67 million. That makes us number one in Chile and number two overall in Latin America. Third, we're continuing to invest in emerging Asia and Africa. And then finally, and Charlie mentioned this sort of at the top of the call was this really exciting partnership we have with Mercado Pago, which is for financial subsidiary of Mercado Libre. Mercado Libre is the largest e-commerce system in Latin America and has given us access to the mass market in Latin America, and we're seeing really nice growth there. So, we don't necessarily break out the specific growth rates, but this is a portfolio that's becoming quite meaningful, with our particular emphasis being on how Brazil and Latin America are growing. And as we look forward, we really do believe we're in the right spot at the right time, and that growth will continue. So thanks, Erik, it's Andy again. I will talk about the quarter, and then I'll talk about the outlook. In the second quarter, ORR came in at $31 million, which was about $20 million below our average expectation. The bottom line there is the slowdown in the real estate market is playing through as we predicted, and we've seen lower agency earnings, lower real estate transactions fees and lower incentive fees. As far as looking forward, we would expect near term to see pressure remain on the ORR line really until the market experiences a rebound in the real estate transaction volumes."

            "name": "Caroline Feeney",
            "content": "Yes. Hi Wes. It's Caroline, and I'll take your question. So first of all, I'd say, overall, we're very pleased with the strong results we saw across our entire Retirement Strategies business, with just over $7.5 billion in total sales and record institutional account values of $259 billion. This included $5.7 billion in our Institutional Retirement Strategies business, highlighted by a strong quarter in international reinsurance transactions. In terms of the pipeline overall, Wes, we continue to see strong opportunity in both the U.S. and global risk transfer markets with strong funding positions, both above 100%, and also high intent to transact. And I would be remiss not to mention what was just announced yesterday that we were selected to secure the pension benefits for about 2,000 of PSV and Gs retirees and their beneficiaries. And so far, we've seen a record first half of the year in PRT. And while we expect to see a strong second half, we don't expect to surpass last year's record pipeline. We also see an extremely strong pipeline in the UK with funded positions that were 110%. And Wes, finally, I'd say that given our expertise and our ability to manage large complex transactions along with our financial strength, we are well positioned to remain a leader in both markets. Yes. Sure, Charlie. I'd be happy to talk about how we're growing both these businesses. So first of all, in the Life business, as you said, we have a $12 trillion insurance gap. So we have a strong growth path forward, particularly when you think about the 50 million Americans who are currently underinsured. And as you mentioned, Charlie, we've been very successful in pivoting our businesses to products that have a more favorable risk profile. Our new solutions have less embedded guarantees, they're less capital intensive, and we're writing new business at attractive returns. And as part of that, we saw strong sales in the quarter, up more than 25% over the prior year. And then on the individual retirement strategy side, we also continue to deliver strong sales and earnings. And in fact, we had our strongest sales quarter since the fourth quarter of 2020 and roughly a 20% increase over the prior year, and that's anchored by our FlexGuard suite of index variable annuities where we now have over $15 billion in cumulative sales, reinforcing our leadership position as a top 5 player and we also saw strong growth in our fixed annuity solutions, which were roughly one-third of our sales in the quarter and a significant increase over the prior year. So, I'd say that our de-risking transactions along with our product pivots, have put us in a position to be more nimble with less market sensitivity and we see a meaningful opportunity for strong growth in both businesses going forward. Yes. So Mike, it's Caroline, and I'll take your question. So certainly, I'll start by saying it was indeed a great quarter for Group Insurance. And as Charlie mentioned upfront, we saw record earnings and an overall benefit ratio of 81%. That reflects the execution of our strategy of product and segment diversification and our continued focus on profitability. Total disability new business premiums grew 24% year-to-date compared to the same period last year and our supplemental health business, a core component of our product diversification strategy also saw a strong double-digit growth. And our segment diversification strategy is focused on growing in the under 5,000 lives market. We've got great momentum with that segment now comprising about a quarter of our block. We're also pleased to be achieving that diversification and growth without sacrificing profitability and pricing discipline. The current quarter also reflects favorable mortality experience in the working age population, driven primarily from lower incidents and the impact from positive rate actions on renewals. And also disability continued to see strong results as well. That was driven by lower incidents, strong employment numbers and our continued focus on effective claim management. The disability benefits ratio we saw was our second best reported ever trailing only last quarter. So, moving forward, Mike, we are confident in our Group business. We believe we're in a great position to continue executing on our strategy while continuing to grow in a disciplined and profitable manner. Because of this, you'll note that we've already increased our expectations for core earnings going forward."

            "name": "Rob Falzon",
            "content": "Thank you, Charlie. I'll provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for our PGIM, U.S. and International businesses. I'll begin on slide 6 with our financial results the second quarter of 2023. Our pre-tax adjusted operating income was $1.4 billion or $2.94 per share on an after tax basis. These results reflect underlying business growth, including the benefits from a higher interest rate environment and favorable underwriting experience, partially offset by elevated expenses and lower variable investment and fee income. Our GAAP net income was $576 million lower than our after tax adjusted operating income, primarily driven by mark-to-market losses on currency and interest rate derivatives, and losses on fixed maturity sales, driven by higher rates. Turning to the operating results from our businesses compared to the year ago quarter. PGIM, our global investment manager, had lower asset management fees, driven by rising rates and net outflows and higher expenses to support growth initiatives, while other related revenues increased primarily from higher seed and co-investment earnings. Results of our U.S. businesses primarily reflected a more favorable, comparable impact from our annual assumption update, higher spread income and more favorable underwriting, partially offset by the absence of one-time gain from the sale of PALAC in the prior year quarter and lower fee income. The increase in earnings in our International businesses primarily reflected higher emerging markets earnings and a favorable impact from our annual assumption update and other refinements. Turning to slide 7. PGIM, our global active investment manager has diversified capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed income, equities, and alternatives. PGIM's long-term investment performance remains attractive with 80% or more of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last 5 and 10 year periods. In addition, our short-term performance has improved since the last quarter, with 80% of assets exceeding their benchmarks over a one year period. PGIM experienced third-party net outflows of $5.2 billion in the quarter, primarily from public equity strategies. Institutional outflows were primarily driven by client redemptions for liquidity needs and retail outflows were driven by sub-advised equity mandates. As the investment engine of Prudential, the success and growth of PGIM end of our U.S. and international insurance and retirement businesses are mutually reinforcing. PGIM's asset origination capabilities, investment management expertise, and access to institutional and other sources of private capital are a competitive advantage, helping our businesses bring enhanced solutions and create more value for our customers. Our insurance and retirement businesses in turn provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated net flows, as well as unique access to insurance liabilities. In addition, we continue to grow both organically and through acquisitions, our private alternatives and credit business, which has assets of approximately $234 billion across private, corporate and infrastructure credit, real estate equity and debt, and secondary private equity. Capital deployment across PGIM's private assets platform increased from the prior quarter to $8 billion, benefiting from strong private placement and direct lending originations. Turning to slide 8, our U.S. businesses produce diversified earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income, and benefit from our complimentary mix of longevity and mortality businesses. We continued to drive towards a higher value, higher growth, and less market sensitive mix of earnings, as evidenced by the de-risking transactions that Charlie mentioned, invest in our businesses to deliver best in class customer experiences and expand our addressable market with new financial solutions, leveraging the capabilities across Prudential. Retirement strategies generated strong sales of $7.6 billion in the second quarter across its institutional and individual lines of business. Our institutional retirement business has leading market capabilities, which helped to produce second quarter sales of $5.7 billion, including $3.6 billion of international reinsurance transactions, as well as strong stable value sales. Retirement account values were a record high at the end of the second quarter. In individual retirement, our product pivots have resulted in contingent strong sales of more simplified solutions like FlexGuard and FlexGuard Income, representing approximately 65% of sales and increased fixed annuity sales that accounted for approximately one third of sales this quarter. Our individual life sales increased 27% from the year ago quarter, reflecting our earlier product pivot strategy with variable life products representing approximately 74% of sales in the quarter. And group insurance sales were up 33% compared to the year ago quarter, driven by growth in disability and supplemental health. We've been very pleased with the momentum we are seeing in our group insurance business as we execute our strategy of product and segment diversification, while leveraging technology to increase operating efficiency and enhance the customer experience. Our record results this quarter include favorable group life and disability underwriting experience, which resulted in a benefits ratio of 81%. Turning to slide 9, our international businesses include our Japanese Life Insurance companies, where we have a differentiated multi-channel distribution model, as well as other businesses aimed at expanding our presence in targeted high growth emerging markets. In Japan, we are focused on providing high quality service and expanding our distribution and product offerings. Our needs based approach and protection product focus continue to provide important value to our customers as we expand our product offerings to meet their evolving needs. In emerging markets, we're focused on creating a selective portfolio of businesses in regions where customer needs are growing, where there are compelling opportunities to build market leading businesses, and where the financial enterprise can add value. Our international business sales were up 9%, compared to the year ago quarter. Life Planner sales were up 12% driven by record sales in Brazil, as well as higher single premium U.S. dollar sales in Japan. Gibraltar sales were up 6%, primarily driven by growth in the bank channel. As we look ahead, we are well positioned across our businesses to be a global leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security. We continue to focus on investing in growth businesses and markets, delivering industry leading customer experiences, and creating the next generation of financial solutions to serve the diverse needs of a broad range of customers. And with that, I'll now hand it over to Ken. Hey Jimmy, it's Rob. So, a couple of thoughts as you're referring to the eventual adoption of ESR First point ESR is still a work in process and is not scheduled for adoption until like 2025. And so, we continue to work with the JFSA and with the industry to fine-tune the ESR regime, which is, to date, largely mirrored the regime that's been established on the international side. As currently constructed, it would cause us to look creatively at how we manage our book of business and our sales. So, I don't think it would necessarily change our distribution and our sales, but where we hold the assets against those sales could be in Japan or it could be reinsured to other jurisdictions in order to be able to make sure that we're matching the economics of the products that we're selling into the economics of the statutory regimes in which they reside. So, we're comfortable that either through a combination of efficacy and getting sort of the right economic outcomes and/or the other levers that we have available to us that we'll be able to sort of continue the balance of sales that we have and sort of manage the way in which we capitalize and reserve those sales. Hey John, it's Rob. Maybe just a little further elaboration. In the reinsurance of the PDI transaction, recall that those are individual sort of client separate accounts. And so those -- the separate account business there is something that PGIM will continue to manage. With regard to the GUL business, the agreement that we have there is actually a 7-year initial IMA. And obviously, with good performance, we would expect to continue to be able to manage that even over a longer period of time. Ryan, it's Rob. I'll take that. As we've talked about in the past, we see really interesting opportunities that exist in the intersection of asset management and insurance you see evolving in the industry. And we're quite excited about what that implies for our ability to create avenues of growth, both in our insurance and our asset management businesses. So, we're being thoughtful about how we execute against that opportunity. And that includes organizing ourselves in a way so as to institutionalize our ongoing balance sheet optimization capability. So, think about that on the liability side as we're looking at reinsurance solutions to balance the use of captives, affiliates and third-party reinsurance, to continue to actively evaluate additional blocks, existing blocks of business for reinsurance and then also looking at flow or new sales solutions. On the asset side, it's about expanding our lens on the available assets or investments that can generate greater outlook for us. We're also expanding our capabilities to source those investments either directly or in partnership with others, including things like acquiring capabilities as we did with Deerpath. This is an important component of our broader strategy, which is around enhancing valuation by becoming higher growth, less market-sensitive and more nimble. I think we're looking at the full range of opportunities that would exist there. And so going from captive to third party and hybrid solutions that would exist in between that."

        "speaker5": {
            "name": "Charlie Lowrey",
            "content": "Thank you, Bob. And thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our second quarter results reflect continued momentum across our businesses, including the fourth consecutive quarter of underlying earnings growth and record operating earnings for group insurance. We continue to execute on our strategy by reducing market sensitivity and increasing our capital flexibility, enhancing our capabilities and optimizing operating efficiency to support long-term growth. Our strategic progress and financial strength position us well to navigate the current macroeconomic environment, and maintain our disciplined approach to capital deployment. Turning to slide 3. I'll start this morning by noting two significant milestones demonstrating how we are reducing market sensitivity and increasing our capital flexibility. During the second quarter, we completed a reinsurance transaction for a $10 billion block of traditional variable annuities and received proceeds of $650 million. With this transaction, I'm pleased that we have achieved our objective of lowering the proportion of traditional variable annuities, while continuing our progress in pivoting to less market sensitive and higher growth products. Additionally, last week, we announced another transaction to reinsure a $12.5 billion block of guaranteed universal life policies, which will be accretive to earnings. We expect to receive approximately $450 million of proceeds when the transaction closes, which is expected to be in the fourth quarter of this year. We also continue to deliver on our vision to increase access to investing insurance and retirement security by enhancing our capabilities and customer experiences and by expanding our distribution channels and products to more people around the world. In Latin America, we continued to expand our distribution through the Mercado Libre platform and added 150,000 new customers last quarter. Also, Prudential of Brazil achieved a record sales quarter, driven by strong performance by Life Planner and continued expansion of the third-party distribution channel. Prudential of Brazil is now the third largest life insurance company in the country, growing at twice the market average and reaching more than 3.5 million customers. In addition, we see continued opportunity and feel we are well-positioned in the international longevity risk transfer market, as we completed more than $3.5 billion of transaction in the second quarter. In the U.S. our individual retirement strategies business achieved annuity sales of $1.9 billion in the second quarter, a 20% increase year-over-year, and the highest since the fourth quarter of 2020. Our FlexGuard suite has reached $15 billion of sales over the past three years. And our fixed annuity sales in the quarter represented over one-third of new business, as we innovate our portfolio of annuity solutions to meet customer needs. As we look ahead, we are well-positioned as a global leader at the intersection of asset management and insurance. We are confident that our strategy in mutually reinforcing business mix, which leverages the combined strength of our brand, global asset and liability origination capabilities, and multichannel distribution will enable us to drive future growth and continue to expand access to investing insurance and retirement security. At the same time, we continued to enhance the ways we leverage technology to improve customer experiences and optimize operating efficiency. One recent example is, Model My Retirement, a new digital tool designed to help institutional pension customers gain a better understanding of their retirement benefits and adjust their financial planning accordingly. Customers can now quickly and seamlessly get an estimate of their available annuity benefits through our self-service website. We also announced a strategic partnership with Nayya, a leading benefits experience platform. The new partnership will allow group insurance clients to harness AI and data science capabilities to make more informed workplace benefit decisions. And we are also using chatbot technology and robotic process automation to reduce transaction processing time across our U.S. businesses. As part of our continuous improvement framework, we are focusing on creating a linear, faster and more agile company, so that we can better meet the needs of our customers, while driving growth and efficiency. We have made good progress in this area, having exceeded the target we established two years ago, but we think there is more work we can do. We are evaluating additional opportunities including further evolving our operating model, simplifying our organizational structure and streamlining decision making. Turning now to slide 4. Prudential's rock solid balance sheet and robust risk and capital management frameworks have allowed us to confidently navigate the current macro environment. Our AA financial strength is supported by: our strong capital position, including approximately $50 billion of unrealized insurance margin; $4.5 billion in highly liquid assets at the end of the second quarter, which does not include the $650 million of proceeds from the traditional variable annuities reinsurance transaction that was completed this quarter; and a high-quality, well-diversified investment portfolio and disciplined approach to asset liability management. Moving to slide 5. Our disciplined approach to capital deployment coupled with the added capital flexibility achieved through our de-risking transactions enables us to effectively balance investing in the long-term growth of our businesses, with returning capital to shareholders. In the second quarter, we returned approximately $700 million in capital to shareholders. And with that, Rob will now provide an overview of our second quarter financial results and an update on our business performance. So, I would say, yes, to both of those. So, let me go through yes and, Suneet. So first, I'll go through each one sort of GUL and then the VA business. But, first, we are very pleased with the valuation we received for reinsuring the $12.5 billion block of guaranteed universal life policies that we announced last week. And as we said, we expect to receive approximately $450 million of proceeds when the transaction closes. The transaction will be accretive to earnings and will also reduce our market sensitivity and increase our capital flexibility. But would we consider an additional de-risking opportunity for Life sub block? Absolutely. As long as it met the strategic financial objectives and made sense to all our stakeholders. However, we're going to be disciplined in our approach as the individual life business continues to be core to our purpose. There's still significant potential for growth in the industry with a $12 trillion life insurance gap. And I think our strong Individual Life sales in the second quarter reflects our product pivot to less market-sensitive products. And from an enterprise perspective, our Life business helps balance our longevity with our mortality, so it remains important to us. On the VA side, it's a little bit of a different story, but there are some similarities. So we've made considerable progress in reducing the market sensitivity and increasing our capital flexibility through the two transactions we've done, and we're pleased with the valuations, again, that we received for reinsuring the $10 billion block of traditional variable annuities in the second quarter as well as the valuation for the $30 billion block we sold last year. But as a result of these transactions, as we've said, and the natural runoff of this business, we have achieved the original objective that we established two years ago of blowing the proportion of traditional variable annuities. So, we're not in a position of having to do another transaction. Having said that, I want to be very clear that we'll continue to explore additional opportunities. But again, to state the obvious, but I'll state it, we'll only do something if it's in the best interest of all our stakeholders. But these transactions aren't only about de-risking. As you said, they're also about growth. So, while we've been quite successful in our de-risking efforts as part of our strategy, we've also been equally focused on growing with less market-sensitive products in our businesses, which you've seen over the past few quarters. So, let me turn it over to Caroline for a minute because -- Caroline, would you want to talk about some of the progress we've made with that part of our strategy? Hi. Mike, this is Charlie. I think it's really the former. In other words, if you think about what we're trying to do, if we take a step back and think about strategy of becoming a higher growth, less market-sensitive and more nimble company, this clearly falls as Caroline and I talked about in the first and second bucket. So we are de-risking and have de-risked and would consider further de-risking transactions if they made sense to stakeholders, but at the same time, using that as a way to pivot to becoming a higher-growth company. Hey Mike, one other thing. It's Charlie. We talk a lot about the investments we're making in technology, processes, infrastructure and other things. And this is -- what's pleasing about this is, this is a tangible -- you can see a tangible outcome of some of the investments we're making, specifically in Group this time, but there are tangible outcomes we're beginning to see. All right. Thank you again for joining us today. We are making progress, transforming Prudential to deliver sustainable long-term growth and to meet the evolving needs of our customers. We are confident that our strategy and mutually reinforcing business mix will enable Prudential to become a leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security. Thank you again, and have a great day."

During the first quarter, we continued to transform our business to be less market-sensitive and better positioned to deliver sustainable long-term growth. Our financial strength, disciplined asset liability management and robust risk management position us well to navigate the current macroeconomic environment while maintaining our balanced approach to capital deployment focused on creating value for our stakeholders. Turning to Slide 3. I'll begin this morning with an update on the progress of our strategy to become a higher growth, less market-sensitive and more nimble company. We are investing in long-term sustainable growth by expanding access to our products and services and markets around the world, including through programmatic M&A and organic growth opportunities, creating the next generation of financial solutions and delivering industry-leading customer experiences. Let me provide a few recent examples. Yesterday, we announced that Prudential is acquiring a majority stake in Deerpath Capital Management, a leading US private credit and direct lending manager with more than $5 billion in assets under management. The acquisition will expand PGIM's alternative capabilities, while providing additional fee-based revenue and complementing PGIM's existing direct lending origination capabilities. In addition, Deerpath is a great example of we are building our self-reinforcing business model, which will benefit both third-party investors as well as our insurance and retirement customers. Our Institutional Retirement Strategies business had strong first quarter sales, largely driven by our Pension Risk Transfer business, which had its best first quarter ever with more than $2.8 billion in total new business transactions. In addition, we experienced continued momentum in international reinsurance with a $500 million longevity risk transaction. We also achieved new growth milestones in our international business, especially in Latin America, where Prudential of Brazil's sales reached double-digit year-over-year growth through our three distribution channels. In particular, we are driving growth in Brazil through our expanded third-party distribution channel, which allows more consumers to access our products and services. During the quarter, we also expanded our distribution through the Mercado Libre platform into Mexico to sell life and accident and health products. In the US, our individual retirement strategies business continued to expand its suite of next-generation protection solutions. We expanded our FlexGuard distribution and introduced new product enhancements to meet the evolving needs of our customers. We are also diversifying our sales mix to meet increasing customer needs in a higher interest rate environment. Sales of fixed annuities represented one-third of total individual annuity sales in the first quarter, a significant increase from a year ago quarter. We continue to enhance the ways in which customers engage with our products and solutions, to drive more digital experiences and better customer outcomes. Let me give you a couple of examples. First, an industry survey ranked Prudential as a top three carrier in e-signature adoption. A majority of annuities applications are now submitted with e-signature, which has reduced processing time by several days and improved our environmental impact. Second, we launched a new electronic claims portal for life insurance customers that allows beneficiaries to file claims in minutes and to receive payments in days rather than weeks. By using the portal this quarter, we have experienced a 300% increase in digital claims processing and overwhelmingly positive customer feedback. Turning now to slide four. Prudential's rock solid balance sheet and robust risk and capital management frameworks have allowed us to confidently navigate the current macroeconomic environment. Our financial strength, including our AA rating is supported by $4.6 billion in highly liquid assets at the end of the first quarter, as well as a high-quality, well-diversified investment portfolio and a disciplined approach to asset liability management. We've also taken advantage of opportunities to further optimize our financial flexibility and liquidity position. We proactively issued a contingent capital facility to replace the one that matures in November of this year and issued $500 million of hybrid debt to pre-fund the maturity of the same amount next year. Moving to slide five. Our disciplined approach to capital deployment also enables us to effectively balance investing in the long-term growth of our businesses with returning capital to shareholders. In the first quarter, we returned $700 million to shareholders and increased the quarterly dividend by 4%, our 15th consecutive annual dividend increase. Looking ahead, we will maintain our disciplined approach to capital management and redeployment. We are confident that this approach, coupled with our robust financial position, mix of mutually enhancing businesses and growth strategy, positions us well to be a leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security for people around the world. Thank you for your time this morning. And with that, Rob will now provide an overview of our first quarter financial results and an update on our business performance.\nRob Falzon: Thank you, Charlie. I'll provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for our PGIM, US and International businesses. I will also provide an overview of our investment portfolio and specifically our commercial real estate holdings, given the increased focus on the risks associated with a potential near-term credit cycle. I'll begin on slide six with our financial results for the first quarter of 2023. Our pre-tax adjusted operating income was $1.3 billion or $2.66 per share on an after-tax basis. These results reflect underlying business growth, including the benefits from a higher interest rate environment, offset by lower variable investment and fee income, as well as elevated seasonal mortality experience. While elevated mortality improved compared to the year ago quarter as COVID has transitioned to an endemic phase. Turning to the operating results from our businesses compared to the year ago quarter. PGIM, our global investment manager, had lower asset management fees due to lower assets under management resulting from the higher interest rates, equity market declines, and net outflows. Other related revenues increased primarily from seed and co-investment earnings. Results of our US businesses, primarily reflected lower fee income, less favorable variable investment income, partially offset by the impact of higher rates on spread income and more favorable underwriting. The decrease in earnings in our International businesses primarily reflected lower spread income largely due to less favorable variable investment income. Turning to slide seven, PGIM, our global active investment manager, has diversified capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed income, equities, and alternatives. PGIM's investment performance remains attractive with 80% or more of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last three, five and 10-year periods. PGIM experienced third-party institutional and retail net outflows of $14 billion in the quarter, primarily from fixed income strategies. Institutional outflows were mainly driven by client redemptions for liquidity needs, including de-risking actions of defined benefit sponsors. Retail outflows were driven by investors rebalancing amidst higher interest rates and inflation, consistent with the industry. As the investment engine of Prudential, the success and growth of PGIM and of our US and international insurance and Retirement businesses are mutually self-reinforcing. PGIM's asset origination capabilities, investment management expertise, and access to institutional and other sources of private capital or a competitive advantage, helping our businesses bring enhanced solutions and create more value for our customers. Our insurance and retirement businesses, in turn, provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated net flows, which totaled $2 billion in the first quarter of 2023 as well as unique access to insurance liabilities. In addition, we continue to grow our private alternatives and credit business, which has assets of approximately $235 billion across private, corporate and infrastructure credit, real estate equity and debt, and secondary private equity and will be further enhanced through the acquisition of Deerpath Capital, as Charlie previously stated. Turning to slide eight, our US businesses produced diversified earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income and benefit from our complementary mix of longevity and mortality businesses. We continue to shift towards higher growth and less market-sensitive products and markets, enhance our customer and adviser experiences, and further expand our addressable market. Retirement strategies achieved strong sales of $5.5 billion in the first quarter across its institutional and individual lines of business. Our Institutional Retirement business has market-leading capabilities with first quarter sales of $3.8 billion, including a jumbo pension risk transfer transaction, which contributed to record account values at the end of the first quarter. In Individual Retirement, product pivots have resulted in continued strong sales of more simplified solutions like FlexGuard and FlexGuard Income, representing over $13 billion of sales since inception, as well as increased fixed annuity sales that comprised approximately one-third of our sales. Our individual life sales reflect our earlier product pivot strategy with variable life products representing about 70% of sales for the quarter. And we continue to diversify group insurance sales with strong growth in supplemental health and disability products and driving 25% growth in the premier segment from the prior year quarter. Turning to slide nine. Our international businesses include our Japanese life insurance companies, where we have a differentiated multi-channel distribution model, as well as other businesses aimed at expanding our presence in high-growth emerging markets. In Japan, we are focused on providing high-quality service and expanding our geographic coverage and product offerings. Our needs-based approach and protection product focus continue to provide important value to our customers, as we expand our product offerings to meet their evolving needs. We continue to enhance customer experience and agent support, including through digital tools. Prudential of Japan ranked number one in two out of the three categories in the 2023 J.D. Power Life Insurance customer satisfaction survey. We are proud to be recognized for the value we provide customers. In emerging markets, we are focused on creating a carefully selected portfolio of businesses in regions where customer needs are growing, where there are compelling opportunities to build market-leading businesses and where the Prudential enterprise can add value. Our International businesses experienced their highest sales since the third quarter of 2020. Compared to the prior year quarter, Gibraltar sales were up 16%, mainly driven by the Life Consultant channel, primarily from higher US dollar sales. Life Planner sales were up 13%, driven by the continued momentum in Brazil as well as higher sales in Japan. Now turning to our investment portfolio on slide 10. We have a disciplined approach to our investment portfolio construction and management. It reflects our robust asset liability management practices, commitment to broad diversification and a rigorous underwriting security selection and credit management framework. We also leverage PGIM's expertise across multiple asset classes, including its deep and long-standing experience in private placements and real estate. With respect to our investment portfolio, here are a few key points. 30% of the portfolio is invested in government securities, primarily comprised of US treasuries and Japanese government bonds. 43% of the portfolio is invested in corporate securities, of which over 93% are investment grade. Private placements represent almost 40% of these corporate securities and over half of our BBB and below rated securities. These privates have financial covenants and structural protections that have consistently resulted in lower losses than comparable public securities. In past cycles, the loss experienced on our BBB private placements have been comparable to single A public credits. Mortgage loans represent an area of interest; I'll provide more detail on slide 11. Our mortgage loans represent 13% of our portfolio and reflect our conservative underwriting with an average loan-to-value of 57% and debt service coverage of 2.4 times. The portfolio is broadly diversified by property type, overweight in more defensive sectors such as multifamily and industrial, and underweighted in both office and retail. Specifically, office properties represent only 2% of invested assets, with loan to values and debt service coverage ratios that are in line with the overall portfolio. We have a disciplined portfolio monitoring process to review all investments at least annually and a robust risk management framework, which includes stress tests under cyclical and tail scenarios. Any potential credit losses in these scenarios are factored into our capital management framework and are expected to be manageable. As we look ahead, we are well positioned across our businesses to be a leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security. We continue to be focused on investing in growth businesses and markets, delivering industry-leading customer experiences and creating the next generation of financial solutions to better serve the diverse needs of a broad range of customers. And with that, I'll now hand it over to Ken.\nKen Tanji: Thanks, Rob. I'll begin on Slide 12, which provides insight into earnings for the second quarter of 2023 relative to our first quarter results. As noted, pre-tax adjusted operating income in the first quarter was $1.3 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $2.66 on an after-tax basis. To get a sense of how our second quarter results might develop, we suggest adjustments for the following items. First, variable investment income was below expectations in the first quarter by $150 million. Next, we adjust underwriting experience by $85 million to normalize for first quarter experience. And last, we expect other items to increase adjusted operating income by $25 million, primarily due to the seasonally elevated expenses in the first quarter. These items combined get us to a baseline of $3.20 per share for the second quarter. I'll note that if you exclude items specific to the second quarter, earnings per share would be $3.29. The key takeaway is that our underlying earnings power has improved due to business growth, including the benefit of higher interest rates. While we have provided these items to consider, please note there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the second quarter. Turning to Slide 13. Our capital position continues to support our AA financial strength rating. Our cash and liquid assets were $4.6 billion at the high end of our liquidity target range. We have substantial off-balance sheet resources including contingent capital and liquidity facilities. As Charlie noted, we replaced a $1.5 billion contingent capital facility that will mature in November. We remain thoughtful in our capital deployment, balancing the preservation of financial strength and flexibility, investment in our businesses and shareholder distributions. Turning to Slide 14 and in summary, we are transforming our businesses for sustainable growth. We continue to navigate the current macro environment with the financial strength of our rock-solid balance sheet, and we maintain a balanced and disciplined approach to capital deployment. Now I'll turn it to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting your question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Tom Gallagher from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live.\nTom Gallagher: Good morning. First question is just on the potential for the rules being changed on the interest maintenance reserve. Can you -- I know that I think that was around the $1.8 billion negative adjustment for you guys last year based on the mark-to-market impacts from interest rates from derivatives. Curious if -- I think there's a proposal within the NAIC out there that suggests there will be some changes. Can you talk about whether you think that will go through and whether or not at least some portion, if not all, of the $1.8 billion could be recaptured if it has changed? Thanks.\nKen Tanji: Hi, Tom, it's Ken. Yes, the NAIC is in the process of addressing what is uneconomic issues with the IMR. They -- as you mentioned, they've released a proposal, and that's out for comment until June 9th. So, they're giving some time to receive input for the industry to work collectively on this. We think it's a big step in the right direction as both the industry, the ACOI regulators that -- they're focused on addressing this issue. Having said that, the proposal needs some changes in a few areas, but there is a process to sort that out. We and many others are engaged in very constructive discussions. It's hard to predict the regulatory process, but it seems it's on the path for changes this year.\nTom Gallagher: And Ken, would you -- is kind of your base case assumption based on what's out there now that you'll potentially get all of it back, or would it be just a part, maybe a partial clawing back of some of that negative impact on RBC?\nKenn Tanji: Yes, Tom, again, it's hard to predict. There are things that are being discussed and until that those things get sorted out, I wouldn't want to give an indication of how that plays out. But again, they are taking input, it's a very constructive process, I think all the intentions are there to put this on the path for resolution, but that will play out in time.\nTom Gallagher: And then just for my follow-up, I just -- a question on leverage. I think you've announced you're going to redeem $1.5 billion of sub debt in June. And I think you issued $500 million this quarter as well -- or sorry, in Q1. The -- where do you stand now on leverage? Can you just talk about -- do you have upward capacity to issue more debt? Are you at about the right level? Because I think there's been some changes in -- certainly, from an accounting perspective, it's a bit of an elusive calculation to do from our perspective. But can you provide some help there? Thank you.\nKenn Tanji: Yes. Sure. Yes, at the end of first quarter, we were in line with our leverage objectives and then when we call the $1.5 billion of debt, which has always been in our plans to do that in June, that would increase our debt capacity. Our overall debt capacity, though, is a function of rating agency criteria and other objectives, as we look at profitability, free cash flow, fixed cost coverage and stress testing, which we believe is important. So, it's not just leverage that would determine our debt capacity. But again, calling that debt was part of our plans. It was prefunded and that will improve our debt capacity going forward. And overall, we're on track for our plans for the year.\nTom Gallagher: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Ryan Krueger from KBW. Your line is now live.\nRyan Krueger: Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Could you talk a little bit more about the drivers of PGIM flows in the quarter? And then I guess how are you thinking about the outlook going forward? Do you -- would you anticipate further liquidity-driven repositioning impacts, or do you think a lot of that's behind you now?\nAndy Sullivan: Good morning Ryan, it's Andy. I'll take your question. As we always discuss, flows are going to vary quarter-to-quarter. So, we stay focused on the long-term track record. In Q1, we experienced third-party net outflows of $14 billion, driven both by retail and the institutional. On both fronts, as you heard Rob say upfront, it is very much a fixed income story. Our retail outflows were $3.8 billion in the quarter. The fact is we continue to see money flowing out of active US mutual funds and into money market funds, CDs and other short-term solutions. That being said, we did see a slowing of the retail outflows in the quarter consistent with the industry. We would expect this outflow trend to reverse once inflation moderates and the rate environment stabilizes. On the institutional side, net outflows were $10.2 billion for the quarter. That was driven almost entirely by redemptions from public fixed income as institutional investors sought that liquidity, as you mentioned, and DB sponsors de-risk their plans. We would expect that the near-term, flow volatility in the institutional business will remain volatile, given the heightened macroeconomic, geopolitical and market uncertainty. That being said, our long-term investment performance remains very, very strong with over 80% of our benchmarkable assets outperforming the three, five and 10-year marks. We have high confidence in the power of our platform, particularly as sustained higher rates are going to be good for the fixed income business, and we will benefit over time from the synergy between our insurance and asset management businesses. So by paying attention to the fundamentals, we know we'll be a net grower.\nRyan Krueger: Thanks. And then, a follow-up on other related revenues in PGIM. What -- how sensitive is that to transaction-related real estate fees? And I guess, in other words, in the current environment where there's less commercial real estate activity, would you expect that to remain a little bit lower than normal because of the lack of incentive fees, or can you give some perspective on that?\nAndy Sullivan: Yes. Again, it's Andy. Thanks, Ryan. As you know, last quarter, we lowered our run rate expectations for ORR, specifically due to as you're speaking to the expected slowdown in real estate-related revenues. And that shows up in a variety of ways, obviously, both in the agency side, but also as you're talking about in transaction fees and incentive fees. So in the quarter, we came in lower than our expected average, because we saw that real estate slowdown as we expect it. And I guess, the only other thing I would mention is, just a reminder that incentive fees tend to be seasonally low in Q1. So that was definitely a contributor as well. So I think over time, the expected average of about $50 million is still the right ballpark, but definitely, the real estate slowdown will have an impact.\nRyan Krueger: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Erik Bass from Autonomous Research. Your line is now live.\nErik Bass: Hi. Thank you. You mentioned stress testing your credit portfolio and including that in your capital management plans. So I was just hoping you could provide a bit more color on what you're assuming and what those capital impacts could look like in a moderate or severe recession scenario.\nRob Falzon: Erik, it's Rob. I'll take the first stab at sort of describing how we think about stress testing. And then, Ken, perhaps I'll turn it over to you and you can talk about how we factor that into our capital planning. So we perform -- we have a very robust enterprise risk management capability and perform a whole series of stress tests that vary between our outlook on a base case basis, which includes sort of a moderate decline from an economic standpoint, a full board recession and particularly with respect to our real estate portfolio, we look at -- we run some of the CCARs more severe stress tests that the banks are subject to as well. The results of those are factored into both our capital planning and our reserving. We haven't, Erik, updated any disclosure on that. But what I would say is if you look back to when we first -- or last, I should say, provided some disclosure on that was back in the first quarter of 2020, the order of magnitude that we articulated then in terms of the impact coming from the portfolio from a credit cycle is roughly same order of magnitude today. Ken, I don't know if you want to elaborate further on that.\nKen Tanji: Yes. Just on your second part of your question, Erik, on sort of what underpins our plans -- what is underpinning our plans is sort of the expectation of a slowing economy and the early stages of a mild recession, which would include an elevated level of credit losses and in-rating migration. And beyond that, though, we also, as Rob just described, we have a variety of stress testing that we also consider. And those are the -- that's what we look at when we set our plans for the year.\nErik Bass: Got it. Thank you. And then I was hoping you could talk a little bit about your strategic view of the US individual life business going forward. Just under LDTI, I think your guidance implies this business will be roughly breakeven, are almost slightly profitable on a GAAP basis. So are there any actions that you're considering or that you could take to improve the profitability of this business?\nCaroline Feeney: Hi, Erik, it's Caroline, and I'll take your question. So obviously, as you state, LDTI is expected to result in a meaningful decline in earnings this year for the Life business as AOI recognition will be deferred. While this impacts the earnings pattern, it doesn't change the economics of the business. So however, even under the impact of LDTI, we are proactively looking at ways to enhance the earnings power of the business. And we do remain encouraged by the actions we've taken to pivot to less interest rate sensitive products, as well as to diversify our overall product portfolio. And Erik, this obviously also includes the recent launch of our indexed variable universal life product, FlexGuard Life, which is ramping up nicely. We do expect our AOI to grow over time based on core growth, the compounding impact of new business written at attractive returns. And also higher reinvestment rates. And overall, we remain very committed to the individual Life business. We do continue to believe that this business is core to Prudential's purpose and we like the growth potential with our overall brand as well as our product breadth and certainly our distribution strength. And we also like the additive mix that the Life business brings, particularly the longevity and mortality balance. And in terms of our pivot, our business -- our new business, Erik, it's really a much more favorable risk profile and we're writing new business at attractive returns.\nErik Bass: Great. Thank you.\nCaroline Feeney: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question today is coming from Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.\nJimmy Bhullar: Hey. Just a question first on your commercial mortgage loan book. If you could discuss your confidence in that portfolio? And any stats that you could give us in the loans that have either been restructured and how that sort of trended over the past several months?\nRob Falzon: Jimmy, it's Rob. I'll handle that. First, just from a sort of a high-level standpoint, the real estate portfolio is a very high-quality portfolio, broadly diversified both by geography and in the underlying property types. And we really benefit from PGIM's direct origination capabilities in this arena. They've got a management team there that's got well over 25 years industry experience and deep knowledge of the markets and a proven track record in that area. When we look at the quality of the portfolio, it's actually holding up quite well. You can see that our CECL reserve for that portfolio is just a little under $200 million. That's about 39 basis points against the portfolio, then that is up from about 21 basis points a year ago. But that's primarily a general reserve. We only have a single loan with a specific reserve in there, an office property. But outside of that, the reserve really comprises our estimation of losses across the portfolio based on historical data.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then the acquisition of Deerpath, should we assume that there's going to be sort of a diversion of funds from buyback to fund this, or should we not expect any impact on your buyback plans.\nCharlie Lowrey: So, Jimmy, let me take that and just raise it up a level and then I'll answer your question directly. We have said when we think about buybacks and the application of capital, that we want to be good stewards of capital. And we have and will continue to demonstrate a very disciplined and balanced approach to the redeployment of capital within our businesses and to our shareholders and other stakeholders. And you saw in the first quarter, we returned over $700 million to shareholders, which included the 15th consecutive annual increase in our dividend. So -- but if I take a step back for a moment, let me share with you some observations about how we think about capital allocation and particular optimization, which fits to your point. We look across all our businesses, both domestically and internationally, to ensure that we're optimizing capital deployment. So we'll continue to look for ways to optimize capital to maximize outcomes for all our stakeholders by balancing investments in our businesses and business growth, programmatic M&A, and returning capital to shareholders while maintaining our financial strength. And you saw examples of all four of that this quarter, right? We continue to invest in our businesses. We did programmatic M&A with the Deerpath Capital. We returned capital to shareholders, both in the form of dividends and share repurchases and we made an announcement to repay hybrid, which lowers our -- the hybrid, which lowers our leverage. So we'll continue to evaluate all these things as we go forward, especially in the current macroeconomic environment. But as an example, this quarter, we were able to do all of that given the strength of our capital position, given the cash flow we've generated and given our strategy going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question is on the capital side of things. When we -- after the $1.5 billion debt pay down, right, you guys at around are at 3.1 at the holdco. So can you just give me -- I'm just looking for a sense of where you want to run relative to that target? And then the answer to that question, can you give us a sense of just the timing of dividends that you're going to take out of PICA this year as well as any repatriation of capital from Japan?\nKen Tanji: Yes. Hey, Elyse, it's Ken. As I mentioned before, we've been planning for the -- all of the $1.5 billion for some time. That's how we built our plans and then in terms of trends and timing 1Q is typically a lower quarter for cash flow from subsidiaries and that\u2019s what we saw this quarter, first quarter and it tends to be higher in subsequent quarters. All of our businesses are profitable in generating cash flow. That includes PICA and PGIM, and we expect cash flows from them as we progress through the year and we expect to operate within our $3 billion to $5 billion of holdco HLA range. It will be higher in some periods and lower in others and that's why we define the range. But overall, we're proceeding very in line with our plans.\nElyse Greenspan: Thanks. And then the second quarter baseline, the 320 EPS, that assumes normal PII, but prepays and alternative real estate income could be lower just given the volatility we're seeing in markets. So how should we think about just PII, not only for the Q2, but also for the balance of the year?\nRob Falzon: Elyse, it's Rob. I'll try to address that. First, with regard to the returns on the alternatives portion of the portfolio, distinguishing that from the prepayments part of your question, market performance is going to continue to impact returns. That's primarily in the private equity component of our portfolio. That correlation is directional. How it manifests in any given quarter is kind of dependent on the conditions in the quarter. And I'd also note that within that PE allocation that we've got, about a quarter of that is actually allocated to mezzanine distressed debt and infrastructure. So not entirely correlated with the markets. And also remind you that the PE is reported on a one quarter lag. So if you look at equity performance in the first quarter, that would be some indication of the portfolio on a go-forward basis. With regard to prepayments, we did see a reduced level of prepayments on a higher interest rate environment. And I think it's -- that's a trend that we're anticipating on a go-forward basis. Maybe I'll just close with going back to the alternatives portfolio, just to emphasize, we're -- our alternatives are invested for the long-term. And over that horizon, we expect to continue to benefit from the dedicated team that we've got. And from the diversification that we have in the portfolio and the efforts we've had around manager selection, including within the real estate component of that to the part of your question, real estate is actually a relatively modest component of our alternatives, it's 15-ish or so percent.\nElyse Greenspan: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\nAlex Scott: Hey, good morning. First one I had is on annuities. That was a place where, I guess, relative to the presentation, you all put out at the time of the LDTI recast, the result came in much, much stronger this quarter. So I just wanted to see if you had a perspective on sort of what changed there versus what you were expecting at the time of the LDTI recast? And one of the things that struck me was NII, and I know you all have talked about sensitivity to the NII on shorter-duration collateral securities and cash. And I just wanted to see if you could provide any kind of sensitivity to help us think through how to model that, as we think through federal funds at the levels they are today versus some of the projections that have them declining?\nCaroline Feeney: Yeah. So Alex, it's Caroline, and I'll take your questions. So first of all, I would point out that the strong earnings in our Retirement Strategies business continues to reflect the ongoing growth that we're experiencing in this business. And I'll just start with the institutional retirement business, which ended the quarter with record account values of $253 billion. Our account values benefited from nearly $4 billion in sales, including the best first quarter ever in our pension risk transfer business. And then if I move to the individual retirement strategy side, we continue to see strong sales here as well, anchored by our FlexGuard suite of indexed variable annuities. In less than three years, we've delivered over $13 billion in total sales, clearly reinforcing our leadership position as a top five player in the indexed variable annuity space. And complementing that success, our fixed annuity offerings saw continued strong growth and represented over 30% of our sales for the quarter. Compounding this growth story from an earnings perspective, Alex, is our robust disciplined pricing. So when we go to market, our pricing clearly is fair, competitive and also accretive to shareholder value. We're also able to maintain this profitable growth trajectory, thanks to the strength of our brand, our leading distribution capabilities as well as strong execution. I would also point out that earnings in the Retirement Strategies business are seeing a benefit from tailwinds provided by the current interest rate environment in both short- term as well as long-term rates, which are driving favorable spread income. And then finally, we remain focused on expense discipline and continuous improvement in operating efficiency with an eye towards protecting the bottom line. So it's really a combination of all of these factors that contribute to the strong earnings we continue to see in the retirement strategies business, which are well-positioned for continued growth.\nAlex Scott: Got it. Maybe just a follow-up to that, I mean the portion that's the sensitivity to shorter term interest rates, is there any way for us to gauge how that may react if the Fed run trade begins to decline. It just seemed like there's maybe a bit more leverage than I would have guessed on the upside to that. So I don't want to overlook \u2013 estimate?\nCaroline Feeney: So Alex, clearly, the earnings, as I mentioned, are seeing a benefit from the current interest rate environment, and that's both on the short-term as well as the long-term rates driving the favorable spread income. And if we were to see rates decline, then clearly, we would see a reduction in the spread income that we earn. But I also want to reiterate the point that I made that business growth continues to be a driver of earnings as well. And so even if there was a reduction in rates, we would clearly expect that to persist.\nAlex Scott: Got it. Yeah, I understand. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from John Barnidge from Piper Sandler. Your line is now live.\nJohn Barnidge: Thank you very much for the opportunity, and good morning. My question is around the group insurance. Persistency decline in both group life and disability, can you maybe talk about the drivers, seeing any impact from deployment reductions as the larger jumbo into the market?\nCaroline Feeney: Of course, John. It's Caroline, and I'll take your question. So let me just start by taking a step back and pointing out that at core focus of our group business is to remain price disciplined and profit focused. And that just really means pursuing smart growth. We saw a 2% growth from the year ago quarter and earned premiums and fees, and that was primarily driven by growth in disability and supplemental health. And while we saw strong sales in the first quarter in Group Life, the year-over-year decline in annualized new business premiums is attributable to our strong discipline when it comes to pricing new sales. So specific to your question on persistency, John, I'll highlight our approach to and as well as our experience with renewals, which, as you know, are heavily weighted towards the January 1st effective date. When it comes to pursuing renewals, if we are unable to achieve our desired level of profitability through appropriate rate action, we choose not to retain that business, which is, in fact, just really addition by subtraction. So from a group life persistency perspective, you're actually seeing those principles in action here in the first quarter. And the trend in the persistency ratio in our group disability business remains strong. John, you also asked about unemployment and the impacts there. With regard to any signs of impacts from workforce reductions, we really aren't seeing any impact on our business at this point in time. While there clearly have been quite a few large layoff announcements that have generated their share of headlines, overall employment conditions continue to be strong. We're seeing tight labor markets with low current unemployment and a large number of job openings. So this favorable employment trend is evident in the results of our group disability business and our results reflect favorable macroeconomic tailwinds, as well as strong execution on proactive claims management. So broadly, we view the risk of unemployment impacts to our business as low over the short to medium-term. And also, I would mention, John, historically increases in unemployment rates over a sustained period could drive an increase in disability claims. However, they would typically take six to 12 months to cycle into our results.\nJohn Barnidge: Thank you very much. And another question around Japan. I believe they're lifting pandemic related restrictions, categorizing COVID like infectious disease or like the influenza. Can you talk about -- is that anticipated to improve or enhance distribution, or are there any product launches planned around that? Thank you.\nAndy Sullivan: So John, it's Andy. I'll take your question. But let me lift it up a bit and just talk about Japan sales overall. Our Japan operation is competitively advantaged with outstanding distribution, really strong product and a great brand. We were very pleased with the quarter sales results where we had a 4% improvement over the sequential quarter and a 10% improvement year-over-year. That success was well spread out as we experienced material year-over-year growth in the Life Planner, Life Consultant and bank channels. To your question on product, our work on innovating our product designs continues as we drive to ensure that we meet the needs for retirement, wealth transfer and unmet health and care needs. We also continue to drive our efforts around customer experience with a particular focus on strengthening the product and the offering and the experience to small to midsized enterprises. As far as the pandemic related effects and restrictions, we are seeing the COVID related sales challenges begin to subside. But that being said, we are still seeing impacts from a recruiting and retention perspective. But if you look at everything in aggregate, we're quite optimistic about our ability to grow these businesses over time as it always is, our priorities are to deliver strong value to our customers while achieving very, very healthy levels of profitability.\nJohn Barnidge: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question today is coming from Suneet Kamath from Jefferies. Your line is now live.\nSuneet Kamath: Thanks. I just want to go back to Charlie, an answer that you gave to a previous question on capital, I think it was Jimmy's question. So I just wanted to confirm, are you committing to the $1 billion of buyback for the year, or it just felt like maybe there was a little bit of vagueness in your response. I just wanted to give you the opportunity to clarify.\nCharlie Lowrey: No, thanks, Suneet. There is no vagueness in my response. But to be clear, the Board has authorized $1 billion of buybacks, and we will evaluate that each quarter according to the macroeconomic conditions. So there is no wavering per se, but we can't guarantee that we are going to -- that would be a forward-looking statement, which we can't make. So no equivocation in our desire to execute on the program. But again, we can't make forward-looking statements.\nSuneet Kamath: Okay. That's clear. Thanks for that. And then I guess, I don't know if it's for Rob or Ken, when you talk about on Slide 11 about the mortgage loan portfolio and the process that you go through evaluating at least once a year, what is that process like? Is that an internal process where you use your team, or do you go externally and hire firms to kind of confirm or validate your approach? Just curious how you think about that?\nRob Falzon: Hi, it's Rob, Suneet, and I\u2019ll take the question. So it\u2019s a rolling process, first of all. So it goes on throughout the year. It's not a single date point in time when we do appraisals. We have a very rigorous process around this which is we have a central team that sort of runs the appraisals on all of the properties, and that's a combination of using outsourced appraisers in order to give us input into those appraisals, but ultimately, the appraisal is an internal appraisal. We use outsiders for inputs into the appraisal and even both from a data standpoint and from a valuation standpoint, we -- the internal appraisal process is one that will look at all that external data and valuations but we put constraints around it. For instance, we have floors on cap rates that vary according to different property types that we use in our own internal valuations. That's resulted as we've noted in the past, in a phenomenon where our internal appraisals have generally been at the time in which we make them about 10% lower than what the external appraisals are that we've received in those processes. So what you see when we quote our valuations, we're doing it based on that internal view informed by external appraisals, but very much in an internal number with a level of conservatism that's applied on it.\nSuneet Kamath: Makes sense. And if I could sneak one more in just on Japan again. So higher rates in Japan is a relatively new phenomenon. So I'm just curious, one, is that changing kind of customer behavior in terms of products? And then relatedly, I think maybe a quarter or so ago, you guys were having some issues with lapses in the foreign currency products. So just curious if there's an update there in terms of if that's continuing or if it's stabilized, that would be helpful. Thanks.\nAndy Sullivan: Sure. It's Andy. I'll take the question. Let me start with the second half of your question. So on surrenders. So as we discussed last quarter, our elevated level of surrenders began to decelerate in December. And we've absolutely seen that continue into quarter one, as the surrenders continue to subside all the way through the quarter. So we're seeing that come back and subside pretty consistently. As far as the higher rates, and obviously, when we say that, higher yen rates, higher US interest rates, I would -- as I would always say, higher interest rates are good for Prudential, are good for our businesses, and they're good for our Japanese business. Obviously, that's from an earnings perspective, but also higher yields give us greater flexibility in our product designs and allows us to deliver additional value to our customers while delivering additional value to our shareholders. So, all-in-all, we see these as good trends and good things.\nSuneet Kamath: Got it. Okay. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Tracy Benguigui from Barclays. Your line is now live.\nTracy Benguigui: Thank you. What drove elevated mortality in the first quarter versus what you typically see? I guess, I'm just curious if you saw an early flu season last quarter that was a pull forward or not?\nCaroline Feeney: Sure, Tracy. It's Caroline. And thanks for your question. The Life business typically experiences elevated seasonal mortality in the first quarter, and that's consistent with what we see across the industry. And certainly, this year was no exception. And along with the industry, we even saw some excess seasonal mortality, and that was due to the impact from COVID, flu and also other respiratory illnesses. We also saw a higher incidence of large face value claims within our Life business. And going forward, Tracy, we do believe that COVID has transitioned to an endemic state and therefore, may still contribute to some amount of elevated mortality over the near to medium term. I would just point out, however, that the overall trend is better than the two previous winters, reinforcing our belief that we will return to pre-pandemic mortality levels in the long term. And finally, even though we did see some unfavorable mortality experience in the quarter, our diverse mix of mortality and longevity businesses helps to mitigate some of that experience over longer-term horizons. Tracy, you also asked about flu season last year and there was no evidence of an early flu season in our book last year.\nTracy Benguigui: Very helpful. I appreciate that. The next question, I'd like to ask you about your office loan maturities in the next 24 months. Our review of stat filings, it looks like it's about $500 million. Can you speak to the feasibility of extension? Do you feel like borrowers could either purchase an interest rate cap if the loan is floating or reduce the loan balance by putting in more equity with the current debt yields allow that?\nRob Falzon: Sure, Tracy. It's Rob. The -- about -- actually a little over 10% of the portfolio matures in the next two years. So you think about it, just looking at a little further from the statistic that you quoted. The -- recall that our portfolio is almost exclusively a fixed rate portfolio as opposed to floating rate. And so, when you look at the differentiation, the differences on the rollover of the portfolio are going to be looking at what's happened at the long end of the curve versus the short end of the curve where obviously been more dramatic at the short end of the curve for those that have been borrowing on a floating rate basis. Because of the relatively low loan to values we have across our portfolio, and we gave the statistics on that, it's mid-50% on average LTV as we roll over loans. And incidentally, the office portfolio is very much in line with that overall portfolio statistic. So as we're rolling over our loans, we're not particularly concerned about the sufficiency of equity in order to be able to refinance, even if it requires a higher level of loan and LTV from where we are.\nTracy Benguigui: Thank you. Very helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question is coming from Michael Ward from Citi. Your line is now live.\nMichael Ward: Thanks guys for squeezing me in. Maybe just on commercial real estate. I was wondering about the slide on the REIT debt. I was just wondering if you could expand on that and help us understand how it fits in the spectrum and how -- if we should think about the credit risk they're similar to like a direct commercial mortgage loan?\nRob Falzon: It's Rob again. Mike, I would think about the REIT portfolio as more akin to our private placement portfolio than the mortgage portfolio. So while mortgages of the underlying assets within the businesses, they are larger, more diversified businesses than what you're going to find in a typical single asset mortgage loan, it's about -- that REIT portfolio is about 2% of our assets. It's 97% investment grade. It's very well-diversified by geography and property type. And like all of our private placements and benefits a strong package of covenants as a result of our direct origination capabilities and that loan portfolio is primarily, if not almost entirely a result of that direct origination within PGIM. So like we do across the rest of the private placement portfolio, we actually feel quite good about the strength of those loans and the performance of them in the down cycle vis-\u00e0-vis comparatively rated public securities.\nMichael Ward: Thanks Rob. And then somewhat and relatedly, I believe PGIM\u2019s one of the bigger CLO managers, I was just wondering if you had any perspective or outlook for that asset class, given broader credit risk?\nRob Falzon: It's Rob, I'll take it again. And I'll defer to Andy if he wants to jump in on me to talk more specifically about PGIM. But Mike as we \u2013 to think about CLOs, first of all from our own portfolio, we are solely a holder of AAA securities within the CLO, within the general account portfolio. We have some miniscule exposure below AAA as a result of being a CLO manager, PGIM being a CLO manager. We do European CLOs, we need to have retention there of a relatively modest amount, so it's inconsequential. But outside of that, it's exclusively a AAA portfolio. As we look at the CLO space, we find good value in the AAA and even the AA space and -- but we're more conservative in our views as to what can happen in a stress environment once you get into the single A and obviously the BBB and subordinated tranches of that.\nMichael Ward: Okay. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Lowrey for any further or closing comments.\nCharlie Lowrey: Okay. Thank you again for joining us today. I hope we demonstrated to you the progress we're making in transforming Prudential to deliver sustainable long-term growth and to meet the evolving needs of our customers. We're confident in our strategy and the strength of our company. For nearly 150 years, Prudential has been focused on creating value for our customers and other stakeholders who we will continue to serve as we strive to be a global leader in expanding access to investing insurance and retirement security. Thank you again for joining us, and have a good day.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

            "content": "Thanks, Rob. I'll begin on Slide 12, which provides insight into earnings for the second quarter of 2023 relative to our first quarter results. As noted, pre-tax adjusted operating income in the first quarter was $1.3 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $2.66 on an after-tax basis. To get a sense of how our second quarter results might develop, we suggest adjustments for the following items. First, variable investment income was below expectations in the first quarter by $150 million. Next, we adjust underwriting experience by $85 million to normalize for first quarter experience. And last, we expect other items to increase adjusted operating income by $25 million, primarily due to the seasonally elevated expenses in the first quarter. These items combined get us to a baseline of $3.20 per share for the second quarter. I'll note that if you exclude items specific to the second quarter, earnings per share would be $3.29. The key takeaway is that our underlying earnings power has improved due to business growth, including the benefit of higher interest rates. While we have provided these items to consider, please note there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the second quarter. Turning to Slide 13. Our capital position continues to support our AA financial strength rating. Our cash and liquid assets were $4.6 billion at the high end of our liquidity target range. We have substantial off-balance sheet resources including contingent capital and liquidity facilities. As Charlie noted, we replaced a $1.5 billion contingent capital facility that will mature in November. We remain thoughtful in our capital deployment, balancing the preservation of financial strength and flexibility, investment in our businesses and shareholder distributions. Turning to Slide 14 and in summary, we are transforming our businesses for sustainable growth. We continue to navigate the current macro environment with the financial strength of our rock-solid balance sheet, and we maintain a balanced and disciplined approach to capital deployment. Now I'll turn it to the operator for your questions. Hi, Tom, it's Ken. Yes, the NAIC is in the process of addressing what is uneconomic issues with the IMR. They -- as you mentioned, they've released a proposal, and that's out for comment until June 9th. So, they're giving some time to receive input for the industry to work collectively on this. We think it's a big step in the right direction as both the industry, the ACOI regulators that -- they're focused on addressing this issue. Having said that, the proposal needs some changes in a few areas, but there is a process to sort that out. We and many others are engaged in very constructive discussions. It's hard to predict the regulatory process, but it seems it's on the path for changes this year. Yes. Just on your second part of your question, Erik, on sort of what underpins our plans -- what is underpinning our plans is sort of the expectation of a slowing economy and the early stages of a mild recession, which would include an elevated level of credit losses and in-rating migration. And beyond that, though, we also, as Rob just described, we have a variety of stress testing that we also consider. And those are the -- that's what we look at when we set our plans for the year. Yes. Hey, Elyse, it's Ken. As I mentioned before, we've been planning for the -- all of the $1.5 billion for some time. That's how we built our plans and then in terms of trends and timing 1Q is typically a lower quarter for cash flow from subsidiaries and that's what we saw this quarter, first quarter and it tends to be higher in subsequent quarters. All of our businesses are profitable in generating cash flow. That includes PICA and PGIM, and we expect cash flows from them as we progress through the year and we expect to operate within our $3 billion to $5 billion of holdco HLA range. It will be higher in some periods and lower in others and that's why we define the range. But overall, we're proceeding very in line with our plans."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Andy Sullivan",
            "content": "Good morning Ryan, it's Andy. I'll take your question. As we always discuss, flows are going to vary quarter-to-quarter. So, we stay focused on the long-term track record. In Q1, we experienced third-party net outflows of $14 billion, driven both by retail and the institutional. On both fronts, as you heard Rob say upfront, it is very much a fixed income story. Our retail outflows were $3.8 billion in the quarter. The fact is we continue to see money flowing out of active US mutual funds and into money market funds, CDs and other short-term solutions. That being said, we did see a slowing of the retail outflows in the quarter consistent with the industry. We would expect this outflow trend to reverse once inflation moderates and the rate environment stabilizes. On the institutional side, net outflows were $10.2 billion for the quarter. That was driven almost entirely by redemptions from public fixed income as institutional investors sought that liquidity, as you mentioned, and DB sponsors de-risk their plans. We would expect that the near-term, flow volatility in the institutional business will remain volatile, given the heightened macroeconomic, geopolitical and market uncertainty. That being said, our long-term investment performance remains very, very strong with over 80% of our benchmarkable assets outperforming the three, five and 10-year marks. We have high confidence in the power of our platform, particularly as sustained higher rates are going to be good for the fixed income business, and we will benefit over time from the synergy between our insurance and asset management businesses. So by paying attention to the fundamentals, we know we'll be a net grower. Yes. Again, it's Andy. Thanks, Ryan. As you know, last quarter, we lowered our run rate expectations for ORR, specifically due to as you're speaking to the expected slowdown in real estate-related revenues. And that shows up in a variety of ways, obviously, both in the agency side, but also as you're talking about in transaction fees and incentive fees. So in the quarter, we came in lower than our expected average, because we saw that real estate slowdown as we expect it. And I guess, the only other thing I would mention is, just a reminder that incentive fees tend to be seasonally low in Q1. So that was definitely a contributor as well. So I think over time, the expected average of about $50 million is still the right ballpark, but definitely, the real estate slowdown will have an impact. So John, it's Andy. I'll take your question. But let me lift it up a bit and just talk about Japan sales overall. Our Japan operation is competitively advantaged with outstanding distribution, really strong product and a great brand. We were very pleased with the quarter sales results where we had a 4% improvement over the sequential quarter and a 10% improvement year-over-year. That success was well spread out as we experienced material year-over-year growth in the Life Planner, Life Consultant and bank channels. To your question on product, our work on innovating our product designs continues as we drive to ensure that we meet the needs for retirement, wealth transfer and unmet health and care needs. We also continue to drive our efforts around customer experience with a particular focus on strengthening the product and the offering and the experience to small to midsized enterprises. As far as the pandemic related effects and restrictions, we are seeing the COVID related sales challenges begin to subside. But that being said, we are still seeing impacts from a recruiting and retention perspective. But if you look at everything in aggregate, we're quite optimistic about our ability to grow these businesses over time as it always is, our priorities are to deliver strong value to our customers while achieving very, very healthy levels of profitability. Sure. It's Andy. I'll take the question. Let me start with the second half of your question. So on surrenders. So as we discussed last quarter, our elevated level of surrenders began to decelerate in December. And we've absolutely seen that continue into quarter one, as the surrenders continue to subside all the way through the quarter. So we're seeing that come back and subside pretty consistently. As far as the higher rates, and obviously, when we say that, higher yen rates, higher US interest rates, I would -- as I would always say, higher interest rates are good for Prudential, are good for our businesses, and they're good for our Japanese business. Obviously, that's from an earnings perspective, but also higher yields give us greater flexibility in our product designs and allows us to deliver additional value to our customers while delivering additional value to our shareholders. So, all-in-all, we see these as good trends and good things."

            "name": "Caroline Feeney",
            "content": "Hi, Erik, it's Caroline, and I'll take your question. So obviously, as you state, LDTI is expected to result in a meaningful decline in earnings this year for the Life business as AOI recognition will be deferred. While this impacts the earnings pattern, it doesn't change the economics of the business. So however, even under the impact of LDTI, we are proactively looking at ways to enhance the earnings power of the business. And we do remain encouraged by the actions we've taken to pivot to less interest rate sensitive products, as well as to diversify our overall product portfolio. And Erik, this obviously also includes the recent launch of our indexed variable universal life product, FlexGuard Life, which is ramping up nicely. We do expect our AOI to grow over time based on core growth, the compounding impact of new business written at attractive returns. And also higher reinvestment rates. And overall, we remain very committed to the individual Life business. We do continue to believe that this business is core to Prudential's purpose and we like the growth potential with our overall brand as well as our product breadth and certainly our distribution strength. And we also like the additive mix that the Life business brings, particularly the longevity and mortality balance. And in terms of our pivot, our business -- our new business, Erik, it's really a much more favorable risk profile and we're writing new business at attractive returns. Thank you. Yeah. So Alex, it's Caroline, and I'll take your questions. So first of all, I would point out that the strong earnings in our Retirement Strategies business continues to reflect the ongoing growth that we're experiencing in this business. And I'll just start with the institutional retirement business, which ended the quarter with record account values of $253 billion. Our account values benefited from nearly $4 billion in sales, including the best first quarter ever in our pension risk transfer business. And then if I move to the individual retirement strategy side, we continue to see strong sales here as well, anchored by our FlexGuard suite of indexed variable annuities. In less than three years, we've delivered over $13 billion in total sales, clearly reinforcing our leadership position as a top five player in the indexed variable annuity space. And complementing that success, our fixed annuity offerings saw continued strong growth and represented over 30% of our sales for the quarter. Compounding this growth story from an earnings perspective, Alex, is our robust disciplined pricing. So when we go to market, our pricing clearly is fair, competitive and also accretive to shareholder value. We're also able to maintain this profitable growth trajectory, thanks to the strength of our brand, our leading distribution capabilities as well as strong execution. I would also point out that earnings in the Retirement Strategies business are seeing a benefit from tailwinds provided by the current interest rate environment in both short- term as well as long-term rates, which are driving favorable spread income. And then finally, we remain focused on expense discipline and continuous improvement in operating efficiency with an eye towards protecting the bottom line. So it's really a combination of all of these factors that contribute to the strong earnings we continue to see in the retirement strategies business, which are well-positioned for continued growth. So Alex, clearly, the earnings, as I mentioned, are seeing a benefit from the current interest rate environment, and that's both on the short-term as well as the long-term rates driving the favorable spread income. And if we were to see rates decline, then clearly, we would see a reduction in the spread income that we earn. But I also want to reiterate the point that I made that business growth continues to be a driver of earnings as well. And so even if there was a reduction in rates, we would clearly expect that to persist. Of course, John. It's Caroline, and I'll take your question. So let me just start by taking a step back and pointing out that at core focus of our group business is to remain price disciplined and profit focused. And that just really means pursuing smart growth. We saw a 2% growth from the year ago quarter and earned premiums and fees, and that was primarily driven by growth in disability and supplemental health. And while we saw strong sales in the first quarter in Group Life, the year-over-year decline in annualized new business premiums is attributable to our strong discipline when it comes to pricing new sales. So specific to your question on persistency, John, I'll highlight our approach to and as well as our experience with renewals, which, as you know, are heavily weighted towards the January 1st effective date. When it comes to pursuing renewals, if we are unable to achieve our desired level of profitability through appropriate rate action, we choose not to retain that business, which is, in fact, just really addition by subtraction. So from a group life persistency perspective, you're actually seeing those principles in action here in the first quarter. And the trend in the persistency ratio in our group disability business remains strong. John, you also asked about unemployment and the impacts there. With regard to any signs of impacts from workforce reductions, we really aren't seeing any impact on our business at this point in time. While there clearly have been quite a few large layoff announcements that have generated their share of headlines, overall employment conditions continue to be strong. We're seeing tight labor markets with low current unemployment and a large number of job openings. So this favorable employment trend is evident in the results of our group disability business and our results reflect favorable macroeconomic tailwinds, as well as strong execution on proactive claims management. So broadly, we view the risk of unemployment impacts to our business as low over the short to medium-term. And also, I would mention, John, historically increases in unemployment rates over a sustained period could drive an increase in disability claims. However, they would typically take six to 12 months to cycle into our results. Sure, Tracy. It's Caroline. And thanks for your question. The Life business typically experiences elevated seasonal mortality in the first quarter, and that's consistent with what we see across the industry. And certainly, this year was no exception. And along with the industry, we even saw some excess seasonal mortality, and that was due to the impact from COVID, flu and also other respiratory illnesses. We also saw a higher incidence of large face value claims within our Life business. And going forward, Tracy, we do believe that COVID has transitioned to an endemic state and therefore, may still contribute to some amount of elevated mortality over the near to medium term. I would just point out, however, that the overall trend is better than the two previous winters, reinforcing our belief that we will return to pre-pandemic mortality levels in the long term. And finally, even though we did see some unfavorable mortality experience in the quarter, our diverse mix of mortality and longevity businesses helps to mitigate some of that experience over longer-term horizons. Tracy, you also asked about flu season last year and there was no evidence of an early flu season in our book last year."

            "name": "Rob Falzon",
            "content": "Thank you, Charlie. I'll provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for our PGIM, US and International businesses. I will also provide an overview of our investment portfolio and specifically our commercial real estate holdings, given the increased focus on the risks associated with a potential near-term credit cycle. I'll begin on slide six with our financial results for the first quarter of 2023. Our pre-tax adjusted operating income was $1.3 billion or $2.66 per share on an after-tax basis. These results reflect underlying business growth, including the benefits from a higher interest rate environment, offset by lower variable investment and fee income, as well as elevated seasonal mortality experience. While elevated mortality improved compared to the year ago quarter as COVID has transitioned to an endemic phase. Turning to the operating results from our businesses compared to the year ago quarter. PGIM, our global investment manager, had lower asset management fees due to lower assets under management resulting from the higher interest rates, equity market declines, and net outflows. Other related revenues increased primarily from seed and co-investment earnings. Results of our US businesses, primarily reflected lower fee income, less favorable variable investment income, partially offset by the impact of higher rates on spread income and more favorable underwriting. The decrease in earnings in our International businesses primarily reflected lower spread income largely due to less favorable variable investment income. Turning to slide seven, PGIM, our global active investment manager, has diversified capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed income, equities, and alternatives. PGIM's investment performance remains attractive with 80% or more of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last three, five and 10-year periods. PGIM experienced third-party institutional and retail net outflows of $14 billion in the quarter, primarily from fixed income strategies. Institutional outflows were mainly driven by client redemptions for liquidity needs, including de-risking actions of defined benefit sponsors. Retail outflows were driven by investors rebalancing amidst higher interest rates and inflation, consistent with the industry. As the investment engine of Prudential, the success and growth of PGIM and of our US and international insurance and Retirement businesses are mutually self-reinforcing. PGIM's asset origination capabilities, investment management expertise, and access to institutional and other sources of private capital or a competitive advantage, helping our businesses bring enhanced solutions and create more value for our customers. Our insurance and retirement businesses, in turn, provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated net flows, which totaled $2 billion in the first quarter of 2023 as well as unique access to insurance liabilities. In addition, we continue to grow our private alternatives and credit business, which has assets of approximately $235 billion across private, corporate and infrastructure credit, real estate equity and debt, and secondary private equity and will be further enhanced through the acquisition of Deerpath Capital, as Charlie previously stated. Turning to slide eight, our US businesses produced diversified earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income and benefit from our complementary mix of longevity and mortality businesses. We continue to shift towards higher growth and less market-sensitive products and markets, enhance our customer and adviser experiences, and further expand our addressable market. Retirement strategies achieved strong sales of $5.5 billion in the first quarter across its institutional and individual lines of business. Our Institutional Retirement business has market-leading capabilities with first quarter sales of $3.8 billion, including a jumbo pension risk transfer transaction, which contributed to record account values at the end of the first quarter. In Individual Retirement, product pivots have resulted in continued strong sales of more simplified solutions like FlexGuard and FlexGuard Income, representing over $13 billion of sales since inception, as well as increased fixed annuity sales that comprised approximately one-third of our sales. Our individual life sales reflect our earlier product pivot strategy with variable life products representing about 70% of sales for the quarter. And we continue to diversify group insurance sales with strong growth in supplemental health and disability products and driving 25% growth in the premier segment from the prior year quarter. Turning to slide nine. Our international businesses include our Japanese life insurance companies, where we have a differentiated multi-channel distribution model, as well as other businesses aimed at expanding our presence in high-growth emerging markets. In Japan, we are focused on providing high-quality service and expanding our geographic coverage and product offerings. Our needs-based approach and protection product focus continue to provide important value to our customers, as we expand our product offerings to meet their evolving needs. We continue to enhance customer experience and agent support, including through digital tools. Prudential of Japan ranked number one in two out of the three categories in the 2023 J.D. Power Life Insurance customer satisfaction survey. We are proud to be recognized for the value we provide customers. In emerging markets, we are focused on creating a carefully selected portfolio of businesses in regions where customer needs are growing, where there are compelling opportunities to build market-leading businesses and where the Prudential enterprise can add value. Our International businesses experienced their highest sales since the third quarter of 2020. Compared to the prior year quarter, Gibraltar sales were up 16%, mainly driven by the Life Consultant channel, primarily from higher US dollar sales. Life Planner sales were up 13%, driven by the continued momentum in Brazil as well as higher sales in Japan. Now turning to our investment portfolio on slide 10. We have a disciplined approach to our investment portfolio construction and management. It reflects our robust asset liability management practices, commitment to broad diversification and a rigorous underwriting security selection and credit management framework. We also leverage PGIM's expertise across multiple asset classes, including its deep and long-standing experience in private placements and real estate. With respect to our investment portfolio, here are a few key points. 30% of the portfolio is invested in government securities, primarily comprised of US treasuries and Japanese government bonds. 43% of the portfolio is invested in corporate securities, of which over 93% are investment grade. Private placements represent almost 40% of these corporate securities and over half of our BBB and below rated securities. These privates have financial covenants and structural protections that have consistently resulted in lower losses than comparable public securities. In past cycles, the loss experienced on our BBB private placements have been comparable to single A public credits. Mortgage loans represent an area of interest; I'll provide more detail on slide 11. Our mortgage loans represent 13% of our portfolio and reflect our conservative underwriting with an average loan-to-value of 57% and debt service coverage of 2.4 times. The portfolio is broadly diversified by property type, overweight in more defensive sectors such as multifamily and industrial, and underweighted in both office and retail. Specifically, office properties represent only 2% of invested assets, with loan to values and debt service coverage ratios that are in line with the overall portfolio. We have a disciplined portfolio monitoring process to review all investments at least annually and a robust risk management framework, which includes stress tests under cyclical and tail scenarios. Any potential credit losses in these scenarios are factored into our capital management framework and are expected to be manageable. As we look ahead, we are well positioned across our businesses to be a leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security. We continue to be focused on investing in growth businesses and markets, delivering industry-leading customer experiences and creating the next generation of financial solutions to better serve the diverse needs of a broad range of customers. And with that, I'll now hand it over to Ken. Erik, it's Rob. I'll take the first stab at sort of describing how we think about stress testing. And then, Ken, perhaps I'll turn it over to you and you can talk about how we factor that into our capital planning. So we perform -- we have a very robust enterprise risk management capability and perform a whole series of stress tests that vary between our outlook on a base case basis, which includes sort of a moderate decline from an economic standpoint, a full board recession and particularly with respect to our real estate portfolio, we look at -- we run some of the CCARs more severe stress tests that the banks are subject to as well. The results of those are factored into both our capital planning and our reserving. We haven't, Erik, updated any disclosure on that. But what I would say is if you look back to when we first -- or last, I should say, provided some disclosure on that was back in the first quarter of 2020, the order of magnitude that we articulated then in terms of the impact coming from the portfolio from a credit cycle is roughly same order of magnitude today. Ken, I don't know if you want to elaborate further on that. Jimmy, it's Rob. I'll handle that. First, just from a sort of a high-level standpoint, the real estate portfolio is a very high-quality portfolio, broadly diversified both by geography and in the underlying property types. And we really benefit from PGIM's direct origination capabilities in this arena. They've got a management team there that's got well over 25 years industry experience and deep knowledge of the markets and a proven track record in that area. When we look at the quality of the portfolio, it's actually holding up quite well. You can see that our CECL reserve for that portfolio is just a little under $200 million. That's about 39 basis points against the portfolio, then that is up from about 21 basis points a year ago. But that's primarily a general reserve. We only have a single loan with a specific reserve in there, an office property. But outside of that, the reserve really comprises our estimation of losses across the portfolio based on historical data. Elyse, it's Rob. I'll try to address that. First, with regard to the returns on the alternatives portion of the portfolio, distinguishing that from the prepayments part of your question, market performance is going to continue to impact returns. That's primarily in the private equity component of our portfolio. That correlation is directional. How it manifests in any given quarter is kind of dependent on the conditions in the quarter. And I'd also note that within that PE allocation that we've got, about a quarter of that is actually allocated to mezzanine distressed debt and infrastructure. So not entirely correlated with the markets. And also remind you that the PE is reported on a one quarter lag. So if you look at equity performance in the first quarter, that would be some indication of the portfolio on a go-forward basis. With regard to prepayments, we did see a reduced level of prepayments on a higher interest rate environment. And I think it's -- that's a trend that we're anticipating on a go-forward basis. Maybe I'll just close with going back to the alternatives portfolio, just to emphasize, we're -- our alternatives are invested for the long-term. And over that horizon, we expect to continue to benefit from the dedicated team that we've got. And from the diversification that we have in the portfolio and the efforts we've had around manager selection, including within the real estate component of that to the part of your question, real estate is actually a relatively modest component of our alternatives, it's 15-ish or so percent. Hi, it's Rob, Suneet, and I'll take the question. So it's a rolling process, first of all. So it goes on throughout the year. It's not a single date point in time when we do appraisals. We have a very rigorous process around this which is we have a central team that sort of runs the appraisals on all of the properties, and that's a combination of using outsourced appraisers in order to give us input into those appraisals, but ultimately, the appraisal is an internal appraisal. We use outsiders for inputs into the appraisal and even both from a data standpoint and from a valuation standpoint, we -- the internal appraisal process is one that will look at all that external data and valuations but we put constraints around it. For instance, we have floors on cap rates that vary according to different property types that we use in our own internal valuations. That's resulted as we've noted in the past, in a phenomenon where our internal appraisals have generally been at the time in which we make them about 10% lower than what the external appraisals are that we've received in those processes. So what you see when we quote our valuations, we're doing it based on that internal view informed by external appraisals, but very much in an internal number with a level of conservatism that's applied on it. Sure, Tracy. It's Rob. The -- about -- actually a little over 10% of the portfolio matures in the next two years. So you think about it, just looking at a little further from the statistic that you quoted. The -- recall that our portfolio is almost exclusively a fixed rate portfolio as opposed to floating rate. And so, when you look at the differentiation, the differences on the rollover of the portfolio are going to be looking at what's happened at the long end of the curve versus the short end of the curve where obviously been more dramatic at the short end of the curve for those that have been borrowing on a floating rate basis. Because of the relatively low loan to values we have across our portfolio, and we gave the statistics on that, it's mid-50% on average LTV as we roll over loans. And incidentally, the office portfolio is very much in line with that overall portfolio statistic. So as we're rolling over our loans, we're not particularly concerned about the sufficiency of equity in order to be able to refinance, even if it requires a higher level of loan and LTV from where we are. It's Rob again. Mike, I would think about the REIT portfolio as more akin to our private placement portfolio than the mortgage portfolio. So while mortgages of the underlying assets within the businesses, they are larger, more diversified businesses than what you're going to find in a typical single asset mortgage loan, it's about -- that REIT portfolio is about 2% of our assets. It's 97% investment grade. It's very well-diversified by geography and property type. And like all of our private placements and benefits a strong package of covenants as a result of our direct origination capabilities and that loan portfolio is primarily, if not almost entirely a result of that direct origination within PGIM. So like we do across the rest of the private placement portfolio, we actually feel quite good about the strength of those loans and the performance of them in the down cycle vis-a\u0300-vis comparatively rated public securities. It's Rob, I'll take it again. And I'll defer to Andy if he wants to jump in on me to talk more specifically about PGIM. But Mike as we \u2013 to think about CLOs, first of all from our own portfolio, we are solely a holder of AAA securities within the CLO, within the general account portfolio. We have some miniscule exposure below AAA as a result of being a CLO manager, PGIM being a CLO manager. We do European CLOs, we need to have retention there of a relatively modest amount, so it's inconsequential. But outside of that, it's exclusively a AAA portfolio. As we look at the CLO space, we find good value in the AAA and even the AA space and -- but we're more conservative in our views as to what can happen in a stress environment once you get into the single A and obviously the BBB and subordinated tranches of that."

            "content": "Thank you, Bob. And thanks to everyone for joining us today. During the first quarter, we continued to transform our business to be less market-sensitive and better positioned to deliver sustainable long-term growth. Our financial strength, disciplined asset liability management and robust risk management position us well to navigate the current macroeconomic environment while maintaining our balanced approach to capital deployment focused on creating value for our stakeholders. Turning to Slide 3. I'll begin this morning with an update on the progress of our strategy to become a higher growth, less market-sensitive and more nimble company. We are investing in long-term sustainable growth by expanding access to our products and services and markets around the world, including through programmatic M&A and organic growth opportunities, creating the next generation of financial solutions and delivering industry-leading customer experiences. Let me provide a few recent examples. Yesterday, we announced that Prudential is acquiring a majority stake in Deerpath Capital Management, a leading US private credit and direct lending manager with more than $5 billion in assets under management. The acquisition will expand PGIM's alternative capabilities, while providing additional fee-based revenue and complementing PGIM's existing direct lending origination capabilities. In addition, Deerpath is a great example of we are building our self-reinforcing business model, which will benefit both third-party investors as well as our insurance and retirement customers. Our Institutional Retirement Strategies business had strong first quarter sales, largely driven by our Pension Risk Transfer business, which had its best first quarter ever with more than $2.8 billion in total new business transactions. In addition, we experienced continued momentum in international reinsurance with a $500 million longevity risk transaction. We also achieved new growth milestones in our international business, especially in Latin America, where Prudential of Brazil's sales reached double-digit year-over-year growth through our three distribution channels. In particular, we are driving growth in Brazil through our expanded third-party distribution channel, which allows more consumers to access our products and services. During the quarter, we also expanded our distribution through the Mercado Libre platform into Mexico to sell life and accident and health products. In the US, our individual retirement strategies business continued to expand its suite of next-generation protection solutions. We expanded our FlexGuard distribution and introduced new product enhancements to meet the evolving needs of our customers. We are also diversifying our sales mix to meet increasing customer needs in a higher interest rate environment. Sales of fixed annuities represented one-third of total individual annuity sales in the first quarter, a significant increase from a year ago quarter. We continue to enhance the ways in which customers engage with our products and solutions, to drive more digital experiences and better customer outcomes. Let me give you a couple of examples. First, an industry survey ranked Prudential as a top three carrier in e-signature adoption. A majority of annuities applications are now submitted with e-signature, which has reduced processing time by several days and improved our environmental impact. Second, we launched a new electronic claims portal for life insurance customers that allows beneficiaries to file claims in minutes and to receive payments in days rather than weeks. By using the portal this quarter, we have experienced a 300% increase in digital claims processing and overwhelmingly positive customer feedback. Turning now to slide four. Prudential's rock solid balance sheet and robust risk and capital management frameworks have allowed us to confidently navigate the current macroeconomic environment. Our financial strength, including our AA rating is supported by $4.6 billion in highly liquid assets at the end of the first quarter, as well as a high-quality, well-diversified investment portfolio and a disciplined approach to asset liability management. We've also taken advantage of opportunities to further optimize our financial flexibility and liquidity position. We proactively issued a contingent capital facility to replace the one that matures in November of this year and issued $500 million of hybrid debt to pre-fund the maturity of the same amount next year. Moving to slide five. Our disciplined approach to capital deployment also enables us to effectively balance investing in the long-term growth of our businesses with returning capital to shareholders. In the first quarter, we returned $700 million to shareholders and increased the quarterly dividend by 4%, our 15th consecutive annual dividend increase. Looking ahead, we will maintain our disciplined approach to capital management and redeployment. We are confident that this approach, coupled with our robust financial position, mix of mutually enhancing businesses and growth strategy, positions us well to be a leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security for people around the world. Thank you for your time this morning. And with that, Rob will now provide an overview of our first quarter financial results and an update on our business performance. So, Jimmy, let me take that and just raise it up a level and then I'll answer your question directly. We have said when we think about buybacks and the application of capital, that we want to be good stewards of capital. And we have and will continue to demonstrate a very disciplined and balanced approach to the redeployment of capital within our businesses and to our shareholders and other stakeholders. And you saw in the first quarter, we returned over $700 million to shareholders, which included the 15th consecutive annual increase in our dividend. So -- but if I take a step back for a moment, let me share with you some observations about how we think about capital allocation and particular optimization, which fits to your point. We look across all our businesses, both domestically and internationally, to ensure that we're optimizing capital deployment. So we'll continue to look for ways to optimize capital to maximize outcomes for all our stakeholders by balancing investments in our businesses and business growth, programmatic M&A, and returning capital to shareholders while maintaining our financial strength. And you saw examples of all four of that this quarter, right? We continue to invest in our businesses. We did programmatic M&A with the Deerpath Capital. We returned capital to shareholders, both in the form of dividends and share repurchases and we made an announcement to repay hybrid, which lowers our -- the hybrid, which lowers our leverage. So we'll continue to evaluate all these things as we go forward, especially in the current macroeconomic environment. But as an example, this quarter, we were able to do all of that given the strength of our capital position, given the cash flow we've generated and given our strategy going forward. No, thanks, Suneet. There is no vagueness in my response. But to be clear, the Board has authorized $1 billion of buybacks, and we will evaluate that each quarter according to the macroeconomic conditions. So there is no wavering per se, but we can't guarantee that we are going to -- that would be a forward-looking statement, which we can't make. So no equivocation in our desire to execute on the program. But again, we can't make forward-looking statements. Okay. Thank you again for joining us today. I hope we demonstrated to you the progress we're making in transforming Prudential to deliver sustainable long-term growth and to meet the evolving needs of our customers. We're confident in our strategy and the strength of our company. For nearly 150 years, Prudential has been focused on creating value for our customers and other stakeholders who we will continue to serve as we strive to be a global leader in expanding access to investing insurance and retirement security. Thank you again for joining us, and have a good day."

And now, I'll turn it over to Charlie.\nCharlie Lowrey: Thank you, Bob, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Our third quarter performance reflects continued positive momentum in growing our businesses, increasing capital efficiency, and pivoting our product suite to address the investing, insurance, and retirement needs of our customers and clients around the world. We reported robust sales across our U.S. and international insurance and retirement businesses as well as strong investment performance and private credit originations in PGIM. We also maintained our disciplined approach to capital deployment, while continuing to invest in our businesses and returning excess capital to shareholders. Our strategic progress and performance are backed by our financial strength. Turning to Slide 3. This morning, I will highlight how we continue to become a higher-growth, more capital-efficient company. We are growing our market-leading businesses while increasing our capital flexibility. Let's start by taking a closer look at how our Retirement Strategies business is benefiting from the global retirement opportunity. On the Institutional side, our continued leadership in pension risk transfer was reinforced through a second transaction with IBM, this time to reinsure $6 billion of pension liabilities. With this latest transaction, we have now closed seven out of the 10 largest pension risk transfer deals in the U.S. On the Individual side, five of our annuity products have exceeded $1 billion in sales so far this year, validating our product diversification strategy. Our Japan business is another great example of how we are addressing the growing demand for retirement products. While life insurance has traditionally comprised the bulk of our business in Japan, year-to-date sales of retirement and savings products are up 30% compared to the prior year. Meanwhile, PGIM is well-positioned to help plan sponsors deliver benefits to millions of retirement beneficiaries through its diversified investment solutions. As a market leader, with nearly $0.5 trillion of assets under management supporting defined benefit and defined contribution plans, PGIM serves more than half of the world's 300 largest pension funds. Now, let's look at how we are further growing our market-leading businesses by diversifying our products and expanding our global distribution networks. In our Retirement Strategies business, we're increasing the number of individual annuity solutions and adding new workplace partnerships, like the relationship we recently announced with JPMorgan Asset Management. In our Group Insurance business, we are expanding our disability and supplemental health products and growing our position in the under 5,000 lives and association market segments. Turning to our Individual Life business. We continue to launch innovative, more capital-efficient products, and we have positive momentum across our distribution channels. In our International Businesses, we're benefiting from recent product launches and our strong multi-channel distribution in both, Japan and Brazil. And lastly, PGIM continues to benefit from our deeply connected and reinforcing business mix, resulting in strong affiliated flows on a year-to-date basis. In addition, private alternatives capital deployment has increased 24% year-to-date, underscoring the demand in the market and PGIM's private credit capabilities. PGIM is also well-positioned to continue to capture the growing retail demand for fixed-income products. In addition, our investments in technology across our insurance, retirement and asset management businesses is helping us to deliver exceptional sales, service, and claims experiences, supporting our growth strategy. At the same time, we're improving the quality of earnings from the continued shift of our business mix. This quarter, we announced a transaction with Wilton Re to reinsure an $11 billion guaranteed universal life block. Following this transaction, we will have reduced our guaranteed universal life reserves by 60%, advancing our strategic progress to become a higher-growth, more capital-efficient company. Turning to Slide 4. Our continued investments in our businesses are supported by our disciplined approach to capital deployment, which included returning more than $700 million to shareholders during the third quarter. Turning to Slide 5. Our growth strategy is further supported by our financial strength and our risk and capital management framework. We maintain a AA rating which reflects a healthy capital position, including more than $4 billion in highly liquid assets at the end of the third quarter. We also maintain a well-diversified, high-quality portfolio and disciplined approach to Asset-Liability Management. In closing, we're operating from a position of strength with confidence in our strategy, our capabilities and our path to deliver long-term sustainable value for all our stakeholders. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob.\nBob McLaughlin: Thanks, Charlie. I'll provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for our PGIM, U.S. and international businesses. I'll begin on Slide 6 with our financial results. Our pretax adjusted operating income was $1.6 billion or $3.48 per share on an after-tax basis for the third-quarter of 2024 and $9.98 on a year-to-date basis, which is up 6%. These results reflect the execution of our strategy to grow our market-leading businesses and were driven by higher spread and fee income due to continued strong sales and the benefit of higher interest rates and equity markets, net of increased expenses to support the growth of our businesses. Year-to-date adjusted operating return-on-equity of 13.7% has improved a 0.5 percentage point from the prior year. This reflects the strength of our businesses, the benefits from the deliberate actions we have taken to pivot to more capital-efficient and higher-growth products. Turning to the operating results from our businesses compared to the year-ago quarter. PGIM, our global investment manager, had higher asset management fees driven by favorable investment performance, contributions from the Deerpath Capital acquisition and market appreciation. This was partially offset by higher expenses to support business growth. Earnings growth in our U.S. businesses reflected more favorable underwriting results from better-than-expected mortality experience in individual life and higher spread income driven by business growth and the benefit of higher interest rates. This was partially offset by lower legacy traditional variable annuity fee income as we intentionally pivot to less market-sensitive products as well as higher expenses to support business growth. Results of our international businesses included less favorable underwriting results, primarily reflecting elevated U.S. dollar product surrenders with the weakness in the yen and higher expenses to support business growth, partially offset by higher joint-venture earnings driven by Encaje performance in Chile and higher spread income due to higher yields from the reinvestment of the portfolio. Turning to Slide 7. PGIM, our global investment manager, has diversified capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed-income, equities and alternatives. PGIM's strong investment performance continues to improve with 86% of assets under management exceeding their benchmarks over the past year. This has contributed favorably to strong long-term performance with 79% and 85% of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last five and 10-year periods, respectively. PGM's assets under management increased by 15% to $1.4 trillion from the year-ago quarter, driven by market appreciation, investment performance and net flows. Total net flows in the quarter of $3.2 billion included affiliated net flows of $6.4 billion, driven by strong retirement strategy sales, partially offset by $3.2 billion of third-party net outflows. On a year-to-date basis, total net flows were $29 billion, including $15 billion in affiliated flows and $14 billion from third-party clients. These inflows reflect the net benefit from large episodic institutional pension plan activity. As the investment engine of Prudential, PGIM's capabilities support the success and growth of our U.S. and international businesses in retirement, asset management and insurance. PGIM's asset origination capabilities, investment management expertise and access to institutional and other sources of private capital, including through our sponsored reinsurer Prismic are a competitive advantage, helping our businesses bring enhanced solutions and create more value for our customers. Our insurance and retirement businesses in-turn provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated net flows as well as unique access to insurance liabilities. In addition, our diversified PGIM private alternatives platform, which has assets under management of over $250 billion, experienced strong private credit origination activity driven by our direct lending businesses, including the benefit from our recent acquisition of Capital. Turning to Slide 8. Our U.S. businesses produced diversified earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income and benefit from our complementary mix of longevity and mortality businesses and diversified sources of earnings. We continue to focus on growing our market-leading businesses by expanding our addressable market with new financial solutions delivered through a broader distribution footprint, leveraging capabilities across Prudential and enhancing those capabilities to improve the experience of our customers and distribution partners while driving operating efficiencies. Retirement strategies generated strong sales of nearly $15 billion in the third-quarter across its institutional and individual lines of business. Institutional retirement sales totaled $11 billion in the quarter. U.S. funded pension risk transfer transactions of $6.3 billion included the second PRT transaction with IBM. Additionally, longevity risk transfer sales totaled $2.8 billion for the quarter. Year-to-date, institutional retirement sales were over $26 billion as we have captured about 40% of the PRT market. Individual Retirement posted $3.6 billion in sales, its best quarter of sales in over a decade. Our product pivots and innovation have resulted in continued strong sales of our registered index-linked annuities and fixed annuity products have more than doubled from the prior year. Additionally, we continue to reduce market sensitivity by running off our legacy variable annuities. Group Insurance sales primarily occur in the first quarter of the year based on annual enrollments. On a year-to-date basis, sales increased 3% compared to the prior year, driven by growth in supplemental health. We are executing our strategy of both product and client segment diversification, while leveraging technology to increase operating efficiency and enhance the customer experience. These actions to improve profitability and performance resulted in a benefits ratio of 83.4%, which is at the low end of our target range. In Individual Life, sales increased 13% from the year ago quarter and 9% year-to-date. These increases include the benefit from the strength and breadth of our distribution capabilities and expansion of our product offerings, including our pivot towards more capital-efficient products like FlexGuard Life, which reached its highest sales quarter since its launch in 2022. Turning to Slide 9. Our international businesses include our Japanese life insurance companies where we have a differentiated multichannel distribution model as well as other businesses aimed at expanding our presence in targeted high-growth emerging markets. In Japan, we are focused on providing high-quality service and expanding our distribution and product offerings. Our needs-based selling approach and protection and retirement product focus continue to provide important value to our customers as we extend our product offerings to meet their evolving needs. In emerging markets, we are focused on creating a selective portfolio of businesses in regions where customer needs are growing, where there are compelling opportunities to build market-leading businesses and where the Prudential enterprise can add value. Sales in our international businesses were up 25% compared to the year-ago quarter. Higher sales in Japan are benefiting from recent product launches as we expand our retirement and savings offerings, which are gaining traction with customers and represented 75% of the current quarter sales. In addition, emerging market sales were also higher, driven by growth in Brazil as we continue to expand third-party distribution and benefit from the strong performance of our world-class Life Planners. As we look ahead, we are well-positioned across our businesses to be a global leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security. We continue to focus on investing in growth businesses and markets delivering industry-leading customer and client experiences and creating the next-generation of financial solutions to serve the diverse needs of a broad range of customers. And with that, I'll now hand it over to Yanela.\nYanela Frias: Thank you, Rob. I will begin on Slide 10, which provides insight into earnings for the fourth quarter of 2024 relative to our third quarter results. Pre-tax adjusted operating income for the third quarter was $1.6 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $3.48 on an after-tax basis. To get a sense of how our fourth quarter results might develop, we suggest adjustments for the following items. First, variable investment income was below expectations by $50 million in the third quarter, driven by lower private equity returns. Beginning next quarter, we plan to pre-announce our estimated variable investment income results. Next, underwriting experience was above expectations by $15 million in the third quarter. And last, we include an adjustment of $100 million for expenses and other items. Higher expenses in the third quarter reflect the timing of investments in enterprise initiatives to support growth. We expect higher initiative investments to continue in the fourth quarter and maintain the full year 2024 expected loss in Corporate & Other of $1.8 billion. We also expect seasonally lower annual premiums of $50 million in international in the fourth quarter. These adjustments combined get us to a baseline of $3.34 per share for the fourth quarter. I will note that if you exclude items specific to the fourth quarter, earnings per share would be $3.67. The key takeaway is that our underlying earnings power increased and reflects the improved quality of earnings from intentionally shifting our business mix and continued investment in the growth of our market-leading businesses. While we have provided these items to consider, please note that there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the future. A few items that I would highlight. We continue to benefit from new money rates that were higher than our portfolio yield in the third quarter, and we do not expect a significant impact from the potential decline in short-term rates. We have cash at the holding company, floating rate assets across our businesses and collateral in Individual Retirement Strategies that earn short-term yields, which is generally offset by interest-rate derivatives that manage duration across our businesses where we pay short-term rates and receive fixed. The earnings benefit from the recent pension risk transfer transactions grows over time as we reposition the investment portfolio and is viewed by In-Force runoff. In addition, our legacy variable annuities In-Force is running off at $3 billion to $4 billion per quarter and we have been experiencing an elevated level of surrenders in our businesses in Japan associated with U.S. dollar products as the yen has weakened relative to the U.S. dollar. The exchange rate hit a 38-year low in the second quarter. And while we have experienced a reduction in surrender levels as the yen strengthened during the third quarter, we expect some continued near-term pressure on earnings before surrenders normalized. Also of note, in order to provide greater insight into our financial outlook and to better align with the longer-term nature of our business, we plan to introduce new intermediate-term financial targets. These targets will replace our quarterly baseline disclosure concurrent with the release of our fourth quarter earnings results. Turning to Slide 11. Our regulatory capital ratios are strong and above levels that we believe represent AA financial strength as we continue to maintain margins to support strong organic growth prospects and are prepared for the potential impacts of market-driven volatility. Our cash and liquid assets were $4.3 billion, which is above our minimum liquidity target of $3 billion and we have substantial off-balance sheet resources. We remain thoughtful in our capital deployment, preserving financial strength and flexibility, investing in our businesses for long-term growth and returning capital to shareholders. Turning to Slide 12, and in summary, we are becoming a higher growth, more capital-efficient company. We are maintaining a disciplined approach to capital deployment and our growth is supported by the strength of our balance sheet. And with that, we will be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Ryan Krueger from KBW. Your line is now live.\nRyan Krueger: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I guess one question and kind of a related follow-up would be, one, can you give an update on Prismic and potential activity there? And then the second one was just how you plan to use capital that you free up from both, external and internal reinsurance transactions going forward? Because I think you freed up some capital from various transactions, but what are your key priorities for returning that over time?\nRobFalzon: Ryan, it's Rob. I'll take the first part of your question and I think Charlie will probably jump in and handle the second part of that. So, I guess what I'd start with, Ryan, is that I would reiterate what we said last quarter, which is we'd be disappointed if we've not entered into an additional transaction that we could announce before year-end. We're continuing our work on a very active pipeline. It's got multiple reinsurance transactions across a spectrum of types, so it's ongoing looking at our own balance sheet optimization. It's looking at opportunities for flow or new sales financing as well as third-party blocks and there we have a particular focus on Japan. And as you may have seen, we actually made -- Prismic actually made an announcement that we've stood up a dedicated licensed team in Tokyo in order to be able to advance that opportunity. While they're all in play, I think we would say that the likely next transaction is going to be back-book amongst the variety of things that we're working on and potentially in Japan. The interest in that is in particularly that it would help establish the plumbing and the precedent for doing third-party transactions from that market, which is a -- we think is an interesting market in which we have a competitive advantage. If I was stepping back, Ryan, I would say we have a visible pipeline. We have capital available to us. We've got the right underwriting expertise and the staffing at Prismic. And all of that combines to give us confidence in our ability to scale Prismic in a way that's consistent with our aspirations and the aspirations of our investors.\nCharlie Lowrey: And Ryan, this is Charlie. Let me add on to what Rob said in terms of capital deployment. You know, we've always said that we want to be good stewards of capital and that we have a consistent disciplined and balanced approach to the redeployment of that capital with our businesses and to our shareholders and there are really three aspects to our approach on which we focus. The first is just maintaining our rock-solid balance sheet and financial strength, which is fundamental to us in terms of fulfilling our promises, which we've done for almost 150 years. The second is investing, both organically and through programmatic acquisitions to support the sustainable long-term growth of our businesses. And finally, returning excess capital to shareholders as we've done in the past. And in this quarter, we deployed capital to support strong sales across our businesses, including several new products to meet the evolving needs of our customers, and we returned over $700 million to shareholders. So we have a consistent process and we're going to follow that through.\nRyan Krueger: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Suneet Kamath from Jefferies. Your line is now live.\nSuneet Kamath: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to start with Japan. Can you talk about how the margins or the returns on this -- these retirement products that you're selling compare to the protection products, death protection products that you used to sell? I mean, my recollection is those death protection products had very attractive margins and I just want to get a sense of the new business that you're writing and how that compares.\nAndy Sullivan: Yes. Suneet. Good morning. It's Andy. I'll take the question. So we're pleased with the profitability of the sales that we're seeing in Japan and we do not expect an impact on the margins given the mix-shift between the product types. We're actually quite excited. We see a long-term opportunity to help the citizens in Japan prepare for and enjoy their retirement. Given the longevity aspects of Japan and the low bank savings yields, we believe that we're going to see a continued strengthening of demand for a broader set of retirement products. While we already have a broad product portfolio there, we've been methodically diversifying and expanding our capabilities to really lean into this opportunity and you saw that success of that strategy in third quarter with our retirement investment product sales increasing about 30% year-to-date versus the prior year. And those sales accounted for the majority of Japan sales in the quarter. So, we don't expect an impact on the margin given that mix shift and we're very excited as we see this as early days and what should be a very long-term opportunity tailwind.\nSuneet Kamath: Okay. That makes sense. Thanks for that. And then I guess for Caroline, it looks like your prediction that 2024 would be another record year for annuity sales is playing out. Just curious if you can give some color around like where the growth is kind of coming from? Is it coming out of 401(k) plan rollovers or product exchanges? And how sustainable do you think this level of sales is as we think about moving into 2025? Thanks.\nCaroline Feeney: Yes, sure. Thanks for your question, Suneet. So first of all, let me say, we are extremely pleased with our individual retirement results. And as you saw in the third quarter, we drove over $3.5 billion of sales, making it our best quarter in over a decade. And this strong performance is the direct result of our efforts over the past few years to diversify our annuity portfolio, allowing us to meet more of the consumer need for protected savings and income. In fact, we now have the broadest individual product portfolio we've ever had. And to put that in perspective, Suneet, as Charlie mentioned in his opening comments, just two years ago, we had only one-product that generated over $1 billion in sales. Now we already have five products that have exceeded that mark this year. So in terms of your question on sustainability, the outlook for our individual annuity franchise remained strong. Beyond our diversified portfolio, what we see is a clear tailwind coming from aging demographics. That's over 11,000 Americans turning 65 every day and 30 million Americans turning 65 between now and 2030. So a lot of that growth to need is coming from that tailwind. And we're also seeing increased demand in the marketplace for protected savings and income solutions. So combining those factors, the industry is on pace for a third sequential record-setting sales year as you say, with year-to-date sales outpacing last year by more than 25%. And we'll meet that demand head-on with our diverse portfolio of solutions and the strength of our brand and our distribution.\nSuneet Kamath: Got it. Okay. Thanks for that.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Tom Gallagher from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live.\nTom Gallagher: Good morning. First question back on Japan. Can you talk about your sales mix between yen products' foreign currency products? I know foreign currency has been a big part of what's gone on, but just given the move higher in rates in Japan as -- or are you starting to see a pivot back into yen-oriented products? And how do you see that going forward? Thanks.\nAndy Sullivan: Yes, Tom, it's Andy. I'll take the question. So in the third quarter, we saw about 30% of our sales in Japan were yen-based sales. The fact is our level of yen-based sales has nearly doubled over the last three years and this has been based on what have been a series of very intentional actions on our part. You know, we believe in having a broadly diversified product portfolio in every geography that we operate. So for Japan, that means having good diversification across life insurance, retirement and savings products and having a nice balance between U.S. dollar and yen offerings. So, we've been intentionally strengthening the choices of our -- that our customers have for yen-based products over the last year or so. And these new product introductions have been a material contributor to the 29% year-over-year sales increase. So we believe in a broad portfolio. We've been expanding the yen-based offerings and we're seeing the success of that strategy.\nTom Gallagher: Got you. Thanks. And then my follow-up is, I guess a broader industry question, but I think Swiss Re Research Institute put out a report recently on how they expect excess mortality to persist for another 5 to 10 years. And you know, hard to know exactly what the degrees they're referring to is, but is that -- is that -- and particularly if it mentioned the U.S. and Japan, which are obviously two big exposures for Pru. Curious, do you share that view broadly speaking, if that does come to pass, do you feel like you have enough prudence in your reserves to handle it? And any additional thoughts you would have on that topic? Thanks.\nYanela Frias: Hi, Tom, it's Yanela. And let me take that question. So yes, the observations and the expectations from the report are consistent with our internal view and with the approach that we have taken for our mortality assumptions. So our assumptions reflect some continued excess mortality through 2028 before returning to the pre-pandemic trend line. And obviously, we regularly monitor mortality trends in advances and adjust accordingly every year during our annual assumption process in the second quarter. I would remind you that we have a diversified mix of businesses providing natural mortality hedges, right? So life insurance and PRT and also throughout globally within the U.S. and other significant insurance markets such as Japan and the U.K. And so a few data points on what we are seeing. In individual life, we have experienced mortality that is broadly in line with expectations since updating our mortality base table assumptions in 2022 and this quarter we saw favorable experience. Now the individual life insured population is less impacted by COVID than the general population. Our PRT mortality experience has trended heavier in 2023 that is consistent with continued excess mortality. And what I would say is that, our PRT population tends to be more closely correlated to the general population.\nTom Gallagher: That's great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Nick Annitto from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\nNick Annitto: Hi, good morning. Thanks. I just wanted to hit on PGIM first. Maybe could you talk about what went on institutional in the quarter, what drove the outflows and maybe how you're expecting them to come into '25? I mean, I know it's episodic, but any color there would be helpful. Thanks.\nAndy Sullivan: Sure, Nick. It's Andy. And let me actually comment on institutional and retail. So starting on institutional, I'd reiterate what I said last quarter. We expect to continue experiencing more near-term variability in our institutional fixed income flows. We are the sixth largest manager of DB assets globally and many of these DB plans remain overfunded and we're seeing these clients derisk. That is leading to more money in motion creating this near-term variation. But as the rate curve normalizes, money will flow back more consistently into institutional fixed income, and we obviously expect to benefit from that given our world-class business. Stepping back from that dynamic, we believe in analyzing our flows over a longer timeframe and looking inclusively at affiliated flows. Affiliated flows stem from when we win pension risk transfer transactions as well as from flow from asset-intensive annuities and life insurance. In the pension space, often the activity within third-party and affiliated are linked. So you're really talking about the same universe of DB plans. So the bottom line is you have to look at both, third-party and affiliated to get the full picture on our PGIM assets under management. If you look across 2024 year-to-date, our third-party institutional flows are a positive $14 billion and our affiliated institutional flows are a positive $15 billion. So we like that track record of success. Just a minute on retail. On the retail side of the business, we continue to achieve improving results. And in the quarter, we saw positive $1.3 billion in inflows. We are seeing in retail, the investors return to fixed income strategies and we would expect that will accelerate given the anticipated Fed direction. So really if you step-back, the strength of our fixed-income franchise is very, very strong. And we think over time, we're going to experience significant tailwinds and will be a net winner over the long-term.\nNick Annitto: Thanks. That's helpful. And then maybe just more of a higher-level one. You know, I guess following the GUL deal that you guys just did and some of the other deals that you guys have done, is there any block in the business that you guys kind of view non-core that can be shopped?\nCharlie Lowrey: Hi, Nick, it's Charlie. Let me take that one and I'll take a step back and then directly answer your question. But, you know, we feel really good about the considerable progress we've made in shifting our business mix to be more capital efficient and the fact that we're well-positioned to capture market opportunities for higher growth. We'd execute it on several transactions that have driven a 50% reduction in our traditional variable annuities portfolio and also a 60% reduction in the guaranteed universal life reserves and then following the transaction we announced in the third quarter with Wilton Re. And while we've been quite successful in increasing our capital efficiency as part of our strategy, we've been equally focused on investing in our market-leading businesses to drive growth with some of those proceeds. Having said that, and this gets to your question, we will consider additional opportunities as long as they meet our strategic and financial objectives and make sense for all our stakeholders. So we'll continue to review our portfolios, but it needs to meet the strategic and financial objectives that we talked about.\nNick Annitto: That's helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. The question today is coming from John Barnidge from Piper Sandler. Your line is now live.\nJohn Barnidge: Good morning. Thank you for the opportunity. On the variable investment income pre-announcement that you're going to do for disclosure going forward. Will that be a wholly separate pre-announcement from the AUM one that comes out as an 8-K? Thanks.\nYanela Frias: Hi, John, it's Yanela. That will be included in the current disclosure that we provide on AUM. So it will be all-inclusive.\nJohn Barnidge: Thank you for that. And then it sounds like you were upbeat about the growth opportunity at Workplace Solutions. Can you maybe talk about partnerships there that you're working on? Thank you.\nCaroline Feeney: Yes. Hi, John, it's Caroline. Thank you for your question. And yes, we are very much upbeat and confident in terms of our Group results going-forward. And we have a number of strategic partnerships that we've recently executed. And most of these are very much focused on elevating the customer enrollment experience, but they're also going to be a key contributor to our overall focus on things like claims management. And I'll just give you a few examples, John. One of those is a partnership with a leading edge technology firm that's really transforming the benefits experience for millions of people. And essentially their innovative platform walks employees through the enrollment process, connecting them with credential counselors for one-on-one support. Another partnership we have is with Evolution IQ. This is an AI-driven platform that leverages data to expedite claim, examiner -- evaluations in short as well as long-term disability claims. And the platform is going to help us eliminate manual work. It's going to help us provide better outcomes for customers overall for disability claims. And I would just say in terms of how we're feeling about our group business overall, John, it is growing nicely as we've demonstrated another strong quarter driven by solid underlying fundamentals. We're growing at attractive markets margins. And when I think about our overall diversification strategy, improving claims management capabilities and investments in those strategic partnerships I just mentioned, we're very much positioned to continue to see that profitable growth and solid earnings.\nJohn Barnidge: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Wes Carmichael from Autonomous. Your line is now live.\nWes Carmichael: Hi, thanks, good morning. My first question, I guess, was on the comments regarding away from the quarterly EPS baseline and moving towards new financial targets. Is there any more color you can provide us on what you're considering for those and realize it's still maybe in flux?\nYanela Frias: Hi, Wes. This is Yanela. And so yes, let me start with just kind of reaffirming what we're doing. So we plan to introduce new intermediate-term financial targets beginning for 2025. And really we're making this change to provide greater insight into our financial outlook and to better align with the longer-term nature of our business where the economics emerge over a longer period of time. We also think it will help investors better understand our business outlook and earnings power. So that is really what we're doing. We will be replacing the quarterly baseline. And again, as we shared also, we will be pre-announcing VII. We plan to implement these changes beginning with the release of the fourth quarter earnings results. So we will share the targets and the information at that time.\nWes Carmichael: Okay, got it. Thanks, Yanela. My second question, I guess, was on -- sorry, was there something else?\nYanela Frias: No, sorry.\nWes Carmichael: My second question is on the group business. I saw a press release, I think last quarter that entering the stop-loss business. I guess just curious how meaningful that could be over time and kind of what that business brings through?\nCaroline Feeney: Yes, of course, Wes, it's Caroline, and I'll take your question. So our entry into the medical stop loss builds upon our strategy to diversify our portfolio across both client segments and products. And this move allows us to better serve the evolving needs of our clients by offering a broader range of solutions, particularly West in the mid-market. And as you know, employers frequently purchase medical stop loss in conjunction with other group products, making it attractive from a portfolio perspective and allowing us to leverage our deep customer and our broker relationships. In the near-term, Wes, we plan to take a thoughtful approach to scaling with a disciplined underwriting process and robust reinsurance program with experienced partners. And given the size of our total book, we expect it to be a small portion of our business mix. Our longer-term success will be guided by a disciplined approach to scale. We're committed to sustainable growth and ensuring that our expansion in this area is both strategic and measured.\nWes Carmichael: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Wilma Burdis from Raymond James. Your line is now live.\nWilma Burdis: Hi, good morning. Could you talk a little bit more about the Prismic team -- the Prismic Japan team that you're building out? And maybe give us some examples of the types of deals that could make sense and the size of the market? Thanks.\nRobFalzon: Wilma, it's Rob. Sure. The -- so in order for us to be able to effectively do reinsurance transactions in Japan, we need to have an agency license business on the ground there dedicated to Prismic. And so that's what we've put into place in response to what we see is a very large opportunity there. If you think about the discussions we've had even on this call about the foreign -- the U.S. dollar and other foreign currency-denominated products that are sold-in Japan and have historically been sold-in Japan. With the upcoming ESR, so the new economic solvency regime that's going to be adopted in Japan, there is a there is a it -- that solvency regime is fairly punitive with respect to long duration liabilities and foreign currency denominated liabilities in very much what we believe to be a non-economic way. And we think that that's going to give rise to be a catalyst to ongoing desire by insurers in that marketplace to continue to meet the customer demand for those products, because Japanese customers continue to have an interest in dollar-denominated products and the returns that they can get on those. But to meet -- to be able to square that off with being able to economically finance the reserves and capital against that business in a way that continues to create a compelling economic proposition for the Japanese customers. So we're actually quite excited about that opportunity. We think the brand and quality and scale of our own business -- business there gives us incredible credibility with the other insurers in that marketplace that would be interested in doing things on as I described before that would follow a pattern of what we're able to do with our own book from an optimization standpoint?\nWilma Burdis: Okay, thank you. And then my understanding is that there are some tailwinds for U.K. longevity blocks. Is that something you're seeing? And maybe just talk a little bit about why that market is attractive? Thanks.\nCaroline Feeney: Yes, of course, Wilma, it's Caroline, and I'll take your question. So in the near-term for longevity reinsurance or overall international reinsurance, we remain focused on the U.S., the U.K. and the Netherlands. And that -- but what I would say specifically to your question on the U.K., we continue to see very strong funding levels there, actually reaching 113%. And when we look at the market size in the U.K., we do expect a size of around $70 billion in pension risk transfer for the year, most of which will seek reinsurance solutions. And so this is why we are pleased that we're not only a leader in this business in the U.S., but also in U.K. and obviously, Wilma, you also saw our expansion last year in the Netherlands. And so for the time being, those are very much our three areas of focus and we're pleased to remain a leader.\nWilma Burdis: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Alex Scott from Barclays. Your line is now live.\nAlex Scott: Hi, good morning. First one I had for you is on the comments that were made on, I guess, surrenders in foreign currency products being a bit elevated. And it was noted that there was some earnings pressure from that. I wanted to also get a feel for what kind of revenue pressure is that exhibiting on the international franchise, particularly Life Planner?\nAndy Sullivan: So Alex, it's Andy. I'll take -- I'll take your question. And maybe just let's start by explaining the dynamics to make sure everyone has it clear. So the weaker yen is leading to an enhanced level of U.S. dollar policy surrenders. That's really kind of flowing from two things. First, on U.S. dollar recurring premium products, affordability has become an issue for customers as it takes more yen to pay the premium. Second, some customers in our U.S. dollar investment products are looking to monetize their gains. So with this, they either reduce their level of coverage or they turn the policy in. That obviously has some influence on our sales, but I think the best way to think about this is had it not been for this surrender experience over this recent -- recent period, we would have seen instead of being flat, low-single-digit earnings growth across our PII business segment. So it's influencing both obviously the premium and the AOI.\nAlex Scott: Got it. That's helpful. And then I had a follow-up on the potential for reinsurance in Japan and the comments on Prismic. When I think about Pru's business, it very much aligns with what was described in terms of longer duration, a lot of foreign currency denominated in USD, etc. If you were to engage in a transaction involving your own business, should we think about that more as like mitigating whatever impact would have been there from the economic solvency regime or is -- or does it go further than that? I mean, should we think about it as potentially releasing capital that could -- that could be redeployed elsewhere in your business. So let me answer that question.\nRobFalzon: Sorry, it's Rob. Let me answer that question. Well, let me say more broadly, when we think about reinsurance. And whether that'd be to Prismic or it'd be to sort of other opportunities that we have for reinsurance within our portfolio, we really think about reinsurance as an opportunity to, one, derisk and grow our portfolio. So financing for growth and by reinsuring, diversifying against risk. And we also think about that as the -- as an opportunity for optimizing our backbook and that will be in response to things like you're alluding to the TSR regime, the economic solvency regime and excuse me in Japan. And when we look at the benefits from that reinsurance, we then say, okay, from an economic and business strategy standpoint, what is the optimal outcome for us? So as we're thinking about that, there are going to be instances where we're looking to do reinsurance in order to be able to deliver products to the marketplace on a compelling -- with a compelling value proposition. There are going to be other times when we're looking to ensure that we've got an optimization of our own capital against the regimes as they're being modified. And there are other times when we just see a dislocation between how blocks of business are being valued within our franchise in a public basis versus what we see as the opportunity to transact in the private marketplace where they will be valued differently, obviously at a higher valuation on -- and provide therefore to our investors, shareholders a better risk-adjusted return by being to monetize those.\nYanela Frias: And Alex, maybe if I could add specifically to Japan and our business and ESR, I did share in the first quarter that we reinsured $3 billion of U.S. dollar-denominated whole life products from Japan to our Bermuda affiliate Gibraltari. And in the second quarter, we executed a transaction for U.S. dollar new business from Gibraltar to PICA. So definitely is a tool that will help us stabilize capital in all of our operating entities, including in Japan. Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is a follow-up from Wes Carmichael from Autonomous. Your line is now live.\nWes Carmichael: Hi, thanks for taking the follow-up. I guess I just really wanted to follow-up on this particular topic on ESR. And Rob, your comments that you know this regime is punitive and perhaps uneconomic for long-duration liabilities. Like I guess I think about -- I understand that you have levers for reinsurance for your own book, but is this transition to ESR, like is this ex reinsurance, like would this be somewhat problematic in terms of you know, Pru needing to capitalize the business to a greater degree or something? I'm just trying to understand kind of the issue that maybe you and both Japanese insurers are facing here.\nAndy Sullivan: Yes. No, Wes, it's Andy. You want to start Yanela, and then I'll add in?\nYanela Frias: Yes, Wes, let me start in terms of the impact to our capital position. So I'll reiterate that we believe our Japan businesses are well-capitalized and financially strong and that strength would be reflected under any reasonable capital standard, including the new ESR framework like as we mentioned that we have tools like reinsurance. We have transacted in a couple of blocks of business, but we expect that upon implementation of our capital levels will continue to be above target levels that would support a AA financial strength ratings in Japan.\nAndy Sullivan: Yes, Wes, and it's Andy. I was just going to add. We've managed changing capital regimes at Prudential over a very long period of time. In Japan, we have a very broad product portfolio that meets the needs of our customers. We've continued to innovate and expand that portfolio, including with ESR-friendly type products. So the bottom-line is as a management team, between the product capabilities combined with our strong underwriting, our ALM capabilities, hedging and reinsurance, we believe we have everything -- we need to continue to profitably grow in Japan and navigate these changes.\nWes Carmichael: Got it. That's all very helpful. And I guess my follow-up would be, just any help with the outlook for the pension risk transfer market into the fourth quarter. I know the third quarter was a big one with IBM. But as you look to this quarter and maybe even to 2025, any thoughts there?\nCaroline Feeney: Yes. Of course, Wes, it's Caroline, and I'll take that one. So with over $16 billion and a 40% market share in PRT sales this year, clearly we're continuing to demonstrate our strong market leadership. And as we look forward to '25, we continue to view the U.S. PRT market as highly attractive with $3 trillion in outstanding U.S. corporate pension liabilities, favorable funding positions and a robust long-term pipeline of opportunities. And while the market remains highly competitive, we believe we are uniquely positioned to execute. Of course, our scale, our depth of underwriting experience as well as our ability to originate attractive assets enable us to price competitively while generating attractive returns for our shareholders. We also delivered deep expertise, have a demonstrated ability to handle complex deals and provide industry-leading service. And Wes, we believe that combination is evident in our sales this year where over half of our transactions have been with existing clients. And those traits are exactly why Prudential remains one of the few companies to have successfully executed transactions over $1 billion and why we continue to feel very confident about our go-forward business.\nWes Carmichael: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is a follow-up from Tom Gallagher from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live.\nTom Gallagher: Thanks, Yanela, just -- would you mind reiterating what you said you're going to change the quarterly disclosure? Did you say you were going to eliminate the quarterly bridge that you typically provide on the next quarter-out? And I think I heard you say you were going to start pre-announcing alternatives and any other changes you're planning on making? Thanks.\nYanela Frias: Yes, Tom. So we are eliminating the quarterly baseline disclosure and we're replacing that with intermediate-term financial targets, starting with '25 and pre-announcing variable investment income. Those are the two key changes we're making. We are still going to speak to unique items in the quarter really to help you understand what's happening, but that's the extent of the changes.\nTom Gallagher: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is a follow-up from Suneet Kamath from Jefferies. Your line is now live.\nSuneet Kamath: Hi, thanks. I just wanted to circle back on this concept of doing a backbook deal with Prismic. I just want to make sure I'm thinking about it right. So if you were to do a deal with a block of business from Japan, is it fair to say that there might be some initial EPS pressure because you're giving up some of the earnings that you're now -- you own 100% of it and obviously, you'll give up some of those earnings to your Prismic partners. Presumably, you'll free up some capital, which you can then deploy in new business, but there might be a little bit of a lag between when you lose the earnings on the backbook versus when you deploy the capital that's being freed. Is that the right way to think about it or is there some sort of offset that I'm missing there?\nRobFalzon: No, Suneet, I think you've -- I'm sorry, it's Rob. I think you've captured it well, which is -- that's not unique to doing a backbook deal in Japan. That's that you could use that same description and apply it to each of the reinsurance transactions that we've done to date, which is that by virtue of reinsuring we unlock capital and embedded value and in Japan, in particular, we think that our products there have very high levels of margins in the reserves that we have and so we're able to release those reserves and capital associated with it. By virtue of reinsuring, then the AOI associated with that block will no longer appear on our earnings. However, our analysis looks at what the economics of that translate into with the freed up capital and our ability to redeploy that capital. And does PGIM manage all of the assets that back the Japanese liabilities already or is there a portion of assets that they don't manage that if it went into Prismic, it would start to earn fees on?\nRobFalzon: No. The assets that we have within our business today are the vast, vast majority of them are managed by PGIM. There's a selective a couple of instances where we do have some third-party managers in specific areas that PGIM is not focused on. But I would say by and large, it'd be accurate to characterize that those liabilities -- excuse me, those assets that are backing the liabilities are being managed by PGIM today. When they transferred into Prismic, they would be managed -- continue to be managed by PGIM, but on a sort of a third-party set of economics as opposed to the economic arrangement we have with the general account and that generally is accretive to PGIM.\nSuneet Kamath: Got it. Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Lowrey for any further closing comments.\nCharlie Lowrey: Okay. Thank you, and thank you again for joining us today. We've entered the last quarter of this year, pleased with the progress we've made to become a higher-growth and more capital-efficient company. We are well-positioned to address the growing needs of our customers and clients around the world as they seek to protect their life's work and live better lives longer. So thank you again and enjoy the rest of the day.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day.

            "name": "Andy Sullivan",
            "content": "Yes. Suneet. Good morning. It's Andy. I'll take the question. So we're pleased with the profitability of the sales that we're seeing in Japan and we do not expect an impact on the margins given the mix-shift between the product types. We're actually quite excited. We see a long-term opportunity to help the citizens in Japan prepare for and enjoy their retirement. Given the longevity aspects of Japan and the low bank savings yields, we believe that we're going to see a continued strengthening of demand for a broader set of retirement products. While we already have a broad product portfolio there, we've been methodically diversifying and expanding our capabilities to really lean into this opportunity and you saw that success of that strategy in third quarter with our retirement investment product sales increasing about 30% year-to-date versus the prior year. And those sales accounted for the majority of Japan sales in the quarter. So, we don't expect an impact on the margin given that mix shift and we're very excited as we see this as early days and what should be a very long-term opportunity tailwind. Yes, Tom, it's Andy. I'll take the question. So in the third quarter, we saw about 30% of our sales in Japan were yen-based sales. The fact is our level of yen-based sales has nearly doubled over the last three years and this has been based on what have been a series of very intentional actions on our part. You know, we believe in having a broadly diversified product portfolio in every geography that we operate. So for Japan, that means having good diversification across life insurance, retirement and savings products and having a nice balance between U.S. dollar and yen offerings.

We've been expanding the yen-based offerings and we're seeing the success of that strategy. Sure, Nick. It's Andy. And let me actually comment on institutional and retail.

            "name": "Caroline Feeney",
            "content": "Yes, sure. Thanks for your question, Suneet. So first of all, let me say, we are extremely pleased with our individual retirement results. And as you saw in the third quarter, we drove over $3.5 billion of sales, making it our best quarter in over a decade. And this strong performance is the direct result of our efforts over the past few years to diversify our annuity portfolio, allowing us to meet more of the consumer need for protected savings and income. In fact, we now have the broadest individual product portfolio we've ever had. And to put that in perspective, Suneet, as Charlie mentioned in his opening comments, just two years ago, we had only one-product that generated over $1 billion in sales. Now we already have five products that have exceeded that mark this year. So in terms of your question on sustainability, the outlook for our individual annuity franchise remained strong. Beyond our diversified portfolio, what we see is a clear tailwind coming from aging demographics. That's over 11,000 Americans turning 65 every day and 30 million Americans turning 65 between now and 2030. So a lot of that growth to need is coming from that tailwind. And we're also seeing increased demand in the marketplace for protected savings and income solutions. So combining those factors, the industry is on pace for a third sequential record-setting sales year as you say, with year-to-date sales outpacing last year by more than 25%. And we'll meet that demand head-on with our diverse portfolio of solutions and the strength of our brand and our distribution. Yes. Hi, John, it's Caroline. Thank you for your question. And yes, we are very much upbeat and confident in terms of our Group results going-forward. And we have a number of strategic partnerships that we've recently executed. And most of these are very much focused on elevating the customer enrollment experience, but they're also going to be a key contributor to our overall focus on things like claims management. And I'll just give you a few examples, John. One of those is a partnership with a leading edge technology firm that's really transforming the benefits experience for millions of people. And essentially their innovative platform walks employees through the enrollment process, connecting them with credential counselors for one-on-one support. Another partnership we have is with Evolution IQ. This is an AI-driven platform that leverages data to expedite claim, examiner -- evaluations in short as well as long-term disability claims. And the platform is going to help us eliminate manual work. It's going to help us provide better outcomes for customers overall for disability claims. And I would just say in terms of how we're feeling about our group business overall, John, it is growing nicely as we've demonstrated another strong quarter driven by solid underlying fundamentals. We're growing at attractive markets margins. And when I think about our overall diversification strategy, improving claims management capabilities and investments in those strategic partnerships I just mentioned, we're very much positioned to continue to see that profitable growth and solid earnings. Yes, of course, Wes, it's Caroline, and I'll take your question. So our entry into the medical stop loss builds upon our strategy to diversify our portfolio across both client segments and products. And this move allows us to better serve the evolving needs of our clients by offering a broader range of solutions, particularly West in the mid-market. And as you know, employers frequently purchase medical stop loss in conjunction with other group products, making it attractive from a portfolio perspective and allowing us to leverage our deep customer and our broker relationships. In the near-term, Wes, we plan to take a thoughtful approach to scaling with a disciplined underwriting process and robust reinsurance program with experienced partners. And given the size of our total book, we expect it to be a small portion of our business mix. Our longer-term success will be guided by a disciplined approach to scale. We're committed to sustainable growth and ensuring that our expansion in this area is both strategic and measured. Yes, of course, Wilma, it's Caroline, and I'll take your question. So in the near-term for longevity reinsurance or overall international reinsurance, we remain focused on the U.S., the U.K. and the Netherlands. And that -- but what I would say specifically to your question on the U.K., we continue to see very strong funding levels there, actually reaching 113%. And when we look at the market size in the U.K., we do expect a size of around $70 billion in pension risk transfer for the year, most of which will seek reinsurance solutions. And so this is why we are pleased that we're not only a leader in this business in the U.S., but also in U.K. and obviously, Wilma, you also saw our expansion last year in the Netherlands. And so for the time being, those are very much our three areas of focus and we're pleased to remain a leader. Yes. Of course, Wes, it's Caroline, and I'll take that one. So with over $16 billion and a 40% market share in PRT sales this year, clearly we're continuing to demonstrate our strong market leadership. And as we look forward to '25, we continue to view the U.S. PRT market as highly attractive with $3 trillion in outstanding U.S. corporate pension liabilities, favorable funding positions and a robust long-term pipeline of opportunities. And while the market remains highly competitive, we believe we are uniquely positioned to execute. Of course, our scale, our depth of underwriting experience as well as our ability to originate attractive assets enable us to price competitively while generating attractive returns for our shareholders. We also delivered deep expertise, have a demonstrated ability to handle complex deals and provide industry-leading service. And Wes, we believe that combination is evident in our sales this year where over half of our transactions have been with existing clients. And those traits are exactly why Prudential remains one of the few companies to have successfully executed transactions over $1 billion and why we continue to feel very confident about our go-forward business."

            "name": "RobFalzon",
            "content": "Ryan, it's Rob. I'll take the first part of your question and I think Charlie will probably jump in and handle the second part of that. So, I guess what I'd start with, Ryan, is that I would reiterate what we said last quarter, which is we'd be disappointed if we've not entered into an additional transaction that we could announce before year-end. We're continuing our work on a very active pipeline. It's got multiple reinsurance transactions across a spectrum of types, so it's ongoing looking at our own balance sheet optimization. It's looking at opportunities for flow or new sales financing as well as third-party blocks and there we have a particular focus on Japan. And as you may have seen, we actually made -- Prismic actually made an announcement that we've stood up a dedicated licensed team in Tokyo in order to be able to advance that opportunity. While they're all in play, I think we would say that the likely next transaction is going to be back-book amongst the variety of things that we're working on and potentially in Japan. The interest in that is in particularly that it would help establish the plumbing and the precedent for doing third-party transactions from that market, which is a -- we think is an interesting market in which we have a competitive advantage. If I was stepping back, Ryan, I would say we have a visible pipeline. We have capital available to us. We've got the right underwriting expertise and the staffing at Prismic. And all of that combines to give us confidence in our ability to scale Prismic in a way that's consistent with our aspirations and the aspirations of our investors. Wilma, it's Rob. Sure. The -- so in order for us to be able to effectively do reinsurance transactions in Japan, we need to have an agency license business on the ground there dedicated to Prismic. And so that's what we've put into place in response to what we see is a very large opportunity there. If you think about the discussions we've had even on this call about the foreign -- the U.S. dollar and other foreign currency-denominated products that are sold-in Japan and have historically been sold-in Japan. With the upcoming ESR, so the new economic solvency regime that's going to be adopted in Japan, there is a there is a it -- that solvency regime is fairly punitive with respect to long duration liabilities and foreign currency denominated liabilities in very much what we believe to be a non-economic way. And we think that that's going to give rise to be a catalyst to ongoing desire by insurers in that marketplace to continue to meet the customer demand for those products, because Japanese customers continue to have an interest in dollar-denominated products and the returns that they can get on those. But to meet -- to be able to square that off with being able to economically finance the reserves and capital against that business in a way that continues to create a compelling economic proposition for the Japanese customers. So we're actually quite excited about that opportunity. We think the brand and quality and scale of our own business -- business there gives us incredible credibility with the other insurers in that marketplace that would be interested in doing things on as I described before that would follow a pattern of what we're able to do with our own book from an optimization standpoint? Sorry, it's Rob. Let me answer that question. Well, let me say more broadly, when we think about reinsurance. And whether that'd be to Prismic or it'd be to sort of other opportunities that we have for reinsurance within our portfolio, we really think about reinsurance as an opportunity to, one, derisk and grow our portfolio. So financing for growth and by reinsuring, diversifying against risk. And we also think about that as the -- as an opportunity for optimizing our backbook and that will be in response to things like you're alluding to the TSR regime, the economic solvency regime and excuse me in Japan. And when we look at the benefits from that reinsurance, we then say, okay, from an economic and business strategy standpoint, what is the optimal outcome for us? So as we're thinking about that, there are going to be instances where we're looking to do reinsurance in order to be able to deliver products to the marketplace on a compelling -- with a compelling value proposition. There are going to be other times when we're looking to ensure that we've got an optimization of our own capital against the regimes as they're being modified. And there are other times when we just see a dislocation between how blocks of business are being valued within our franchise in a public basis versus what we see as the opportunity to transact in the private marketplace where they will be valued differently, obviously at a higher valuation on -- and provide therefore to our investors, shareholders a better risk-adjusted return by being to monetize those. No, Suneet, I think you've -- I'm sorry, it's Rob. I think you've captured it well, which is -- that's not unique to doing a backbook deal in Japan. That's that you could use that same description and apply it to each of the reinsurance transactions that we've done to date, which is that by virtue of reinsuring we unlock capital and embedded value and in Japan, in particular, we think that our products there have very high levels of margins in the reserves that we have and so we're able to release those reserves and capital associated with it. By virtue of reinsuring, then the AOI associated with that block will no longer appear on our earnings. However, our analysis looks at what the economics of that translate into with the freed up capital and our ability to redeploy that capital. And does PGIM manage all of the assets that back the Japanese liabilities already or is there a portion of assets that they don't manage that if it went into Prismic, it would start to earn fees on? No. The assets that we have within our business today are the vast, vast majority of them are managed by PGIM. There's a selective a couple of instances where we do have some third-party managers in specific areas that PGIM is not focused on. But I would say by and large, it'd be accurate to characterize that those liabilities -- excuse me, those assets that are backing the liabilities are being managed by PGIM today. When they transferred into Prismic, they would be managed -- continue to be managed by PGIM, but on a sort of a third-party set of economics as opposed to the economic arrangement we have with the general account and that generally is accretive to PGIM."

            "name": "Yanela Frias",
            "content": "Thank you, Rob. I will begin on Slide 10, which provides insight into earnings for the fourth quarter of 2024 relative to our third quarter results. Pre-tax adjusted operating income for the third quarter was $1.6 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $3.48 on an after-tax basis. To get a sense of how our fourth quarter results might develop, we suggest adjustments for the following items. First, variable investment income was below expectations by $50 million in the third quarter, driven by lower private equity returns. Beginning next quarter, we plan to pre-announce our estimated variable investment income results. Next, underwriting experience was above expectations by $15 million in the third quarter. And last, we include an adjustment of $100 million for expenses and other items. Higher expenses in the third quarter reflect the timing of investments in enterprise initiatives to support growth. We expect higher initiative investments to continue in the fourth quarter and maintain the full year 2024 expected loss in Corporate & Other of $1.8 billion. We also expect seasonally lower annual premiums of $50 million in international in the fourth quarter. These adjustments combined get us to a baseline of $3.34 per share for the fourth quarter. I will note that if you exclude items specific to the fourth quarter, earnings per share would be $3.67. The key takeaway is that our underlying earnings power increased and reflects the improved quality of earnings from intentionally shifting our business mix and continued investment in the growth of our market-leading businesses. While we have provided these items to consider, please note that there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the future. A few items that I would highlight. We continue to benefit from new money rates that were higher than our portfolio yield in the third quarter, and we do not expect a significant impact from the potential decline in short-term rates. We have cash at the holding company, floating rate assets across our businesses and collateral in Individual Retirement Strategies that earn short-term yields, which is generally offset by interest-rate derivatives that manage duration across our businesses where we pay short-term rates and receive fixed. The earnings benefit from the recent pension risk transfer transactions grows over time as we reposition the investment portfolio and is viewed by In-Force runoff. In addition, our legacy variable annuities In-Force is running off at $3 billion to $4 billion per quarter and we have been experiencing an elevated level of surrenders in our businesses in Japan associated with U.S. dollar products as the yen has weakened relative to the U.S. dollar. The exchange rate hit a 38-year low in the second quarter. And while we have experienced a reduction in surrender levels as the yen strengthened during the third quarter, we expect some continued near-term pressure on earnings before surrenders normalized. Also of note, in order to provide greater insight into our financial outlook and to better align with the longer-term nature of our business, we plan to introduce new intermediate-term financial targets. These targets will replace our quarterly baseline disclosure concurrent with the release of our fourth quarter earnings results. Turning to Slide 11. Our regulatory capital ratios are strong and above levels that we believe represent AA financial strength as we continue to maintain margins to support strong organic growth prospects and are prepared for the potential impacts of market-driven volatility. Our cash and liquid assets were $4.3 billion, which is above our minimum liquidity target of $3 billion and we have substantial off-balance sheet resources. We remain thoughtful in our capital deployment, preserving financial strength and flexibility, investing in our businesses for long-term growth and returning capital to shareholders. Turning to Slide 12, and in summary, we are becoming a higher growth, more capital-efficient company. We are maintaining a disciplined approach to capital deployment and our growth is supported by the strength of our balance sheet. And with that, we will be happy to take your questions. Hi, Tom, it's Yanela. And let me take that question. So yes, the observations and the expectations from the report are consistent with our internal view and with the approach that we have taken for our mortality assumptions. So our assumptions reflect some continued excess mortality through 2028 before returning to the pre-pandemic trend line. And obviously, we regularly monitor mortality trends in advances and adjust accordingly every year during our annual assumption process in the second quarter. I would remind you that we have a diversified mix of businesses providing natural mortality hedges, right? So life insurance and PRT and also throughout globally within the U.S. and other significant insurance markets such as Japan and the U.K. And so a few data points on what we are seeing. In individual life, we have experienced mortality that is broadly in line with expectations since updating our mortality base table assumptions in 2022 and this quarter we saw favorable experience. Now the individual life insured population is less impacted by COVID than the general population. Our PRT mortality experience has trended heavier in 2023 that is consistent with continued excess mortality. And what I would say is that, our PRT population tends to be more closely correlated to the general population. Hi, John, it's Yanela. That will be included in the current disclosure that we provide on AUM. So it will be all-inclusive. Hi, Wes. This is Yanela. And so yes, let me start with just kind of reaffirming what we're doing. So we plan to introduce new intermediate-term financial targets beginning for 2025. And really we're making this change to provide greater insight into our financial outlook and to better align with the longer-term nature of our business where the economics emerge over a longer period of time. We also think it will help investors better understand our business outlook and earnings power. So that is really what we're doing. We will be replacing the quarterly baseline. And again, as we shared also, we will be pre-announcing VII. We plan to implement these changes beginning with the release of the fourth quarter earnings results. So we will share the targets and the information at that time. No, sorry. And Alex, maybe if I could add specifically to Japan and our business and ESR, I did share in the first quarter that we reinsured $3 billion of U.S. dollar-denominated whole life products from Japan to our Bermuda affiliate Gibraltari. And in the second quarter, we executed a transaction for U.S. dollar new business from Gibraltar to PICA. So definitely is a tool that will help us stabilize capital in all of our operating entities, including in Japan. Yes. Thank you. Yes, Wes, let me start in terms of the impact to our capital position. So I'll reiterate that we believe our Japan businesses are well-capitalized and financially strong and that strength would be reflected under any reasonable capital standard, including the new ESR framework like as we mentioned that we have tools like reinsurance. We have transacted in a couple of blocks of business, but we expect that upon implementation of our capital levels will continue to be above target levels that would support a AA financial strength ratings in Japan. Yes, Tom. So we are eliminating the quarterly baseline disclosure and we're replacing that with intermediate-term financial targets, starting with '25 and pre-announcing variable investment income. Those are the two key changes we're making. We are still going to speak to unique items in the quarter really to help you understand what's happening, but that's the extent of the changes."

            "name": "Charlie Lowrey",
            "content": "Thank you, Bob, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Our third quarter performance reflects continued positive momentum in growing our businesses, increasing capital efficiency, and pivoting our product suite to address the investing, insurance, and retirement needs of our customers and clients around the world. We reported robust sales across our U.S. and international insurance and retirement businesses as well as strong investment performance and private credit originations in PGIM. We also maintained our disciplined approach to capital deployment, while continuing to invest in our businesses and returning excess capital to shareholders. Our strategic progress and performance are backed by our financial strength. Turning to Slide 3. This morning, I will highlight how we continue to become a higher-growth, more capital-efficient company. We are growing our market-leading businesses while increasing our capital flexibility. Let's start by taking a closer look at how our Retirement Strategies business is benefiting from the global retirement opportunity. On the Institutional side, our continued leadership in pension risk transfer was reinforced through a second transaction with IBM, this time to reinsure $6 billion of pension liabilities. With this latest transaction, we have now closed seven out of the 10 largest pension risk transfer deals in the U.S. On the Individual side, five of our annuity products have exceeded $1 billion in sales so far this year, validating our product diversification strategy. Our Japan business is another great example of how we are addressing the growing demand for retirement products. While life insurance has traditionally comprised the bulk of our business in Japan, year-to-date sales of retirement and savings products are up 30% compared to the prior year. Meanwhile, PGIM is well-positioned to help plan sponsors deliver benefits to millions of retirement beneficiaries through its diversified investment solutions. As a market leader, with nearly $0.5 trillion of assets under management supporting defined benefit and defined contribution plans, PGIM serves more than half of the world's 300 largest pension funds. Now, let's look at how we are further growing our market-leading businesses by diversifying our products and expanding our global distribution networks. In our Retirement Strategies business, we're increasing the number of individual annuity solutions and adding new workplace partnerships, like the relationship we recently announced with JPMorgan Asset Management. In our Group Insurance business, we are expanding our disability and supplemental health products and growing our position in the under 5,000 lives and association market segments. Turning to our Individual Life business. We continue to launch innovative, more capital-efficient products, and we have positive momentum across our distribution channels. In our International Businesses, we're benefiting from recent product launches and our strong multi-channel distribution in both, Japan and Brazil. And lastly, PGIM continues to benefit from our deeply connected and reinforcing business mix, resulting in strong affiliated flows on a year-to-date basis. In addition, private alternatives capital deployment has increased 24% year-to-date, underscoring the demand in the market and PGIM's private credit capabilities. PGIM is also well-positioned to continue to capture the growing retail demand for fixed-income products. In addition, our investments in technology across our insurance, retirement and asset management businesses is helping us to deliver exceptional sales, service, and claims experiences, supporting our growth strategy. At the same time, we're improving the quality of earnings from the continued shift of our business mix. This quarter, we announced a transaction with Wilton Re to reinsure an $11 billion guaranteed universal life block. Following this transaction, we will have reduced our guaranteed universal life reserves by 60%, advancing our strategic progress to become a higher-growth, more capital-efficient company. Turning to Slide 4. Our continued investments in our businesses are supported by our disciplined approach to capital deployment, which included returning more than $700 million to shareholders during the third quarter. Turning to Slide 5. Our growth strategy is further supported by our financial strength and our risk and capital management framework. We maintain a AA rating which reflects a healthy capital position, including more than $4 billion in highly liquid assets at the end of the third quarter. We also maintain a well-diversified, high-quality portfolio and disciplined approach to Asset-Liability Management. In closing, we're operating from a position of strength with confidence in our strategy, our capabilities and our path to deliver long-term sustainable value for all our stakeholders. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob. And Ryan, this is Charlie. Let me add on to what Rob said in terms of capital deployment. You know, we've always said that we want to be good stewards of capital and that we have a consistent disciplined and balanced approach to the redeployment of that capital with our businesses and to our shareholders and there are really three aspects to our approach on which we focus. The first is just maintaining our rock-solid balance sheet and financial strength, which is fundamental to us in terms of fulfilling our promises, which we've done for almost 150 years. The second is investing, both organically and through programmatic acquisitions to support the sustainable long-term growth of our businesses. And finally, returning excess capital to shareholders as we've done in the past. And in this quarter, we deployed capital to support strong sales across our businesses, including several new products to meet the evolving needs of our customers, and we returned over $700 million to shareholders. So we have a consistent process and we're going to follow that through. Hi, Nick, it's Charlie. Let me take that one and I'll take a step back and then directly answer your question. But, you know, we feel really good about the considerable progress we've made in shifting our business mix to be more capital efficient and the fact that we're well-positioned to capture market opportunities for higher growth. We'd execute it on several transactions that have driven a 50% reduction in our traditional variable annuities portfolio and also a 60% reduction in the guaranteed universal life reserves and then following the transaction we announced in the third quarter with Wilton Re. And while we've been quite successful in increasing our capital efficiency as part of our strategy, we've been equally focused on investing in our market-leading businesses to drive growth with some of those proceeds. Having said that, and this gets to your question, we will consider additional opportunities as long as they meet our strategic and financial objectives and make sense for all our stakeholders. So we'll continue to review our portfolios, but it needs to meet the strategic and financial objectives that we talked about. Okay. Thank you, and thank you again for joining us today. We've entered the last quarter of this year, pleased with the progress we've made to become a higher-growth and more capital-efficient company. We are well-positioned to address the growing needs of our customers and clients around the world as they seek to protect their life's work and live better lives longer. So thank you again and enjoy the rest of the day."

And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Charlie.\nCharlie Lowrey: Thank you, Bob, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. During the second quarter, we continued to grow our market-leading businesses and become more capital efficient to deliver greater long-term value for our stakeholders. Our momentum was driven by robust sales in our U.S. and International Businesses, as well as strong investment performance and originations across PGIM\u2019s Private Alternatives platform. We maintained our disciplined approach to capital deployment by investing in the growth of our businesses and returning excess capital to shareholders. This progress was supported by our strong financial position. Turning to Slide 3, I will focus my remarks this morning on the strategic actions we are taking to expand access to investing, insurance and retirement security, and how they position us to address the evolving financial challenges of our customers around the world. One of our most compelling growth opportunities is addressing the increasing global demand for retirement products, solutions, and advice. This year, historic levels of Americans will turn 65. At the same time, 55-year-olds will enter the crucial decade before retirement in preparation for life after work. These aging demographics will result in an estimated $137 trillion retirement opportunity in the U.S. and $26 trillion in Japan by 2050. As a leader in pension risk transfer and individual annuities, Retirement Strategies is delivering products and solutions that protect the life\u2019s work of our customers and ensure a more financially secure retirement for people around the world. Our market leadership is demonstrated by nearly $22 billion in Retirement Strategies sales in the first half of this year, representing a 67% increase from the prior year. This includes robust sales in pension risk and longevity risk transfer, as well as nearly doubling our individual annuity sales. Since the launch of our FlexGuard Indexed Variable Annuity product suite in 2020, our sales have exceeded $21 billion. Meanwhile, in Japan, our customers are benefiting from an expanded product suite demonstrated by a 20% increase in retirement and savings product sales year-over-year. PGIM, our global asset management business, is well-positioned to address the increasing demand for retirement solutions around the world, while capitalizing on growing institutional demand for private credit and alternative investments. PGIM provides investment solutions that help retirement plan sponsors deliver benefits to millions of beneficiaries. With nearly $0.5 trillion of assets under management supporting defined benefit and defined contribution plans, PGIM is a market leader, servicing more than half of the world\u2019s 300 largest pension funds, including over two-thirds of the largest 100 U.S. pension plans, and is the largest pension fund manager in Japan. PGIM also continues to grow its Private Alternatives business with capital deployment of nearly $11 billion in the second quarter, a 35% increase compared to a year-ago quarter. This includes the benefit of our recent acquisition of Deerpath Capital. Moving now to our market-leading insurance businesses, we have expanded our product suite and distribution channels to meet the growing demand for products and solutions that can help bridge the global life insurance gap. In our U.S. Insurance businesses, strong sales continue to benefit from expanded distribution and product diversification. This has resulted in a shift to a more capital-efficient product mix. Year-to-date, Group Insurance sales are up 13% and Individual Life sales are up 7% compared to the first half of 2023. In Brazil, we continue to expand our third-party distribution and benefit from the high quality of our life planners. This has resulted in a 27% increase in year-to-date sales. Across each of our businesses, our strategy is underpinned by the continued investment in capabilities and initiatives that translate into future earnings growth. This includes expanding our products and distribution and using artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other technology to deliver exceptional sales, service, and claims experiences. Turning to Slide 4, our disciplined approach to capital deployment supported investments in our businesses while returning over $700 million to shareholders during the quarter. Turning to Slide 5, our financial strength, diversified business mix, and risk and capital management framework supports our growth strategy. Our AA rating reflects our healthy capital position, including more than $4 billion in highly liquid assets at the end of the second quarter, a high-quality, well-diversified investment portfolio, and a disciplined approach to asset liability management. We are confident that our financial strength, our business strategy and the evolving opportunities to support our customers around the world put us in a strong position to deliver long-term value to our shareholders. With that, I will turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our individual business performance.\nRob Falzon: Thank you, Charlie. I\u2019ll provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for our PGIM, U.S., and International Businesses. I\u2019ll begin on Slide 6 with our financial results for the second quarter of 2024. Our pre-tax adjusted operating income was $1.6 billion or $3.39 per share on an after-tax basis, up 10% from the year-ago quarter and 12.5% on a year-to-date basis. These results reflect the execution of our strategy to grow our market-leading businesses. Higher spread in fee income was the result of continued strong sales and the benefit of higher interest rates in equity markets. Additionally, expenses were lower and include a reduction in legal reserves. Results for the current quarter also include a modest net favorable impact from our annual assumptions update and other refinements reflecting the benefit of our diversified business mix. Year-to-date adjusted operating return on equity was 13.5% and has improved nearly 1.5 percentage points from the prior year. This reflects the strength of our businesses, the benefits from the deliberate actions we\u2019ve taken to pivot to more capital-efficient products, and operating efficiencies we\u2019ve achieved that support growth. Turning to the operating results from our businesses compared to the year-ago quarter. PGIM, our Global Investment Manager, had higher asset management fees driven by favorable investment performance, contributions from the Deerpath Capital acquisition, and equity market appreciation. Additionally, higher incentive and transaction fees resulted in an increase in other related revenues. This was partially offset by higher expenses to support business growth. Earnings growth in our U.S. businesses reflected higher spread income driven by business growth and the benefit of higher interest rates, more favorable underwriting results, and lower expenses. In addition, a more favorable relative impact from our annual assumptions update and other refinements was driven by a more favorable Retirement Strategies update partially offset by a less favorable update in Individual Life. This was partially offset by lower legacy traditional variable annuity fee income as we intentionally pivot to less market-sensitive products. Results of our International Businesses included an unfavorable relative impact from our annual assumptions update and other refinements, less favorable underwriting results, primarily reflecting policyholder behavior, and lower spread income due to less favorable variable investment income. Results in the quarter also included higher joint venture earnings. Turning to Slide 7, PGIM, our Global Investment Manager, has diversified capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed income, equities and alternatives. PGIM\u2019s strong investment performance continues to improve with 83% of assets under management exceeding their benchmarks over the past year. This has contributed favorably to strong long-term performance with 80% and over 90% of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last five-year and 10-year periods, respectively. PGIM\u2019s assets under management increased by 5% to $1.3 trillion from the year-ago quarter driven by market appreciation, investment performance and affiliated net flows. Third-party net outflows in the quarter totaled $9.5 billion. Institutional outflows of $8.9 billion were primarily in fixed income driven by two large clients. Retail outflows of $600 million were driven by sub-advised equity strategies and mutual funds and were partially offset by positive momentum in public fixed income. PGIM third-party flows are episodic due to large single-client transactions. On a year-to-date basis, we generated $17.1 billion of inflows reflecting the net benefit from large institutional pension clients. As the investment engine of Prudential, PGIM\u2019s capabilities support the success and growth of our U.S. and International Businesses in retirement, asset management, and insurance. PGIM\u2019s asset origination capabilities, investment management expertise and access to institutional and other sources of private capital, including through the recently launched Reinsurer Prismic, are a competitive advantage, helping our businesses bring enhanced solutions and create more value for our customers. Our insurance and retirement businesses, in turn, provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated net flows, as well as unique access to insurance liabilities. In addition, our diversified PGIM Private Alternatives platform, which has assets under management of approximately $240 billion, experienced strong private credit origination activity driven by our direct lending businesses, including from our recent acquisition of Deerpath Capital. Turning to Slide 8, our U.S. businesses produce diversified earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income, and benefit from our complementary mix of longevity and mortality businesses. We continue to focus on growing our market-leading businesses by transforming our capabilities to improve customer experiences and expanding our addressable market with new financial solutions leveraging the capabilities across Prudential. Retirement Strategies generated strong sales of $7.5 billion in the second quarter across its institutional and individual lines of business. Institutional Retirement sales of $4 billion included U.S.-funded pension risk transfer transactions of $1.4 billion and longevity risk transfer sales of $1.2 billion. Year-to-date, Institutional Retirement has generated sales of $15 billion. Individual Retirement posted $3.5 billion in sales, its best quarter of sales in over a decade. Our product pivots have resulted in continued strong sales of FlexGuard and FlexCard Income and fixed annuity sales have doubled from the prior year. Additionally, we continue to reduce market sensitivity by running off our legacy variable annuities. Group Insurance sales primarily occur in the first quarter of the year based on annual enrollments. On a year-to-date basis, sales increased 13% compared to the prior year, driven by growth in life, disability and supplemental health. We are executing our strategy of both product and client segmentation diversification while leveraging technology to increase operating efficiency and enhance customer experience. These actions to improve profitability and performance resulted in a favorable benefit ratio of 81.1%. In Individual Life, sales increased 3% from the year-ago quarter and 7% year-to-date. These increases include the benefit from our FlexGuard Life product, which reached its highest sales quarter since its launch in 2022, and from our pivot towards more capital-efficient products. Turning to Slide 9, our International Businesses include our Japanese life insurance companies, where we have a differentiated multi-channel distribution model, as well as other businesses aimed at expanding our presence in targeted high-growth emerging markets. In Japan, we are focused on providing high-quality service and expanding our distribution and product offerings. Our needs-based approach and protection of retirement product focus continue to provide important value to our customers as we expand our product offerings to meet their evolving needs. In emerging markets, we are focused on creating a selective portfolio of businesses and regions where customers\u2019 needs are growing, where there are compelling opportunities to build market-leading businesses, and where the financial enterprise can add value. Sales in our International Businesses were up 11% compared to the year-ago quarter. Higher sales in Japan are benefiting from recent product launches as we expand our retirement and savings offerings. These new products are gaining traction with customers and represented 20% of the current quarter sales. In addition, emerging market sales were higher, driven by growth in Brazil, as we continue to expand third-party distribution and benefit from the strong performance of our world-class life planners. As we look ahead, we are well-positioned across our businesses to be a global leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security. We continue to focus on investing in growth businesses and markets, delivering industry-leading customer experiences and creating the next generation of financial solutions to serve the diverse needs of a broad range of customers. And with that, I\u2019ll now hand it over to Yanela.\nYanela Frias: Thank you, Rob. I will begin on Slide 10, which provides insight into earnings for the third quarter of 2024 relative to our second quarter results. Pre-tax adjusted operating income for the second quarter was $1.6 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $3.39 on an after-tax basis. To get a sense of how our third quarter results might develop, we suggest adjustments for the following items. First, our annual assumption update and other refinements resulted in a net benefit of $6 million in the second quarter. Second, variable investment income was below expectations by $90 million in the second quarter, driven by lower real estate returns. Next, underwriting experience was below expectations by $10 million in the second quarter and we expect $30 million of favorable seasonality in the third quarter. And last, we include an adjustment of $95 million for expenses and other items. Expenses in the second quarter were lower than expected, reflecting a reduction in legal reserves and the timing of expenses. As a result, we have lowered the full year 2024 expected loss in corporate and other to $1.8 billion. In the third quarter, we expect higher investments in our initiatives to support growth as originally planned. These adjustments combined get us to a baseline of $3.48 per share for third quarter. I will note that if you exclude items specific to the third quarter, earnings per share would be $3.56. The key takeaway is that our underlying earnings power increased and reflects our continued investment in the growth of our market-leading businesses and our pivot away from more capital intensive and lower growth businesses. While we have provided these items to consider, please note that there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the third quarter. Turning to Slide 11, our capital position continues to support our AA financial strength rating. Our regulatory capital ratios are in excess of our AA objectives. Our cash and liquid assets were $4.4 billion, within our liquidity target range of $3 billion to $5 billion and we have substantial off-balance sheet resources. We remain thoughtful in our capital deployment, preserving financial strength and flexibility, investing in our businesses for long-term growth, and returning capital to shareholders. Turning to Slide 12, and in summary, we are growing our market-leading businesses, we are maintaining a disciplined approach to capital deployment and our growth is supported by the strength of our balance sheet. And with that, we will be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Ryan Krueger from KBW. Your line is now live.\nRyan Krueger: Hey. Thanks. Good morning. My first question was on Prismic. Can you give an update on your progress towards additional transactions and would you anticipate getting another one done before the end of the year?\nRob Falzon: Good morning, Ryan. It\u2019s Rob. Yeah. We and our Prismic investors share aspirations to grow well beyond the initial $10 billion transaction that we completed relatively recently. We continue to work on a very active pipeline of multiple insurance transactions. That pipeline includes ongoing balance sheet optimization, flow or new sales solutions across our businesses, as well as third-party blocks where we have a particular focus on Japan. I would be -- we would be disappointed if we\u2019ve not entered into an additional transaction before year end.\nRyan Krueger: Thank you. And the second one was on just hoping you could revisit your earnings sensitivity to short-term rates, and I think in addition to the total sensitivity, can you give some perspective on the different moving parts between some of the businesses?\nYanela Frias: Hi, Ryan. It\u2019s Yanela. Yes. With regards to rates, short-term rates, we do not expect much of an impact due to changes in short-term rates. We have cash at the holding company and collateral in individual Retirement Strategies that earned short-term yields. And this is generally offset by interest rate derivatives where we pay short-term rates and receive fixed, and we use these to manage duration across our businesses. So generally, these are offsetting. Let me also address long-term rates since we\u2019ve seen some recent movement. With respect to long-term rates, we have benefited from the rise in rates over the past few years. We have been at levels that are significantly higher than over the past decade and this has increased our portfolio yields in both domestic and international. So higher rates are good for us and it has been a tailwind. If rates were to decline, it would reduce our new money rates, but we do have a healthy spread between our new money rates and portfolio yields. And lastly, I would point out that we have a very disciplined ALM approach which significantly reduces future spread volatility of the enforced.\nRyan Krueger: Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Suneet Kamath from Jefferies. Your line is now live.\nSuneet Kamath: Good morning. Thank you. I guess last quarter you guys were pretty optimistic about the industry annuity sales. I think you said over $400 billion, and year-to-date, that\u2019s tracking pretty closely, so that\u2019s good. I guess my question is, given the moving rates that we\u2019ve seen, with the 10-year now, somewhere in the 3.8-yerar neighborhood, do you think that will dampen demand for annuity growth and how are you thinking about pricing in this if this becomes the new kind of rate environment? Thanks.\nCaroline Feeney: Yeah. So, Suneet, it\u2019s Caroline, and I\u2019ll take your question. So, right now, the annuity market continues to be extremely strong, as you referenced, with the market on pace to deliver a third straight record year, outpacing last year\u2019s run rate by over 20%. It\u2019s certainly possible that in a decreasing interest rate environment, we could see some pullback from the record sales levels, particularly in fixed annuities. From a Prudential perspective, while we\u2019ve been very pleased with the growth in our fixed annuity sales, for us, it\u2019s really just a piece of the overall portfolio. We have the broadest product portfolio we\u2019ve ever had, with no overconcentration in any single product. In fact, this past quarter, we had record sales in three distinct products, and two of those products are in our RILA suite of solutions, which are actually less sensitive to interest rates. And Suneet, this really reflects our very deliberate strategy, which enables us to serve the broadest set of customers across all market conditions. Frankly, we\u2019re also very excited about the broader retirement opportunity. We do see strengthening tailwinds from rapid growth in the population of Americans over age 65, and as well as increased demand for solutions that protect retirement savings and provide lifetime income. So, we believe customer demand for protected income will continue to be the driving force behind growth over the long-term and we\u2019re well positioned to meet that demand with our diverse portfolio of solutions and the strength of our brand and distribution. Finally, Suneet, you asked a question about pricing. We are also very well positioned to continue with our pricing discipline, which we have the ability to adapt pricing and enter the market with revised pricing in very short order, which enables us to be very nimble with changing markets.\nSuneet Kamath: Okay. That makes sense. Thanks for that. And then, I guess, for Rob, on Prismic again, you said that you\u2019d be disappointed if you didn\u2019t do something this year. Should we think about the sort of first deal that you do? Should that be on the smaller side as sort of a proof of concept deal or is that not the way that you\u2019re thinking about it? Thanks.\nRob Falzon: So, Suneet, so it would actually be the second deal. So, the first transaction we closed was about $10 billion in reserves and so relatively significant in size. For the next transaction, I would -- what I would say is that, the nature of underlying liabilities is what impacts the sizing of the transaction and that\u2019s going to be dependent upon sort of market sensitivity, hedging and collateral needs. So, we\u2019re not constraining it simply because of appetite or access to capital or other capabilities. It would really just be a function of making sure that as we\u2019re constructing the Prismic portfolio, it all fits together well.\nSuneet Kamath: And are you leaning one way or the other in terms of the different uses? Like, you\u2019ve talked about flow, you\u2019ve talked about your own in-force, you\u2019ve talked about third party. Is there one way that you\u2019re leaning in particular on that?\nRob Falzon: Well, I would say, we -- the continued balance sheet optimization is probably our highest priority, Suneet, and incidentally, the most controllable of the things that we\u2019re working on. But both flow and third-party are high priorities for us, and they are being actively worked as well.\nSuneet Kamath: Okay. Thanks, Rob.\nRob Falzon: Okay.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question is on PGIM. I know you guys had called out two large pension outflows in the quarter, but I was hoping to just get more color on trends and flows, both on the institutional and retail side, and how you think about the outlook for the balance of the year.\nAndy Sullivan: Sure. Good morning, Elyse. It\u2019s Andy. I\u2019ll take that. So our flows in PGIM have become more variable. This is mostly driven on the institutional side of the business, so let me start there. We\u2019re the sixth largest manager of defined benefit assets globally, and we have very large strategic pension clients.\\ If you look at many of these defined benefit portfolios as we sit here today are overfunded and those clients are either derisking or they\u2019re exploring PRT. So, as a result, we\u2019re seeing more than normal institutional money in motion, leading to a variability in our institutional flows. Overall, we expect that in PGIM, we\u2019ll be a beneficiary of that environment, given our world-class fixed income solutions and our leading PRT business. If you take a step back, though, and look across the year, last quarter you saw us benefit with noteworthy PRT wins and a large pension mandate inflow. This quarter, we saw fixed income outflows as a few of our clients de-risked and moved. But the important part is, when you look across the year, our institutional flows are positive year-to-date at $17 billion. On the retail side of the business, we have experienced large improvement versus last year. Year-to-date, our flows are flat, and that is a market improvement. We\u2019re starting to see flows back into our fixed income retail products with $1.1 billion in positive inflow this quarter. We believe this is poised to accelerate once clients start to move to $6 trillion that\u2019s sitting in money market assets over into longer-term active products and we expect that declining rates are going to be the trigger to that action. So the punchline overall, from a flows perspective, is we expect that we will remain a net winner over the long-term, but you should expect near-term variability. It will continue in this environment.\nElyse Greenspan: Thanks. And then my second question was on the group side. Results there were pretty strong. Just anything you\u2019re calling one-off there? And then how should we think about the benefits ratio trending in that business over the balance of the year?\nCaroline Feeney: Sure. Elyse, it\u2019s Caroline, and I\u2019ll take your question. There\u2019s really none -- nothing that\u2019s one-off, Elyse. It was really very much core strength in the business, which was driven by a few different factors. First of all, we continue to see strong life and group disability results driven by favorable mortality and by our focus on effective claims management, which is an area we continue to invest in. We also continue to see strong double-digit growth in our supplemental health business, which is a core component of our diversification strategy. And we\u2019ve also seen growth in our under-5,000 lives and our association market segments, helping us further broaden our portfolio. So, overall, Elyse, the business is growing, and it\u2019s doing so at attractive margins. In terms of your question on the benefit ratio, we delivered a very strong result coming in at 81% in line with a year-ago quarter and below our target range of 83% to 87%. Given that we have been below our target range for the first half of the year, you can expect for the year we would be towards the lower end of that target range.\nElyse Greenspan: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Wesley Carmichael from Autonomous Research. Your line is now live.\nWesley Carmichael: Good morning. Thank you. On Individual Life, I was hoping you could touch on the assumption review impact, what drove that unfavorable in the quarter and do you think there\u2019s an ongoing impact to either earnings or cash flow?\nYanela Frias: Hi, Wes. This is Yanela. So, let me take your question. I mean, to take it a step up, the annual assumption update this quarter had a modest benefit to adjusted operating income, as you saw, and this is a result of our multiline business mix that generally creates risk diversification and tends to moderate the annual assumption update impact. So the net modest benefit was due to favorable mortality updates for the Institutional Retirement Strategies, partially offset by unfavorable policyholder behavior updates for both Individual Life and Japan. And to your question about what drove the large impact to Individual Life, the negative impact to Individual Life was primarily due to lower guaranteed universal life surrender experience post-COVID as individuals retain their life-insuring policies at higher levels than previously assumed. And this was based on our examination of updated emerging experience data of our business and information available from a number of industry studies. So that is what drove the assumption update, and we do have a small ongoing impact from the assumption update as well.\nWesley Carmichael: Yeah. That\u2019s helpful, Yanela. And is that ongoing impact? Is that an operating earnings impact or is there any statutory impact on that?\nYanela Frias: So there\u2019s an ongoing operating income perspective. From a statutory perspective, the assumption update there, we have a process from a process standpoint that is done at the end of the year. So that will be reflected in our statutory results at the end of the year. Having said that, any impacts are not expected to be meaningful to our assessment of capital availability, cash flows or our capital deployment plans.\nWesley Carmichael: No. That\u2019s great. Thank you. And then maybe my follow-up, on variable investment income, I think some of your competitors this quarter have talked about an expectation for real estate equity returns to improve in the back half of the year. So just curious if you guys have the same outlook or not?\nRob Falzon: It\u2019s Rob. I\u2019ll take that question. I would say that if we look at the industry from an overall basis, our real estate investment group has a forecast that there will be actually continued valuation declines through the remainder of the year across the industry. Those valuation declines, though, will be in the low-single digits. So while we think we\u2019re close to an inflection point where that could begin to turn around, we\u2019re not quite sure we\u2019re at the trough of that yet.\nWesley Carmichael: That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, Rob.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Tom Gallagher from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live.\nTom Gallagher: Good morning. Just a follow-up on that actuarial review. I think most of the $800 million or so net income release from the review came from RILA. Would you mind just sort of, A, is that correct, and, B, can you talk about what drove the change, was that a utilization assumption changes, and will that be a gap-only impact or will there be a statutory impact as well?\nYanela Frias: Yes, Tom. It\u2019s Yanela. So, yes, the non-AOI impact was mainly due to RILA, and it was really driven by a methodology update to the annuity valuation, and this is really to be consistent with industry standard and also more consistent with how we actually manage the product. So it\u2019s a valuation methodology change. It is GAAP-only, so we will not see a comparable statutory impact and that is just following the normal variable annuity reserving and capital standards.\nTom Gallagher: Got you. Okay. Thanks. And then my follow-up is, can you just comment on what caused some of the weakness in Institutional Retirement this quarter? Was it spreads, underwriting, expenses? And how do you feel about earnings visibility going forward in that business?\nCaroline Feeney: Yes. So, Tom, it\u2019s Caroline. So, we actually don\u2019t see much weakness in the earnings, especially given both reported and core earnings are up this quarter compared to the prior year quarter. If I just take the institutional side of the business for a moment, it does take time to see the impact from a risk transfer transaction materialize in our earnings. So in essence, Tom, sales leads, and then obviously earnings will follow. We had $4 billion in sales this past quarter and we believe that rapidly growing demand for pension derisking in the U.S. and our International markets will continue to fuel profitable growth. We did see some less favorable underwriting this quarter as well as lower VII on the institutional side. And then on the individual side, Tom, there are two key drivers of our core earnings. First, I would point to the strong sales we\u2019re driving through our expanded portfolio, which includes our RILA or Fix Products. And this past quarter, as you heard, was especially strong, our best quarter in over a decade. The higher sales volumes across these products will also drive future profitability, but over the near-term, those profits are tempered by the higher up-front distribution costs associated with those higher sales levels. And then second, there\u2019s the impact from our decision to no longer sell traditional variable annuities with living benefit guarantees. While this business continues to generate strong fee income, it will run off at roughly $3 billion to $4 billion per quarter, offsetting some of the earnings growth from our new business. But we see this largely as a transition. Ultimately, we like the business we\u2019re putting on and those strong sales are contributing higher quality earnings. But you\u2019re still going to see an impact from the intentional runoff of our traditional variable annuity block.\nTom Gallagher: Got you. Thanks, Caroline.\nCaroline Feeney: Thanks, Tom.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from John Barnidge from Piper Sandler. Your line is now live.\nJohn Barnidge: Good morning. Appreciate the opportunity. Can you talk about growth in the group channel and how much of that\u2019s coming from at this point employee growth versus wage and then adding more coverage? Thanks.\nCaroline Feeney: Sure. John, it\u2019s Caroline. I\u2019ll take your question. So the growth in our book continues to be primarily driven by the execution of our diversification strategy, which is focused on growing in the under 5,000 lives market, as well as our focus on further diversifying in disability and supplemental health products. We\u2019re certainly benefiting from strong employment, John, which is driving overall employee and wage growth and will continue to grow organically in the block. However, when you look at what is primarily driving our growth, it is more driven by the strong underlying fundamentals and executing on our strategy. So hopefully that helps you. I would also say one more thing in terms of our strategy. We\u2019ve also made a lot of progress on diversification in our under 5,000 market, which spreads our premiums out more across the year. So we\u2019re continuing to like what we see in our diversification.\nJohn Barnidge: Thank you. My follow-up question is on the comment about building a select portfolio in International markets. I know you\u2019re focused on where you want to be. What does the opportunity set look like internationally, and is there an opportunity to accelerate that through M&A? Thank you.\nAndy Sullivan: So, John, it\u2019s Andy. I\u2019ll take the question. Yeah. And as you said, our strategy in emerging markets or in International in general is to accelerate our growth through a select set of emerging markets by extending our leadership position in Latin America, by strengthening our footprint in emerging Asia, and in particular in India and Indonesia, and by investing in market leaders in Africa. I mean, I think the important thing here is, you\u2019re already seeing very, very strong good growth in Brazil that is leading to healthy earnings growth in that block of business. Many of these other markets offer us very good opportunity, but they will take time to develop. So this is about the medium- and long-term as well. As far as M&A, we are absolutely open to opportunistic, programmatic M&A to help us accelerate our growth in those markets. But as always, organic growth is going to be job one for us. We\u2019re confident that over time, emerging markets will become a bigger part of the Prudential pie.\nJohn Barnidge: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.\nJimmy Bhullar: I had a question for Yanela or maybe for Rob just on capital deployment. Your cash flows and capital levels are obviously pretty strong, yet buybacks have been fairly modest relative to most of your peers, even as stock trades at a relatively low multiple. So I\u2019m just wondering if you could talk about your appetite for buybacks versus other uses of capital.\nYanela Frias: Hey, Jimmy. It\u2019s Yanela. So, look, we remain well capitalized. You saw PICA\u2019s RBC ratio in excess of our AA objective of 375. We are positioned to continue to invest in the growth of our businesses and you\u2019ve seen that year-to-date where we\u2019ve closed three large PRT transactions exceeding $10 billion in liabilities and we\u2019ve funded strong growth across all of our businesses. And even with that, we continue to pay dividends out of our insurance subsidiaries, and our highly liquid assets increased a bit, as you mentioned. But we will remain thoughtful in our capital deployment. We will remain focused on preserving financial strength and flexibility, investing in our businesses for long-term growth where we see a lot of opportunities and then returning capital to shareholders.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. Thanks. And if I could just ask about your views on the sales outlook for the Japanese business. Just given the high volatility in the yen, I think, that\u2019s depressing demand for some Forex products there. But how are you thinking about your trends in your business in Japan and just the sales outlook in that market?\nAndy Sullivan: Yeah. Jimmy, it\u2019s Andy. I\u2019ll take the question. Maybe let me just start by saying we\u2019re very, very pleased with the sales results that we saw. We experienced strong year-over-year growth in our life planner, independent agent and bank channels. And sales in Japan were up 10% year-over-year. That is really flowing from our work to continue to broaden and innovate our product portfolio and to enhance the customer experience in our business. The fact is, in that 10% year-over-year up, 20% of our sales this quarter flowed from more recent product introductions, including both life and annuity products, and we\u2019ve been expanding our yen offerings in addition to our U.S. dollar offerings. Obviously, we are -- we see effects from the yen strengthening and weakening. Lately here, with the strength we\u2019ve seen, we think that will be a benefit to our U.S. dollar products as it will make them more affordable for the consumer. Japanese consumers are still absolutely interested in taking advantage of the U.S. interest rates. So we\u2019re pleased with the yen movement this week, we\u2019re pleased with the work that we\u2019ve done and the results we\u2019ve shown and we expect to continue the good sales trend.\nJimmy Bhullar: And is competition in that market fairly rational, because we\u2019ve heard from some of your peers that it\u2019s a much more competitive market than it used to be a few years ago?\nAndy Sullivan: Yeah. Jimmy, I start by saying all the businesses we compete in are competitive, but I would say, yes, the marketplace is rational. At times, you may see a competitor get aggressive, but overall we see it as a rational market with a good ability for us to derive and drive profitability. And we\u2019re competitively advantaged with broad product portfolio, differentiated distribution and a good brand. So, the last thing I always reinforce is we\u2019ll be disciplined no matter what the competition does and make sure that we deliver for the customer and the shareholder.\nJimmy Bhullar: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Michael Ward from Citi. Your line is now live.\nMichael Ward: Thanks, guys. Good morning. I was wondering the -- I was wondering if you have any sense on the individualized charge. I was wondering if you have any sense of, like, how that would have looked had you not done the GUL deal. And I guess I\u2019m curious, like, if these types of reserve actions or assumption updates, does that keep you in the market for further risk transfer opportunities?\nYanela Frias: So, Mike, this is Yanela, let me take your question. So, obviously, we executed on the transaction earlier this year. We don\u2019t have a sense of what the impact would have been. So that said, in terms of further derisking transactions, we always are looking at options and opportunities to the extent they are available.\nMichael Ward: Okay. And then I noticed the disclosure for PGIM. I think part of the outflow or the reduction in AUM was that you moved a quant fund to run-off. I was wondering if you could expand on that and if that contributed to the investment performance in the quarter pressure?\nAndy Sullivan: So, it\u2019s Andy. I\u2019ll take the question. I\u2019ll take that in two parts. First, the quant manager where you\u2019re referring to is not a material part of our business. It had less than a $1 billion in assets under management and it\u2019s a subcomponent on the quantitative equity side that we\u2019re exploring strategically what we want to do with the capability. But as far as you referenced investment performance, we\u2019re actually quite pleased with our investment performance in the business. Obviously, that is job one. It\u2019s the most critical ingredient. And if you look at our short-term and long-term results, they have been very, very strong and we remain confident in our ability to continue that track. But as far as that block of business, it\u2019s small, not material to the overall business.\nMichael Ward: Okay. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. We reach the end of our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over for any further closing comments.\nCharlie Lowrey: Sure. This is Charlie. Let me make an observation, if I may, before the closing comments, and that we are experiencing very turbulent times right now, obviously, and this is exactly when clients need us the most. And we\u2019ve seen that in the past when clients turn to us during these kind of volatile times, such as the great financial crisis and others that we\u2019ve all been through. And what we\u2019ve observed is that we\u2019ve been a net beneficiary in these turbulent times, as there is a real flight to quality, which we define as having the financial strength, the strength of brand and the strength of distribution so that clients can meet us when, where and how they want. Now, obviously, past isn\u2019t prologue, but I\u2019ll make the following observation, and that is that we have exactly the capabilities that clients need in terms of investing, insurance and retirement security, and that we will be laser-focused during these times in helping them as they map through this volatility. So we\u2019ll continue to focus on our clients and we\u2019ll continue to deliver sustainable value to all our stakeholders as we go forward. So, thanks, and have an enjoyable weekend.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s teleconference webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day.

            "name": "Andy Sullivan",
            "content": "Sure. Good morning, Elyse. It's Andy. I'll take that. So our flows in PGIM have become more variable. This is mostly driven on the institutional side of the business, so let me start there. We're the sixth largest manager of defined benefit assets globally, and we have very large strategic pension clients.\\ If you look at many of these defined benefit portfolios as we sit here today are overfunded and those clients are either derisking or they're exploring PRT. So, as a result, we're seeing more than normal institutional money in motion, leading to a variability in our institutional flows. Overall, we expect that in PGIM, we'll be a beneficiary of that environment, given our world-class fixed income solutions and our leading PRT business. If you take a step back, though, and look across the year, last quarter you saw us benefit with noteworthy PRT wins and a large pension mandate inflow. This quarter, we saw fixed income outflows as a few of our clients de-risked and moved. But the important part is, when you look across the year, our institutional flows are positive year-to-date at $17 billion. On the retail side of the business, we have experienced large improvement versus last year. Year-to-date, our flows are flat, and that is a market improvement. We're starting to see flows back into our fixed income retail products with $1.1 billion in positive inflow this quarter. We believe this is poised to accelerate once clients start to move to $6 trillion that's sitting in money market assets over into longer-term active products and we expect that declining rates are going to be the trigger to that action. So the punchline overall, from a flows perspective, is we expect that we will remain a net winner over the long-term, but you should expect near-term variability. It will continue in this environment. So, John, it's Andy. I'll take the question. Yeah. And as you said, our strategy in emerging markets or in International in general is to accelerate our growth through a select set of emerging markets by extending our leadership position in Latin America, by strengthening our footprint in emerging Asia, and in particular in India and Indonesia, and by investing in market leaders in Africa. I mean, I think the important thing here is, you're already seeing very, very strong good growth in Brazil that is leading to healthy earnings growth in that block of business. Many of these other markets offer us very good opportunity, but they will take time to develop. So this is about the medium- and long-term as well. As far as M&A, we are absolutely open to opportunistic, programmatic M&A to help us accelerate our growth in those markets. But as always, organic growth is going to be job one for us. We're confident that over time, emerging markets will become a bigger part of the Prudential pie. Yeah. Jimmy, it's Andy. I'll take the question. Maybe let me just start by saying we're very, very pleased with the sales results that we saw. We experienced strong year-over-year growth in our life planner, independent agent and bank channels. And sales in Japan were up 10% year-over-year. That is really flowing from our work to continue to broaden and innovate our product portfolio and to enhance the customer experience in our business. The fact is, in that 10% year-over-year up, 20% of our sales this quarter flowed from more recent product introductions, including both life and annuity products, and we've been expanding our yen offerings in addition to our U.S. dollar offerings. Obviously, we are -- we see effects from the yen strengthening and weakening. Lately here, with the strength we've seen, we think that will be a benefit to our U.S. dollar products as it will make them more affordable for the consumer. Japanese consumers are still absolutely interested in taking advantage of the U.S. interest rates. So we're pleased with the yen movement this week, we're pleased with the work that we've done and the results we've shown and we expect to continue the good sales trend. Yeah. Jimmy, I start by saying all the businesses we compete in are competitive, but I would say, yes, the marketplace is rational. At times, you may see a competitor get aggressive, but overall we see it as a rational market with a good ability for us to derive and drive profitability. And we're competitively advantaged with broad product portfolio, differentiated distribution and a good brand. So, the last thing I always reinforce is we'll be disciplined no matter what the competition does and make sure that we deliver for the customer and the shareholder. So, it's Andy. I'll take the question. I'll take that in two parts. First, the quant manager where you're referring to is not a material part of our business. It had less than a $1 billion in assets under management and it's a subcomponent on the quantitative equity side that we're exploring strategically what we want to do with the capability. But as far as you referenced investment performance, we're actually quite pleased with our investment performance in the business. Obviously, that is job one. It's the most critical ingredient. And if you look at our short-term and long-term results, they have been very, very strong and we remain confident in our ability to continue that track. But as far as that block of business, it's small, not material to the overall business."

            "name": "Caroline Feeney",
            "content": "Yeah. So, Suneet, it's Caroline, and I'll take your question. So, right now, the annuity market continues to be extremely strong, as you referenced, with the market on pace to deliver a third straight record year, outpacing last year's run rate by over 20%. It's certainly possible that in a decreasing interest rate environment, we could see some pullback from the record sales levels, particularly in fixed annuities. From a Prudential perspective, while we've been very pleased with the growth in our fixed annuity sales, for us, it's really just a piece of the overall portfolio. We have the broadest product portfolio we've ever had, with no overconcentration in any single product. In fact, this past quarter, we had record sales in three distinct products, and two of those products are in our RILA suite of solutions, which are actually less sensitive to interest rates. And Suneet, this really reflects our very deliberate strategy, which enables us to serve the broadest set of customers across all market conditions. Frankly, we're also very excited about the broader retirement opportunity. We do see strengthening tailwinds from rapid growth in the population of Americans over age 65, and as well as increased demand for solutions that protect retirement savings and provide lifetime income. So, we believe customer demand for protected income will continue to be the driving force behind growth over the long-term and we're well positioned to meet that demand with our diverse portfolio of solutions and the strength of our brand and distribution. Finally, Suneet, you asked a question about pricing. We are also very well positioned to continue with our pricing discipline, which we have the ability to adapt pricing and enter the market with revised pricing in very short order, which enables us to be very nimble with changing markets. Sure. Elyse, it's Caroline, and I'll take your question. There's really none -- nothing that's one-off, Elyse. It was really very much core strength in the business, which was driven by a few different factors. First of all, we continue to see strong life and group disability results driven by favorable mortality and by our focus on effective claims management, which is an area we continue to invest in. We also continue to see strong double-digit growth in our supplemental health business, which is a core component of our diversification strategy. And we've also seen growth in our under-5,000 lives and our association market segments, helping us further broaden our portfolio. So, overall, Elyse, the business is growing, and it's doing so at attractive margins. In terms of your question on the benefit ratio, we delivered a very strong result coming in at 81% in line with a year-ago quarter and below our target range of 83% to 87%. Given that we have been below our target range for the first half of the year, you can expect for the year we would be towards the lower end of that target range. Yes. So, Tom, it's Caroline. So, we actually don't see much weakness in the earnings, especially given both reported and core earnings are up this quarter compared to the prior year quarter. If I just take the institutional side of the business for a moment, it does take time to see the impact from a risk transfer transaction materialize in our earnings. So in essence, Tom, sales leads, and then obviously earnings will follow. We had $4 billion in sales this past quarter and we believe that rapidly growing demand for pension derisking in the U.S. and our International markets will continue to fuel profitable growth. We did see some less favorable underwriting this quarter as well as lower VII on the institutional side. And then on the individual side, Tom, there are two key drivers of our core earnings. First, I would point to the strong sales we're driving through our expanded portfolio, which includes our RILA or Fix Products. And this past quarter, as you heard, was especially strong, our best quarter in over a decade. The higher sales volumes across these products will also drive future profitability, but over the near-term, those profits are tempered by the higher up-front distribution costs associated with those higher sales levels. And then second, there's the impact from our decision to no longer sell traditional variable annuities with living benefit guarantees. While this business continues to generate strong fee income, it will run off at roughly $3 billion to $4 billion per quarter, offsetting some of the earnings growth from our new business. But we see this largely as a transition. Ultimately, we like the business we're putting on and those strong sales are contributing higher quality earnings. But you're still going to see an impact from the intentional runoff of our traditional variable annuity block. Thanks, Tom. Sure. John, it's Caroline. I'll take your question. So the growth in our book continues to be primarily driven by the execution of our diversification strategy, which is focused on growing in the under 5,000 lives market, as well as our focus on further diversifying in disability and supplemental health products. We're certainly benefiting from strong employment, John, which is driving overall employee and wage growth and will continue to grow organically in the block. However, when you look at what is primarily driving our growth, it is more driven by the strong underlying fundamentals and executing on our strategy. So hopefully that helps you. I would also say one more thing in terms of our strategy. We've also made a lot of progress on diversification in our under 5,000 market, which spreads our premiums out more across the year. So we're continuing to like what we see in our diversification."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Rob Falzon",
            "content": "Thank you, Charlie. I'll provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for our PGIM, U.S., and International Businesses. I'll begin on Slide 6 with our financial results for the second quarter of 2024. Our pre-tax adjusted operating income was $1.6 billion or $3.39 per share on an after-tax basis, up 10% from the year-ago quarter and 12.5% on a year-to-date basis. These results reflect the execution of our strategy to grow our market-leading businesses. Higher spread in fee income was the result of continued strong sales and the benefit of higher interest rates in equity markets. Additionally, expenses were lower and include a reduction in legal reserves. Results for the current quarter also include a modest net favorable impact from our annual assumptions update and other refinements reflecting the benefit of our diversified business mix. Year-to-date adjusted operating return on equity was 13.5% and has improved nearly 1.5 percentage points from the prior year. This reflects the strength of our businesses, the benefits from the deliberate actions we've taken to pivot to more capital-efficient products, and operating efficiencies we've achieved that support growth. Turning to the operating results from our businesses compared to the year-ago quarter. PGIM, our Global Investment Manager, had higher asset management fees driven by favorable investment performance, contributions from the Deerpath Capital acquisition, and equity market appreciation. Additionally, higher incentive and transaction fees resulted in an increase in other related revenues. This was partially offset by higher expenses to support business growth. Earnings growth in our U.S. businesses reflected higher spread income driven by business growth and the benefit of higher interest rates, more favorable underwriting results, and lower expenses. In addition, a more favorable relative impact from our annual assumptions update and other refinements was driven by a more favorable Retirement Strategies update partially offset by a less favorable update in Individual Life. This was partially offset by lower legacy traditional variable annuity fee income as we intentionally pivot to less market-sensitive products. Results of our International Businesses included an unfavorable relative impact from our annual assumptions update and other refinements, less favorable underwriting results, primarily reflecting policyholder behavior, and lower spread income due to less favorable variable investment income. Results in the quarter also included higher joint venture earnings. Turning to Slide 7, PGIM, our Global Investment Manager, has diversified capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed income, equities and alternatives. PGIM's strong investment performance continues to improve with 83% of assets under management exceeding their benchmarks over the past year. This has contributed favorably to strong long-term performance with 80% and over 90% of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last five-year and 10-year periods, respectively. PGIM's assets under management increased by 5% to $1.3 trillion from the year-ago quarter driven by market appreciation, investment performance and affiliated net flows. Third-party net outflows in the quarter totaled $9.5 billion. Institutional outflows of $8.9 billion were primarily in fixed income driven by two large clients. Retail outflows of $600 million were driven by sub-advised equity strategies and mutual funds and were partially offset by positive momentum in public fixed income. PGIM third-party flows are episodic due to large single-client transactions. On a year-to-date basis, we generated $17.1 billion of inflows reflecting the net benefit from large institutional pension clients. As the investment engine of Prudential, PGIM's capabilities support the success and growth of our U.S. and International Businesses in retirement, asset management, and insurance. PGIM's asset origination capabilities, investment management expertise and access to institutional and other sources of private capital, including through the recently launched Reinsurer Prismic, are a competitive advantage, helping our businesses bring enhanced solutions and create more value for our customers. Our insurance and retirement businesses, in turn, provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated net flows, as well as unique access to insurance liabilities. In addition, our diversified PGIM Private Alternatives platform, which has assets under management of approximately $240 billion, experienced strong private credit origination activity driven by our direct lending businesses, including from our recent acquisition of Deerpath Capital. Turning to Slide 8, our U.S. businesses produce diversified earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income, and benefit from our complementary mix of longevity and mortality businesses. We continue to focus on growing our market-leading businesses by transforming our capabilities to improve customer experiences and expanding our addressable market with new financial solutions leveraging the capabilities across Prudential. Retirement Strategies generated strong sales of $7.5 billion in the second quarter across its institutional and individual lines of business. Institutional Retirement sales of $4 billion included U.S.-funded pension risk transfer transactions of $1.4 billion and longevity risk transfer sales of $1.2 billion. Year-to-date, Institutional Retirement has generated sales of $15 billion. Individual Retirement posted $3.5 billion in sales, its best quarter of sales in over a decade. Our product pivots have resulted in continued strong sales of FlexGuard and FlexCard Income and fixed annuity sales have doubled from the prior year. Additionally, we continue to reduce market sensitivity by running off our legacy variable annuities. Group Insurance sales primarily occur in the first quarter of the year based on annual enrollments. On a year-to-date basis, sales increased 13% compared to the prior year, driven by growth in life, disability and supplemental health. We are executing our strategy of both product and client segmentation diversification while leveraging technology to increase operating efficiency and enhance customer experience. These actions to improve profitability and performance resulted in a favorable benefit ratio of 81.1%. In Individual Life, sales increased 3% from the year-ago quarter and 7% year-to-date. These increases include the benefit from our FlexGuard Life product, which reached its highest sales quarter since its launch in 2022, and from our pivot towards more capital-efficient products. Turning to Slide 9, our International Businesses include our Japanese life insurance companies, where we have a differentiated multi-channel distribution model, as well as other businesses aimed at expanding our presence in targeted high-growth emerging markets. In Japan, we are focused on providing high-quality service and expanding our distribution and product offerings. Our needs-based approach and protection of retirement product focus continue to provide important value to our customers as we expand our product offerings to meet their evolving needs. In emerging markets, we are focused on creating a selective portfolio of businesses and regions where customers' needs are growing, where there are compelling opportunities to build market-leading businesses, and where the financial enterprise can add value. Sales in our International Businesses were up 11% compared to the year-ago quarter. Higher sales in Japan are benefiting from recent product launches as we expand our retirement and savings offerings. These new products are gaining traction with customers and represented 20% of the current quarter sales. In addition, emerging market sales were higher, driven by growth in Brazil, as we continue to expand third-party distribution and benefit from the strong performance of our world-class life planners. As we look ahead, we are well-positioned across our businesses to be a global leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security. We continue to focus on investing in growth businesses and markets, delivering industry-leading customer experiences and creating the next generation of financial solutions to serve the diverse needs of a broad range of customers. And with that, I'll now hand it over to Yanela. Good morning, Ryan. It's Rob. Yeah. We and our Prismic investors share aspirations to grow well beyond the initial $10 billion transaction that we completed relatively recently. We continue to work on a very active pipeline of multiple insurance transactions. That pipeline includes ongoing balance sheet optimization, flow or new sales solutions across our businesses, as well as third-party blocks where we have a particular focus on Japan. I would be -- we would be disappointed if we've not entered into an additional transaction before year end. So, Suneet, so it would actually be the second deal. So, the first transaction we closed was about $10 billion in reserves and so relatively significant in size. For the next transaction, I would -- what I would say is that, the nature of underlying liabilities is what impacts the sizing of the transaction and that's going to be dependent upon sort of market sensitivity, hedging and collateral needs. So, we're not constraining it simply because of appetite or access to capital or other capabilities. It would really just be a function of making sure that as we're constructing the Prismic portfolio, it all fits together well. Well, I would say, we -- the continued balance sheet optimization is probably our highest priority, Suneet, and incidentally, the most controllable of the things that we're working on. But both flow and third-party are high priorities for us, and they are being actively worked as well. Okay. It's Rob. I'll take that question. I would say that if we look at the industry from an overall basis, our real estate investment group has a forecast that there will be actually continued valuation declines through the remainder of the year across the industry. Those valuation declines, though, will be in the low-single digits. So while we think we're close to an inflection point where that could begin to turn around, we're not quite sure we're at the trough of that yet."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Yanela Frias",
            "content": "Thank you, Rob. I will begin on Slide 10, which provides insight into earnings for the third quarter of 2024 relative to our second quarter results. Pre-tax adjusted operating income for the second quarter was $1.6 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $3.39 on an after-tax basis. To get a sense of how our third quarter results might develop, we suggest adjustments for the following items. First, our annual assumption update and other refinements resulted in a net benefit of $6 million in the second quarter. Second, variable investment income was below expectations by $90 million in the second quarter, driven by lower real estate returns. Next, underwriting experience was below expectations by $10 million in the second quarter and we expect $30 million of favorable seasonality in the third quarter. And last, we include an adjustment of $95 million for expenses and other items. Expenses in the second quarter were lower than expected, reflecting a reduction in legal reserves and the timing of expenses. As a result, we have lowered the full year 2024 expected loss in corporate and other to $1.8 billion. In the third quarter, we expect higher investments in our initiatives to support growth as originally planned. These adjustments combined get us to a baseline of $3.48 per share for third quarter. I will note that if you exclude items specific to the third quarter, earnings per share would be $3.56. The key takeaway is that our underlying earnings power increased and reflects our continued investment in the growth of our market-leading businesses and our pivot away from more capital intensive and lower growth businesses. While we have provided these items to consider, please note that there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the third quarter. Turning to Slide 11, our capital position continues to support our AA financial strength rating. Our regulatory capital ratios are in excess of our AA objectives. Our cash and liquid assets were $4.4 billion, within our liquidity target range of $3 billion to $5 billion and we have substantial off-balance sheet resources. We remain thoughtful in our capital deployment, preserving financial strength and flexibility, investing in our businesses for long-term growth, and returning capital to shareholders. Turning to Slide 12, and in summary, we are growing our market-leading businesses, we are maintaining a disciplined approach to capital deployment and our growth is supported by the strength of our balance sheet. And with that, we will be happy to take your questions. Hi, Ryan. It's Yanela. Yes. With regards to rates, short-term rates, we do not expect much of an impact due to changes in short-term rates. We have cash at the holding company and collateral in individual Retirement Strategies that earned short-term yields. And this is generally offset by interest rate derivatives where we pay short-term rates and receive fixed, and we use these to manage duration across our businesses. So generally, these are offsetting. Let me also address long-term rates since we've seen some recent movement. With respect to long-term rates, we have benefited from the rise in rates over the past few years. We have been at levels that are significantly higher than over the past decade and this has increased our portfolio yields in both domestic and international. So higher rates are good for us and it has been a tailwind. If rates were to decline, it would reduce our new money rates, but we do have a healthy spread between our new money rates and portfolio yields. And lastly, I would point out that we have a very disciplined ALM approach which significantly reduces future spread volatility of the enforced. Hi, Wes. This is Yanela. So, let me take your question. I mean, to take it a step up, the annual assumption update this quarter had a modest benefit to adjusted operating income, as you saw, and this is a result of our multiline business mix that generally creates risk diversification and tends to moderate the annual assumption update impact. So the net modest benefit was due to favorable mortality updates for the Institutional Retirement Strategies, partially offset by unfavorable policyholder behavior updates for both Individual Life and Japan. And to your question about what drove the large impact to Individual Life, the negative impact to Individual Life was primarily due to lower guaranteed universal life surrender experience post-COVID as individuals retain their life-insuring policies at higher levels than previously assumed. And this was based on our examination of updated emerging experience data of our business and information available from a number of industry studies. So that is what drove the assumption update, and we do have a small ongoing impact from the assumption update as well. So there's an ongoing operating income perspective. From a statutory perspective, the assumption update there, we have a process from a process standpoint that is done at the end of the year. So that will be reflected in our statutory results at the end of the year. Having said that, any impacts are not expected to be meaningful to our assessment of capital availability, cash flows or our capital deployment plans. Yes, Tom. It's Yanela. So, yes, the non-AOI impact was mainly due to RILA, and it was really driven by a methodology update to the annuity valuation, and this is really to be consistent with industry standard and also more consistent with how we actually manage the product. So it's a valuation methodology change. It is GAAP-only, so we will not see a comparable statutory impact and that is just following the normal variable annuity reserving and capital standards. Hey, Jimmy. It's Yanela. So, look, we remain well capitalized. You saw PICA's RBC ratio in excess of our AA objective of 375. We are positioned to continue to invest in the growth of our businesses and you've seen that year-to-date where we've closed three large PRT transactions exceeding $10 billion in liabilities and we've funded strong growth across all of our businesses. And even with that, we continue to pay dividends out of our insurance subsidiaries, and our highly liquid assets increased a bit, as you mentioned. But we will remain thoughtful in our capital deployment. We will remain focused on preserving financial strength and flexibility, investing in our businesses for long-term growth where we see a lot of opportunities and then returning capital to shareholders. So, Mike, this is Yanela, let me take your question. So, obviously, we executed on the transaction earlier this year. We don't have a sense of what the impact would have been. So that said, in terms of further derisking transactions, we always are looking at options and opportunities to the extent they are available."

            "name": "Charlie Lowrey",
            "content": "Thank you, Bob, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. During the second quarter, we continued to grow our market-leading businesses and become more capital efficient to deliver greater long-term value for our stakeholders. Our momentum was driven by robust sales in our U.S. and International Businesses, as well as strong investment performance and originations across PGIM's Private Alternatives platform. We maintained our disciplined approach to capital deployment by investing in the growth of our businesses and returning excess capital to shareholders. This progress was supported by our strong financial position. Turning to Slide 3, I will focus my remarks this morning on the strategic actions we are taking to expand access to investing, insurance and retirement security, and how they position us to address the evolving financial challenges of our customers around the world. One of our most compelling growth opportunities is addressing the increasing global demand for retirement products, solutions, and advice. This year, historic levels of Americans will turn 65. At the same time, 55-year-olds will enter the crucial decade before retirement in preparation for life after work. These aging demographics will result in an estimated $137 trillion retirement opportunity in the U.S. and $26 trillion in Japan by 2050. As a leader in pension risk transfer and individual annuities, Retirement Strategies is delivering products and solutions that protect the life's work of our customers and ensure a more financially secure retirement for people around the world. Our market leadership is demonstrated by nearly $22 billion in Retirement Strategies sales in the first half of this year, representing a 67% increase from the prior year. This includes robust sales in pension risk and longevity risk transfer, as well as nearly doubling our individual annuity sales. Since the launch of our FlexGuard Indexed Variable Annuity product suite in 2020, our sales have exceeded $21 billion. Meanwhile, in Japan, our customers are benefiting from an expanded product suite demonstrated by a 20% increase in retirement and savings product sales year-over-year. PGIM, our global asset management business, is well-positioned to address the increasing demand for retirement solutions around the world, while capitalizing on growing institutional demand for private credit and alternative investments. PGIM provides investment solutions that help retirement plan sponsors deliver benefits to millions of beneficiaries. With nearly $0.5 trillion of assets under management supporting defined benefit and defined contribution plans, PGIM is a market leader, servicing more than half of the world's 300 largest pension funds, including over two-thirds of the largest 100 U.S. pension plans, and is the largest pension fund manager in Japan. PGIM also continues to grow its Private Alternatives business with capital deployment of nearly $11 billion in the second quarter, a 35% increase compared to a year-ago quarter. This includes the benefit of our recent acquisition of Deerpath Capital. Moving now to our market-leading insurance businesses, we have expanded our product suite and distribution channels to meet the growing demand for products and solutions that can help bridge the global life insurance gap. In our U.S. Insurance businesses, strong sales continue to benefit from expanded distribution and product diversification. This has resulted in a shift to a more capital-efficient product mix. Year-to-date, Group Insurance sales are up 13% and Individual Life sales are up 7% compared to the first half of 2023. In Brazil, we continue to expand our third-party distribution and benefit from the high quality of our life planners. This has resulted in a 27% increase in year-to-date sales. Across each of our businesses, our strategy is underpinned by the continued investment in capabilities and initiatives that translate into future earnings growth. This includes expanding our products and distribution and using artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other technology to deliver exceptional sales, service, and claims experiences. Turning to Slide 4, our disciplined approach to capital deployment supported investments in our businesses while returning over $700 million to shareholders during the quarter. Turning to Slide 5, our financial strength, diversified business mix, and risk and capital management framework supports our growth strategy. Our AA rating reflects our healthy capital position, including more than $4 billion in highly liquid assets at the end of the second quarter, a high-quality, well-diversified investment portfolio, and a disciplined approach to asset liability management. We are confident that our financial strength, our business strategy and the evolving opportunities to support our customers around the world put us in a strong position to deliver long-term value to our shareholders. With that, I will turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our individual business performance. Sure. This is Charlie. Let me make an observation, if I may, before the closing comments, and that we are experiencing very turbulent times right now, obviously, and this is exactly when clients need us the most. And we've seen that in the past when clients turn to us during these kind of volatile times, such as the great financial crisis and others that we've all been through. And what we've observed is that we've been a net beneficiary in these turbulent times, as there is a real flight to quality, which we define as having the financial strength, the strength of brand and the strength of distribution so that clients can meet us when, where and how they want. Now, obviously, past isn't prologue, but I'll make the following observation, and that is that we have exactly the capabilities that clients need in terms of investing, insurance and retirement security, and that we will be laser-focused during these times in helping them as they map through this volatility. So we'll continue to focus on our clients and we'll continue to deliver sustainable value to all our stakeholders as we go forward. So, thanks, and have an enjoyable weekend."

Representing Prudential on today's call are Charlie Lowrey, Chairman and CEO; Rob Falzon, Vice Chairman; Andy Sullivan, Head of International Businesses and PGIM, our global investment manager; Caroline Feeney, Head of U.S. Businesses; Yanela Frias, Chief Financial Officer; and Rob Axel, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer. \n We will start with prepared comments by Charlie, Rob and Yanela, and then we will take your questions. \n Today's discussion may include forward-looking statements. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions we make today. In addition, our presentation includes references to non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of such measures to the comparable GAAP measures and a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, please see the slides titled Forward-Looking Statements and non-GAAP Measures in the appendix to today's presentation and the quarterly financial supplement, both of which can be found on our website at investor.prudential.com. \n And now I'll turn it over to Charlie. \nCharles Lowrey: Thank you, Bob, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our results for the quarter reflect accelerating momentum across all our businesses, including significant positive net flows in PGIM, our global asset manager and strong sales in our U.S. and International Insurance businesses. \n During the quarter, we made substantial progress in shifting our business mix and growing our market-leading businesses to become a higher growth, more capital efficient and nimble company. We also maintained our disciplined approach to capital management by making further investments in our businesses and returning additional capital to shareholders. Our rock-solid balance sheet, business mix and distinct strategy position us to deliver long-term growth for our stakeholders. \n Turning to Slide 3. I'll now begin this morning with a few recent examples that demonstrate how we are growing our market-leading businesses. PGIM achieved robust third-party and affiliated net flows in the quarter, notably in our fixed-income business, underpinned by continued strong investment performance. These flows reinforce the benefits of our large and strategic global client relationships and the power of our mutually reinforcing business system to grow our asset management fees. \n Our Institutional Retirement Strategies business reported strong sales and record account values, including the benefits of 2 large pension risk transfer transactions in the quarter. As a result, we delivered a record first quarter of PRT sales. Meanwhile, our Individual Retirement Strategies business recorded its best sales quarter in more than a decade. This reflects the continued diversification and expansion of our product offerings as well as strong demand in the market. \n Strong growth in our group insurance elected our product and segment diversification strategy leading to increased sales across life, disability and supplemental health. Meanwhile, our individual life insurance business continues to shift towards more capital-efficient products and broaden solutions through newer offerings like FlexGuard Life, which had its highest sales quarter since launching in 2022. \n Internationally, we continue to benefit from our broadening product portfolio in Japan and from our actions to expand our distribution to new customers in emerging markets. Prudential in Brazil saw strong momentum across all distribution channels, most notably in our Life Planner channel, which reported record sales for the quarter. \n We achieved these milestones while continuing to pivot away from more capital-intensive and lower-growth businesses. We successfully closed a reinsurance transaction for a portion of our guaranteed universal life block further advancing our strategy to reduce market sensitivity and increase capital efficiency. We also announced an agreement to sell Prudential of Argentina, a move aligned with our strategy of focusing on fewer high-growth emerging markets where we have an opportunity to achieve scale. \n And finally, we initiated the process to exit our Assurance business so that we can focus our efforts and resources on core businesses and capabilities. We also continue to strengthen our operating model through technology and strategic partnerships to generate efficiencies that can be reinvested to fuel growth and deliver exceptional sales, service and claims experiences. This ongoing focus on improving the ways we work and supporting our customers continues to be recognized outside the company. \n As just one example, Prudential of Japan recently ranked #1 for life insurance service in a J.D. Power customer satisfaction survey for the ninth year in a row. We are proud to be recognized for the value we provide to our customers. \n Turning now to Slide 4. Our disciplined approach to capital deployment enables us to invest in our market-leading businesses to support long-term growth and return capital to shareholders. In the first quarter, we returned over $700 million to shareholders and increased the quarterly dividend by 4%, our 16th consecutive annual dividend increase. We will continue to focus on creating sustainable, profitable growth that will benefit all stakeholders. \n Moving to Slide 5. Our growth strategy is supported by Prudential's rock-solid balance sheet and robust risk and capital management framework. Our AA-rated financial strength represents a strong capital position, including approximately $48 billion of unrealized insurance margins over $4 billion in highly liquid assets at the end of the first quarter, a high-quality, well-diversified investment portfolio and a disciplined approach to asset liability management. \n We've entered the second quarter with confidence in our strategy to be a global leader in expanding access to investing insurance and retirement security for people around the world. \n And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob to provide more details on our first quarter business performance. \nRobert Falzon: Thanks, Charlie. I will provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for our PGIM U.S. and international businesses I'll begin on Slide 6 with our financial results for the first quarter of 2024. \n Our pretax adjusted operating income was $1.5 billion or $3.12 per share on an after-tax basis, up 16% from the year-ago quarter. These results reflect the continued execution of our strategy to grow our market-leading businesses. Strong sales and robust net inflows and the benefit of higher interest rates and equity markets have resulted in higher spread income, fee income and underwriting results. \n These diversified sources of earnings were partially offset by higher expenses to support business growth and onetime costs of closing the Guaranteed Universal Life reinsurance transaction. \n Turning to the operating results from our businesses compared to the year-ago quarter. PGIM, our global investment manager had higher asset management fees driven by equity market appreciation, positive third-party net inflows and contributions from the Deerpath Capital acquisition. Additionally, higher incentive fees and seed and co-investment income resulted in an increase in other related revenues. This was partially offset by higher expenses to support business growth. \n Earnings growth in our U.S. businesses reflected higher spread income driven by business growth and the benefit of higher interest rates and variable investment income as well as more favorable underwriting results. This was partially offset by higher expenses, including the onetime charges associated with the closing of the Guaranteed Universal Life reinsurance transaction and by lower legacy traditional variable annuity fee income as we intentionally continue our pivot to less market-sensitive products. \n Earnings growth in our International businesses was primarily driven by higher spread income, including the benefit of higher interest rates and more favorable variable investment income and higher joint venture earnings due to the favorable encaje performance in Chile. This was partially offset by less favorable underwriting results, primarily reflecting policyholder behavior. \n Turning to Slide 7. PGIM, our global investment manager, has diversified capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed income, equities and alternatives. PGIM's strong investment performance continues to improve with 80% of assets under management exceeding their benchmarks over the past year. This has contributed favorably to attractive long-term performance with over 80% of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last 5- and 10-year periods. \n PGIM's assets under management increased by 6% to $1.3 trillion from the year-ago quarter, driven by market appreciation and positive third-party net flows. Robust third-party net inflows in the quarter totaled $26.6 billion. Institutional inflows of $26 billion included a large fixed-income client mandate. And retail flows also turned positive, reflecting building momentum in public fixed income. \n Additionally, strong affiliated flows were driven by retirement strategy sales during the quarter as the investment engine of Prudential, the success and growth of PGIM and of our U.S. and International insurance and retirement businesses are mutually reinforcing. PGIM's asset origination capabilities, investment management expertise and access to institutional and other sources of private capital, including through the recently launched reinsurer Prismic, our competitive advantage helping our businesses bring enhanced solutions and create more value for our customers. \n Our insurance and retirement businesses, in turn, provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated net flows as well as unique access to insurance liabilities. In addition, our diversified PGIM private alternatives platform, which has assets under management of approximately $240 billion experienced strong private credit activity driven by our organic growth and the first full quarter benefit from acquiring Deerpath Capital. \n Turning to Slide 8. Our U.S. businesses produced diversified earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income and benefit from our complementary mix of longevity and mortality businesses. We continue to focus on growing our market-leading businesses by transforming our capabilities to improve customer experiences and expanding our addressable market with new financial solutions leveraging the capabilities across Prudential. \n Retirement strategies generated strong sales of $14.3 billion in the first quarter across its institutional and individual lines of business. Institutional Retirement sales of $11 billion in the first quarter included 2 large U.S. funded pension risk transfer transactions of nearly $9 billion, driving the strongest first quarter in market history. \n We have now completed 6 of the 10 largest transactions on record. Individual Retirement posted $3.3 billion in sales, our best quarter in sales in over a decade. Our product pivots have resulted in continued strong sales of FlexGuard and FlexCard Income, which increased nearly 60% from the year-ago quarter and fixed annuity sales have nearly tripled, while we continue to reduce market sensitivity by running off our legacy variable annuities. \n Group Insurance sales increased 18% compared to the prior year, driven by growth in life, disability and supplemental health. We are executing our strategy of both product and client segment diversification while leveraging technology to increase operating efficiency and enhance the customer experience. \n In Individual Life, we continue to execute our strategic pivot to more capital-efficient products with the closing of the guaranteed Universal Life reinsurance transaction. Total sales in Individual Life increased 12% from the year-ago quarter, including the benefit from the recently launched FlexGuard Life product. Variable Life products represented approximately 70% of sales for the quarter. \n Turning to Slide 9. Our International businesses include our Japanese life insurance companies, where we have a differentiated multichannel distribution model as well as other businesses aimed at expanding our presence in targeted high-growth emerging markets. \n In Japan, we're focused on providing high-quality service and expanding our distribution and product offerings. Our needs-based approach and protection product focus continue to provide important value to our customers as we expand our product offerings to meet their evolving needs. In emerging markets, we're focused on creating a selective portfolio of businesses in regions where customer needs are growing, where there are compelling opportunities to build market-leading businesses and where the Prudential enterprise can add value. \n Sales in our International businesses were up 5% compared to the year-ago quarter. Higher sales in Japan are benefiting from the recent product launches, including a new yen-denominated variable life product offered through our Life Consultant and independent agency channels beginning in the first quarter. In addition, emerging market sales were higher, driven by growth in Brazil as we continue to expand third-party distribution and benefit from the strong performance of our world-class life planners. \n As we look ahead, we are well-positioned across our businesses to be a global leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security. We continue to focus on investing in growth businesses and markets, delivering industry-leading customer experiences and creating the next generation of financial solutions to serve the diverse needs of a broad range of customers. \n And with that, I'll now hand it over to Yanela. \nYanela del Frias: Thank you, Rob. I will begin on Slide 10, which provides insight into earnings for the second quarter of 2024 relative to our first-quarter results. As noted, pretax adjusted operating income for the first quarter was $1.5 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $3.12 on an after-tax basis. \n To get a sense of how our second quarter results might develop, we suggest adjustments for the following items: Underwriting experience was below expectations by $85 million in the first quarter, and we expect $10 million of favorable seasonality in the second quarter. We also included an adjustment of $50 million for expenses and other items. This includes adjustments for typical seasonality of expenses and premiums as well as the onetime expenses related to our guaranteed universal life reinsurance transaction. \n These adjustments combined get us to a baseline of $3.43 per share for the second quarter. I will note that if you exclude items specific to the second quarter, earnings per share would be $3.50. The key takeaway is that we continue to drive underlying earnings power momentum as we invest in the growth of our market-leading businesses and pivot away from capital-intensive and lower-growth businesses. \n While we have provided these items to consider, please note that there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the second quarter. \n Turning to Slide 11. Our capital position continues to support our AA financial strength rating. Our regulatory capital ratios are in excess of our AA objectives. Our cash and liquid assets were $4.2 billion within our liquidity target range of $3 billion to $5 billion, and we have substantial off-balance sheet resources. We remain thoughtful in our capital deployment, investing in our businesses for long-term growth and returning capital to shareholders. \n Turning to Slide 12. And in summary, we are becoming a higher growth, more capital efficient and nimble company. We are maintaining a disciplined approach to capital deployment and our growth is supported by our rock-solid balance sheet. \n And with that, we will be happy to take your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Ryan Krueger from KBW. \nRyan Krueger: My first question was on Prismic. Can you talk about the outlook for reinsuring in-force blocks, additional in-force blocks to Prismic and do you expect more activity on this in 2024? \nRobert Falzon: Ryan, it's Rob. I'll take your question. As we've shared before, we and our Prismic investors who are a group of very large global institutional investors that operate and scale have aspirations that go well beyond the initial $10 billion transaction that we completed last year. We're continuing work on an active pipeline. That pipeline includes ongoing balance sheet optimization. It includes flow or new sales that are solutions across our businesses and working on third-party blocks where we believe we can provide our reinsurance and asset management capabilities to other insurers. \n To maybe state the obvious, these transactions are complex. They're bespoke to each situation and they require regulatory coordination and all of that takes time. Our decision to use Prismic for this pipeline has contrasted to the opportunity to also use our own balance sheet or to partner or reinsure with other third parties is unique to each of the opportunities. And it's driven by looking through a lens of commercial priorities, statutory considerations, GAAP outcomes and economic considerations. \n And that includes implications to earnings ROE, capital and liquidity. If I could step back and sort of more broadly, address it. We see extraordinarily interesting growth opportunities at the intersection of what we're calling the intersection of asset management and insurance. Private institutional capital is coming into the insurance space, insurance and retirement sector. It helps to finance the growth and to meet customer needs -- customer and client needs.  \n And in addition, the investment options that are available to the industry are expanding, and they're providing opportunities to grow investment capabilities while enhancing portfolio diversification and generating greater output from our portfolio as well. We're excited about what this implies for our ability to create avenues of growth across our insurance, retirement and asset management businesses. And we believe that our brand, scale, and the quality across our businesses gives us a highly competitive platform to execute against the opportunity and Prismic is an important expansion of that platform. \nRyan Krueger: Great. And then separately on -- I had a question on G&A expenses. I think they were up around 7% year-over-year on a consolidated basis. And previously, you had talked about taking expense actions that could keep G&A relatively flat in the near term. So I was hoping for an update on that. \nYanela del Frias: Ryan, this is Yanela. And I will take your question. We are committed to keeping expenses flat while investing in our businesses. And as you noted, we did see an increase in G&A this quarter, but keep in mind that G&A includes expenses to support growth, including nondeferrable sales expenses in support of our very strong sales this quarter as well as onetime expenses like the cost-related to the GUL transaction.  \n So that's what you're seeing in terms of the increase. With regards to the strong sales, especially in retirement strategies, please note that the incremental earnings from those sales are not all fully reflected in the quarter. And there's 2 reasons, the timing of those sales as well as the fact that we leg into the final asset portfolio supporting the PRT sales over a period of time. So as a result, we expect that the full incremental earnings benefit to emerge in subsequent quarters. And Caroline, I don't know if you wanted to spend a minute on retirement strategies, fundamentals. \nCaroline Feeney-Pfundstein: Yes, sure. Of course, Yanela, thanks. And Ryan, clearly, Yanela just went through some of the earnings drivers. So now let me share with you how we're thinking about the fundamentals in our growth story. So overall, we're very pleased with the strong sales growth across our Retirement Strategies business. with over $14 billion in sales this past quarter.  \n In Institutional, we achieved $11 billion in sales led by nearly $9 billion of pension risk transfer, not only our best first quarter, Ryan, but also the best first quarter in market history, further demonstrating our leadership in the market. And then on the individual side, we had our best quarter in over a decade with almost $3.5 billion in sales nearly doubling our volume from the year-ago quarter. And that success comes from our work over the past few years to diversify our annuity portfolio and broaden our distribution which allows us to meet more of the consumer needs for protected savings and for income than ever before.  \n And as Yanela mentioned, these strong sales will continue to increase core earnings over time as we realize the full impact of these sales. \nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Tom Gallagher from Evercore ISI. \nThomas Gallagher: First question is just on the I think, what was a jumbo PGIM inflow that you got from a single client this quarter? I think that might have been $25 billion or $26 billion. And if that's not right, can you please sort of clarify what that amount was? And then what was the mandate in? Was that public fixed income? And any kind of sense for what kind of fee rate you would have had on that? \nAndrew Sullivan: Tom, it's Andy. So this mandate was a significant portion of the $26 billion that we saw in institutional positive net flows. Obviously, we don't disclose fee rate on individual mandates. That said, this is a large mandate from a key pension client for a high-quality fixed-income portfolio. \n So the fee rate is lower than our overall average fee rate across our asset classes. We were very pleased with our flows overall this quarter, and we're obviously very proud that we have so many large clients that place their trust in us. \nThomas Gallagher: And Andy, just as a follow-up, any -- how does the pipeline look? Any other sizable large mandates you think might get funded this year? \nAndrew Sullivan: Yes. So maybe, Tom, let me just bring it up and I'll end with the outcome. So overall, on the institutional side, we're obviously very pleased given that large mandate, we feel that reinforces our position as a leading partner in the marketplace. And I'd also add that we've been consistently adding new clients to our roster on the institutional side every quarter, every year.  \n On the retail side, we saw positive flows of about $0.5 billion. We're beginning to see early momentum in the retail fixed-income space, consistent with industry trends and improving client sentiment. I would reiterate what Rob said at the top of the script as well that we had significant positive affiliated flows this quarter driven by pension risk transfer, showing the strength and importance of the synergies in the business system.  \n As far as specific to your question, the outlook looking forward, we like the fundamentals that we're seeing as the environment is clearly improving, and our investment performance is very, very strong. But we also know that a sticky inflationary environment will keep money on the sidelines a little while longer and that our large client flows can remain episodic. But the key punchline is, over time, we are very confident that will be a net winner and a net grower. \nThomas Gallagher: Great. Rob, just if I could slip one more in about a follow-up to what Ryan asked about Prismic. Have you guys done any additional fundraising beyond the first $1 billion for Prismic? And if you haven't, any thoughts on how much you would be looking to raise in a potential next fundraising? \nRobert Axel: Yes, Tom, the investors that we have in Prismic and our conversations with them have indicated their desire to put a significant amount of capital to work and the strategy that we've outlined to them. And so expectations are that these are firms that deal on the billions, not the millions or hundreds of millions.  \n And they've indicated that their desire is to scale the initial investment that they've made, which is, frankly, small by their standards and would be uneconomic if it were not for their anticipation that it was going to be followed by investments that would be multiples of what they've contributed upfront. That having been said, this is not a fund. It is a collaborative of investors that have committed to working with us in this strategy and they will fund as we develop and execute against pipeline. \nOperator: Next question today is coming from Joel Hurwitz from Dowling & Partners. \nJoel Hurwitz: So I want to go back to the individual retirement sales. So a very strong quarter, including sizable growth in fixed annuity sales. Can you just talk about the pivot to fixed annuities? And I guess, what's your plan to grow in this product line? \nCaroline Feeney-Pfundstein: Yes. Of course, Joel. It's Caroline, and I'll take your question. So first of all, the individual annuities market had a record year last year with about $380 billion of sales, and fixed annuities were a key piece of that given the rapid rises that we did see in interest rates. We're seeing continued momentum for fixed annuities this year as the value proposition remains strong, driving industry sales of over $100 billion in the first quarter, putting the industry on track for another record year.  \n In terms of our own growth, Joel, fixed annuities, represented almost half of our sales last quarter mirroring the broader market shift we've seen over the past few years -- past year, excuse me, our sales growth is a testament to 3 things: first, our successful expansion of our product portfolio to include more fixed annuity solutions such as our Westgard, MIGA allowing us to meet more customer needs across a broader set of channels.  \n Second, our brand and our distribution strength, which enables us to scale quickly to meet increasing market demand. We continue to expand our partnerships across multiple channels and platforms which also had a significant impact on our business this past quarter. And finally, our dynamic and proactive pricing process, which allows us to react quickly to changing market conditions, to maintain competitive pricing while maximizing shareholder value. So overall, Joe, we're pleased with our ability to meet the increased demand while maintaining favorable returns.  \n We like the diversification, these products bring to our business mix and the role they can play as a strong complement to our FlexGuard suite of solutions. \nJoel Hurwitz: Okay. So it sounds like this will be a core product in your line of filing forward then? \nCaroline Feeney-Pfundstein: Absolutely, Joe. Yes, we see it as a core product as we broaden our portfolio. \nJoel Hurwitz: Okay. And then just moving over to pension risk transfer. Just any update on your outlook and Obviously, a very strong start to the year, I guess, how should we think about your desire to grow this business year-on-year out? \nCaroline Feeney-Pfundstein: Yes. So as you said, Joel, and rightly so, we had a very strong start here. We finished actually the strongest first quarter ever in PRT, leading the market, including 2 transactions with Shell and Verizon totaling nearly $9 billion. In terms of our outlook on growth, last year's market volume was roughly $45 billion, and we expect to see that healthy pipeline continue this year supported by favorable funding positions of over 100%.  \n And although the market is highly competitive, very few carriers have actually executed transactions exceeding $1 billion. And I should call out that our expertise and our ability to handle large complex transactions along with our financial strength, position us to continue to be a leader in the space. \nJoel Hurwitz: Okay. I guess, just how do you balance the capital strain from growing that business? Just how should we think about your appetite for overall growth this year after doing $9 billion in Q1. \nCaroline Feeney-Pfundstein: Yes. So I'd say, in general, Joel, obviously, each large transaction naturally consumes its appropriate share of capital. We believe these deals are a very effective way of deploying capital. and we like the returns that we're generating.  \n First, PRT remains a great source for organic growth. It represents one of the few products that can allow us to originate billions of insurance liabilities in a single transaction. And as a market leader in the space, we continue to see, as I mentioned, a strong pipeline of those large-sized opportunities.  \n I'll also add that the success of our PRT business benefits PGIM as we continue to originate these deals PGIM can match our insurance liabilities with a high-quality portfolio of assets. So with all that being said, Joel, we do expect to continue to opportunistically deploy capital in the space and we feel good about the returns as well as the benefits PRT brings to Prudential. \nOperator: Your next question today is coming from Wes Carmichael from Autonomous. \nWesley Carmichael: Rob, on your answer on Prismic, you mentioned the transactions require regulatory coordination is one of the considerations here. I'm just wondering if you can give us an update on the regulatory environment in Bermuda and how that's changed, if at all, over the past year if the CMA is more involved in improving potential deals or influencing the structure of transactions. \nRobert Axel: Yes, Wes, happy to do so. We've actually been highly engaged with the BMA throughout the consultation process that it recently went through and provided feedback on the proposed enhancements to their regime directly with the BMA as well as in coordination with the broader industry.  \n I think what I would characterize is that while the BMA's updates to regulatory regime are generally going to result in a more conservative level of capital required and reserving than what they had prior to their consultation process. That's going to vary significantly by product type. And the BMA is committed to continuing to maintain a principles-based economically driven regime.  \n And we believe that the combination of that approach to managing insurance assets and liabilities along with its status with reciprocal jurisdiction in the U.S. and equivalency in Europe is going to continue to make it a very attractive jurisdiction to do business for insurers. \nWesley Carmichael: And maybe just a quick follow-up on that. But do you think PRT is a good liability for Prismic? Does that make sense there? \nRobert Falzon: PRT can be done economically, both within the U.S. statutory regime and within the Bermuda statutory regime. We've advanced, adopted a set of principles that are under consideration for pension risk transfer type liabilities in coordination with our New Jersey supervisor.  \n And so our ability or desire to use Bermuda versus the U.S. statutory regime is less driven by differences in the regimes per se and more driven by the source of investors coming into it. So obviously, for our own balance sheet, operating within the U.S. statutory regime works well for us. But to the extent we want to bring third-party capital into that capital has a desire for a number of reasons.  \n Those institutions providing that capital to come into jurisdictions like Barbuda, and that would be more of the primary driver as to why we would be funding some of PRT through our Bermuda framework as contrasted to a U.S. framework. \nWesley Carmichael: That's really helpful. And then maybe just one more on the regulatory front. But can you give us just an update on the transition to ESR in Japan, we're getting closer to the implementation date here. So has there been any movement, particularly on how long-duration FX products are treated or anything else? Any other color might be helpful. \nYanela del Frias: This is Yanela. Let me give you an update on where we are with ESR. On ESR, we believe our Japan businesses are well capitalized and financially strong, and that would be evident under any reasonable capital standard. We have been working with regulators and advocating for reasonable and responsible standards. And we have strategies to adapt to the potential new regime and to better match the economics of our business.  \n And these strategies include reinsurance business internally in the U.S. or Bermuda or reassuring externally. And as an example of these strategies, during the first quarter, we reinsured $3 billion of U.S. dollar-denominated whole life products from Japan to our Bermuda affiliate, Gibraltar, which allows us to manage capital for that block on a more economic basis.  \n So we're looking at this very carefully. The proposed regulations are still subject to change. but are expected to be finalized later this quarter ahead of being effective on April 1, 2025. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question today is coming from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. \nElyse Greenspan: My first question, I guess, is on the M&A side, right? Can you just give us an update on the pipeline and things that you're looking at? And given the action to exit Assurance IQ, how is that going to impact future M&A decisions? \nCharles Lowrey: Sure, Elyse. This is Charlie. Thanks for the question. We've executed on many transactions over time that have significantly grown the company. And we have pursued these transactions or acquisitions for a variety of reasons such as expanding our capabilities, broadening our distribution, increasing scale and/or adding key talent. \n In every acquisition, there are things that have gone right as well as lessons we have learned. And certainly, we anticipated a different outcome when we purchased Assurance, and we've incorporated these lessons into our M&A approach, which gets to your question. As we look forward, we will focus on acquisitions of more established businesses that present opportunities to expand our capabilities and scale in our existing market-leading businesses. \n And you've seen that -- we've seen us do that with Deerpath Capital, Montana Capital Partners and Green Harvest as 3 examples. And we're going to continue to be really thoughtful and very disciplined about how we execute with the goal of creating value for our shareholders. \nElyse Greenspan: And then my second question, within group, good results in the quarter, you guys were towards the lower end of the target range for that business for the year. Just anything you want to point out, especially in the disability side, results seem good in the quarter? And how you expect the benefits ratio in that business to trend over the other 3 quarters of the year. \nCaroline Feeney-Pfundstein: Sure. Of course, Elyse, it's Caroline, and I'll take your question. So first of all, we're very pleased with our first quarter sales for group overall, which are influenced by the momentum we've seen in executing on our strategy to maintain our core product leadership while growing in the under 5,000 lives and association markets and further diversifying in disability and supplemental health. \n Our capabilities continue to resonate in the disability marketplace where our earned premiums were up nearly 15% and compared to the prior year quarter. In terms of drivers of our success, we're continuing to expand our value proposition by enhancing our customer experience, including streamlining our claims process with simplified language, with more efficient technology. That outcome is enabling customers to better understand their benefits. \n And then beyond these investments, at least in our core capabilities, we also remain highly focused on maintaining strong pricing discipline, only accepting those cases that make economic sense. So looking ahead at this year, as you know, most of our new business premiums are effective in the first quarter. So in general, the first quarter is when you will see the majority of the impact from new sales, renewals and enrollment on existing business. \n However, as we continue to grow in the under 5,000 lives in association market. We will see that sales season extend more into the second half of the year with business growth consistent with what we saw last year. So overall, we're very excited about the growth trajectory that we're seeing, not just in disability but across the board in our group business. And you asked about benefits ratio, Elyse. And so I'll just finally add that our overall -- our group underwriting results as has quarter were strong. \n We've recorded a total benefit ratio of just under 85%, which is our best first quarter benefit ratio ever and is within our recently lowered target range of 83 to 87. Specifically with regards to the disability underwriting results, it does reflect our focus on effective claims management and the continued tailwinds of strong employment as well as a high interest rate environment. \nOperator: Our next question is coming from Suneet Kamath from Jefferies. \nSuneet Kamath: To start with Individual Retirement. Caroline, you had mentioned the strong sales, and I think you're expecting that will persist going forward for you in the industry. Just wanted to get a sense of where that money is coming from. Is this new money coming to the industry, maybe from the qualified market? Or are we seeing 1035 exchanges from existing annuities? Just wanted to get a sense of where that demand is coming from. \nCaroline Feeney-Pfundstein: Yes, Suneet, it's a great question. Thanks so much. I don't think it's really one thing. I think it's the dynamic of individuals thinking more clearly as we have over 11,000 individuals turning 65 every single year over the next several years and 30 million Americans going to be turning 65 between now and 2030. \n And I think, unfortunately, many realizing that they have more work to do on retirement and understanding that protected income and protected savings is now increasingly more important to them and a priority. We're seeing that. And I think that is why we have seen 2 consecutive record years in the annuities market. It's also why, as I mentioned earlier, we very much see that we're on track for now a third consecutive record year of sales. \n And so I think it's really customer needs and broader solutions that we as an industry are able to offer. And certainly, we're very proud of the work that we have done in terms of expanding our portfolio the strength of our distribution and our brand that continues to resonate very well and positions us to be able to help many of these consumers with this growing need. \nSuneet Kamath: Got it. Okay. That makes sense. And then I guess, one for Rob, if I could. I think in your, Rob, you keep referencing this $48 billion of insurance margins, I don't know what that means. Like how was that calculated? And if that's such a big number, is there a way that you can start to monetize that rather than just wait for it to flow through the income statement? \nRobert Axel: I'll take a first stab at that, Suneet, and then I'll answer and then I'll ask Yanela to jump in if she wants to clarify anything I'm about to say. So with the change in accounting for long duration under LDTI, we now have the ability to actually calculate and share those margins. And that's what we've been doing since the adoption of those updated GAAP standards. \n Think about that as the present value of profits in the individual products that we have over the remaining life of those products on a gross basis. It doesn't include sort of net of expenses. So think of that as sort of just on a product basis before corporate expenses that might be associated with continuing to maintain and administer those blocks. \n As we think about that, that will naturally manifest over the life of the product as our experience then those margins become realized net income over the remaining period of time. There are opportunities to accelerate that. Reinsurance generally is a tool which we can use to do that, a large percentage of that -- those margins and reserves that we have exist within our Japan businesses. \n And within those Japan businesses, as we look to do reinsure some of that business out of Japan and into either the U.S. or Bermuda as we regularly do, that gives us opportunities to accelerate the realization of some of that margin. But Yanela, I don't know if you would like to add anything to that. \nYanela del Frias: No, Rob, that was a great explanation, nothing to add. \nSuneet Kamath: Got it. If I could just sneak one more in for Yanela. On HoldCo cash, are there any big movements that you're expecting as we move through the year in terms of capital structure, either issuances or repayments? Or are we kind of at a steady state at this point? \nYanela del Frias: No. We had the hybrid issuance in the first quarter. That was a prefunding of a 2025 maturity. So we issued $1 billion, and we also did redeem $500 million of previously issued hybrids. So from an issuance perspective, nothing more is expected. Our HLA balance did increase modestly during the quarter. As you saw, we did have net positive cash flows from our businesses after funding very strong growth, as you noted and as we've talked about, and the net proceeds of this hybrid issuance. \n These inflows were offset by shareholder distributions and net interest expense. Also important to note is that due to the timing of the closing of the GUL reinsurance transaction, those proceeds are in PICA and they have been factored into our capital plans for the year and that's worth about 8 RBC points. \n So again, from an HLA perspective in a HoldCo cash perspective, we had strong inflows. We had the expected outflows, and we are at $4.2 billion, well within our liquidity objective of $3 billion to $5 billion. \nOperator: Next question today is coming from Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. \nJamminder Bhullar: First question, just on the Assurance IQ business. Should we just assume that you're shutting down the business? Or is it reasonable to assume that you'll be able to sell it for like a decent consideration? \nYanela del Frias: Jimmy, it's Yanela. I'll take your question. And as we say that we've begun a wind-down process for Assurance and have moved the results to divested businesses. First of all, let me acknowledge that these decisions are always difficult and our utmost focus is caring for the people involved. That said, this winddown will not have a material impact on earnings. \n Assurance has not been material to our results. We have accrued all wind-down costs this quarter in divested businesses. And we do have assets on the balance sheet, such as commission receivables, which will convert to cash over time. And beyond that, as we go through the wind-down process, we certainly will assess whether there is any incremental value to the assets and to the extent that there is, we will seek to monetize that value. \nJamminder Bhullar: And I would have thought that it would be -- the exit would be slightly accretive to earnings given that Assurance IQ wasn't really making much money. And in most of the years when you were reporting it stand-alone, it was actually losing money. But is that not correct? \nYanela del Frias: Well, that's the point. We had moved it to corporate other because it was not material. Now it's in divested, and it's just not material to the bottom line. \nJamminder Bhullar: And then on the [ CRE ] portfolio, it seems like on commercial mortgage loans, most of the credit metrics are fairly stable with what they had been recently. But if you just talk about what's going on there and give us some insight into the percentage of loans or the number of loans that are maturing this year and what's happened with loans that have matured -- like are you having to extend more of them? Or are they just paying down? Or just anything to give us more color on how the portfolio has been performing. \nRobert Falzon: Okay. Jimmy, let me start at a high level and then end with your specific question on maturity. So actually, there has not been a material change from year-end. We've got a $51 billion portfolio. It's about 14% of our investments. \n The portfolio remains resilient. It's high quality. It's broadly diversified, looking at both geography and underlying property types. And as we pointed out before, we benefit significantly from PGIM's direct origination of these loans, their deep knowledge of local markets and the proven track record they've had through prior cycles.  \n It's a management team with over 25 years of average industry experience. LTVs and debt service coverage ratios really did not change for the entire -- on a portfolio-wide basis from the end of year to the -- through the first quarter, we're at 58% on a loan-to-value basis and almost 2.5x on a debt service coverage ratio. \n The office, as you might expect, Jimmy, had some negative trends. It's just pointing out that's about $7 billion of our portfolio or about 14% of the mortgage portfolio. LTVs there were up, it gets lost in the rounding and the overall. So our -- while our LTV for the overall portfolio didn't rise within the office sector, we went up from 71% at year-end to 74%, but our coverage ratios remained the same at just over 2.5x. So feel good about where we are in the overall portfolio. \n From an outlook standpoint -- and I'm sorry, I'm not sure if you asked the question but reserves in the real estate portfolio, we added modestly to those from the first quarter experience. So they're up, they're at $414 million, up from about $370-plus million as of year-end. So a modest increase there. As we're looking forward, expectation across the -- sort of across industry is that there'll be another 5% to 10% valuation decline across the industry. \n Office is a subsector of that will probably be more like around 15% decline. And while our portfolio won't be immune to further declines in value, we do expect it to continue to be resilient, given its construction, the institutional quality of our underlying properties and the conservative loan underwriting that we've got in those LTVs and debt service coverage ratios that I shared with you. \n With respect to loan maturities, during 2023, we had about $2 billion worth of maturities. There were 4 modifications under $400 million of that with long-term extensions.  The remainder were resolved favorably through refinancings, payoffs or short-term extensions, which were then subsequently paid off. \n For the remainder of 2024, we've got $2 billion or about 4% of the portfolio that's maturing. And then years after that, think of it as about being plus or minus 10% per year, so around $5.5 billion a year through 2028. We expect that there'll be episodic issues that we'll need to deal with in the way of ongoing loan modifications and extensions. \n But overall, we are quite comfortable with the quality and resilience of the portfolio. \nOperator: Your next question is coming from Wilma Burdis from Raymond James. \nWilma Jackson Burdis: Given the high level of retail sales, could you talk about the competition levels in annuity and life products? We would expect pricing to rationalize somewhat this year given regulatory changes in Bermuda. So have you seen any evidence of this? And maybe give us some broader color. \nCaroline Feeney-Pfundstein: Yes. So Wilma, it's Caroline. So I'll take your question. if I think about life for a moment and our sales results and our outlook going forward, I'll take that first. We are very pleased, Wilma, with our first quarter results with over $165 million in sales an increase of more than 10% from the prior year quarter. That's driven by our term and variable products, and we continue to write that new business at healthy returns continuing the trend we saw throughout the year in spite of competition. \n As we look to this year, we continue to see positive momentum for our portfolio. That does include core products like variable universal life and term where we are already a market leader. In addition, Wilma, and I think this is part of how we're staying ahead and continuing our market leadership position with competition as we've rolled out new solutions. Like our FlexGuard Life indexed variable universal life product to further penetrate the accumulation market and be able to reach new customers. And we achieved our highest quarterly sales of FlexGuard life this past quarter. So that we're very confident that with these products, our pricing disability, discipline, excuse me, and our distribution strength we will remain and continue to be a leader in the life market. \n In terms of the annuities market, yes, certainly, there is significant growth across the annuity space and increasing competition. with the record industry sales that we've seen in each of the past 2 years. But as I shared earlier, and I think this is important to reiterate, we've been able to achieve the strong results, thanks to our brand and our industry-leading execution and distribution. \n We've maintained a distinct focus on our end-to-end customer and adviser experiences using automation and process enhancement to make it easier than ever to buy a Prudential policy. We also have deep and expanding partnerships across multiple distribution channels. And this enables us to scale quickly to meet increased market demand and allows us to expand distribution. \n And finally, we combine all of that with our world-class asset management capabilities through PGIM. So we believe we're in a very strong position to continue to build on our growth and meet the market demand even with rising competition in the space. \nWilma Jackson Burdis: And given the exit in Argentina, could you discuss which regions you're thinking about scaling? And more broadly, could you give us an update on the market for bolt-on opportunities? \nAndrew Sullivan: So Wilma, it's Andy. So our emerging market strategy is to focus on a few select high-growth geographies that offer us the opportunity for significant scale. So at this point, what I would tell you is we're in the countries that we want to be in. So there really are no direct implications from the sale of Argentina for the rest of our portfolio. And we remain highly committed to Latin America as part of our emerging market growth strategy. \n I think the second part of your question was around programmatic bolt-on acquisitions. Job 1 is always organic growth for us. So that's where the majority of our focus is. But we will always be in the know and in the flow of potential acquisition opportunities. But as always, we'll be patient and we'll be disciplined. \nOperator: We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Lowrey for any further closing comments. \nCharles Lowrey: Okay. Thank you again for joining us today. We are pleased by the progress we've made in growing our market-leading businesses, including leveraging our mutually reinforcing business system and optimizing capital to deliver sustainable long-term growth. We will continue to lead the way in expanding access to investing insurance and retirement security across the globe as we help current and future generations live better lives longer. Thank you again for joining us, and have a good day. \nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

            "content": "Tom, it's Andy. So this mandate was a significant portion of the $26 billion that we saw in institutional positive net flows. Obviously, we don't disclose fee rate on individual mandates. That said, this is a large mandate from a key pension client for a high-quality fixed-income portfolio. \n So the fee rate is lower than our overall average fee rate across our asset classes. We were very pleased with our flows overall this quarter, and we're obviously very proud that we have so many large clients that place their trust in us. Yes. So maybe, Tom, let me just bring it up and I'll end with the outcome. So overall, on the institutional side, we're obviously very pleased given that large mandate, we feel that reinforces our position as a leading partner in the marketplace. And I'd also add that we've been consistently adding new clients to our roster on the institutional side every quarter, every year.  \n On the retail side, we saw positive flows of about $0.5 billion. We're beginning to see early momentum in the retail fixed-income space, consistent with industry trends and improving client sentiment. I would reiterate what Rob said at the top of the script as well that we had significant positive affiliated flows this quarter driven by pension risk transfer, showing the strength and importance of the synergies in the business system.  \n As far as specific to your question, the outlook looking forward, we like the fundamentals that we're seeing as the environment is clearly improving, and our investment performance is very, very strong. But we also know that a sticky inflationary environment will keep money on the sidelines a little while longer and that our large client flows can remain episodic. But the key punchline is, over time, we are very confident that will be a net winner and a net grower. So Wilma, it's Andy. So our emerging market strategy is to focus on a few select high-growth geographies that offer us the opportunity for significant scale. So at this point, what I would tell you is we're in the countries that we want to be in. So there really are no direct implications from the sale of Argentina for the rest of our portfolio.

            "name": "Yanela del Frias",
            "content": "Thank you, Rob. I will begin on Slide 10, which provides insight into earnings for the second quarter of 2024 relative to our first-quarter results. As noted, pretax adjusted operating income for the first quarter was $1.5 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $3.12 on an after-tax basis. \n To get a sense of how our second quarter results might develop, we suggest adjustments for the following items: Underwriting experience was below expectations by $85 million in the first quarter, and we expect $10 million of favorable seasonality in the second quarter. We also included an adjustment of $50 million for expenses and other items. This includes adjustments for typical seasonality of expenses and premiums as well as the onetime expenses related to our guaranteed universal life reinsurance transaction. \n These adjustments combined get us to a baseline of $3.43 per share for the second quarter. I will note that if you exclude items specific to the second quarter, earnings per share would be $3.50. The key takeaway is that we continue to drive underlying earnings power momentum as we invest in the growth of our market-leading businesses and pivot away from capital-intensive and lower-growth businesses. \n While we have provided these items to consider, please note that there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the second quarter. \n Turning to Slide 11. Our capital position continues to support our AA financial strength rating. Our regulatory capital ratios are in excess of our AA objectives. Our cash and liquid assets were $4.2 billion within our liquidity target range of $3 billion to $5 billion, and we have substantial off-balance sheet resources. We remain thoughtful in our capital deployment, investing in our businesses for long-term growth and returning capital to shareholders. \n Turning to Slide 12. And in summary, we are becoming a higher growth, more capital efficient and nimble company. We are maintaining a disciplined approach to capital deployment and our growth is supported by our rock-solid balance sheet. \n And with that, we will be happy to take your questions. Ryan, this is Yanela. And I will take your question. We are committed to keeping expenses flat while investing in our businesses. And as you noted, we did see an increase in G&A this quarter, but keep in mind that G&A includes expenses to support growth, including nondeferrable sales expenses in support of our very strong sales this quarter as well as onetime expenses like the cost-related to the GUL transaction.  \n So that's what you're seeing in terms of the increase. With regards to the strong sales, especially in retirement strategies, please note that the incremental earnings from those sales are not all fully reflected in the quarter. And there's 2 reasons, the timing of those sales as well as the fact that we leg into the final asset portfolio supporting the PRT sales over a period of time. So as a result, we expect that the full incremental earnings benefit to emerge in subsequent quarters. And Caroline, I don't know if you wanted to spend a minute on retirement strategies, fundamentals. This is Yanela. Let me give you an update on where we are with ESR. On ESR, we believe our Japan businesses are well capitalized and financially strong, and that would be evident under any reasonable capital standard. We have been working with regulators and advocating for reasonable and responsible standards. And we have strategies to adapt to the potential new regime and to better match the economics of our business.  \n And these strategies include reinsurance business internally in the U.S. or Bermuda or reassuring externally. And as an example of these strategies, during the first quarter, we reinsured $3 billion of U.S. dollar-denominated whole life products from Japan to our Bermuda affiliate, Gibraltar, which allows us to manage capital for that block on a more economic basis.  \n So we're looking at this very carefully. The proposed regulations are still subject to change. but are expected to be finalized later this quarter ahead of being effective on April 1, 2025. No, Rob, that was a great explanation, nothing to add. No. We had the hybrid issuance in the first quarter. That was a prefunding of a 2025 maturity. So we issued $1 billion, and we also did redeem $500 million of previously issued hybrids. So from an issuance perspective, nothing more is expected. Our HLA balance did increase modestly during the quarter. As you saw, we did have net positive cash flows from our businesses after funding very strong growth, as you noted and as we've talked about, and the net proceeds of this hybrid issuance. \n These inflows were offset by shareholder distributions and net interest expense. Also important to note is that due to the timing of the closing of the GUL reinsurance transaction, those proceeds are in PICA and they have been factored into our capital plans for the year and that's worth about 8 RBC points. \n So again, from an HLA perspective in a HoldCo cash perspective, we had strong inflows. We had the expected outflows, and we are at $4.2 billion, well within our liquidity objective of $3 billion to $5 billion. Jimmy, it's Yanela. I'll take your question. And as we say that we've begun a wind-down process for Assurance and have moved the results to divested businesses. First of all, let me acknowledge that these decisions are always difficult and our utmost focus is caring for the people involved. That said, this winddown will not have a material impact on earnings. \n Assurance has not been material to our results. We have accrued all wind-down costs this quarter in divested businesses. And we do have assets on the balance sheet, such as commission receivables, which will convert to cash over time. And beyond that, as we go through the wind-down process, we certainly will assess whether there is any incremental value to the assets and to the extent that there is, we will seek to monetize that value. Well, that's the point. We had moved it to corporate other because it was not material. Now it's in divested, and it's just not material to the bottom line."

            "name": "Caroline Feeney-Pfundstein",
            "content": "Yes, sure. Of course, Yanela, thanks. And Ryan, clearly, Yanela just went through some of the earnings drivers. So now let me share with you how we're thinking about the fundamentals in our growth story. So overall, we're very pleased with the strong sales growth across our Retirement Strategies business. with over $14 billion in sales this past quarter.  \n In Institutional, we achieved $11 billion in sales led by nearly $9 billion of pension risk transfer, not only our best first quarter, Ryan, but also the best first quarter in market history, further demonstrating our leadership in the market. And then on the individual side, we had our best quarter in over a decade with almost $3.5 billion in sales nearly doubling our volume from the year-ago quarter. And that success comes from our work over the past few years to diversify our annuity portfolio and broaden our distribution which allows us to meet more of the consumer needs for protected savings and for income than ever before.  \n And as Yanela mentioned, these strong sales will continue to increase core earnings over time as we realize the full impact of these sales. Yes. Of course, Joel. It's Caroline, and I'll take your question. So first of all, the individual annuities market had a record year last year with about $380 billion of sales, and fixed annuities were a key piece of that given the rapid rises that we did see in interest rates. We're seeing continued momentum for fixed annuities this year as the value proposition remains strong, driving industry sales of over $100 billion in the first quarter, putting the industry on track for another record year.  \n In terms of our own growth, Joel, fixed annuities, represented almost half of our sales last quarter mirroring the broader market shift we've seen over the past few years -- past year, excuse me, our sales growth is a testament to 3 things: first, our successful expansion of our product portfolio to include more fixed annuity solutions such as our Westgard, MIGA allowing us to meet more customer needs across a broader set of channels.  \n Second, our brand and our distribution strength, which enables us to scale quickly to meet increasing market demand. We continue to expand our partnerships across multiple channels and platforms which also had a significant impact on our business this past quarter. And finally, our dynamic and proactive pricing process, which allows us to react quickly to changing market conditions, to maintain competitive pricing while maximizing shareholder value. So overall, Joe, we're pleased with our ability to meet the increased demand while maintaining favorable returns.  \n We like the diversification, these products bring to our business mix and the role they can play as a strong complement to our FlexGuard suite of solutions. Absolutely, Joe. Yes, we see it as a core product as we broaden our portfolio. Yes. So as you said, Joel, and rightly so, we had a very strong start here. We finished actually the strongest first quarter ever in PRT, leading the market, including 2 transactions with Shell and Verizon totaling nearly $9 billion. In terms of our outlook on growth, last year's market volume was roughly $45 billion, and we expect to see that healthy pipeline continue this year supported by favorable funding positions of over 100%.  \n And although the market is highly competitive, very few carriers have actually executed transactions exceeding $1 billion. And I should call out that our expertise and our ability to handle large complex transactions along with our financial strength, position us to continue to be a leader in the space. Yes. So I'd say, in general, Joel, obviously, each large transaction naturally consumes its appropriate share of capital. We believe these deals are a very effective way of deploying capital. and we like the returns that we're generating.  \n First, PRT remains a great source for organic growth. It represents one of the few products that can allow us to originate billions of insurance liabilities in a single transaction. And as a market leader in the space, we continue to see, as I mentioned, a strong pipeline of those large-sized opportunities.  \n I'll also add that the success of our PRT business benefits PGIM as we continue to originate these deals PGIM can match our insurance liabilities with a high-quality portfolio of assets. So with all that being said, Joel, we do expect to continue to opportunistically deploy capital in the space and we feel good about the returns as well as the benefits PRT brings to Prudential. Sure. Of course, Elyse, it's Caroline, and I'll take your question. So first of all, we're very pleased with our first quarter sales for group overall, which are influenced by the momentum we've seen in executing on our strategy to maintain our core product leadership while growing in the under 5,000 lives and association markets and further diversifying in disability and supplemental health. \n Our capabilities continue to resonate in the disability marketplace where our earned premiums were up nearly 15% and compared to the prior year quarter. In terms of drivers of our success, we're continuing to expand our value proposition by enhancing our customer experience, including streamlining our claims process with simplified language, with more efficient technology. That outcome is enabling customers to better understand their benefits. \n And then beyond these investments, at least in our core capabilities, we also remain highly focused on maintaining strong pricing discipline, only accepting those cases that make economic sense. So looking ahead at this year, as you know, most of our new business premiums are effective in the first quarter. So in general, the first quarter is when you will see the majority of the impact from new sales, renewals and enrollment on existing business. \n However, as we continue to grow in the under 5,000 lives in association market. We will see that sales season extend more into the second half of the year with business growth consistent with what we saw last year. So overall, we're very excited about the growth trajectory that we're seeing, not just in disability but across the board in our group business. And you asked about benefits ratio, Elyse. And so I'll just finally add that our overall -- our group underwriting results as has quarter were strong. \n We've recorded a total benefit ratio of just under 85%, which is our best first quarter benefit ratio ever and is within our recently lowered target range of 83 to 87. Specifically with regards to the disability underwriting results, it does reflect our focus on effective claims management and the continued tailwinds of strong employment as well as a high interest rate environment. Yes, Suneet, it's a great question. Thanks so much. I don't think it's really one thing. I think it's the dynamic of individuals thinking more clearly as we have over 11,000 individuals turning 65 every single year over the next several years and 30 million Americans going to be turning 65 between now and 2030. \n And I think, unfortunately, many realizing that they have more work to do on retirement and understanding that protected income and protected savings is now increasingly more important to them and a priority. We're seeing that. And I think that is why we have seen 2 consecutive record years in the annuities market. It's also why, as I mentioned earlier, we very much see that we're on track for now a third consecutive record year of sales. \n And so I think it's really customer needs and broader solutions that we as an industry are able to offer. And certainly, we're very proud of the work that we have done in terms of expanding our portfolio the strength of our distribution and our brand that continues to resonate very well and positions us to be able to help many of these consumers with this growing need. Yes. So Wilma, it's Caroline. So I'll take your question. if I think about life for a moment and our sales results and our outlook going forward, I'll take that first. We are very pleased, Wilma, with our first quarter results with over $165 million in sales an increase of more than 10% from the prior year quarter. That's driven by our term and variable products, and we continue to write that new business at healthy returns continuing the trend we saw throughout the year in spite of competition. \n As we look to this year, we continue to see positive momentum for our portfolio. That does include core products like variable universal life and term where we are already a market leader. In addition, Wilma, and I think this is part of how we're staying ahead and continuing our market leadership position with competition as we've rolled out new solutions. Like our FlexGuard Life indexed variable universal life product to further penetrate the accumulation market and be able to reach new customers. And we achieved our highest quarterly sales of FlexGuard life this past quarter. So that we're very confident that with these products, our pricing disability, discipline, excuse me, and our distribution strength we will remain and continue to be a leader in the life market. \n In terms of the annuities market, yes, certainly, there is significant growth across the annuity space and increasing competition. with the record industry sales that we've seen in each of the past 2 years. But as I shared earlier, and I think this is important to reiterate, we've been able to achieve the strong results, thanks to our brand and our industry-leading execution and distribution. \n We've maintained a distinct focus on our end-to-end customer and adviser experiences using automation and process enhancement to make it easier than ever to buy a Prudential policy. We also have deep and expanding partnerships across multiple distribution channels. And this enables us to scale quickly to meet increased market demand and allows us to expand distribution. \n And finally, we combine all of that with our world-class asset management capabilities through PGIM. So we believe we're in a very strong position to continue to build on our growth and meet the market demand even with rising competition in the space."

            "name": "Robert Axel",
            "content": "Yes, Tom, the investors that we have in Prismic and our conversations with them have indicated their desire to put a significant amount of capital to work and the strategy that we've outlined to them. And so expectations are that these are firms that deal on the billions, not the millions or hundreds of millions.  \n And they've indicated that their desire is to scale the initial investment that they've made, which is, frankly, small by their standards and would be uneconomic if it were not for their anticipation that it was going to be followed by investments that would be multiples of what they've contributed upfront. That having been said, this is not a fund. It is a collaborative of investors that have committed to working with us in this strategy and they will fund as we develop and execute against pipeline. Yes, Wes, happy to do so. We've actually been highly engaged with the BMA throughout the consultation process that it recently went through and provided feedback on the proposed enhancements to their regime directly with the BMA as well as in coordination with the broader industry.  \n I think what I would characterize is that while the BMA's updates to regulatory regime are generally going to result in a more conservative level of capital required and reserving than what they had prior to their consultation process. That's going to vary significantly by product type. And the BMA is committed to continuing to maintain a principles-based economically driven regime.  \n And we believe that the combination of that approach to managing insurance assets and liabilities along with its status with reciprocal jurisdiction in the U.S. and equivalency in Europe is going to continue to make it a very attractive jurisdiction to do business for insurers. I'll take a first stab at that, Suneet, and then I'll answer and then I'll ask Yanela to jump in if she wants to clarify anything I'm about to say. So with the change in accounting for long duration under LDTI, we now have the ability to actually calculate and share those margins. And that's what we've been doing since the adoption of those updated GAAP standards. \n Think about that as the present value of profits in the individual products that we have over the remaining life of those products on a gross basis. It doesn't include sort of net of expenses. So think of that as sort of just on a product basis before corporate expenses that might be associated with continuing to maintain and administer those blocks. \n As we think about that, that will naturally manifest over the life of the product as our experience then those margins become realized net income over the remaining period of time. There are opportunities to accelerate that. Reinsurance generally is a tool which we can use to do that, a large percentage of that -- those margins and reserves that we have exist within our Japan businesses. \n And within those Japan businesses, as we look to do reinsure some of that business out of Japan and into either the U.S. or Bermuda as we regularly do, that gives us opportunities to accelerate the realization of some of that margin. But Yanela, I don't know if you would like to add anything to that."

            "content": "Thank you, Bob, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our results for the quarter reflect accelerating momentum across all our businesses, including significant positive net flows in PGIM, our global asset manager and strong sales in our U.S. and International Insurance businesses. \n During the quarter, we made substantial progress in shifting our business mix and growing our market-leading businesses to become a higher growth, more capital efficient and nimble company. We also maintained our disciplined approach to capital management by making further investments in our businesses and returning additional capital to shareholders. Our rock-solid balance sheet, business mix and distinct strategy position us to deliver long-term growth for our stakeholders. \n Turning to Slide 3. I'll now begin this morning with a few recent examples that demonstrate how we are growing our market-leading businesses. PGIM achieved robust third-party and affiliated net flows in the quarter, notably in our fixed-income business, underpinned by continued strong investment performance. These flows reinforce the benefits of our large and strategic global client relationships and the power of our mutually reinforcing business system to grow our asset management fees. \n Our Institutional Retirement Strategies business reported strong sales and record account values, including the benefits of 2 large pension risk transfer transactions in the quarter. As a result, we delivered a record first quarter of PRT sales. Meanwhile, our Individual Retirement Strategies business recorded its best sales quarter in more than a decade. This reflects the continued diversification and expansion of our product offerings as well as strong demand in the market. \n Strong growth in our group insurance elected our product and segment diversification strategy leading to increased sales across life, disability and supplemental health. Meanwhile, our individual life insurance business continues to shift towards more capital-efficient products and broaden solutions through newer offerings like FlexGuard Life, which had its highest sales quarter since launching in 2022. \n Internationally, we continue to benefit from our broadening product portfolio in Japan and from our actions to expand our distribution to new customers in emerging markets. Prudential in Brazil saw strong momentum across all distribution channels, most notably in our Life Planner channel, which reported record sales for the quarter. \n We achieved these milestones while continuing to pivot away from more capital-intensive and lower-growth businesses. We successfully closed a reinsurance transaction for a portion of our guaranteed universal life block further advancing our strategy to reduce market sensitivity and increase capital efficiency. We also announced an agreement to sell Prudential of Argentina, a move aligned with our strategy of focusing on fewer high-growth emerging markets where we have an opportunity to achieve scale. \n And finally, we initiated the process to exit our Assurance business so that we can focus our efforts and resources on core businesses and capabilities. We also continue to strengthen our operating model through technology and strategic partnerships to generate efficiencies that can be reinvested to fuel growth and deliver exceptional sales, service and claims experiences. This ongoing focus on improving the ways we work and supporting our customers continues to be recognized outside the company. \n As just one example, Prudential of Japan recently ranked #1 for life insurance service in a J.D. Power customer satisfaction survey for the ninth year in a row. We are proud to be recognized for the value we provide to our customers. \n Turning now to Slide 4. Our disciplined approach to capital deployment enables us to invest in our market-leading businesses to support long-term growth and return capital to shareholders. In the first quarter, we returned over $700 million to shareholders and increased the quarterly dividend by 4%, our 16th consecutive annual dividend increase. We will continue to focus on creating sustainable, profitable growth that will benefit all stakeholders. \n Moving to Slide 5. Our growth strategy is supported by Prudential's rock-solid balance sheet and robust risk and capital management framework. Our AA-rated financial strength represents a strong capital position, including approximately $48 billion of unrealized insurance margins over $4 billion in highly liquid assets at the end of the first quarter, a high-quality, well-diversified investment portfolio and a disciplined approach to asset liability management. \n We've entered the second quarter with confidence in our strategy to be a global leader in expanding access to investing insurance and retirement security for people around the world. \n And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob to provide more details on our first quarter business performance. Sure, Elyse. This is Charlie. Thanks for the question. We've executed on many transactions over time that have significantly grown the company. And we have pursued these transactions or acquisitions for a variety of reasons such as expanding our capabilities, broadening our distribution, increasing scale and/or adding key talent. \n In every acquisition, there are things that have gone right as well as lessons we have learned. And certainly, we anticipated a different outcome when we purchased Assurance, and we've incorporated these lessons into our M&A approach, which gets to your question. As we look forward, we will focus on acquisitions of more established businesses that present opportunities to expand our capabilities and scale in our existing market-leading businesses. \n And you've seen that -- we've seen us do that with Deerpath Capital, Montana Capital Partners and Green Harvest as 3 examples. And we're going to continue to be really thoughtful and very disciplined about how we execute with the goal of creating value for our shareholders. Okay. Thank you again for joining us today. We are pleased by the progress we've made in growing our market-leading businesses, including leveraging our mutually reinforcing business system and optimizing capital to deliver sustainable long-term growth. We will continue to lead the way in expanding access to investing insurance and retirement security across the globe as we help current and future generations live better lives longer. Thank you again for joining us, and have a good day."

            "name": "Robert Falzon",
            "content": "Thanks, Charlie. I will provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for our PGIM U.S. and international businesses I'll begin on Slide 6 with our financial results for the first quarter of 2024. \n Our pretax adjusted operating income was $1.5 billion or $3.12 per share on an after-tax basis, up 16% from the year-ago quarter. These results reflect the continued execution of our strategy to grow our market-leading businesses. Strong sales and robust net inflows and the benefit of higher interest rates and equity markets have resulted in higher spread income, fee income and underwriting results. \n These diversified sources of earnings were partially offset by higher expenses to support business growth and onetime costs of closing the Guaranteed Universal Life reinsurance transaction. \n Turning to the operating results from our businesses compared to the year-ago quarter. PGIM, our global investment manager had higher asset management fees driven by equity market appreciation, positive third-party net inflows and contributions from the Deerpath Capital acquisition. Additionally, higher incentive fees and seed and co-investment income resulted in an increase in other related revenues. This was partially offset by higher expenses to support business growth. \n Earnings growth in our U.S. businesses reflected higher spread income driven by business growth and the benefit of higher interest rates and variable investment income as well as more favorable underwriting results. This was partially offset by higher expenses, including the onetime charges associated with the closing of the Guaranteed Universal Life reinsurance transaction and by lower legacy traditional variable annuity fee income as we intentionally continue our pivot to less market-sensitive products. \n Earnings growth in our International businesses was primarily driven by higher spread income, including the benefit of higher interest rates and more favorable variable investment income and higher joint venture earnings due to the favorable encaje performance in Chile. This was partially offset by less favorable underwriting results, primarily reflecting policyholder behavior. \n Turning to Slide 7. PGIM, our global investment manager, has diversified capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed income, equities and alternatives. PGIM's strong investment performance continues to improve with 80% of assets under management exceeding their benchmarks over the past year. This has contributed favorably to attractive long-term performance with over 80% of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last 5- and 10-year periods. \n PGIM's assets under management increased by 6% to $1.3 trillion from the year-ago quarter, driven by market appreciation and positive third-party net flows. Robust third-party net inflows in the quarter totaled $26.6 billion. Institutional inflows of $26 billion included a large fixed-income client mandate. And retail flows also turned positive, reflecting building momentum in public fixed income. \n Additionally, strong affiliated flows were driven by retirement strategy sales during the quarter as the investment engine of Prudential, the success and growth of PGIM and of our U.S. and International insurance and retirement businesses are mutually reinforcing. PGIM's asset origination capabilities, investment management expertise and access to institutional and other sources of private capital, including through the recently launched reinsurer Prismic, our competitive advantage helping our businesses bring enhanced solutions and create more value for our customers. \n Our insurance and retirement businesses, in turn, provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated net flows as well as unique access to insurance liabilities. In addition, our diversified PGIM private alternatives platform, which has assets under management of approximately $240 billion experienced strong private credit activity driven by our organic growth and the first full quarter benefit from acquiring Deerpath Capital. \n Turning to Slide 8. Our U.S. businesses produced diversified earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income and benefit from our complementary mix of longevity and mortality businesses. We continue to focus on growing our market-leading businesses by transforming our capabilities to improve customer experiences and expanding our addressable market with new financial solutions leveraging the capabilities across Prudential. \n Retirement strategies generated strong sales of $14.3 billion in the first quarter across its institutional and individual lines of business. Institutional Retirement sales of $11 billion in the first quarter included 2 large U.S. funded pension risk transfer transactions of nearly $9 billion, driving the strongest first quarter in market history. \n We have now completed 6 of the 10 largest transactions on record. Individual Retirement posted $3.3 billion in sales, our best quarter in sales in over a decade. Our product pivots have resulted in continued strong sales of FlexGuard and FlexCard Income, which increased nearly 60% from the year-ago quarter and fixed annuity sales have nearly tripled, while we continue to reduce market sensitivity by running off our legacy variable annuities. \n Group Insurance sales increased 18% compared to the prior year, driven by growth in life, disability and supplemental health. We are executing our strategy of both product and client segment diversification while leveraging technology to increase operating efficiency and enhance the customer experience. \n In Individual Life, we continue to execute our strategic pivot to more capital-efficient products with the closing of the guaranteed Universal Life reinsurance transaction. Total sales in Individual Life increased 12% from the year-ago quarter, including the benefit from the recently launched FlexGuard Life product. Variable Life products represented approximately 70% of sales for the quarter. \n Turning to Slide 9. Our International businesses include our Japanese life insurance companies, where we have a differentiated multichannel distribution model as well as other businesses aimed at expanding our presence in targeted high-growth emerging markets. \n In Japan, we're focused on providing high-quality service and expanding our distribution and product offerings. Our needs-based approach and protection product focus continue to provide important value to our customers as we expand our product offerings to meet their evolving needs. In emerging markets, we're focused on creating a selective portfolio of businesses in regions where customer needs are growing, where there are compelling opportunities to build market-leading businesses and where the Prudential enterprise can add value. \n Sales in our International businesses were up 5% compared to the year-ago quarter. Higher sales in Japan are benefiting from the recent product launches, including a new yen-denominated variable life product offered through our Life Consultant and independent agency channels beginning in the first quarter. In addition, emerging market sales were higher, driven by growth in Brazil as we continue to expand third-party distribution and benefit from the strong performance of our world-class life planners. \n As we look ahead, we are well-positioned across our businesses to be a global leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security. We continue to focus on investing in growth businesses and markets, delivering industry-leading customer experiences and creating the next generation of financial solutions to serve the diverse needs of a broad range of customers. \n And with that, I'll now hand it over to Yanela. Ryan, it's Rob. I'll take your question. As we've shared before, we and our Prismic investors who are a group of very large global institutional investors that operate and scale have aspirations that go well beyond the initial $10 billion transaction that we completed last year. We're continuing work on an active pipeline. That pipeline includes ongoing balance sheet optimization. It includes flow or new sales that are solutions across our businesses and working on third-party blocks where we believe we can provide our reinsurance and asset management capabilities to other insurers. \n To maybe state the obvious, these transactions are complex. They're bespoke to each situation and they require regulatory coordination and all of that takes time. Our decision to use Prismic for this pipeline has contrasted to the opportunity to also use our own balance sheet or to partner or reinsure with other third parties is unique to each of the opportunities. And it's driven by looking through a lens of commercial priorities, statutory considerations, GAAP outcomes and economic considerations. \n And that includes implications to earnings ROE, capital and liquidity. If I could step back and sort of more broadly, address it. We see extraordinarily interesting growth opportunities at the intersection of what we're calling the intersection of asset management and insurance. Private institutional capital is coming into the insurance space, insurance and retirement sector. It helps to finance the growth and to meet customer needs -- customer and client needs.  \n And in addition, the investment options that are available to the industry are expanding, and they're providing opportunities to grow investment capabilities while enhancing portfolio diversification and generating greater output from our portfolio as well. We're excited about what this implies for our ability to create avenues of growth across our insurance, retirement and asset management businesses. And we believe that our brand, scale, and the quality across our businesses gives us a highly competitive platform to execute against the opportunity and Prismic is an important expansion of that platform. PRT can be done economically, both within the U.S. statutory regime and within the Bermuda statutory regime. We've advanced, adopted a set of principles that are under consideration for pension risk transfer type liabilities in coordination with our New Jersey supervisor.  \n And so our ability or desire to use Bermuda versus the U.S. statutory regime is less driven by differences in the regimes per se and more driven by the source of investors coming into it. So obviously, for our own balance sheet, operating within the U.S. statutory regime works well for us. But to the extent we want to bring third-party capital into that capital has a desire for a number of reasons.  \n Those institutions providing that capital to come into jurisdictions like Barbuda, and that would be more of the primary driver as to why we would be funding some of PRT through our Bermuda framework as contrasted to a U.S. framework. Okay. Jimmy, let me start at a high level and then end with your specific question on maturity. So actually, there has not been a material change from year-end. We've got a $51 billion portfolio. It's about 14% of our investments. \n The portfolio remains resilient. It's high quality. It's broadly diversified, looking at both geography and underlying property types. And as we pointed out before, we benefit significantly from PGIM's direct origination of these loans, their deep knowledge of local markets and the proven track record they've had through prior cycles.  \n It's a management team with over 25 years of average industry experience. LTVs and debt service coverage ratios really did not change for the entire -- on a portfolio-wide basis from the end of year to the -- through the first quarter, we're at 58% on a loan-to-value basis and almost 2.5x on a debt service coverage ratio. \n The office, as you might expect, Jimmy, had some negative trends. It's just pointing out that's about $7 billion of our portfolio or about 14% of the mortgage portfolio. LTVs there were up, it gets lost in the rounding and the overall. So our -- while our LTV for the overall portfolio didn't rise within the office sector, we went up from 71% at year-end to 74%, but our coverage ratios remained the same at just over 2.5x. So feel good about where we are in the overall portfolio. \n From an outlook standpoint -- and I'm sorry, I'm not sure if you asked the question but reserves in the real estate portfolio, we added modestly to those from the first quarter experience. So they're up, they're at $414 million, up from about $370-plus million as of year-end. So a modest increase there. As we're looking forward, expectation across the -- sort of across industry is that there'll be another 5% to 10% valuation decline across the industry. \n Office is a subsector of that will probably be more like around 15% decline. And while our portfolio won't be immune to further declines in value, we do expect it to continue to be resilient, given its construction, the institutional quality of our underlying properties and the conservative loan underwriting that we've got in those LTVs and debt service coverage ratios that I shared with you. \n With respect to loan maturities, during 2023, we had about $2 billion worth of maturities. There were 4 modifications under $400 million of that with long-term extensions.  The remainder were resolved favorably through refinancings, payoffs or short-term extensions, which were then subsequently paid off. \n For the remainder of 2024, we've got $2 billion or about 4% of the portfolio that's maturing. And then years after that, think of it as about being plus or minus 10% per year, so around $5.5 billion a year through 2028. We expect that there'll be episodic issues that we'll need to deal with in the way of ongoing loan modifications and extensions. \n But overall, we are quite comfortable with the quality and resilience of the portfolio."
