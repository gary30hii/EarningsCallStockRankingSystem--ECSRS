At the request of Cisco Systems, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now, I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nMarilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Sue. Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 quarterly earnings conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chairman and CEO, and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. By now you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties, including COVID-19, that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. In Q2 fiscal 2019, we completed the sale of our SPVSS [Service Provider Video Software Solutions] business. As such, all of the financial information we will be discussing is normalized to exclude the SPVSS business from our historical results. I will now turn it over to Chuck.\nCharles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thank you, Marilyn. We hope all of you and your families are staying safe and healthy. Our thoughts remain with everyone who has been affected by the pandemic, and we are grateful to those who remain on the front lines working to help those impacted during these challenging times. As we've been preparing for this call, it's offered me some time to reflect on what we've achieved since I stepped into this role five years ago. Through the hard work of everyone at Cisco, we have undergone a significant transformation in the midst of some of the most complex times in our history. I am so proud of what our teams have accomplished. They have demonstrated resiliency, determination, and compassion as we delivered on our financial commitments, brought market-leading innovation to our customers, transitioned our business model, and driven a culture that has truly shined over the past six months. The Cisco of today is more agile, innovative, and focused. Through both organic and inorganic innovation, we delivered incredible new technology with new, more flexible consumption offers for our customers with more software and subscriptions. At our Financial Analyst Conference in 2017, we laid out key metrics for our transformation. We set a goal of 30% of our revenue to come from software. And while we achieved 29% in fiscal year 2020, we did achieve 31% in Q4. We also delivered 51% of our revenue from software and services in FY 2020, exceeding our target of 50%. Lastly, we now have 78% of our software revenue sold as subscription, beating our target of 66%. With our customers as our guide, we have successfully executed against our strategy to help them transform and modernize their organizations. We launched our intent-based networking architecture using automation and machine learning to help our customers drive simplicity and cost-effective management of their networks. As customers move more workloads to the cloud, we're offering fast, highly secure access to applications hosted anywhere, in the private data center, public cloud, or a SaaS platform, with our cloud security integrated with our SD-WAN solution. We introduced new capabilities across software, silicon, and optics to help bring to life the Internet for the future. The innovation we've driven in our security portfolio has helped us become the top enterprise security company in the world. With Webex, we have the most trusted secure platform for remote collaboration for the enterprise, and we're also delivering real-time insights for customers in their multi-cloud environments to optimize user experience with our insights and observability assets like AppDynamics. Over the past few years, this transition has resulted in improvements in our financial performance, including expanding margins and demonstrating continued financial discipline. Once again, I want to thank our teams for what we've achieved. If the past year has taught us anything, it's the need to always be nimble. I believe that the changes we've made to our business now put us in a position of strength as we focus on our future. We're a company that embraces change, and we've shown our ability to thrive in any environment. The past six months have unquestionably reshaped our world. Industries, governments, and work have changed dramatically, and many of these changes will become permanent. At Cisco, we are committed to helping our customers truly digitize their organizations for the future, regardless of the challenges or fundamental shifts that we may face. Like many other organizations, we've also had the opportunity to reexamine our business and our portfolio for this new world. As I said last quarter, we were going to take time to better understand the short and long-term implications of COVID-19, and we now believe we have a better view. Based on the many conversations we've had with our customers around the world, we believe we have perspective into how they will adapt their technology strategies for the future to ensure greater resiliency, agility, and innovation. We know how to adapt our business's strategy to align with where our customers are headed. The changes we are making to our business reflect how we are leveraging our existing strengths, investing for growth, and unlocking new opportunities. We will also be very disciplined on our cost structure, as we always have been. Over the next few quarters, we will be taking out over $1 billion on an annualized basis to reduce our cost structure. At the same time, we're going to rebalance our R&D investments to focus on key areas that will position us well for the future. More specifically, we will accelerate the transition of the majority of our portfolio to be delivered as a service. We will also accelerate our investments in the following areas: cloud security; cloud collaboration; key enhancements for education, healthcare, and other industries; increased automation in the enterprise; the future of work; and application insights and analytics. At the same time, we will continue our focus in the following areas, many of which have been accelerated by the pandemic: multi-cloud investment; 5G and Wi-Fi 6; 400-gig; optical networking; next-generation silicon; AI; and more. These investments will help define the next phase of our transformation and allow us to bring the best, most relevant innovation to our customers in simpler, more easily consumables ways. I am confident that, once again, we have the right strategy that will deliver what our customers need from us, and we will emerge from this challenging time as a stronger company than before. Now, let me discuss our performance in the quarter. While our results reflect the ongoing challenges in the current environment, we executed well. As you would expect, the pandemic has had the most impact on our enterprise and commercial orders, driven by an overall slowdown in spending. We are seeing customers continue to delay their purchasing decisions in certain areas, while increasing spend in others until they have greater visibility and clarity on the timing and shape of the global economic recovery. Despite this challenging economic environment, the pandemic has also triggered a massive and rapid shift to remote operations and automation to maximize personal safety. With this, many customers are increasingly reliant on our broad portfolio of technologies, resulting in another quarter of strong demand for our Catalyst 9000, security, Webex, and other SaaS-based solutions. Throughout fiscal year 2020, we demonstrated operational resilience based on our strong customer relationships, a solid financial foundation, differentiated innovation, and a compelling strategic transformation built on the strength of our key technology platforms. Now, I'll cover a few highlights from the quarter. In June, we introduced an expanded business resiliency portfolio offering healthcare and education solutions with simpler consumption models and services to accelerate adoption. We will continue to expand this portfolio to cover areas such as social distancing in the workplace, effective virtual employee engagement at scale, and pop-up connected clinics. Within our Infrastructure Platforms business, we continue to see a strong ramp of our Catalyst 9K portfolio as many customers take advantage of their employees working from home to refresh their aging infrastructure, enabling them to simplify, secure, and automate the management of their networks. Our acquisition of ThousandEyes will complement these capabilities by adding deeper and broader visibility and analytics across networks and applications, enabling us to deliver the best possible experiences for our customers. By integrating their SaaS-based offering with our AppDynamics application intelligence portfolio and SD-WAN technology, we can provide unparalleled intelligence and insights at cloud scale, driving improved customer experience as well as reliability of their applications. Security continues to be a top priority for our customers, particularly in this distributed digital world. Our ability to connect and protect our customers working from anywhere, on any device, is accelerating the adoption of our comprehensive security portfolio, resulting in double-digit revenue growth this quarter. As more data goes to the cloud and users become more distributed, we had good momentum in our cloud security solutions, protecting workloads, applications, and data. We also continue to expand our capabilities to enable simplification and automation of our customer security infrastructure. A good example of this is our SecureX platform, which is designed to unify visibility, enable automation, and deliver a consistent experience. Since our launch six weeks ago, we have over 2,100 active daily customers, two-thirds of which have two or more products active. We're also delivering Secure Remote Worker solutions that span our endpoint security portfolio combined with the power of our Zero Trust Architecture with Duo, AnyConnect, Umbrella, and AMP for Endpoints. Applications have become a lifeline for so many organizations, and this has only increased over the past few months. As organizations define what their future looks like, our collaboration technology will play a key role in evolving how they work, transact, and connect. Webex had strong performance this quarter with double-digit growth, as businesses, governments, educators, and front-line workers everywhere have embraced remote work. We expect this momentum to continue, as we have begun to see the conversion of free trials into paid subscriptions. AppDynamics also achieved another solid quarter. These monitoring tools offer our customers great value by providing real-time insights from a single pane of glass to optimize user experience in their multi-cloud environments. As we think about all that we've achieved over the past five years, I want to take a moment to acknowledge Kelly Kramer, our Chief Financial Officer, who has been an incredible partner to me. She has played a key role in reshaping Cisco into the company we are today. I want to let you all know that Kelly has made the decision to retire from Cisco. Over her 8-plus years here, Kelly has led the effort to improve our financial performance, focused on investor confidence, and helped position Cisco for success. Kelly and I have been focused on simple, clear communication, absolute transparency, delivering on our commitments, and always aligning Cisco for future growth. Kelly has graciously agreed to stay on as CFO until we have her successor on board and will advise us with a succession process. I can assure you that, with Kelly staying on during the search and with our world-class finance team, we will have a seamless transition. Kelly, thank you so much for your partnership and your friendship. You will truly be missed. Now, before I turn it over to Kelly, I want to reiterate my confidence for what the future holds. Over the past five years, we have not shied away from making bold moves to position us for long-term growth, and now is no different. We are committed to running a strong business as well as leveraging technology for good to solve the world's biggest challenges and create new opportunities for the future. As we've demonstrated, we have helped our customers build resiliency in difficult environments, through industry disruptions, and in times of rapid growth. We will also continue to use our position to make our communities and world a better place. Whether it's tackling the global health pandemic or social injustice and intolerance, we are committed to our purpose of powering an inclusive future for all. As we start a new fiscal year, I believe we have incredible opportunities in front of us. We will navigate the pandemic in the most effective way possible while not damaging the long-term prospects for Cisco. We remain strongly aligned to our customers' priorities and deeply committed to delivering long-term growth. Now, I'll turn it over to Kelly.\nKelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Chuck. It really has been great, and I want to thank you, the leadership team, and really all of Cisco. I also want to thank my finance team, who has an amazing job. I'll certainly miss Cisco, but I'm looking forward to what's next. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter, then cover the full year, followed by guidance for Q1. Our overall Q4 results reflect good execution with strong margins in a very challenging environment. Total revenue was $12.2 billion, down 9%. Our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 33%, up 0.4 points. Non-GAAP net income was $3.4 billion, down 5% year over year, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.80, down 4%. Let me provide some more detail on our Q4 revenue. Total product revenue was down 13% to $8.8 billion. Infrastructure Platforms was down 16%. This is the product area most impacted by the COVID environment. We saw declines across switching, routing, data center, and wireless, driven primarily by the weakness we saw in the commercial and enterprise markets. We did see pockets of strength with the continued growth of Cat 9K, which was up double digits, and the ramp of our Wi-Fi 6 products. Data center was particularly weak with the decline of the market and DRAM price declines. Applications was down 9%. On the positive side, we saw strong double-digit growth in Webex with the importance of remote working. We also saw solid growth in AppDynamics and IoT software. This was offset by declines in Unified Communication and TP endpoints. Security was up 10%, with strong performance in network security, identity and access, advanced threat and unified threat management. Our cloud security portfolio performed well, with strong double-digit growth and continued momentum with our Duo and Umbrella offerings. Service revenue was flat for the quarter, but we had growth in our maintenance business as well as software and support services. This was offset by our advisory services, which was impacted by the COVID environment. We continued to transform our business, delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions. Software subscriptions were 78% of total software revenue, up 8 points year over year. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, at the end of Q4 were $28.4 billion, up 12%. RPO for product was up 17% and service was up 9%. The continued growth in RPO demonstrates the strength of our portfolio of software and services. In terms of orders in Q4, total product orders were down 10%. Looking at our geographies, the Americas was down 11%, EMEA was down 6%, and APJC was down 13%. Total emerging markets were down 19%, with the BRICs plus Mexico down 26%. In our customer segments, public sector was down 1%, while enterprise was down 7%. Commercial was down 23%, and service provider was down 5%. From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q4 gross margin was 65%, down 0.5 points. Product gross margin was 63.2%, down 1.5 points. And service gross margin was 69.8%, up 1.9 points year over year. Our Q4 GAAP tax rate was 16.7%, which reflects the true-ups to the annual tax rate. In terms of the bottom line, from a GAAP perspective, Q4 net income was $2.6 billion and EPS was $0.62. We ended Q4 with total cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $29.4 billion. Operating cash flow was $3.8 billion, down 4% year over year. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders through our quarterly dividend. We continued to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. Just last week we closed our acquisition of ThousandEyes. This move is consistent with our strategy of increasing investment in innovation and R&D for our growth areas. I'll now cover the full fiscal year results. We delivered strong margins and grew EPS in a very challenging environment. Revenue was $49.3 billion, down 5%. Total non-GAAP gross margin was 66%, up 1.4 points, and our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 33.8%, up 1.5 points. From a bottom line perspective, non-GAAP net income was $13.7 billion, down 1%, and non-GAAP EPS was $3.21, up 4%. GAAP net income was $11.2 billion and GAAP EPS was $2.64. We delivered operating cash flow of $15.4 billion, down 3%. Normalized for the cash received in Q1 fiscal 2019 related to the legal settlement with Arista, operating cash flow was flat for fiscal 2020. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $8.6 billion to shareholders over the fiscal year, which represents 59% of our free cash flow. That was comprised of $2.6 billion of share repurchases and $6 billion for our quarterly dividend. To summarize, we executed well in Q4 and the fiscal year with strong margins in a very challenging environment. We're seeing the returns on the investments we are making in innovation and driving the shift to more software and subscriptions, delivering long-term growth and shareholder value. Let me reiterate our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. This guidance is subject to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. We expect revenue to decline in the range of minus 9% to minus 11% year over year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 64% to 65%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 30% to 31%, and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 19%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.69 to $0.71. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A.\nMarilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Kelly. Sue, we'll now open up the queue for questions. And as a reminder, we ask the audience to address one question only so we have time to get through as many as possible. Sue, I'll turn it over to you.\nOperator: Thank you. The first question is from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. You may go ahead.\nSami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you very much. My first question is for the team here. I just wanted to know. Now that you've achieved the 50% of revenue coming from software and services, and that was the guidepost given at the 2017 Analyst Day, do you guys have a new target in mind and new range? I know you guys introduced some new products and new services and some new investment areas. I'm just hoping to understand to see if you get maybe a new roadmap or a new target that we should hold you guys or measure you against?\nCharles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Sami, thanks for the question. And it's been a pretty successful three years as we've been making this transition, and we obviously still have a ways to go, to your question, relative to a new target. We were talking about this in the last week or so, and we feel like we just need to get through this pandemic cycle that we have, and then we'll set some new targets and we'll communicate them to you at that time. So we don't have one yet.\nSami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got it, thank you.\nMarilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Sami. Next question, please?\nOperator: The next question is from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley Investment Research. You may go ahead.\nMeta A. Marshall - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, thanks. Chuck, you referred to kind of changes you were going to make to the portfolio based on conversations you were having with customers. Where do you feel like they are in terms of knowing what their kind of network architectures are looking like when they come back, or just how their budgets are looking for the remainder of the year? Thanks.\nCharles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Meta. I think that when we think about the network architectures, I think one thing we know is that our customers are living in this multi-cloud environment. And as they went into this work-from-home environment, as I said on our last call, those who had technical debt and those who had not really invested in modernizing their infrastructure, they know they will need to do that and they'll do it at different paces based on their financial abilities. I'd say that it's clear that many of our customers do want to consume the technology as a service, so we're currently looking at the entire portfolio to see how deeply we can get into the portfolio relative to delivering as a service, and I think we'll have a lot of that in the marketplace by the end of the calendar year. We will also be working with our customers on their network architectures, which are certainly going to be prevalent on or dependent upon cloud security, on SD-WAN and the integration of those, so we're going to accelerate that, as well as helping them navigate this multi-cloud world because I do think that we have seen some customers accelerate that shift as well. So the network architectures that we built 15 years ago, as I've talked about, just aren't relevant today because the traffic flows are completely different. And so we'll continue to work with customers, and I think it will be at a different pace just based on how they all come out and how they manage the pandemic.\nMeta A. Marshall - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, thanks.\nMarilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer & Company. You may go ahead.\nIttai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Chuck, when you talk about the portfolio and these changes you need to make over there and the acceleration of R&D in some areas, can you talk about more specifically what areas you feel you need the most adjustment in? And also, it feels like the pace of technology evolution clearly is just \u2013 it keeps accelerating. And there's so much of it you can do internally and you've been very acquisitive in the past, but I can't help but feel like you need to move much faster and much more aggressive on M&A. I know you've been very disciplined from a price standpoint, and clearly a market like we have today is not necessarily conducive to that. But just given the fact that we're moving much, much faster, are you more open to get a bit more aggressive here on the M&A front to fill in gaps, because it sounds like it feels like the longer you wait on this, the gaps will keep getting bigger, not smaller?\nCharles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Ittai, it's a great question. And your first question around the areas that we feel like we need to invest, I think this pandemic is basically just \u2013 it's just giving us the air cover to accelerate the transition of R&D expense into cloud security, cloud collab, away from the on-prem aspects of the portfolio. Clearly, we've got a lot of technology that we're working on today to help our customers over the next three, four, five years in this multi-cloud world that they're going to live in, and you'll see more of that come out over the next couple of years. But on the M&A question, I think that there's clearly a recognition that the valuations of the assets that are attractive have achieved different levels. And so, I think that we'll continue to be disciplined, but I would say that we're open to looking at the current world and the reality that we live in. So, I think we're open to any and all ideas and we continue to work through different options, and we have a list of potential targets that we maintain on a pretty regular basis. And so, I think the real difference is there has to be a recognition that the valuations have changed, but we'll try to be disciplined and do the right thing at the right time.\nMarilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Ittai. Sue, let's get the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Jim Suva with Citigroup Investment Research. You may go ahead.\nJim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you very much, Chuck and Kelly. And Kelly, you'll be significantly missed, so thank you for the duration. But looking forward, if my model is right, and maybe it's wrong, it seems like year-over-year revenue comparisons get materially easier, maybe to the tune of 400 basis points year-over-year for the quarter outlook. And like with Huawei being pushed out and Cisco being preferred in many countries, even beyond the United States as well as an incumbency factor coming out of coronavirus, help me bridge your kind of year-over-year revenue growth. And maybe it's still yet to come about, why things aren't more positive because the comps are easier, Huawei is less preferred and Cisco has an incumbency factor, and we're coming out of coronavirus. Thank you.\nCharles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Well, I'll comment subjectively, and then I'll let Kelly talk a little bit about the numbers. I wouldn't say that we're coming out of the coronavirus right now. I think that it feels to me very much like it felt 90 days ago. And clearly, in the US, we have not seen \u2013 we've seen some areas that have gotten better and obviously some that have not. But I'd say, in general, it feels pretty much the same as it did 90 days ago to us relative to that. I think that some of the things you're talking about around service providers around the world and the possibility where we would be getting opportunities that we wouldn't have had before, I think some of those are still to be seen, but we would share that optimism, and we'll have to wait and see how that plays out. Kelly, do you want to talk about the...\nKelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yeah, and then from the compares, I mean, Q1 of 2020, so my guide for this next quarter, in Q1 of 2021, that's our toughest compare. Obviously, we had \u2013 Q3 and Q4 were very, very tough for us in 2020 because of COVID, so comparing to Q1 of 2020 right now, we still have some tougher compares. But they do get easier as the year goes on, assuming that the pandemic ends. But as you know, Jim, we forecast based on what we see, based on the order rates, and we feel this is a pretty accurate guide.\nJim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you so much, Chuck and Kelly, for the details. And Kelly, thank you so much for your service.\nKelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Jim. I appreciate it.\nMarilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Paul Silverstein with Cowen. You may go ahead.\nPaul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe sort of a question, two clarifications. Chuck, to your response to Jim's question, when you talked about it feeling pretty much the same as 90 days ago in the US, you're referring to both enterprise and commercial, your small and medium customers as well as your large customers across the board? And then with respect to the $1 billion that you referenced in terms of coming out of costs, will that all be out of OpEx? And I appreciate there's probably some sensitivity if it involves head count reduction, as I suspect it does. But Kelly, I'm hoping you could give us a sense for the timing in that reduction and the nature of the reductions. Is that all in OpEx, or is some of it out of cost of goods sold? Thanks.\nCharles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yeah. Paul, let me just tell you a little bit \u2013 I'll give you a little sort of a customer segment and around-the-world view of what it's felt like in the last 90 days or so, so maybe that will help add a little color. In the US, in particular, I'd say we saw some strength in the very high end of enterprise. And then sort of as you go down in the marketplace, we just \u2013 the weakness got a little bit worse as you just sort of went straight down, as you would expect with small business, medium business, and even smaller-sized enterprises that didn't perform as well as the very largest of enterprises. But we did see strength in the very large enterprise in the US. We also saw some strength in federal in the US clearly, and that was actually really promising because they had a very strong quarter a year ago, so they executed really well. Service provider around the world, if you look at Asia and Europe, our service provider business was positive in both of those regions, and it was just slightly negative in the US. It was primarily Canada and Mexico in the Americas that drove the negative here. So overall, that was a bright spot, particularly outside of the United States. We did see countries, a few countries that actually began to show some positives, and I'm trying to think through like can we build a model that says Asia went in first and so they're going to come out first, and we did see Japan had a good quarter for us on the demand side. Korea had a good quarter for us on the demand side, and we're seeing some positives. Germany had a good quarter for us. And I'd say if we think about how our European team feels right now, they actually feel reasonably okay. Not great-great, but better than they did 90 days ago. The Americas is still sort of the wild card I'd say that we see right now. So hopefully that gives you a little more color around what we're seeing up and down the stack. And then, Kelly, do you want to?\nKelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Sure. Where you'll see the costs coming out, I'd say the majority of it in OpEx, I'd say maybe an 80/20 split. We'll certainly have some in COGS too on that side, on the services side, but mostly in OpEx. And in terms of timing, we should see a lot of this, most of this, the bulk of this coming out at the end of Q1 and a little bleeding over into Q2 depending on the country it's in.\nPaul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: Kelly, thank you. You'll be missed. Thanks, Chuck.\nKelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thank you, Paul. I appreciate it.\nCharles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yes, she will.\nMarilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Paul. Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead.\nRod Hall - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks for the question. I guess I wanted to go back to the linearity of this order trajectory, Chuck and Kelly, on particularly enterprise. I guess if we go back to 2009, we're starting to see commercial order volumes deteriorating into the range we saw back then in that recession. We haven't really seen enterprise do that, and I wonder whether you think that that is where we're kind of headed here. It just feels like this is not turning out to be a V-shaped recovery. It's more like we're headed into a real recession, a prolonged recession. So I'm just curious kind of what you think about the trajectory of those volumes and what they look like at the end of the quarter versus the beginning of the quarter.\nCharles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: I would say that \u2013 I'll make a couple comments and I'll kick it to Kelly to give you a little bit more color. I think that as Kelly and I looked at where we expected demand to be from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter, we were pretty much in line. In fact, it was a slight, slight, slight bit better than we had anticipated at the beginning of the quarter. But I would not get too excited about it being slightly better, as you can tell from the guide. And then I think linearity was generally in line, but it was probably a little more back-end loaded than we've seen, and we had a lot of big enterprise activity towards the end of the quarter. So, Kelly, anything to add?\nKelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: The only thing I will add, and Chuck kind of touched on this, again, it is the biggest, biggest premier enterprise accounts, they are still investing significantly and they had very good order rates. But it does \u2013 as you go down the tiers in enterprise, it did slow down, and commercial is not surprising. You saw what the commercial numbers are. So I do think it is related to they're waiting to see what comes out of the pandemic and they're pausing their spends. But I think this is why seeing the big, big accounts still investing in their digital transformation I think gives us confidence that once we do get through this, we feel good about how we'll come out of it.\nMarilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Okay, next question?\nRod Hall - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Can I have a follow-up?\nCharles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Sure.\nMarilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Go ahead.\nKelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Go ahead, Rod.\nRod Hall - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: I just wondered if you guys could talk a little bit about what sort of color you're hearing from these enterprise customers. Do you think that they've \u2013 because they're investing so aggressively in work-from-home, are they pulling demand forward out of the back end of the year? Are their budgets changing, or are they just kind of robbing from the back end of the year budgets and moving it toward the front end of the year to compensate for work-from-home and all this stuff that's going on?\nCharles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: I don't think that \u2013 I hadn't heard anything about anybody pulling anything forward. I think that the larger the companies are, the more confident they have in their ability to come out at some point, and they're going to continue to invest to position themselves when they come out. And clearly, there are some large enterprises that are not investing, depending on which industries they're in. But I think it's just normal investment cycles that certain large companies have just decided they're going to continue to pursue. And I do think Kelly made a good point. As we've given like the number of software license agreements that we did, it says that the portfolio that we have and the strategy we have, I think, whether it's helping them with application visibility as they move more to the cloud, it's going to resonate even more. When you think about the security strategy we have going to the cloud, it's going to be more required in the future. We look at this infrastructure transformation as they deal with this multi-cloud world and these new traffic flows, I think that's going to be super-relevant. And then obviously, the employee and customer experience that they have, which are all areas that we're investing in, I think when we come out of this, those will be even more in demand than they were when we went into it. We've just got to get to the other side of it, and then I feel pretty good.\nMarilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Okay. Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. You may go ahead.\nSimon Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great, thanks for taking the question, Kelly, we will miss you, and you're too young to retire.\nKelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Simon.\nSimon Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: I wanted to follow up, Chuck, on the Cat 9K, because you did mention the strength there. And I guess I'm trying to discern sort of the macro versus the product cycle issues, and my understanding is that the portfolio has been releasing platforms that are more suited for small enterprises just at the time when those are the weakest customers. So if you could, help us maybe understand the overall contributions of this product and where you are in the product cycle, and maybe even explain what's macro-related versus normal cycle-related. Thank you very much.\nCharles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Simon, I'll let Kelly talk about the numbers in a minute, but I'm going to share with you my instinct on this because I've thought about the same thing. Because the one thing that we know is that the campus business that we have, people aren't in their campus offices, so the whole notion of refresh and upgrades clearly are not top of mind for every customer the way they might have been nine months ago. However, what I think is that the 9K is for those customers who are either in the process of a real commitment to modernizing their infrastructure and they're continuing to do that, or they've made a decision and they have the financial wherewithal right now to actually embark on that, and the 9K is what they are using to do that in their campus environments. And some of them are using this opportunity with no one in their campus environments to upgrade. Clearly, that's not every customer, but I think what it says is those customers who are still on our older platforms, which we didn't see the growth on, it's sort of the story we talked about. They haven't committed to refresh, they haven't committed to that modernization piece, and so that part is not accelerating, but the 9K has continued to accelerate. So it's been a positive story for us. Kelly, do you want to...\nKelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: I think you said it well, and I think, Simon, your point as well. So the products you referenced, the Cat 9200, which was launched for the lower end, the mid to lower end, is in that commercial segment, to your point. But when I look at it individually, that product is still \u2013 revenue is growing like amazing double digits, and so that just shows that we're still very early in the transition. When the customers are buying, they are buying the new portfolio hand over fist, and it's just the COVID impact of the overall and again the legacy products falling off is really what's driving it. But that's why we have faith and feel good about the portfolio when we come out of the environment.\nCharles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Simon, I think two just comments on top of that. Number one is we still are very early in this whole process. And the 9200, I think it's important to note. It is a small business product, but it's also an access layer product in the enterprise, as it goes into branches, it goes into, in some cases, wiring closets, et cetera. So we will still see some continued demand for that.\nSimon Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thank you very much.\nMarilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Sue, let's go ahead and move to the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from James Fish with Piper Sandler. You may go ahead.\nJames E. Fish - Piper Sandler & Co.: Hey, thanks for the question, guys, and congrats on the retirement there, Kelly.\nKelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, James.\nJames E. Fish - Piper Sandler & Co.: For me, I want to bridge a few of the questions that have been asked together. But Chuck, you talked about accelerating the transition towards SaaS. Can you guys give us an update as to where that SaaS revenue is, not the term license contribution, and where you guys think it could accelerate given the investments? And then utilizing Ittai's question from before, do you need to acquire to help accelerate it?\nCharles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Well, I'll let Kelly answer the numbers question. We gave you the total software number and we gave you the percent that's coming from subscriptions and SaaS, but I think you're asking specifically about SaaS. And look, I think that we've made a lot of progress. If you do the math on where the software in our portfolio was five years ago and what percentage of it was coming from subscription and SaaS, I don't know, we've certainly increased it significantly over the last four or five years without any major, major revenue-driving acquisitions. So, that would certainly help. And we continue \u2013 as I said earlier, continue to look at alternatives in that space. And you should assume that we will continue to look at them, but we'll also be disciplined. So, Kelly, you want to touch on the SaaS numbers or...?\nKelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, we don't disclose the total SaaS number. Again, it's made up of our Webex business, a lot of our portfolio, Duo and Umbrella and security. And again, acquisition, Meraki is a hybrid where we ship an appliance, but then it has the SaaS management, and things like ThousandEyes that we're adding to our networking portfolio and AppDynamics, I mean, that's just going to continue to accelerate. So, I think you're going to see it twofold, right? You're going to continue to see us to be \u2013 those are the type of assets that we have been acquiring and will continue to acquire, and you're seeing internally this is also how we are developing product to try to accelerate that. But the growth in the SaaS portfolio has been really good for us.\nJames E. Fish - Piper Sandler & Co.: Understood. Appreciate the color, and congrats again, Kelly.\nKelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, James.\nMarilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Jeff Kvaal with Wolfe Research. You may go ahead.\nJeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Wolfe Research LLC: Thank you very much and my congratulations again, Kelly. We look forward to seeing you in a new role at some point down the road. I have a question and a clarification. I think the question, Chuck, last quarter you spent a little bit of time talking with us about traction on the webscale side of things. I'm wondering if that traction has seen some follow-through, if you could update us on that. And then, secondly, for Kelly, you suggest that the OpEx will come lower by $800 million. Is that a gross number or is that a net number; i.e., you'll take it out by $800 million, but bring some back in the some of the growthier areas in business? Thank you.\nCharles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yeah. Jeff, thanks for asking the question. I would have been in trouble if I'd gotten off this call and not talked about webscale. So, we saw another positive quarter, so that's one of the areas that was really positive for us. It was the third quarter in a row where we've had double-digit growth with the webscale players. And again, as I said last quarter, we have had some traction with the 8K, some traction with our silicon, but nothing that's meaningfully moving the numbers yet. So, it really is just the rest of the portfolio. But as I said, I think it speaks to the long-term effort that we've put in over the last few years of rebuilding these relationships, and I think it speaks to their belief in our strategy going forward. And we feel good about where we are, and we believe over the next one to two years that they'll begin to be meaningful contributors, and we're excited about what the teams have done.\nKelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: And on the cost-out, so again, we are taking out gross over $1 billion, so that is gross. But like anything, Jeff, there's puts and takes as we go forward, so whether it's things like the dollars, weaker FX, it's going to be a bit of a headwind this year, we reset the bonus, all that kind of stuff, that will be puts and takes. But that's a real cost-out that we're taking out as we go through and do our planning.\nJeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay. Got it. Thank you both very much.\nKelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yeah.\nMarilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Jeff. Sue, I think we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question is from George Notter with Jefferies. You may go ahead.\nGeorge C. Notter - Jefferies LLC: Hi, guys. Thanks very much. I guess I wanted to kind of go back to the discussion of moving more of the business to a as-a-service model. And could you just put a little bit more meat on the bone in terms of what areas are you specifically thinking about as new candidates to kind of move that direction? And how do you incentivize customers in those areas also? I'm just trying to think about the mechanics of how this works. And then congrats to Kelly also. Thanks.\nCharles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Literally, we're looking at everything. We're trying to \u2013 we're looking at everything from our compute portfolio to clearly our software assets are already in the midst of that transition, and many of them are already being sold that way. And we're even looking at how we deliver our traditional networking hardware as a service over time. So it is literally across the portfolio. And we see an acceleration of some of the work that's already been underway. Obviously, the collaboration portfolio has been transitioning to as-a-service for quite a while. We even launched last, I don't know, two, three quarters ago, we launched our hardware-as-a-service in the collaboration portfolio as a pilot. And we've been working hard on all the operational capabilities and the systems work that needs to be done to do that. So it literally is across the entire portfolio, and we'll give you an update on the next call for sure.\nMarilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: All right, I believe that was our last question. Thanks, George. I'll turn it back to you, Chuck.\nCharles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: All right, I just want to recap and just thank first of all Kelly for everything and the friendship and all the great work that you've done and reiterate that she's going to stay with us until we actually identify her successor, and she'll help advise us through that process. So we're excited about her sticking around and helping us do that. I want to thank the team for executing through a really challenging time. And I really want to reiterate that I think that the strategy that we had going in, I believe when we come out of the pandemic, will be more relevant to our customers than it was six, nine months ago. So I'm optimistic about the future, and we're going to continue to execute through this. And thank you all for joining us today.\nMarilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Great. Thank you, Chuck. Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call, which will reflect our fiscal 2021 first quarter results, will be on Thursday, November 12, 2020 at 1:30 PM Pacific Time, 4:30 PM Eastern Time.

            "content": "Thanks, Chuck. It really has been great, and I want to thank you, the leadership team, and really all of Cisco. I also want to thank my finance team, who has an amazing job. I'll certainly miss Cisco, but I'm looking forward to what's next. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter, then cover the full year, followed by guidance for Q1. Our overall Q4 results reflect good execution with strong margins in a very challenging environment. Total revenue was $12.2 billion, down 9%. Our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 33%, up 0.4 points. Non-GAAP net income was $3.4 billion, down 5% year over year, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.80, down 4%. Let me provide some more detail on our Q4 revenue. Total product revenue was down 13% to $8.8 billion. Infrastructure Platforms was down 16%. This is the product area most impacted by the COVID environment. We saw declines across switching, routing, data center, and wireless, driven primarily by the weakness we saw in the commercial and enterprise markets. We did see pockets of strength with the continued growth of Cat 9K, which was up double digits, and the ramp of our Wi-Fi 6 products. Data center was particularly weak with the decline of the market and DRAM price declines. Applications was down 9%. On the positive side, we saw strong double-digit growth in Webex with the importance of remote working. We also saw solid growth in AppDynamics and IoT software. This was offset by declines in Unified Communication and TP endpoints. Security was up 10%, with strong performance in network security, identity and access, advanced threat and unified threat management. Our cloud security portfolio performed well, with strong double-digit growth and continued momentum with our Duo and Umbrella offerings. Service revenue was flat for the quarter, but we had growth in our maintenance business as well as software and support services. This was offset by our advisory services, which was impacted by the COVID environment. We continued to transform our business, delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions. Software subscriptions were 78% of total software revenue, up 8 points year over year. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, at the end of Q4 were $28.4 billion, up 12%. RPO for product was up 17% and service was up 9%. The continued growth in RPO demonstrates the strength of our portfolio of software and services. In terms of orders in Q4, total product orders were down 10%. Looking at our geographies, the Americas was down 11%, EMEA was down 6%, and APJC was down 13%. Total emerging markets were down 19%, with the BRICs plus Mexico down 26%. In our customer segments, public sector was down 1%, while enterprise was down 7%. Commercial was down 23%, and service provider was down 5%. From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q4 gross margin was 65%, down 0.5 points. Product gross margin was 63.2%, down 1.5 points. And service gross margin was 69.8%, up 1.9 points year over year. Our Q4 GAAP tax rate was 16.7%, which reflects the true-ups to the annual tax rate. In terms of the bottom line, from a GAAP perspective, Q4 net income was $2.6 billion and EPS was $0.62. We ended Q4 with total cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $29.4 billion. Operating cash flow was $3.8 billion, down 4% year over year. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders through our quarterly dividend. We continued to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. Just last week we closed our acquisition of ThousandEyes. This move is consistent with our strategy of increasing investment in innovation and R&D for our growth areas. I'll now cover the full fiscal year results. We delivered strong margins and grew EPS in a very challenging environment. Revenue was $49.3 billion, down 5%. Total non-GAAP gross margin was 66%, up 1.4 points, and our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 33.8%, up 1.5 points. From a bottom line perspective, non-GAAP net income was $13.7 billion, down 1%, and non-GAAP EPS was $3.21, up 4%. GAAP net income was $11.2 billion and GAAP EPS was $2.64. We delivered operating cash flow of $15.4 billion, down 3%. Normalized for the cash received in Q1 fiscal 2019 related to the legal settlement with Arista, operating cash flow was flat for fiscal 2020. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $8.6 billion to shareholders over the fiscal year, which represents 59% of our free cash flow. That was comprised of $2.6 billion of share repurchases and $6 billion for our quarterly dividend. To summarize, we executed well in Q4 and the fiscal year with strong margins in a very challenging environment. We're seeing the returns on the investments we are making in innovation and driving the shift to more software and subscriptions, delivering long-term growth and shareholder value. Let me reiterate our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. This guidance is subject to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. We expect revenue to decline in the range of minus 9% to minus 11% year over year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 64% to 65%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 30% to 31%, and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 19%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.69 to $0.71. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A. Yeah, and then from the compares, I mean, Q1 of 2020, so my guide for this next quarter, in Q1 of 2021, that's our toughest compare. Obviously, we had \u2013 Q3 and Q4 were very, very tough for us in 2020 because of COVID, so comparing to Q1 of 2020 right now, we still have some tougher compares. But they do get easier as the year goes on, assuming that the pandemic ends. But as you know, Jim, we forecast based on what we see, based on the order rates, and we feel this is a pretty accurate guide. Thanks, Jim. I appreciate it. Sure. Where you'll see the costs coming out, I'd say the majority of it in OpEx, I'd say maybe an 80/20 split. We'll certainly have some in COGS too on that side, on the services side, but mostly in OpEx. And in terms of timing, we should see a lot of this, most of this, the bulk of this coming out at the end of Q1 and a little bleeding over into Q2 depending on the country it's in. Thank you, Paul. I appreciate it. The only thing I will add, and Chuck kind of touched on this, again, it is the biggest, biggest premier enterprise accounts, they are still investing significantly and they had very good order rates. But it does \u2013 as you go down the tiers in enterprise, it did slow down, and commercial is not surprising. You saw what the commercial numbers are.

Go ahead, Rod. Thanks, Simon. I think you said it well, and I think, Simon, your point as well.

            "name": "Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.",
            "content": "Thank you, Marilyn. We hope all of you and your families are staying safe and healthy. Our thoughts remain with everyone who has been affected by the pandemic, and we are grateful to those who remain on the front lines working to help those impacted during these challenging times. As we've been preparing for this call, it's offered me some time to reflect on what we've achieved since I stepped into this role five years ago. Through the hard work of everyone at Cisco, we have undergone a significant transformation in the midst of some of the most complex times in our history. I am so proud of what our teams have accomplished. They have demonstrated resiliency, determination, and compassion as we delivered on our financial commitments, brought market-leading innovation to our customers, transitioned our business model, and driven a culture that has truly shined over the past six months. The Cisco of today is more agile, innovative, and focused. Through both organic and inorganic innovation, we delivered incredible new technology with new, more flexible consumption offers for our customers with more software and subscriptions. At our Financial Analyst Conference in 2017, we laid out key metrics for our transformation. We set a goal of 30% of our revenue to come from software. And while we achieved 29% in fiscal year 2020, we did achieve 31% in Q4. We also delivered 51% of our revenue from software and services in FY 2020, exceeding our target of 50%. Lastly, we now have 78% of our software revenue sold as subscription, beating our target of 66%. With our customers as our guide, we have successfully executed against our strategy to help them transform and modernize their organizations. We launched our intent-based networking architecture using automation and machine learning to help our customers drive simplicity and cost-effective management of their networks. As customers move more workloads to the cloud, we're offering fast, highly secure access to applications hosted anywhere, in the private data center, public cloud, or a SaaS platform, with our cloud security integrated with our SD-WAN solution. We introduced new capabilities across software, silicon, and optics to help bring to life the Internet for the future. The innovation we've driven in our security portfolio has helped us become the top enterprise security company in the world. With Webex, we have the most trusted secure platform for remote collaboration for the enterprise, and we're also delivering real-time insights for customers in their multi-cloud environments to optimize user experience with our insights and observability assets like AppDynamics. Over the past few years, this transition has resulted in improvements in our financial performance, including expanding margins and demonstrating continued financial discipline. Once again, I want to thank our teams for what we've achieved. If the past year has taught us anything, it's the need to always be nimble. I believe that the changes we've made to our business now put us in a position of strength as we focus on our future. We're a company that embraces change, and we've shown our ability to thrive in any environment. The past six months have unquestionably reshaped our world. Industries, governments, and work have changed dramatically, and many of these changes will become permanent. At Cisco, we are committed to helping our customers truly digitize their organizations for the future, regardless of the challenges or fundamental shifts that we may face. Like many other organizations, we've also had the opportunity to reexamine our business and our portfolio for this new world. As I said last quarter, we were going to take time to better understand the short and long-term implications of COVID-19, and we now believe we have a better view. Based on the many conversations we've had with our customers around the world, we believe we have perspective into how they will adapt their technology strategies for the future to ensure greater resiliency, agility, and innovation. We know how to adapt our business's strategy to align with where our customers are headed. The changes we are making to our business reflect how we are leveraging our existing strengths, investing for growth, and unlocking new opportunities. We will also be very disciplined on our cost structure, as we always have been. Over the next few quarters, we will be taking out over $1 billion on an annualized basis to reduce our cost structure. At the same time, we're going to rebalance our R&D investments to focus on key areas that will position us well for the future. More specifically, we will accelerate the transition of the majority of our portfolio to be delivered as a service. We will also accelerate our investments in the following areas: cloud security; cloud collaboration; key enhancements for education, healthcare, and other industries; increased automation in the enterprise; the future of work; and application insights and analytics. At the same time, we will continue our focus in the following areas, many of which have been accelerated by the pandemic: multi-cloud investment; 5G and Wi-Fi 6; 400-gig; optical networking; next-generation silicon; AI; and more. These investments will help define the next phase of our transformation and allow us to bring the best, most relevant innovation to our customers in simpler, more easily consumables ways. I am confident that, once again, we have the right strategy that will deliver what our customers need from us, and we will emerge from this challenging time as a stronger company than before. Now, let me discuss our performance in the quarter. While our results reflect the ongoing challenges in the current environment, we executed well. As you would expect, the pandemic has had the most impact on our enterprise and commercial orders, driven by an overall slowdown in spending. We are seeing customers continue to delay their purchasing decisions in certain areas, while increasing spend in others until they have greater visibility and clarity on the timing and shape of the global economic recovery. Despite this challenging economic environment, the pandemic has also triggered a massive and rapid shift to remote operations and automation to maximize personal safety. With this, many customers are increasingly reliant on our broad portfolio of technologies, resulting in another quarter of strong demand for our Catalyst 9000, security, Webex, and other SaaS-based solutions. Throughout fiscal year 2020, we demonstrated operational resilience based on our strong customer relationships, a solid financial foundation, differentiated innovation, and a compelling strategic transformation built on the strength of our key technology platforms. Now, I'll cover a few highlights from the quarter. In June, we introduced an expanded business resiliency portfolio offering healthcare and education solutions with simpler consumption models and services to accelerate adoption. We will continue to expand this portfolio to cover areas such as social distancing in the workplace, effective virtual employee engagement at scale, and pop-up connected clinics. Within our Infrastructure Platforms business, we continue to see a strong ramp of our Catalyst 9K portfolio as many customers take advantage of their employees working from home to refresh their aging infrastructure, enabling them to simplify, secure, and automate the management of their networks. Our acquisition of ThousandEyes will complement these capabilities by adding deeper and broader visibility and analytics across networks and applications, enabling us to deliver the best possible experiences for our customers. By integrating their SaaS-based offering with our AppDynamics application intelligence portfolio and SD-WAN technology, we can provide unparalleled intelligence and insights at cloud scale, driving improved customer experience as well as reliability of their applications. Security continues to be a top priority for our customers, particularly in this distributed digital world. Our ability to connect and protect our customers working from anywhere, on any device, is accelerating the adoption of our comprehensive security portfolio, resulting in double-digit revenue growth this quarter. As more data goes to the cloud and users become more distributed, we had good momentum in our cloud security solutions, protecting workloads, applications, and data. We also continue to expand our capabilities to enable simplification and automation of our customer security infrastructure. A good example of this is our SecureX platform, which is designed to unify visibility, enable automation, and deliver a consistent experience. Since our launch six weeks ago, we have over 2,100 active daily customers, two-thirds of which have two or more products active. We're also delivering Secure Remote Worker solutions that span our endpoint security portfolio combined with the power of our Zero Trust Architecture with Duo, AnyConnect, Umbrella, and AMP for Endpoints. Applications have become a lifeline for so many organizations, and this has only increased over the past few months. As organizations define what their future looks like, our collaboration technology will play a key role in evolving how they work, transact, and connect. Webex had strong performance this quarter with double-digit growth, as businesses, governments, educators, and front-line workers everywhere have embraced remote work. We expect this momentum to continue, as we have begun to see the conversion of free trials into paid subscriptions. AppDynamics also achieved another solid quarter. These monitoring tools offer our customers great value by providing real-time insights from a single pane of glass to optimize user experience in their multi-cloud environments. As we think about all that we've achieved over the past five years, I want to take a moment to acknowledge Kelly Kramer, our Chief Financial Officer, who has been an incredible partner to me. She has played a key role in reshaping Cisco into the company we are today. I want to let you all know that Kelly has made the decision to retire from Cisco. Over her 8-plus years here, Kelly has led the effort to improve our financial performance, focused on investor confidence, and helped position Cisco for success. Kelly and I have been focused on simple, clear communication, absolute transparency, delivering on our commitments, and always aligning Cisco for future growth. Kelly has graciously agreed to stay on as CFO until we have her successor on board and will advise us with a succession process. I can assure you that, with Kelly staying on during the search and with our world-class finance team, we will have a seamless transition. Kelly, thank you so much for your partnership and your friendship. You will truly be missed. Now, before I turn it over to Kelly, I want to reiterate my confidence for what the future holds. Over the past five years, we have not shied away from making bold moves to position us for long-term growth, and now is no different. We are committed to running a strong business as well as leveraging technology for good to solve the world's biggest challenges and create new opportunities for the future. As we've demonstrated, we have helped our customers build resiliency in difficult environments, through industry disruptions, and in times of rapid growth. We will also continue to use our position to make our communities and world a better place. Whether it's tackling the global health pandemic or social injustice and intolerance, we are committed to our purpose of powering an inclusive future for all. As we start a new fiscal year, I believe we have incredible opportunities in front of us. We will navigate the pandemic in the most effective way possible while not damaging the long-term prospects for Cisco. We remain strongly aligned to our customers' priorities and deeply committed to delivering long-term growth. Now, I'll turn it over to Kelly. Sami, thanks for the question. And it's been a pretty successful three years as we've been making this transition, and we obviously still have a ways to go, to your question, relative to a new target. We were talking about this in the last week or so, and we feel like we just need to get through this pandemic cycle that we have, and then we'll set some new targets and we'll communicate them to you at that time. So we don't have one yet.\nSami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got it, thank you. Thanks, Meta. I think that when we think about the network architectures, I think one thing we know is that our customers are living in this multi-cloud environment. And as they went into this work-from-home environment, as I said on our last call, those who had technical debt and those who had not really invested in modernizing their infrastructure, they know they will need to do that and they'll do it at different paces based on their financial abilities. I'd say that it's clear that many of our customers do want to consume the technology as a service, so we're currently looking at the entire portfolio to see how deeply we can get into the portfolio relative to delivering as a service, and I think we'll have a lot of that in the marketplace by the end of the calendar year. We will also be working with our customers on their network architectures, which are certainly going to be prevalent on or dependent upon cloud security, on SD-WAN and the integration of those, so we're going to accelerate that, as well as helping them navigate this multi-cloud world because I do think that we have seen some customers accelerate that shift as well. So the network architectures that we built 15 years ago, as I've talked about, just aren't relevant today because the traffic flows are completely different. And so we'll continue to work with customers, and I think it will be at a different pace just based on how they all come out and how they manage the pandemic. Ittai, it's a great question. And your first question around the areas that we feel like we need to invest, I think this pandemic is basically just \u2013 it's just giving us the air cover to accelerate the transition of R&D expense into cloud security, cloud collab, away from the on-prem aspects of the portfolio. Clearly, we've got a lot of technology that we're working on today to help our customers over the next three, four, five years in this multi-cloud world that they're going to live in, and you'll see more of that come out over the next couple of years. But on the M&A question, I think that there's clearly a recognition that the valuations of the assets that are attractive have achieved different levels. And so, I think that we'll continue to be disciplined, but I would say that we're open to looking at the current world and the reality that we live in. So, I think we're open to any and all ideas and we continue to work through different options, and we have a list of potential targets that we maintain on a pretty regular basis. And so, I think the real difference is there has to be a recognition that the valuations have changed, but we'll try to be disciplined and do the right thing at the right time. Well, I'll comment subjectively, and then I'll let Kelly talk a little bit about the numbers. I wouldn't say that we're coming out of the coronavirus right now. I think that it feels to me very much like it felt 90 days ago. And clearly, in the US, we have not seen \u2013 we've seen some areas that have gotten better and obviously some that have not. But I'd say, in general, it feels pretty much the same as it did 90 days ago to us relative to that. I think that some of the things you're talking about around service providers around the world and the possibility where we would be getting opportunities that we wouldn't have had before, I think some of those are still to be seen, but we would share that optimism, and we'll have to wait and see how that plays out. Kelly, do you want to talk about the... Yeah. Paul, let me just tell you a little bit \u2013 I'll give you a little sort of a customer segment and around-the-world view of what it's felt like in the last 90 days or so, so maybe that will help add a little color. In the US, in particular, I'd say we saw some strength in the very high end of enterprise. And then sort of as you go down in the marketplace, we just \u2013 the weakness got a little bit worse as you just sort of went straight down, as you would expect with small business, medium business, and even smaller-sized enterprises that didn't perform as well as the very largest of enterprises. But we did see strength in the very large enterprise in the US. We also saw some strength in federal in the US clearly, and that was actually really promising because they had a very strong quarter a year ago, so they executed really well. Service provider around the world, if you look at Asia and Europe, our service provider business was positive in both of those regions, and it was just slightly negative in the US. It was primarily Canada and Mexico in the Americas that drove the negative here. So overall, that was a bright spot, particularly outside of the United States. We did see countries, a few countries that actually began to show some positives, and I'm trying to think through like can we build a model that says Asia went in first and so they're going to come out first, and we did see Japan had a good quarter for us on the demand side. Korea had a good quarter for us on the demand side, and we're seeing some positives. Germany had a good quarter for us. And I'd say if we think about how our European team feels right now, they actually feel reasonably okay. Not great-great, but better than they did 90 days ago. The Americas is still sort of the wild card I'd say that we see right now. So hopefully that gives you a little more color around what we're seeing up and down the stack. And then, Kelly, do you want to? Yes, she will. I would say that \u2013 I'll make a couple comments and I'll kick it to Kelly to give you a little bit more color. I think that as Kelly and I looked at where we expected demand to be from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter, we were pretty much in line. In fact, it was a slight, slight, slight bit better than we had anticipated at the beginning of the quarter. But I would not get too excited about it being slightly better, as you can tell from the guide. And then I think linearity was generally in line, but it was probably a little more back-end loaded than we've seen, and we had a lot of big enterprise activity towards the end of the quarter. So, Kelly, anything to add? Sure. I don't think that \u2013 I hadn't heard anything about anybody pulling anything forward. I think that the larger the companies are, the more confident they have in their ability to come out at some point, and they're going to continue to invest to position themselves when they come out. And clearly, there are some large enterprises that are not investing, depending on which industries they're in. But I think it's just normal investment cycles that certain large companies have just decided they're going to continue to pursue. And I do think Kelly made a good point. As we've given like the number of software license agreements that we did, it says that the portfolio that we have and the strategy we have, I think, whether it's helping them with application visibility as they move more to the cloud, it's going to resonate even more. When you think about the security strategy we have going to the cloud, it's going to be more required in the future. We look at this infrastructure transformation as they deal with this multi-cloud world and these new traffic flows, I think that's going to be super-relevant. And then obviously, the employee and customer experience that they have, which are all areas that we're investing in, I think when we come out of this, those will be even more in demand than they were when we went into it. We've just got to get to the other side of it, and then I feel pretty good. Simon, I'll let Kelly talk about the numbers in a minute, but I'm going to share with you my instinct on this because I've thought about the same thing. Because the one thing that we know is that the campus business that we have, people aren't in their campus offices, so the whole notion of refresh and upgrades clearly are not top of mind for every customer the way they might have been nine months ago. However, what I think is that the 9K is for those customers who are either in the process of a real commitment to modernizing their infrastructure and they're continuing to do that, or they've made a decision and they have the financial wherewithal right now to actually embark on that, and the 9K is what they are using to do that in their campus environments. And some of them are using this opportunity with no one in their campus environments to upgrade. Clearly, that's not every customer, but I think what it says is those customers who are still on our older platforms, which we didn't see the growth on, it's sort of the story we talked about. They haven't committed to refresh, they haven't committed to that modernization piece, and so that part is not accelerating, but the 9K has continued to accelerate. So it's been a positive story for us. Kelly, do you want to... Simon, I think two just comments on top of that. Number one is we still are very early in this whole process. And the 9200, I think it's important to note. It is a small business product, but it's also an access layer product in the enterprise, as it goes into branches, it goes into, in some cases, wiring closets, et cetera. So we will still see some continued demand for that. Well, I'll let Kelly answer the numbers question. We gave you the total software number and we gave you the percent that's coming from subscriptions and SaaS, but I think you're asking specifically about SaaS. And look, I think that we've made a lot of progress. If you do the math on where the software in our portfolio was five years ago and what percentage of it was coming from subscription and SaaS, I don't know, we've certainly increased it significantly over the last four or five years without any major, major revenue-driving acquisitions. So, that would certainly help. And we continue \u2013 as I said earlier, continue to look at alternatives in that space. And you should assume that we will continue to look at them, but we'll also be disciplined. So, Kelly, you want to touch on the SaaS numbers or...? Yeah. Jeff, thanks for asking the question. I would have been in trouble if I'd gotten off this call and not talked about webscale. So, we saw another positive quarter, so that's one of the areas that was really positive for us. It was the third quarter in a row where we've had double-digit growth with the webscale players. And again, as I said last quarter, we have had some traction with the 8K, some traction with our silicon, but nothing that's meaningfully moving the numbers yet. So, it really is just the rest of the portfolio. But as I said, I think it speaks to the long-term effort that we've put in over the last few years of rebuilding these relationships, and I think it speaks to their belief in our strategy going forward. And we feel good about where we are, and we believe over the next one to two years that they'll begin to be meaningful contributors, and we're excited about what the teams have done. Literally, we're looking at everything. We're trying to \u2013 we're looking at everything from our compute portfolio to clearly our software assets are already in the midst of that transition, and many of them are already being sold that way. And we're even looking at how we deliver our traditional networking hardware as a service over time. So it is literally across the portfolio. And we see an acceleration of some of the work that's already been underway. Obviously, the collaboration portfolio has been transitioning to as-a-service for quite a while. We even launched last, I don't know, two, three quarters ago, we launched our hardware-as-a-service in the collaboration portfolio as a pilot. And we've been working hard on all the operational capabilities and the systems work that needs to be done to do that. So it literally is across the entire portfolio, and we'll give you an update on the next call for sure. All right, I just want to recap and just thank first of all Kelly for everything and the friendship and all the great work that you've done and reiterate that she's going to stay with us until we actually identify her successor, and she'll help advise us through that process. So we're excited about her sticking around and helping us do that. I want to thank the team for executing through a really challenging time. And I really want to reiterate that I think that the strategy that we had going in, I believe when we come out of the pandemic, will be more relevant to our customers than it was six, nine months ago. So I'm optimistic about the future, and we're going to continue to execute through this. And thank you all for joining us today."

If you have any objections you may disconnect. Now, I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am you may begin.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Michelle.

Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during this quarter or during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. Chuck, I'll now turn it over to you.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks Marilyn. Before we get started, I want to express my gratitude and appreciation for all the frontline workers who are fighting this pandemic every day to keep so many safe. I also want to express my sympathies for those who have lost their lives and the families that have endured the deepest pains from the impact of this tragic situation we are in today. This truly is unlike anything, any of us have ever experienced. As you can imagine, we have been focused on helping our employee\u2019s, customer\u2019s, partners and communities. We currently have 95% of our global workforce working from home, which was a seamless transition for us, as we already had a flexible work policy. And we build the technologies that allow organizations to stay connected, secure and productive. For those 5% who must be in the office to do the roles, we are clearly focused on their health and safety and are taking all of the necessary precautions. During the crisis, many of our customers and partners have been under enormous pressure as they face cash flow challenges. This is why we introduced a variety of free offers and trials for our Webex and security technologies as they dramatically shifted entire workforces to be remote. In addition, we announced $2.5 billion in financing with a new Business Resiliency Program through Cisco Capital to offer financial flexibility and support their business continuity. This will help customers and partner\u2019s access to technology they need now, invest for recovery and defer most of the payments until early 2021. This pandemic is highlighting so many inequities that already existed and is exacerbating these problems. I'm proud to say that Cisco has committed nearly $300 million to date to support both global and local pandemic response efforts, including providing technology and financial support for non-profits, first responders and governments. We are also donating personal protective equipment to hospital workers, including N-95 masks and face shields, 3D printed by Cisco volunteers around the world. I'm so proud of our teams who have been relentlessly focused on these efforts and continuing to identify how we can be innovative to help those most in need. I particularly like to call out our IT, Webex, security and supply chain teams, along with our partners and suppliers who have been working around the clock to ensure we are doing all that we can to keep organizations around the world up and running and giving back to our communities. Thank you. Now, turning to our third quarter performance. Despite the challenging environment we are all operating in, we delivered a solid quarter and financial performance in the midst of the greatest financial crisis of our lifetime. While we are not immune to the impacts of the global pandemic, we believe our underlying business fundamentals and financial position remains strong. As we look at the quarter it very much reflected the journey of the pandemic. In March, we were performing ahead of our expectations, as companies focused on building resiliency in their IT environments. Then in April we began to see a slowdown across the business, as countries across the world were locked down. While parts of our portfolio have been more impacted than others, we believe our leadership from a product, innovation and operational perspective remains solid. While there is so much uncertainty now, we believe our role has never been more important and our responsibility has never been greater, as much of the world is running on Cisco's technology from networking to collaboration to security to stay connected, secure and productive. Organizations more than ever must focus on resiliency and agility and those who had invested in digital capabilities were able to make this shift more seamlessly. While we cannot predict when it's going to happen, one thing we believe is that the demand for our products and services will be strong when we emerge from this situation. We believe the transition in our own business model through our shift to more software and subscription-based offerings is paying off. We saw continued strong adoption of our SaaS-based offerings and now have 74% of our software that is subscription versus 65% a year ago. We also believe, we remain well positioned over the long-term to serve our customers and create differentiated value aligned to cloud, 5G, Wi-Fi 6 and 400 gig. Our business model, diversified portfolio and ability to continue to invest in key growth priorities gives us a strong foundation to build even stronger customer relationships. As we prepare for the future, we will closely partner with our customers to modernize their infrastructure, secure their remote workforce and their data through our innovative solutions that will serve as the foundation for their digital organizations. Next, I'll turn to the performance of our business segments, starting with infrastructure platforms. With the world going online practically overnight, the demand on networks has never been greater, with users looking for secure connectivity, reliable performance and consistent experiences. This has led to our customers evaluating how to expand their capacity quickly, how best to protect their teams and how to keep their data secure, while keeping their business productive. It is also requiring enterprise IT to rapidly setup, deploy and provision mobile offices or mobile healthcare clinics. What I've seen IT teams do around the world and what they've made possible is simply astonishing. Our strategy and value proposition are clear. We are powering the world's ability to stay connected, productive and secure, while automating many of these capabilities. Our intent-based networking architecture was built for environments like this. For industries like healthcare, public services, financial services and service providers especially, having network infrastructure tightly integrated with security is mission-critical. In Q3 we offered new cloud-based COVID-19 bundles for teleworker, mobile healthcare and pop-up branch use cases through our partners and service providers. As customers modernize their network infrastructure, we saw continued strong customer adoption of our subscription-based Catalyst 9000, as customers look to quickly scale remote access capabilities to keep their employees safe and their businesses running. We continue to execute on our secure cloud scale SD-WAN strategy by investing in innovation and partnerships to help enterprises accelerate their multi-cloud strategies. As an example, we are now integrating with our Umbrella secure Internet gateway to give our customers flexibility to use best of breed cloud security with our industry leading SD-WAN solution. Our partnerships across web scale providers like AWS, Azure and our most recent announcement with Google Cloud allow us to offer a truly multi-cloud network fabric. As bandwidth and SaaS application demand increases, we are enabling our customers to securely connect branches and interconnect to different cloud providers to enable consistent application performance and user experience. Moving on to security, which is always at the heart of everything we do. In Q3, we saw solid growth, reflecting increased demand for our robust solutions to secure the rapid growth in remote workers and their devices. Being the largest enterprise security company in the world, we are uniquely positioned to safeguard our customers wherever they work. We have the most comprehensive and integrated end-to-end portfolio in the industry across the network, cloud, applications and endpoints. As I mentioned earlier, we provided extended free licenses for key security technologies that are designed to protect remote workers, including Cisco Umbrella, Zero Trust Security from Duo, industry-leading secure network access from Cisco AnyConnect and end point protection from our AMP technology. We are also supporting our customers on their multi-cloud journey by enabling them to secure direct internet access, cloud application usage and roaming users. We are only two quarters into our secure Internet gateway transition and we are already seeing strong adoption from existing and new customers. Building on the investments we made in innovation partnerships and acquisitions, we also introduced SecureX. This is the industry's broadest cloud-based security platform, connecting the breadth of our portfolio and our customer\u2019s security infrastructure by providing unified visibility, automation and simplified security across applications, the network endpoints and the cloud. Turning to applications. Teleworking and collaboration tools have become a lifeline for businesses and their people to stay connected and productive, with security and privacy being more critical than ever. Our portfolios at the center of our customer strategy for empowering teams and increasing productivity, as 95% of the Fortune 500 use our collaboration portfolio today. We take a security first approach to remote working and provide highly secure cloud-based collaboration solutions with integrated end-to end-encryption, while protecting our customer\u2019s privacy. Throughout the quarter, we invested in scaling our platform at an unparalleled speed to deliver a highly secure consistent experience and ensuring business continuity for our customers. We are now running our Webex platform at three times the capacity we were running at in February to manage the dramatic increase in usage growth. We had well over 500 million meeting participants, generating 25 billion meeting minutes in April, more than tripled the volume in February. We also added many new prospects through free Webex trials that we anticipate converting to revenue in the future. With applications at the core of every business and the surge in demand for monitoring tools that provide real time business insights and optimize user experiences in multi-cloud environments, AppDynamics continues to perform well, particularly in this environment. As I wrap up, I just want to reiterate how grateful I am to have our teams, our resources and our operational resiliency during this time. I also want to commend the heroic efforts of IT organizations and teams around the world who have had to digitize their operations and support remote workforces at an unprecedented speed and scale. This crisis has highlighted the importance of having highly resilient, globally scalable infrastructure technologies to keep the world running and this is what we build. We are providing an innovative solutions that help our customer support business continuity, drive productivity and ensure a highly secure work environment. We believe we will emerge from this crisis stronger than before. With our accelerated innovation cycle, refresh portfolio and significant progress on our shift to more software and subscriptions, we are in a better position today than in past times of uncertainty. Our confidence is further supported by our strong balance sheet to invest for the future and our proven ability to execute no matter the environment. I also believe our incredible culture has been amplified during this time and I'm so proud of what our teams have achieved. I am confident Cisco is resilient and we are built to last, regardless of what the future brings. Kelly. I'll now turn it over to you.\nKelly Kramer: Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter, followed by guidance for Q4. Our overall Q3 results reflect good execution with strong margins and non-GAAP EPS growth in a very challenging environment. COVID-19 did have an impact on our financial results and business operations this quarter, especially in our supply chain where we saw manufacturing challenges and component constraints. Total revenue was $12 billion, down 8%. Our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 34.9%, up 2.7 points. Non-GAAP net income was $3.4 billion, down 2% year-over-year and non-GAAP EPS was $0.79, up 1%. Let me provide some more detail on our Q3 revenue. Total product revenue was down 12% to $8.6 billion. Infrastructure platforms was down 15%. This is the area that was most impacted by the supply chain challenges. Switching revenue declined in both Campus and Data Center. We did see strong growth with the continued ramp of the Cat 9K. Routing decline in both service provider and in enterprise. Data Center revenue decline driven by continued market contraction impacting both our servers and HyperFlex offerings. Wireless declined overall, but we did see strength in the ramp of our Wi-Fi 6 products and solid growth in Meraki. Applications was down 5%, driven by a decline in Unified Communications and TP end points. We did see growth in conferencing, as we saw a strong uptake with the COVID-19 environments. We also saw strong double-digit growth in AppDynamics and IoT software. Security was up 6% with strong performance in unified threat management, identity and access and advanced threat. Our cloud security portfolio performed well with strong double-digit growth and continued momentum with our Duo and Umbrella offerings. Service revenue was up 5%, driven by software and solutions support. We continue to transform our business, delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions. Software subscriptions were 34% of total software revenue up 9 points year-over-year. In terms of orders in Q3, total product orders were down 5%. During the quarter, there was a slowdown in April, as we saw the impact of the COVID-19 environment continue. Looking at our geographies, the Americas was flat, EMEA was down 4% and APJC was down 22%. Total emerging markets were down 21% with the BRICS plus Mexico down 29%. In our customer segments, public sector was up 1%, while enterprise was down 4%, commercial was down 11% and service provider was down 3%. Remaining performance obligations or RPO at the end of Q3 were $25.5 billion, up 11%. The portion related to product was up 25%. From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q3 gross margin was 66.6%, up 2 points. Product gross margin was 65.8%, up 2.1 point and service gross margin was 68.9%, up 1.6 points year-over-year. The increase in product gross margin was driven by productivity with continued memory cost savings and positive mix, partially offset by pricing. In terms of the bottom line from a GAAP perspective, Q3 net income was $2.8 million and EPS was $0.65. We ended Q3 with a total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $28.6 billion, operating cash flow was $4.2 billion, down 2% year-over-year. We have a very strong balance sheet, healthy free cash flow generation and the ability to quickly access capital markets. This is a competitive advantage in a challenging environment. Our commitment to our capital allocation program remains unchanged and we intended to continue to deliver long term value to our shareholders through the return of a minimum of 80% of our free cash flow annually. In Q3 we returned $2.5 billion to shareholders, during the quarter that was comprised of $1 billion of share repurchases and $1.5 billion for our quarterly dividend. To summarize, we executed well with strong margins and non-GAAP EPS growth in a very challenging environment. We're seeing the returns on the investments we're making in innovation and driving the shift to more software and subscriptions, delivering long term growth and shareholder value. Let me reiterate our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201820. This guidance includes a type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. We expect revenue to decline in the range of minus 8.5% to minus 11.5% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 64% to 65% and non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 31.5% to 32.5% and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 20%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected in the range from $0.72 to $0.74. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn, so we can move into the Q&A.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Kelly. Michelle, let's go ahead and plan to open up the line for questions. And as my usual quarterly reminder, we ask that you stick to one question. So we have time to get to others. Michelle?\nOperator: Thank you, Marilyn. Our first question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen and Company. You may go ahead, sir.\nPaul Silverstein: I'm torn whether to ask you about the infrastructure decline. So let me focus on that. Chuck and Kelly maybe you could comment on pricing as a courtesy and the other aspects of the fine gross margin performance. But if I could ask you on the infrastructure side, the thought arises given that so many organizations shifted to work from home. That's likely to persist to some degree. What's your outlook in terms of the benefits from the work from home in terms of the need for your solutions or robust connectivity, but also the potential negative aspect, fewer employees within the four walls of the enterprise? How does that impact campus switching and wireless LAN? If you could, any insight would be appreciated.\nChuck Robbins: Yeah. Paul, thanks for your question and you're spot on in how you should think about it. Look from - when we look at our customers working from home there's clearly collaboration capabilities that I discussed around, where there is clearly more security that needs to be deployed. And then the question about when they return to the office and how much - how many people return to the office and what does that mean to the infrastructure supporting their campus environments is certainly one that we're going to be watching. I will tell you that, I\u2019ve had a lot of customers who are not at the center of this crisis, who realized during this pandemic that that they have a fair amount of technical debt and they have a lot of aged equipment. And so we all know what the timeframe is. But many of them have said this is going - this is a wakeup call and this is going to actually give us air cover to talk to our senior leadership team about upgrading and building out a more robust modernized infrastructure. So again, different customers will be able to do that at different paces based on how they're impacted, what their capital situation is. But that's how we think about it going forward and let's see how it plays out. Kelly, you want to talk at all about pricing thing?\nKelly Kramer: Yeah.\nChuck Robbins: Yes.\nKelly Kramer: So yeah, Paul, on pricing we again continue to have strong margins this quarter. But I will say you know, some of the dynamics, we did benefit still this quarter because we had built up some inventory on memory at the lower prices. So we benefited greatly from that, which you'll see in the VCP [ph] But pricing did get a little bit worse. So pricing to your question Paul, from a gross margin rate on product year-over-year it drove minus 1.9 points on pricing, which is slightly worse than it was year-over-year last quarter and certainly for the quarters ahead, the ones even before that even so. But overall very, very strong productivity, again driven by memory and cost savings, as well as positive software mix.\nChuck Robbins: And so you may want to talk about the correlation between the infrastructure platforms revenue number and the supply chain?\nKelly Kramer: Yeah. I mean, like I said in the prepared remarks, basically the majority, if not all of our supply chain challenges that we had with both components in the factories being impacted was on the infrastructure platform side, so that certainly drove a very large chunk of that revenue.\nPaul Silverstein: Great. I appreciate that. Chuck, can you compare this to 10 years ago to the financial crisis and 20 years ago to the bubble?\nChuck Robbins: Well, I don\u2019t think you can compare it to the bubble because we were at the epicenter of that one, so that one felt a lot different. In this one, we are sort of \u2013 we\u2019re secondary collateral damage, I would say. But I think the difference here is the broad based challenges that this thing has represent - as has presented to customers around the world. And - but we all know that the response from the Fed, the response from Congress on stimulus and the commitment to the economic acceleration or the attempt to slow the economic deceleration is certainly at a level we've never seen before. So I think that like everybody else depending on the availability of testing, the availability of therapeutics and clearly at some point when we get a vaccine, I do believe that the one difference that I see in this one is, that this came upon us so quickly and so consistently around the world that I do think customers are now stepping back and asking themselves, what do I need to do to harden my infrastructure and to better prepare my business for the next time something like this happens.\nMarilyn Mora: Right. Thanks, Chuck. Next question please?\nOperator: Thank you. Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer & Company. You may go ahead, sir.\nIttai Kidron: Thanks. And glad to hear everybody is doing okay, all the workers as well. Thanks for the hard work there. I guess I had a question about applications, just given the push with Webex and AppDynamics, I was a little bit surprised, it was down on a year-over-year basis. I guess, Chuck, can you be a little bit more transparent here and give us kind of a better understanding of the relative revenue levels of Webex and AppDynamics versus the unified IP that is clearly declining and then overshadowing those businesses. I'm trying to understand how close are we to a bottom in the declining businesses where the growth businesses can finally be transparent on an overall product category?\nChuck Robbins: Yeah, Ittai, I think, let me give you some color and then, Kelly can give you some metrics. But I think if you look over the last couple of years at the applications business and collaboration, I think they've performed reasonably well. As you think about what happened with Webex this time, what I will tell you is that our number one priority was to get customers up and running and so we have, we really have three categories of opportunity from customers that, as I said in my prepared remarks, that we believe will convert to revenue in the future. So we have enterprise customers, many of whom already had licenses, who need more licenses and they've exceeded their usage and we'll go back and we'll work with them to clean that up in the future. But again our priority was getting them up and running and just allowing them to be productive. The second is we had a number of new customers, enterprise customers, commercial customers who took advantage of Webex and deployed it for the first time in the 90-day free trial programs that we put out. And then there was a third category, which are more the individual free accounts that customers would sign-up for online. I would say the first two categories represent the majority of what we believe to be the revenue opportunity going forward, but that's something we'll see in the future and wasn't really reflected in the quarter that we just announced. So Kelly, you want to make any comments?\nKelly Kramer: Yeah, I mean, the thing I'll say in terms of just helping you think through the size, the relative size of these pieces, you know, of applications, monitoring and analytics, the AppD business is as I said, growing double-digits, super strong, very good, but it is still fairly small in terms of the percentage of the overall applications and then the same thing for the IoT software. So it comes down the collab, traditional collab and then when I break that down, the biggest chunk of total collab is unified communications and that is where we are seeing the pressure, which we have been seeing right in the endpoints. So that's going to be with us for a while as that goes. We're clearly trying to transition there with some of the things that the teams are building there, but that's a big portion that will continue down for a while I would guess. But again conferencing is strong and like Chuck said, the revenue - this is the revenue we're talking about. When we look at the demand and when I look at the uptake, the significant uptake we had, the offers we had during this last quarter, just using our normal what we expect to convert from free to paid is going to be a nice tailwind for us over the next few quarters here.\nIttai Kidron: Got it. And when you say endpoints, just to clarify, mostly IP, is that the right way to think about this?\nKelly Kramer: Yeah, that's the right way to think about it. It's the biggest driver.\nIttai Kidron: Okay. Good luck. Thanks.\nKelly Kramer: Thanks, Ittai.\nMarilyn Mora: Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead, sir.\nRod Hall: Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. I guess I'll - I've got two. One is regarding the order volumes, I wondered if you guys could juxtapose the fact that the US is kind of surprisingly flat after being down 8% last quarter and then also the commercial order acceleration on the downside, could you guys dig into the regional effects. Is that mostly APAC that's driving that or was it also weak in the US. And then the second question I had is on the $2.5 billion financing plan that you guys announced. I don't know, Kelly, could you give us some idea of how that affects cash flow, like is it affecting cash flow in this quarter and then how should we expect it to unwind into cash flow over the next few quarters. Thanks.\nChuck Robbins: So, Kelly, why don't I give a little color on the Americas and commercial and then you can give some metrics and talk about the financials - the programs. So Rod on the Americas, we had a - it was certainly stronger than what we saw in Asia and Europe and frankly, if you just look at the timing of the pandemic, you can see Asia got hit early. So we saw the more consistent decline in the business. What we did see in the Americas and in the US is we saw obviously strengthened Webex and security as more - as customers executed on their business continuity. We also saw strength in service provider as they built out capacity. So we saw strength in cable, we saw strength in webscale business. And just to comment on the webscale space, which we haven't talked about in a while. We've been talking for years about how that was a marathon and that we had been investing both in our innovation, as well as in the relationships with those customers and we have had the second quarter in a row of robust growth in that part of the marketplace, which frankly is the beginnings of us seeing the results from the years of hard work and re-establishing ourselves there. So I'm really proud of what the teams have done. So that's been a bright spot in the last two quarters. On commercial, if you think about it, commercial or mid-sized enterprises, small medium businesses, they have been disproportionately impacted by this pandemic. So it's not a surprise that that business is going to be hit a little bit hard here, harder than others and Kelly you got any color to add on that and then talk about the financial program?\nKelly Kramer: Yeah. So, yeah and also just to add to the US just to add, switching was also up and strong in the America and U.S - Americas as well. On commercial, it's a similar story, all of the geos were down, but it was down the least in the Americas followed by EMEA and the biggest chunk by far, it was down in APJC. So it's directly related to the kind of the geographical look when you look at overall how the orders went. In terms of the capital - Business Resiliency Program, we really just launched that at the end of April. So like a week or two before the quarter ended. So nothing impacted that in the quarter. So in Q4, there will be I'd say a small amount - we have a pipeline that we're going through. The early signs of the pipe that we're looking at, there is a big interest for smaller commercial customers who haven't really done financing, like a lot of healthcare systems, small healthcare systems, a lot of small colleges, so that - there is a pipeline there. So we'll start to see that convert in Q4. From a cash flow perspective, I don't expect a huge impact. There will be some impact in Q4 and slightly more in Q1, but then they get back on to normal payments in the January months. So we'll be watching that and hopefully it's helpful to those customers that haven't leveraged that in the past, but no impact this quarter and it will be a small impact I think in Q4.\nRod Hall: Okay. Thank you.\nKelly Kramer: Yeah.\nMarilyn Mora: Great. Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Sami Badri from Credit Suisse. You may go ahead, sir.\nSami Badri: Hi, thank you very much. I know you stated that routing was both down for SP and enterprise, but you also mentioned solid progress with webscale customers for two consecutive quarters and given some of the big shifts you have made to work from home and also given the fact that you launched new products in just December of 2019. How has the products like the Series 8000 performed during the entire shift? Are you seeing things accelerate or adoption of the product accelerate or has adoption has been a bit slower than your expectations and maybe just a general update on the product?\nChuck Robbins: Yeah, thanks. I guess the good news is the success we've seen in the webscale space the last two quarters hasn't even seen the impact of the 8000 yet. So it's in trials in lots of customers still - they have very extended evaluation periods before they deploy. But I will tell you, it's doing incredibly well in those trials. We're very optimistic about what the teams have built. We feel good about it. Our service provider business was up mid-single digits and orders in the Americas in Q3 which indicates obviously the capacity buildouts that some of them we're seeing as well as that webscale business. So we'll see how it goes, but right now we're very optimistic and feel good about where we are with our platform. And there are more versions of that platform coming. We've just announced the first couple of members of the family.\nSami Badri: Great. Thanks very much.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Chuck. Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. You may go ahead.\nJoe Cardoso: Hi, this is Joe Cardoso on for Samik Chatterjee. I just wanted to get your thoughts around some of your key initiatives given the macro backdrop, specifically as you look at cloud, Wi-Fi 6 or 400 gig? Are you seeing any acceleration of demand or vice versa a push out there versus your expectations 90 days ago given the change in environment? Thanks.\nChuck Robbins: So I think what we see happening with 5G is a little bit mixed, but generally there is a tendency for our customers to want to sort of put their foot on the accelerator. I think you heard some of our customers that are looking for permits and with regional governments around the United States and other places that they are not sure they're going to be able to get that done during this pandemic. You got other customers who are saying that they actually are not having a problem. But it's - so we think generally there is going to be an acceleration, particularly as our service provider customers also realize that some element of this work from home scenario will not go away. And so we're going to be continuing in the future to work in these very hybrid worlds where we're going to have even a much broader distribution of where their users will be working from and I think that's the reason that they want to continue to accelerate the deployments and the strategies around 5G. I'd say in Wi-Fi 6, I don't see any big significant shift. I'd say on the cloud, I've had mixed feedback from customers. I think that in general, it's probably a tailwind to cloud, but there are some customers that believe they have a cloud strategy and this doesn't - they don't understand why this would change how they go about it. So - but it will, as it relates to our strategy. We are going to continue to accelerate those technologies that help our customers use the cloud more effectively. We are going to - as our customers, some of our customers are going to need OpEx offers in the future given CapEx restraints. So we're working on a balance of our portfolio to be delivered in both op CapEx models to give customers the flexibility that they need. And we're definitely going to continue to accelerate the development and work around our security portfolio as it relates to remote work and cloud connectivity because we think that's only going to accelerate as well.\nMarilyn Mora: Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.\nMeta Marshall: Great, thanks. You know, understanding the end of March and beginning of April were largely work from home or business continuity focus with customers. But as we get into kind of this new normal, do you feel like customers have had an initial sense of what revised budget outlooks are looking like for 2020 or are customers still relatively uncertain that you're talking to.\nChuck Robbins: It's a very good question. I think we went through a surge for a few weeks where customers were solely focused on business continuity and getting themselves prepared for this work from home environment and then I think they took a breath for a couple of weeks and then they stepped back and I could even see it in how we worked as a company. We were solely focused on the immediate virus response getting our teams up and running, getting our customers up and running, making sure we had investments in the community and all those things. And then frankly, we took a breather and now even my calendar and the things that we're focused on are much more sort of the traditional business issues and how we move forward. And I think our customers are in the same mode. I think again they dealt with business continuity. They took a few weeks to figure out okay, based on this, how do I re-prioritize the projects that I have - that I had planned for the rest of the year and I think every customer is at a different phase right now on how they're deploying it and it's going to be very industry-specific as to who moves forward. I'll give you a few examples. Obviously, we're working very closely with higher education because you see in the news the discussion around whether students will be on campus in the fall. As one of the heads of one of the biggest systems in the United States told me, they used anything and everything they could to get students online back in March and now they need to go step back and actually build the real robust long-term architecture that they need and we're working with them to do that. I think healthcare is one that they're going to make investments. I think telehealth is here finally and I think that's going to change forever and I think that those - that industry will continue to work and build out a more robust architecture to support telehealth as opposed to what we put together as quickly as we could with them over the last few months. You got the hospitality, the leisure, the travel that are going to struggle, which is one of the big reasons we wanted to make sure we got our financing program out there candidly is if they need to make investments during this time, we want to help them do that. Not only is it the right thing to do, but they remember afterwards that we were partners to them during their tough time and I think you see financial services moving ahead. So it's going to vary greatly by industry. But I think we're going to have better visibility in the next 60 days or so.\nMeta Marshall: Great, thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Tal Liani from Bank of America. You may go ahead, sir.\nTal Liani: Hi, guys. Services was one of the only areas that grew both sequentially and year-over-year and the question is, why don't we see the impact of, first of all, what are the drivers for that and why don't we see the impact of COVID-19. We're hearing from others that customers are less willing because of the uncertainty to sign on contracts that are longer than one year. So they see the parallel decline in services and just - I would like to get an update on this space and how long does it take it to follow the trends in Infrastructure Platforms and the other products?\nKelly Kramer: Hi, Tal. That's a good question. So I would say, yeah, we had another strong quarter in Q3 and again, it has been driven by like their solution support and their software support. That continues to be a big driver of it. But your point is - of what you're hearing from other companies is absolutely true and what's happening to us, I would say that I expect pressure in my guide for Q4. I have some pressure to services there and where we're seeing it is on things that are like in our advanced services, our proactive services, consulting kind of things, those things that are either discretionary or you only make progress when you're actually in the enterprises, those are seeing pressure that I think will see translate like hitting milestones or doing projects. And then in terms of the maintenance, there is a lag usually on infrastructure maintenance. When the orders drag, it\u2019s usually a lag for a while. So we'll start to feel maybe a little bit of that in the upcoming quarters. But overall, that's a very solid business and we've gone through cycles like this before and we always come out pretty strong on that, but I think your point is a fair point.\nTal Liani: Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Right, thanks Tal. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Amit Daryanani from Evercore. You may go ahead, sir.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks a lot for taking my question guys. I guess a fairly common question I get on you guys is how does Cisco stack up this time versus the past recessions like '08, '09 for example. So it would be really helpful to maybe get your perspective on how do you think Cisco handles and performance through this cycle versus past one and really to get to the bottom of how is Cisco different and perhaps better positioned to manage this correction versus the past one would be helpful.\nChuck Robbins: I think that we're better positioned for sure and you would expect me to say that, but I do believe it. I think that we've spent the last few years driving a significant refresh across our enterprise portfolio, across our service provider offerings, our 5G packet core capabilities. Our security portfolio is robust. We spent the last two years rebuilding and modernizing the Webex architecture as well as unifying the user interface. We've now gone through two months of building out capacity on a global basis. Webex was the largest platform in the world in February and now, it's three times what it was then. So we've built that out. And I think that if you look at the software content in our product portfolio and the percentage of our revenue that, that represents and the percentage of that, that's coming from subscriptions and SaaS versus where we were in 2008, I think all of those things just position us more effectively than perhaps we would have been back then. So I feel good about where we are and I think that our balance sheet is strong. Obviously, our ability to navigate this financially is strong. So I feel good and I wasn't running the company in 2008 clearly, but I was here and it just feels like we're fortunate that we've spent the last few years doing complete refreshes on almost all of our technology. So we have very relevant new offers for our customers right now.\nMarilyn Mora: Right. Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Jim Suva from Citigroup Investment. You may go ahead, sir.\nJim Suva: Thank you. Can you talk a little bit about enterprise, the orders, the trends, maybe the monthly cadence and importantly the color or commentary you have as enterprises are working from home with their employees, keeping their networks up and running, potentially delaying things, how does that kind of look as you go forward because it seems like it's a typical request for proposals might be a little bit different discussions now. What I mean is, say for example, does this help the incumbency of Cisco a little more, does it give you more visibility to hey, Chuck, when things return back to normal in three or six months or at some point, hey, do we have a buildup of more visibility than what we currently have. If you could just help us with the enterprise some commentary, that'd be great.\nChuck Robbins: Yeah. Thanks, Jim. I will tell you this, the number of emails that I've gotten from my peers from virtually every industry about what our teams did to help them, many of them saying we had to get 150,000 people up and running remotely over VPN and you guys helped us do that overnight and for that we're gracious or around Webex and how they couldn't be running their business right now if it wasn't for Webex. And I mean, so we hosted an advisory board call with about 50 of our strategic customers around the world last week or the week before, I can't remember exactly when it was at this point and they spent like the majority of the first third of the call just going through stories of gratitude around what our teams have done. And I tell you that because I think what's happened is, to your point, Jim, I think there is a tendency during these times, you want to work with companies that you believe are strong, are solid and are great partners and are going to do whatever it takes to make you successful during these times and I think that's what our customers believe we do. I think, again as I said earlier, you're going to have some customers right now that are going to look at their infrastructure, the CEOs are looking at it and saying, I will never be this unprepared for something like this again and if there is a wave two coming in the fall, many of them may say we need to work on a lot of this right now. I don't know that yet, but we think there could be. I talked earlier about what we see in certain industries where there will be investments like higher ed. Right now, frankly there is K-12 contingency plans being made, even though I know most K-12 institutions would much rather be teaching those kids in schools for obvious reasons, but it's also not a definite that they'll be going back into the classroom in the fall. So that's happening. The pharmaceuticals and the drug manufacturers are working to beef up their infrastructure for all the research, building up their cyber infrastructure for obvious reasons. So there is a lot of things that are going really well, but then again you have industries that are at the heart of this crisis who I wouldn't expect to make significant investments until we get to the other side.\nJim Suva: Thank you so much for the details. It's greatly appreciated.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Jim.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Jim. Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research. You may go ahead, sir.\nPierre Ferragu: Thank you for taking my question. Chuck, I'd like to come back to you, just the very last comments you made, you said some industries are getting hit very hard now and it's going to be tough for them to make investments before we get on the other side of the crisis. And so what I'm trying to figure out is how much of the economy is already in a situation of feeling the pain, cutting IT budgets and how much of the economy is not there yet and actually at risk of getting into that stage, maybe in three months or even in six months from now because as you say though that these enterprises are like maintaining continuity are actually more into a mode of making the right spending to keep the business running. But maybe in three months to six months, they're going to actually start getting the more of a macro pains, the recessionary environment hurting their business as well. And so my question is really how much are we into that already. What percentage of the economy has been hurt and what percentage could be helped further down the line?\nChuck Robbins: Yeah, Pierre. It's a very good question. I'm going to give you just my pure instinct on this. I think that any customer who potentially could be at risk in three months to six months is already pausing. I don't think that anybody is going to be aggressive right now because any of us can see if we have liquidity issues, we have solvency issues, we have anything that is three months to six months away, my peers, we're all planning, we're working on that right now. No one is waiting. So I think most of the impact that you will see in the next six months or nine months, I think those customers are impacted. Let me say it that way. They know they are impacted. I will tell you, from our perspective, if you map the industries that we believe will continue to invest against our customer base, there is a good correlation that a lot of the industries that we believe will invest are already a large percentage of our customer makeup. So whether you look at public sector, service providers, financial services, higher education, I mean these are all big pieces of business for us and we think that all those and others will also continue to invest. So it's mix, but to answer your specific question, I think anyone who is going to be in trouble three months to six months from now is already pausing and has already been impacted.\nPierre Ferragu: That's great. Very clear answer. Thanks for that.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Pierre. We have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. Tim Long from Barclays. You may go ahead, sir.\nTim Long: Thank you for squeezing me in. Chuck, wanted to ask about competition, kind of a twofold question here. Number one, if you think about some of the pieces of your business where some competitors have been trying to take share, enterprise networking comes to mind where several companies are focused on gaining share there. What do you think this major pandemic disruption does to others ability to maybe disrupt the high market share that you have? And then conversely if you think about some of the markets where Cisco has a real opportunity to gain share, it sounds like cloud would be one of those, you guys are doing well. But do you think there is any of the markets where you are poised to take some share that are impacted either positively or negatively? Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Yeah, it's a great question. I think you even heard from some of our competitors on their earnings calls where they had planned on entering markets and they've acknowledged that it is going to be more difficult to do that during this time in areas where we have good market share. And again I'll remind you that in those areas, like in the campus, we have probably the most robust portfolio we've had in a decade. So we're very - in very good shape with the portfolio. And I think again customers - they are in times like these, they want to go with people they trust and know and I think that will work in our favor. But on the - in the areas to your point where we can take share, I think certainly the webscale play that we've been running for the last 4, 4.5 years I think is one area over the next year. I think in the service provider space with the 8000s and recapturing some routing share because of those portfolios and both of those sets of customers, they will continue doing the evaluations and the new deployments, because they have to because they have just requirements that are increasing on a daily basis. And I think that in the carrier space with 5G and the access networks, the backhaul networks, the core networks with the 8000 and some of our other technology we've come out with, I think we can take share there as well. So, I feel good about where we are and the things that we are in control of right now, I think we're in a pretty good position.\nTim Long: Okay. Thank you, sir.\nMarilyn Mora: All right. Thanks, Tim and that was the last question of our call.\nChuck Robbins: Yeah. So let me just close quickly by, first of all, thanking all of you for being with us and just telling you all that we hope that you're safe and your family is safe and you continue to be safe. I also want to just reiterate our gratitude for the front line workers and these are the healthcare workers, the first responders, some of our colleagues locally who are in the homeless camps, helping try to stem the tide of this pandemic flowing through those kinds of environments. Those people who live paycheck to paycheck who are struggling right now, our thoughts and prayers are with everybody and our gratitude is especially with those who are on the front lines. We look forward to getting to the other side of this and we look forward to doing our part in helping our customers and helping society actually thrive as much as possible during this very difficult time. So thanks for being with us today on our call.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Chuck. Cisco's next quarterly earnings call, which will reflect our Q4 2020 and annual results will be on Wednesday, August 12th at 1:30 PM Pacific Time, 4:30 PM Eastern Time. Again, I'd like to remind the audience that in light of Regulation FD, Cisco's policy is not to comment on its financial guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. We now plan to close the call. If you have any further questions, feel free to contact the Cisco Investor Relations Group and we thank you very much for joining today's call.\nOperator: Thank you for participating on today's conference call.

            "content": "Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter, followed by guidance for Q4. Our overall Q3 results reflect good execution with strong margins and non-GAAP EPS growth in a very challenging environment. COVID-19 did have an impact on our financial results and business operations this quarter, especially in our supply chain where we saw manufacturing challenges and component constraints. Total revenue was $12 billion, down 8%. Our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 34.9%, up 2.7 points. Non-GAAP net income was $3.4 billion, down 2% year-over-year and non-GAAP EPS was $0.79, up 1%. Let me provide some more detail on our Q3 revenue. Total product revenue was down 12% to $8.6 billion. Infrastructure platforms was down 15%. This is the area that was most impacted by the supply chain challenges. Switching revenue declined in both Campus and Data Center. We did see strong growth with the continued ramp of the Cat 9K. Routing decline in both service provider and in enterprise. Data Center revenue decline driven by continued market contraction impacting both our servers and HyperFlex offerings. Wireless declined overall, but we did see strength in the ramp of our Wi-Fi 6 products and solid growth in Meraki. Applications was down 5%, driven by a decline in Unified Communications and TP end points. We did see growth in conferencing, as we saw a strong uptake with the COVID-19 environments. We also saw strong double-digit growth in AppDynamics and IoT software. Security was up 6% with strong performance in unified threat management, identity and access and advanced threat. Our cloud security portfolio performed well with strong double-digit growth and continued momentum with our Duo and Umbrella offerings. Service revenue was up 5%, driven by software and solutions support. We continue to transform our business, delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions. Software subscriptions were 34% of total software revenue up 9 points year-over-year. In terms of orders in Q3, total product orders were down 5%. During the quarter, there was a slowdown in April, as we saw the impact of the COVID-19 environment continue. Looking at our geographies, the Americas was flat, EMEA was down 4% and APJC was down 22%. Total emerging markets were down 21% with the BRICS plus Mexico down 29%. In our customer segments, public sector was up 1%, while enterprise was down 4%, commercial was down 11% and service provider was down 3%. Remaining performance obligations or RPO at the end of Q3 were $25.5 billion, up 11%. The portion related to product was up 25%. From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q3 gross margin was 66.6%, up 2 points. Product gross margin was 65.8%, up 2.1 point and service gross margin was 68.9%, up 1.6 points year-over-year. The increase in product gross margin was driven by productivity with continued memory cost savings and positive mix, partially offset by pricing. In terms of the bottom line from a GAAP perspective, Q3 net income was $2.8 million and EPS was $0.65. We ended Q3 with a total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $28.6 billion, operating cash flow was $4.2 billion, down 2% year-over-year. We have a very strong balance sheet, healthy free cash flow generation and the ability to quickly access capital markets. This is a competitive advantage in a challenging environment. Our commitment to our capital allocation program remains unchanged and we intended to continue to deliver long term value to our shareholders through the return of a minimum of 80% of our free cash flow annually. In Q3 we returned $2.5 billion to shareholders, during the quarter that was comprised of $1 billion of share repurchases and $1.5 billion for our quarterly dividend. To summarize, we executed well with strong margins and non-GAAP EPS growth in a very challenging environment. We're seeing the returns on the investments we're making in innovation and driving the shift to more software and subscriptions, delivering long term growth and shareholder value. Let me reiterate our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201820. This guidance includes a type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. We expect revenue to decline in the range of minus 8.5% to minus 11.5% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 64% to 65% and non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 31.5% to 32.5% and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 20%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected in the range from $0.72 to $0.74. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn, so we can move into the Q&A. Yeah. So yeah, Paul, on pricing we again continue to have strong margins this quarter. But I will say you know, some of the dynamics, we did benefit still this quarter because we had built up some inventory on memory at the lower prices. So we benefited greatly from that, which you'll see in the VCP [ph] But pricing did get a little bit worse. So pricing to your question Paul, from a gross margin rate on product year-over-year it drove minus 1.9 points on pricing, which is slightly worse than it was year-over-year last quarter and certainly for the quarters ahead, the ones even before that even so. But overall very, very strong productivity, again driven by memory and cost savings, as well as positive software mix. Yeah. I mean, like I said in the prepared remarks, basically the majority, if not all of our supply chain challenges that we had with both components in the factories being impacted was on the infrastructure platform side, so that certainly drove a very large chunk of that revenue. Yeah, I mean, the thing I'll say in terms of just helping you think through the size, the relative size of these pieces, you know, of applications, monitoring and analytics, the AppD business is as I said, growing double-digits, super strong, very good, but it is still fairly small in terms of the percentage of the overall applications and then the same thing for the IoT software. So it comes down the collab, traditional collab and then when I break that down, the biggest chunk of total collab is unified communications and that is where we are seeing the pressure, which we have been seeing right in the endpoints. So that's going to be with us for a while as that goes. We're clearly trying to transition there with some of the things that the teams are building there, but that's a big portion that will continue down for a while I would guess. But again conferencing is strong and like Chuck said, the revenue - this is the revenue we're talking about. When we look at the demand and when I look at the uptake, the significant uptake we had, the offers we had during this last quarter, just using our normal what we expect to convert from free to paid is going to be a nice tailwind for us over the next few quarters here. Yeah, that's the right way to think about it. It's the biggest driver. Thanks, Ittai. Yeah. So, yeah and also just to add to the US just to add, switching was also up and strong in the America and U.S - Americas as well. On commercial, it's a similar story, all of the geos were down, but it was down the least in the Americas followed by EMEA and the biggest chunk by far, it was down in APJC. So it's directly related to the kind of the geographical look when you look at overall how the orders went. In terms of the capital - Business Resiliency Program, we really just launched that at the end of April. So like a week or two before the quarter ended. So nothing impacted that in the quarter. So in Q4, there will be I'd say a small amount - we have a pipeline that we're going through. The early signs of the pipe that we're looking at, there is a big interest for smaller commercial customers who haven't really done financing, like a lot of healthcare systems, small healthcare systems, a lot of small colleges, so that - there is a pipeline there. So we'll start to see that convert in Q4. From a cash flow perspective, I don't expect a huge impact. There will be some impact in Q4 and slightly more in Q1, but then they get back on to normal payments in the January months. So we'll be watching that and hopefully it's helpful to those customers that haven't leveraged that in the past, but no impact this quarter and it will be a small impact I think in Q4. Yeah. Hi, Tal. That's a good question. So I would say, yeah, we had another strong quarter in Q3 and again, it has been driven by like their solution support and their software support. That continues to be a big driver of it. But your point is - of what you're hearing from other companies is absolutely true and what's happening to us, I would say that I expect pressure in my guide for Q4. I have some pressure to services there and where we're seeing it is on things that are like in our advanced services, our proactive services, consulting kind of things, those things that are either discretionary or you only make progress when you're actually in the enterprises, those are seeing pressure that I think will see translate like hitting milestones or doing projects. And then in terms of the maintenance, there is a lag usually on infrastructure maintenance. When the orders drag, it's usually a lag for a while. So we'll start to feel maybe a little bit of that in the upcoming quarters. But overall, that's a very solid business and we've gone through cycles like this before and we always come out pretty strong on that, but I think your point is a fair point."

            "name": "Chuck Robbins",
            "content": "Thanks Marilyn. Before we get started, I want to express my gratitude and appreciation for all the frontline workers who are fighting this pandemic every day to keep so many safe. I also want to express my sympathies for those who have lost their lives and the families that have endured the deepest pains from the impact of this tragic situation we are in today. This truly is unlike anything, any of us have ever experienced. As you can imagine, we have been focused on helping our employee's, customer's, partners and communities. We currently have 95% of our global workforce working from home, which was a seamless transition for us, as we already had a flexible work policy. And we build the technologies that allow organizations to stay connected, secure and productive. For those 5% who must be in the office to do the roles, we are clearly focused on their health and safety and are taking all of the necessary precautions. During the crisis, many of our customers and partners have been under enormous pressure as they face cash flow challenges. This is why we introduced a variety of free offers and trials for our Webex and security technologies as they dramatically shifted entire workforces to be remote. In addition, we announced $2.5 billion in financing with a new Business Resiliency Program through Cisco Capital to offer financial flexibility and support their business continuity. This will help customers and partner's access to technology they need now, invest for recovery and defer most of the payments until early 2021. This pandemic is highlighting so many inequities that already existed and is exacerbating these problems. I'm proud to say that Cisco has committed nearly $300 million to date to support both global and local pandemic response efforts, including providing technology and financial support for non-profits, first responders and governments. We are also donating personal protective equipment to hospital workers, including N-95 masks and face shields, 3D printed by Cisco volunteers around the world. I'm so proud of our teams who have been relentlessly focused on these efforts and continuing to identify how we can be innovative to help those most in need. I particularly like to call out our IT, Webex, security and supply chain teams, along with our partners and suppliers who have been working around the clock to ensure we are doing all that we can to keep organizations around the world up and running and giving back to our communities. Thank you. Now, turning to our third quarter performance. Despite the challenging environment we are all operating in, we delivered a solid quarter and financial performance in the midst of the greatest financial crisis of our lifetime. While we are not immune to the impacts of the global pandemic, we believe our underlying business fundamentals and financial position remains strong. As we look at the quarter it very much reflected the journey of the pandemic. In March, we were performing ahead of our expectations, as companies focused on building resiliency in their IT environments. Then in April we began to see a slowdown across the business, as countries across the world were locked down. While parts of our portfolio have been more impacted than others, we believe our leadership from a product, innovation and operational perspective remains solid. While there is so much uncertainty now, we believe our role has never been more important and our responsibility has never been greater, as much of the world is running on Cisco's technology from networking to collaboration to security to stay connected, secure and productive. Organizations more than ever must focus on resiliency and agility and those who had invested in digital capabilities were able to make this shift more seamlessly. While we cannot predict when it's going to happen, one thing we believe is that the demand for our products and services will be strong when we emerge from this situation. We believe the transition in our own business model through our shift to more software and subscription-based offerings is paying off. We saw continued strong adoption of our SaaS-based offerings and now have 74% of our software that is subscription versus 65% a year ago. We also believe, we remain well positioned over the long-term to serve our customers and create differentiated value aligned to cloud, 5G, Wi-Fi 6 and 400 gig. Our business model, diversified portfolio and ability to continue to invest in key growth priorities gives us a strong foundation to build even stronger customer relationships. As we prepare for the future, we will closely partner with our customers to modernize their infrastructure, secure their remote workforce and their data through our innovative solutions that will serve as the foundation for their digital organizations. Next, I'll turn to the performance of our business segments, starting with infrastructure platforms. With the world going online practically overnight, the demand on networks has never been greater, with users looking for secure connectivity, reliable performance and consistent experiences. This has led to our customers evaluating how to expand their capacity quickly, how best to protect their teams and how to keep their data secure, while keeping their business productive. It is also requiring enterprise IT to rapidly setup, deploy and provision mobile offices or mobile healthcare clinics. What I've seen IT teams do around the world and what they've made possible is simply astonishing. Our strategy and value proposition are clear. We are powering the world's ability to stay connected, productive and secure, while automating many of these capabilities. Our intent-based networking architecture was built for environments like this. For industries like healthcare, public services, financial services and service providers especially, having network infrastructure tightly integrated with security is mission-critical. In Q3 we offered new cloud-based COVID-19 bundles for teleworker, mobile healthcare and pop-up branch use cases through our partners and service providers. As customers modernize their network infrastructure, we saw continued strong customer adoption of our subscription-based Catalyst 9000, as customers look to quickly scale remote access capabilities to keep their employees safe and their businesses running. We continue to execute on our secure cloud scale SD-WAN strategy by investing in innovation and partnerships to help enterprises accelerate their multi-cloud strategies. As an example, we are now integrating with our Umbrella secure Internet gateway to give our customers flexibility to use best of breed cloud security with our industry leading SD-WAN solution. Our partnerships across web scale providers like AWS, Azure and our most recent announcement with Google Cloud allow us to offer a truly multi-cloud network fabric. As bandwidth and SaaS application demand increases, we are enabling our customers to securely connect branches and interconnect to different cloud providers to enable consistent application performance and user experience. Moving on to security, which is always at the heart of everything we do. In Q3, we saw solid growth, reflecting increased demand for our robust solutions to secure the rapid growth in remote workers and their devices. Being the largest enterprise security company in the world, we are uniquely positioned to safeguard our customers wherever they work. We have the most comprehensive and integrated end-to-end portfolio in the industry across the network, cloud, applications and endpoints. As I mentioned earlier, we provided extended free licenses for key security technologies that are designed to protect remote workers, including Cisco Umbrella, Zero Trust Security from Duo, industry-leading secure network access from Cisco AnyConnect and end point protection from our AMP technology. We are also supporting our customers on their multi-cloud journey by enabling them to secure direct internet access, cloud application usage and roaming users. We are only two quarters into our secure Internet gateway transition and we are already seeing strong adoption from existing and new customers. Building on the investments we made in innovation partnerships and acquisitions, we also introduced SecureX. This is the industry's broadest cloud-based security platform, connecting the breadth of our portfolio and our customer's security infrastructure by providing unified visibility, automation and simplified security across applications, the network endpoints and the cloud. Turning to applications. Teleworking and collaboration tools have become a lifeline for businesses and their people to stay connected and productive, with security and privacy being more critical than ever. Our portfolios at the center of our customer strategy for empowering teams and increasing productivity, as 95% of the Fortune 500 use our collaboration portfolio today. We take a security first approach to remote working and provide highly secure cloud-based collaboration solutions with integrated end-to end-encryption, while protecting our customer's privacy. Throughout the quarter, we invested in scaling our platform at an unparalleled speed to deliver a highly secure consistent experience and ensuring business continuity for our customers. We are now running our Webex platform at three times the capacity we were running at in February to manage the dramatic increase in usage growth. We had well over 500 million meeting participants, generating 25 billion meeting minutes in April, more than tripled the volume in February. We also added many new prospects through free Webex trials that we anticipate converting to revenue in the future. With applications at the core of every business and the surge in demand for monitoring tools that provide real time business insights and optimize user experiences in multi-cloud environments, AppDynamics continues to perform well, particularly in this environment. As I wrap up, I just want to reiterate how grateful I am to have our teams, our resources and our operational resiliency during this time. I also want to commend the heroic efforts of IT organizations and teams around the world who have had to digitize their operations and support remote workforces at an unprecedented speed and scale. This crisis has highlighted the importance of having highly resilient, globally scalable infrastructure technologies to keep the world running and this is what we build. We are providing an innovative solutions that help our customer support business continuity, drive productivity and ensure a highly secure work environment. We believe we will emerge from this crisis stronger than before. With our accelerated innovation cycle, refresh portfolio and significant progress on our shift to more software and subscriptions, we are in a better position today than in past times of uncertainty. Our confidence is further supported by our strong balance sheet to invest for the future and our proven ability to execute no matter the environment. I also believe our incredible culture has been amplified during this time and I'm so proud of what our teams have achieved. I am confident Cisco is resilient and we are built to last, regardless of what the future brings. Kelly. I'll now turn it over to you. Yeah. Paul, thanks for your question and you're spot on in how you should think about it. Look from - when we look at our customers working from home there's clearly collaboration capabilities that I discussed around, where there is clearly more security that needs to be deployed. And then the question about when they return to the office and how much - how many people return to the office and what does that mean to the infrastructure supporting their campus environments is certainly one that we're going to be watching. I will tell you that, I've had a lot of customers who are not at the center of this crisis, who realized during this pandemic that that they have a fair amount of technical debt and they have a lot of aged equipment. And so we all know what the timeframe is. But many of them have said this is going - this is a wakeup call and this is going to actually give us air cover to talk to our senior leadership team about upgrading and building out a more robust modernized infrastructure. So again, different customers will be able to do that at different paces based on how they're impacted, what their capital situation is. But that's how we think about it going forward and let's see how it plays out. Kelly, you want to talk at all about pricing thing? Yes. And so you may want to talk about the correlation between the infrastructure platforms revenue number and the supply chain? Well, I don't think you can compare it to the bubble because we were at the epicenter of that one, so that one felt a lot different. In this one, we are sort of \u2013 we're secondary collateral damage, I would say. But I think the difference here is the broad based challenges that this thing has represent - as has presented to customers around the world. And - but we all know that the response from the Fed, the response from Congress on stimulus and the commitment to the economic acceleration or the attempt to slow the economic deceleration is certainly at a level we've never seen before. So I think that like everybody else depending on the availability of testing, the availability of therapeutics and clearly at some point when we get a vaccine, I do believe that the one difference that I see in this one is, that this came upon us so quickly and so consistently around the world that I do think customers are now stepping back and asking themselves, what do I need to do to harden my infrastructure and to better prepare my business for the next time something like this happens. Yeah, Ittai, I think, let me give you some color and then, Kelly can give you some metrics. But I think if you look over the last couple of years at the applications business and collaboration, I think they've performed reasonably well. As you think about what happened with Webex this time, what I will tell you is that our number one priority was to get customers up and running and so we have, we really have three categories of opportunity from customers that, as I said in my prepared remarks, that we believe will convert to revenue in the future. So we have enterprise customers, many of whom already had licenses, who need more licenses and they've exceeded their usage and we'll go back and we'll work with them to clean that up in the future. But again our priority was getting them up and running and just allowing them to be productive. The second is we had a number of new customers, enterprise customers, commercial customers who took advantage of Webex and deployed it for the first time in the 90-day free trial programs that we put out. And then there was a third category, which are more the individual free accounts that customers would sign-up for online. I would say the first two categories represent the majority of what we believe to be the revenue opportunity going forward, but that's something we'll see in the future and wasn't really reflected in the quarter that we just announced. So Kelly, you want to make any comments? So, Kelly, why don't I give a little color on the Americas and commercial and then you can give some metrics and talk about the financials - the programs. So Rod on the Americas, we had a - it was certainly stronger than what we saw in Asia and Europe and frankly, if you just look at the timing of the pandemic, you can see Asia got hit early. So we saw the more consistent decline in the business. What we did see in the Americas and in the US is we saw obviously strengthened Webex and security as more - as customers executed on their business continuity. We also saw strength in service provider as they built out capacity. So we saw strength in cable, we saw strength in webscale business. And just to comment on the webscale space, which we haven't talked about in a while. We've been talking for years about how that was a marathon and that we had been investing both in our innovation, as well as in the relationships with those customers and we have had the second quarter in a row of robust growth in that part of the marketplace, which frankly is the beginnings of us seeing the results from the years of hard work and re-establishing ourselves there. So I'm really proud of what the teams have done. So that's been a bright spot in the last two quarters. On commercial, if you think about it, commercial or mid-sized enterprises, small medium businesses, they have been disproportionately impacted by this pandemic. So it's not a surprise that that business is going to be hit a little bit hard here, harder than others and Kelly you got any color to add on that and then talk about the financial program? Yeah, thanks. I guess the good news is the success we've seen in the webscale space the last two quarters hasn't even seen the impact of the 8000 yet. So it's in trials in lots of customers still - they have very extended evaluation periods before they deploy. But I will tell you, it's doing incredibly well in those trials. We're very optimistic about what the teams have built. We feel good about it. Our service provider business was up mid-single digits and orders in the Americas in Q3 which indicates obviously the capacity buildouts that some of them we're seeing as well as that webscale business. So we'll see how it goes, but right now we're very optimistic and feel good about where we are with our platform. And there are more versions of that platform coming. We've just announced the first couple of members of the family. So I think what we see happening with 5G is a little bit mixed, but generally there is a tendency for our customers to want to sort of put their foot on the accelerator. I think you heard some of our customers that are looking for permits and with regional governments around the United States and other places that they are not sure they're going to be able to get that done during this pandemic. You got other customers who are saying that they actually are not having a problem. But it's - so we think generally there is going to be an acceleration, particularly as our service provider customers also realize that some element of this work from home scenario will not go away. And so we're going to be continuing in the future to work in these very hybrid worlds where we're going to have even a much broader distribution of where their users will be working from and I think that's the reason that they want to continue to accelerate the deployments and the strategies around 5G. I'd say in Wi-Fi 6, I don't see any big significant shift. I'd say on the cloud, I've had mixed feedback from customers. I think that in general, it's probably a tailwind to cloud, but there are some customers that believe they have a cloud strategy and this doesn't - they don't understand why this would change how they go about it. So - but it will, as it relates to our strategy. We are going to continue to accelerate those technologies that help our customers use the cloud more effectively. We are going to - as our customers, some of our customers are going to need OpEx offers in the future given CapEx restraints. So we're working on a balance of our portfolio to be delivered in both op CapEx models to give customers the flexibility that they need. And we're definitely going to continue to accelerate the development and work around our security portfolio as it relates to remote work and cloud connectivity because we think that's only going to accelerate as well. It's a very good question. I think we went through a surge for a few weeks where customers were solely focused on business continuity and getting themselves prepared for this work from home environment and then I think they took a breath for a couple of weeks and then they stepped back and I could even see it in how we worked as a company. We were solely focused on the immediate virus response getting our teams up and running, getting our customers up and running, making sure we had investments in the community and all those things. And then frankly, we took a breather and now even my calendar and the things that we're focused on are much more sort of the traditional business issues and how we move forward. And I think our customers are in the same mode. I think again they dealt with business continuity. They took a few weeks to figure out okay, based on this, how do I re-prioritize the projects that I have - that I had planned for the rest of the year and I think every customer is at a different phase right now on how they're deploying it and it's going to be very industry-specific as to who moves forward. I'll give you a few examples. Obviously, we're working very closely with higher education because you see in the news the discussion around whether students will be on campus in the fall. As one of the heads of one of the biggest systems in the United States told me, they used anything and everything they could to get students online back in March and now they need to go step back and actually build the real robust long-term architecture that they need and we're working with them to do that. I think healthcare is one that they're going to make investments. I think telehealth is here finally and I think that's going to change forever and I think that those - that industry will continue to work and build out a more robust architecture to support telehealth as opposed to what we put together as quickly as we could with them over the last few months. You got the hospitality, the leisure, the travel that are going to struggle, which is one of the big reasons we wanted to make sure we got our financing program out there candidly is if they need to make investments during this time, we want to help them do that. Not only is it the right thing to do, but they remember afterwards that we were partners to them during their tough time and I think you see financial services moving ahead. So it's going to vary greatly by industry. But I think we're going to have better visibility in the next 60 days or so. I think that we're better positioned for sure and you would expect me to say that, but I do believe it. I think that we've spent the last few years driving a significant refresh across our enterprise portfolio, across our service provider offerings, our 5G packet core capabilities. Our security portfolio is robust. We spent the last two years rebuilding and modernizing the Webex architecture as well as unifying the user interface. We've now gone through two months of building out capacity on a global basis. Webex was the largest platform in the world in February and now, it's three times what it was then. So we've built that out. And I think that if you look at the software content in our product portfolio and the percentage of our revenue that, that represents and the percentage of that, that's coming from subscriptions and SaaS versus where we were in 2008, I think all of those things just position us more effectively than perhaps we would have been back then. So I feel good about where we are and I think that our balance sheet is strong. Obviously, our ability to navigate this financially is strong. So I feel good and I wasn't running the company in 2008 clearly, but I was here and it just feels like we're fortunate that we've spent the last few years doing complete refreshes on almost all of our technology. So we have very relevant new offers for our customers right now. Yeah. Thanks, Jim. I will tell you this, the number of emails that I've gotten from my peers from virtually every industry about what our teams did to help them, many of them saying we had to get 150,000 people up and running remotely over VPN and you guys helped us do that overnight and for that we're gracious or around Webex and how they couldn't be running their business right now if it wasn't for Webex. And I mean, so we hosted an advisory board call with about 50 of our strategic customers around the world last week or the week before, I can't remember exactly when it was at this point and they spent like the majority of the first third of the call just going through stories of gratitude around what our teams have done. And I tell you that because I think what's happened is, to your point, Jim, I think there is a tendency during these times, you want to work with companies that you believe are strong, are solid and are great partners and are going to do whatever it takes to make you successful during these times and I think that's what our customers believe we do. I think, again as I said earlier, you're going to have some customers right now that are going to look at their infrastructure, the CEOs are looking at it and saying, I will never be this unprepared for something like this again and if there is a wave two coming in the fall, many of them may say we need to work on a lot of this right now. I don't know that yet, but we think there could be. I talked earlier about what we see in certain industries where there will be investments like higher ed. Right now, frankly there is K-12 contingency plans being made, even though I know most K-12 institutions would much rather be teaching those kids in schools for obvious reasons, but it's also not a definite that they'll be going back into the classroom in the fall. So that's happening. The pharmaceuticals and the drug manufacturers are working to beef up their infrastructure for all the research, building up their cyber infrastructure for obvious reasons. So there is a lot of things that are going really well, but then again you have industries that are at the heart of this crisis who I wouldn't expect to make significant investments until we get to the other side. Thanks, Jim. Yeah, Pierre. It's a very good question. I'm going to give you just my pure instinct on this. I think that any customer who potentially could be at risk in three months to six months is already pausing. I don't think that anybody is going to be aggressive right now because any of us can see if we have liquidity issues, we have solvency issues, we have anything that is three months to six months away, my peers, we're all planning, we're working on that right now. No one is waiting. So I think most of the impact that you will see in the next six months or nine months, I think those customers are impacted. Let me say it that way. They know they are impacted. I will tell you, from our perspective, if you map the industries that we believe will continue to invest against our customer base, there is a good correlation that a lot of the industries that we believe will invest are already a large percentage of our customer makeup. So whether you look at public sector, service providers, financial services, higher education, I mean these are all big pieces of business for us and we think that all those and others will also continue to invest. So it's mix, but to answer your specific question, I think anyone who is going to be in trouble three months to six months from now is already pausing and has already been impacted. Yeah, it's a great question. I think you even heard from some of our competitors on their earnings calls where they had planned on entering markets and they've acknowledged that it is going to be more difficult to do that during this time in areas where we have good market share. And again I'll remind you that in those areas, like in the campus, we have probably the most robust portfolio we've had in a decade. So we're very - in very good shape with the portfolio. And I think again customers - they are in times like these, they want to go with people they trust and know and I think that will work in our favor. But on the - in the areas to your point where we can take share, I think certainly the webscale play that we've been running for the last 4, 4.5 years I think is one area over the next year. I think in the service provider space with the 8000s and recapturing some routing share because of those portfolios and both of those sets of customers, they will continue doing the evaluations and the new deployments, because they have to because they have just requirements that are increasing on a daily basis. And I think that in the carrier space with 5G and the access networks, the backhaul networks, the core networks with the 8000 and some of our other technology we've come out with, I think we can take share there as well. So, I feel good about where we are and the things that we are in control of right now, I think we're in a pretty good position. Yeah. So let me just close quickly by, first of all, thanking all of you for being with us and just telling you all that we hope that you're safe and your family is safe and you continue to be safe. I also want to just reiterate our gratitude for the front line workers and these are the healthcare workers, the first responders, some of our colleagues locally who are in the homeless camps, helping try to stem the tide of this pandemic flowing through those kinds of environments. Those people who live paycheck to paycheck who are struggling right now, our thoughts and prayers are with everybody and our gratitude is especially with those who are on the front lines. We look forward to getting to the other side of this and we look forward to doing our part in helping our customers and helping society actually thrive as much as possible during this very difficult time. So thanks for being with us today on our call."

If you have any objections you may disconnect. Now, I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am you may begin.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks Michelle. Welcome everyone to Cisco's second quarter fiscal 2020 quarterly earnings conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chairman and CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. By now you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides including supplemental information will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and other financial information can also be found in the financial information section of our Investor Relations' website. Throughout this conference call we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements including the guidance we will be providing for the third quarter of fiscal 2020. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. With that, I'll now turn it over to Chuck.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks Marilyn and good afternoon everyone. As we told you last quarter and still see now the feedback from our customers is that they remain strongly committed to both our products and services. However, like many in our industry, we are seeing longer decision-making cycles across our customer segments for a variety of reasons including macro uncertainty as well as unique geographical issues. The good news is once this uncertainty passes for our customers, we expect to see spending recover as technology continues to be at the heart of all they do. You'll see in our numbers this quarter that we continue to make progress on several key metrics including our shift to more software and subscriptions with 72% of our software now being sold as a subscription. While we still have a lot more work to do, I firmly believe we have a tremendous opportunity ahead of us. The long-term secular growth trends of 5G, Wi-Fi 6, 400 gig, and the shift to the cloud remain and we expect to benefit from them. This is a multiyear transformation and we are managing our business well while staying focused on helping our customers build simpler, more secure, and cost-effective networks. The broad adoption of multi-cloud and modern application environments is changing how the world's largest networks are built, operated, and secured and Cisco is at the center of this transition. We have made significant investments in the development of software, silicon, and optics; the building blocks for the Internet of the future. We believe this strategy will change the economics of how the Internet will be built to support 5G, 400 gig, and the demands of the future, while helping our customers innovate and move faster than ever before. In December, we introduced Cisco Silicon One, a first-ever single unified silicon architecture; and the Cisco 8000 carrier-class router family built on Silicon One; as well as our new iOS XR7 operating system. We also announced new flexible purchasing options that enable customers to consume our technology however they choose. We also collaborated closely with several of the largest web-scale and SP companies throughout the development process. Their participation in our launch demonstrates their strong support of our strategy as well as our commitment to continued innovation. Our goal is to accelerate the deployment of next-generation Internet infrastructure by offering our customers choices of components, white box, or integrated systems in a flexible consumption model. Now, let me share a brief update on our businesses starting with infrastructure platforms. As the global leader in networking, we believe we are well positioned with our intent-based networking portfolio given the strategic investments we've been making. Over the past several quarters, we've made tremendous progress integrating automation, analytics, and security across our enterprise networking portfolio, while at the same time shifting to a subscription-based model. A great example of our success is the ongoing strong adoption of our Catalyst 9000 platforms. We continue to extend our secure SD-WAN solutions as customers move more applications to the cloud. To do this, we are actively engaging with web-scale companies to help our customers extend their wide-area networks to the cloud and secure their business applications. Recently, we announced integration with Microsoft, Azure Virtual WAN and Office 365 along with a deeper partnership with Amazon Web Services to deliver highly secure end-to-end connectivity and better application performance. Now to Security. We had another solid quarter with strength across our advanced threat and cloud-based solutions including Duo and Umbrella, which are important growth drivers of our business. We continue to see significant opportunity as we execute on our strategy to deliver an integrated security platform. As the market moves to a multi-cloud environment and the need for visibility grows, we're benefiting from our strong position as our customers' most trusted partner. Our differentiated end-to-end approach across the network, cloud and endpoint is winning customers with 100% of the Fortune 100 now using one or more of Cisco security solutions. This quarter, we expanded our security portfolio from the cloud to the edge. We brought to market an integrated IoT architecture, providing enhanced visibility, insights and threat detection across our customers' entire environment. This architecture includes our new software-based security solutions Cyber Vision; and our Edge Intelligence data collection tool to enable our customers to make better business decisions. Finally Applications. There is no question that customers are undergoing a significant workplace transformation and they are turning to Cisco to help them with this transition. As a global market leader, we believe we are the only company providing a cognitive highly secure and analytics-driven collaboration platform which is the foundation for their workplace transformation. This platform is becoming increasingly critical to how enterprises empower their teams by allowing their employees to work more effectively together. To extend our value proposition, we continue to make strategic investments. For example, we recently brought to market several key WebEx capabilities, which combine context, AI and machine learning to enable our customers and their teams to further enhance their meeting experiences. We achieved another strong quarter of growth with AppDynamics demonstrating our ability to deliver unique real-time AI-powered insights from a single pane of glass providing complete visibility. Our customers are looking to connect application performance monitoring with infrastructure automation to simplify IT and increase productivity. Two weeks ago, we announced we are bringing together AppDynamics and our Intersight Workload Optimizer to deliver comprehensive visibility of applications and infrastructure both on-prem and in the cloud using machine learning and AI to proactively remediate problems and optimize user experiences. To summarize, I am pleased with our business transformation and with the new innovative platforms we're bringing to market. While we continue to experience some pause in customer spending related to the uncertainty in the global macro environment, our long-term growth opportunities remain unchanged. Going forward, we will continue to focus on developing groundbreaking technologies and building a new Internet for the 5G era that will help our customers innovate faster than ever before. I remain incredibly confident that our execution against our strategy will drive profitable growth and generate strong shareholder returns for the long-term. I will now turn it over to Kelly.\nKelly Kramer: Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter followed by the guidance for Q3. Our overall Q2 results were consistent with our expectations. We executed well with strong margins and EPS growth. Total revenue was down $12 billion -- was at $12 billion, down 4%. Our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 33.7%, up 1.6 points. Non-GAAP net income was $3.3 billion, flat year-over-year; and non-GAAP EPS was $0.77, up 5%. Let me provide some more detail on our Q2 revenue. Total product revenue was down 6% to $8.7 billion. Infrastructure Platforms was down 8%. Switching revenue declined in both Campus and Data Center. We did see growth with the continued ramp of our Cat 9K and strength of the Nexus 9K. Routing declined driven by weakness in service provider. Wireless declined overall, but we did see strong growth in Meraki and are starting to see the ramp of our WiFi six products. Data Center revenue declined driven by servers offset by strong growth in HyperFlex. Applications was down 8% driven by a decline in Unified Communications, partially offset by double-digit growth in AppDynamics. Security was 9% with strong performance in identity and access, advanced threat and unified threat management. Service revenue was up 5% driven by software and solution support. We continue to transform our business delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions. Software subscriptions were 72% of total software revenue, up 7 points year-over-year. In terms of orders in Q2, total product orders were down 6%. Looking at our geographies, the Americas was down 8%, EMEA was down 1% and APJC was down 4%. Total emerging markets were down 7% with the BRICs plus Mexico down 20%. In our customer segments, public sector was flat while enterprise was down 7%. Commercial was down 4% and service provider was down 11%. Remaining performance obligations or RPO at the end of Q2 were $24.9 billion, up 11%. From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q2 gross margin was 66.4%, up 2.3 points. Product gross margin was 65.9%, up 3.1 points; and service gross margin was 67.7% flat year-over-year. In terms of the bottom line from a GAAP perspective Q2 net income was $2.9 billion and EPS was $0.68. We ended Q2 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $27.1 billion. Operating cash flow was $3.8 billion flat year-over-year. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $2.4 billion to shareholders during the quarter that was comprised of $0.9 billion of share repurchases and $1.5 billion for our quarterly dividend. Today we announced a $0.01 increase to the quarterly dividend to $0.36 per share up 3% year-over-year. This represents a yield of approximately 2.9% based on today's closing price. This dividend increase reinforces our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders and our confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. In early Q3, we closed our acquisition of Exablaze a designer and manufacturer of advanced network devices aimed at reducing latency and improving network performance. To summarize we executed well with strong margins and EPS growth. We're seeing the returns on the investments we're making in innovation and driving the shift to more software and subscriptions delivering long-term growth and shareholder value. Let me reiterate our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2020. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. We expect revenue to decline in the range of minus 1.5% to minus 3.5% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 64.5% to 65.5%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 32.5% to 33.5% and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 20%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.79 to $0.81. Our guidance does not reflect any potential disruptions in our global supply chain that could result from the coronavirus. We will continue to monitor the situation closely. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into Q&A.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks Kelly. Michelle let's go ahead and open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Tim Long from Barclays, you may go ahead.\nTim Long: Yes. Thank you. Chuck maybe if I could just start talking about the macro and the kind of the longer decision process. In your sense, how long do you think this would last particularly if you maybe put into the context that you mentioned a lot of industry drivers going on in 400 gig and WiFi 6? And obviously you got some new router and silicon products out. So maybe just talk a little bit about the timing of that recovery and how you think you can maybe outperform it given all the different dynamics you have going across the businesses this year?\nChuck Robbins: Yes. Tim thanks. It's a great question. So I think first of all, there are many secular growth drivers that are lined up the 5G transition the 400-gig transition WiFi 6 the shift to cloud. And what we're seeing from customers is really just -- it's just pausing just trying to see what's going on. Now what I'll say is that clearly late in the quarter, if you look at some of the issues that had been outstanding that were creating some of the uncertainty like Brexit, we got closer to resolution. We obviously got a signature late in the quarter on a first phase of the U.S./China trade deal and USMCA has now gone through in the U.S.. So hopefully those will give our customers a little more viability. When I speak to the customers, they're still fully planning on moving forward. They're just a little cautious and trying to see what's going on. We obviously have the virus now that we'll see how it plays out. But overall, I don't think it's deep. And we expect that given some of this uncertainty has now dissipated, notwithstanding what we see obviously from the virus that hopefully, we'll see our customers pick up again.\nTim Long: Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks Tim. Next question please.\nOperator: Tejas Venkatesh from UBS. You may go ahead.\nTejas Venkatesh: Thank you. I had a big-picture question. With the December routing announcements and the Cat 9K before that, a lot of the Cisco strategy is now around selling incremental automation software to lower customer OpEx. That seems to require a significant change in your organization. So how far along are you in the sales and channel transformation to fit that goal? Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: That's a very good question. Thank you. We have done a lot of work on the transformation of being able to support the software model and the subscription software model in particular with the automation. And we have -- if you go back to 2017 when we first launched the Catalyst 9000, and we announced subscription businesses on our enterprise networking portfolio, the second half of this year will have some -- a number of -- a small amount of the early renewals on that. So our team has been working hard to be prepared for those renewals. And then in fiscal 2021 we'll see a material number, a reasonably material number associated with that. So I think the sales organization, we've run pilots and now we've scaled things. We're running other pilots and we're scaling things. And we've got the customer experience organization that Maria Martina is leading that has been building out their capabilities. So we have more to do, but I feel good about the progress we've made, and I think that we're in a pretty good position right now.\nMarilyn Mora: Next question, please.\nOperator: Simon Leopold from Raymond James. You may go ahead.\nSimon Leopold: Thank you very much. I'm wondering if maybe you could talk a little bit more about the service provider vertical given, it's been a long-running challenge and seems as if maybe to some extent it's less of a focus for Cisco given that it's such -- become a smaller part of the business. But I want to see if you can maybe talk about how you see this market eventually recovering kind of the timing and the drivers maybe double-clicking beyond just sort of the 5G hand-waving, if we could get a better understanding of what will drive it and when? Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Simon, it's a lot better just to wave hands. Now let me tell you a little bit. I don't think that it's a market that we are ignoring or we -- in fact, if you look at the announcements we made in December let me give you a little update on that. We have about five years of R&D effort in what we announced in December. So that's a lot of commitment to the market. So we do believe that there will be a resurgence. I think that-- I will talk about 5G and 400 gig as well. But just to give you an update on -- in December as you know we launched Silicon One, which is at the heart of these new systems called Cisco 8000 that we launched. And we also announced that we would be willing to sell our Silicon to go into a white box or sell it just directly to a customer if that's how they like to procure it. I will tell you that across the cloud titans there, we're engaged with all of them on variations of those architectures. Several of them were with us at the announcement in December, which shows you their belief in what we're doing. We have taken orders for both from different cloud players, and so we feel good about the acceptance of that launch. The 8000 series will be a fundamental backbone product for 5G networks and I will tell you that we have early wins on IP infrastructure to support 5G rollouts in over 30 customers around the world. They're early. Some of those are cell site, aggregation, backhaul, some core wins. Most of them are in non-standalone, which means they're enhancing their current networks, and then they'll look to build standalone networks. As we've said, we believe that will start in 2021 where we could begin to see some of that pick up. So we think the 400 gig transition as well as the 5G build-out will be the drivers that we'd be looking for over the next couple of years.\nSimon Leopold: Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks Chuck. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Paul Silverstein from Cowen and Company. You may go ahead. Paul Silverstein, your line is open.\nPaul Silverstein: Sorry, I'm still -- don't know how to use the cellphone. Kelly, your margin structure was particularly strong this quarter and that represents a long-standing trend both near-term and longer-term. I recognize the guidance represents an easing. I assume some of that is due to the backup in DRAM pricing or the pending backup. Can you go back through the drivers and what you expect over the next year or two, so that's gross and the operating level?\nKelly Kramer: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, sure. Happy to. And I know we're really happy about where the -- both gross margins and op margins are. But as you know Paul it's driven by a few things. This software transformation has been benefiting us through both \u2013 you can see it in the mix of our products when we show you the gross margin walks in our Qs as well as just overall so we're benefiting from that. I'd say the second big driver is price. We've been very, very disciplined on price, meaning we're taking advantage of raising prices where we have elasticity for example on really older products that we want to shift to newer products or where we know we have room to move. We've been doing that I think very effectively. We've been managing the decline in the pricing and the server market fairly well balancing that with the DRAM prices that are going down dramatically. So what you're going to see in the reporting this quarter Paul and I know you always ask you'll see our pricing. I mentioned in the last quarter's call that pricing was at an all-time lowest level of impact meaning the most beneficial it's been. We're right back at 1.1 points on our year-over-year gross margin walk, so it's still very, very good for us and more in line of what it was I'd say a couple of quarters before Q1. So that's going well. DRAM is benefiting us this quarter for sure. And as you know that's becoming less and less of a benefit to us now as we're starting to see the DRAM prices tick back up. But we again manage that pricing and DRAM cost equation very well. So just in general I think you can expect a little bit more pressure from DRAM pricing the year-over-year compares getting less which is why I guided what I guided. But overall you're still going to see the goodness coming through from the continued increase of our business being software driven.\nPaul Silverstein: Kelly, if I could just quickly follow up. Looking beyond the quarter, looking beyond April, given the ongoing shift to software is there any reason why margins should continue to head up putting aside quarterly volatility?\nKelly Kramer: Yes. I mean, again, I would say yes, because what we're doing on the portfolio is more and more software content. So by definition it will be good for us. We will always have the potential for large swings for things like component costs like DRAM plus or minus. But as always, we'll let you know when those are happening. But yes, I mean, if you go back and look three years back from where we were there to where we are now it is long term just the shift of the overall portfolio that we've been driving.\nPaul Silverstein: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks. Next question please\nOperator: Jim Suva from Citigroup Investment Research. You may go ahead sir\nJim Suva: Thank you very much for the clarity so far. And I had one question that's kind of more broad. I don't know if it's \u2013 for which of you. But on product orders, I was just kind of looking and thinking about the product orders. It looks like the enterprise product orders got incrementally a little more challenged. Public sector got a little more challenged. Service provider marginally improved compared to last quarter year-over-year. So can you maybe just give us some color on product orders? It looks like maybe enterprise a little difficult year-over-year comps. Was it last year a big product cycle in enterprise? Or why are we actually seeing enterprise kind of decline incrementally a little bit worse? Thank you.\nKelly Kramer: Yes. Hey, Jim good question and let me take a crack at it. So when I look at the segment it's \u2013 if I focus on enterprise, a lot of it is the Q2 2019 really, really strong product cycle ramps we had. So if I go back to Q2 2019, it was a record for the campus switching for \u2013 as well as for Collaboration back in Q2 2019. No excuse, but that's what that was. I would say beyond that if I would isolate overall kind of our regions from a bookings point of view, the Americas was down 8%. And if I look at that the U.S. itself was slightly better but in that range and I'd say it was driven by two areas. It was driven by the routing portfolio largely SP segment. That was the biggest driver. And the second biggest driver was the decline we're seeing in the server market. And again that's directly related to the decline of DRAM prices flowing through the entire market and we saw that last quarter as well. So that drove the Americas. Europe was at minus 1% basically flat. But that \u2013 the biggest driver when I look at Europe was really the U.K. We are seeing a slowdown because of Brexit and we did see it in the public sector significantly, which is always a big growth driver for the U.K. for us. So U.K. both enterprise and public sector has slowed down for us, which drove Europe. Europe would have been up 2 points without the U.K. And then for APJC, it continues to be the rapid decline of China. China, as I've talked about and the BRICS plus Mexico being down, China was down again over 30%. It's still only about 2% of our total business, but it still hurts the overall -- I mean, Asia Pac, excluding China, would have been up a couple of points as well, 3 points. So from geography, those are the key drivers. And, again, to your point, we are going off against some tough compares in enterprise for both the Catalyst 9K ramp a year ago and Collab just had a record quarter.\nJim Suva : Thank you. That was a great explanation and greatly appreciated. Thank you so much.\nKelly Kramer: Thanks Jim.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks Jim. Next question, please.\nOperator: Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer & Company. You may go ahead, sir.\nIttai Kidron: Thanks. Chuck, I wanted to dig into applications, down 8% on a year-over-year basis. And I understand the pressure on the unified communications business and it's good to see AppD is still growing. But you haven't talked WebEx. Am I to assume that WebEx is not growing, stuck in the middle here? Help me think about the transformation AMI has been doing over there, where we are in that transformation? And how should I think about the growth and competitiveness of that platform going forward?\nChuck Robbins: Yes. I think the -- first of all, they have re-architected all those platforms, integrated the back ends and have a very modern set of solutions to take to market. And we're currently working -- I was talking to the team yesterday. I think, there's 11 workshops with major customers in the next 30 days to work on plans, to get them to the modern portfolio, because some customers have been running variations of the stuff that we've had out there for 10 to 15 years, so we're in good shape. In fact, there was a great analyst report that was written just a couple of days ago about -- industry analyst, about the portfolio and how far it's come and how effective it is right now. So I feel good about what they're doing. I think if you look back a year ago flat out -- Collab was up 24%. I mean -- and it's a huge business to be up that much. So they had a very tough year to compare against, but I'm pleased with where they are. There is competition. Obviously, there's some good competition in the space, which frankly should just keep making us better. But the team is doing, I think, a really good job. Kelly, do you want to comment on -- \nKelly Kramer: Yes. I mean, I'll just give you the -- I'd say, the largest driver was the UC business and the revenue being down, the huge majority followed, by a bit on the endpoints on the TP. And conferencing was down marginally, hardly anything. So the biggest driver was for sure on the Unified Communications side.\nIttai Kidron: Very good. All right. Good luck, guys. \nKelly Kramer: Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Jeff Kvaal from Nomura. You may go ahead.\nJeff Kvaal: Yes. Thank you very much for taking the question. I was hoping that you could unpack, sort of, a bit of a bigger downtick, maybe, in IP than we were expecting a balanced by a better performance on the services line. Can you sort of help us understand what the dynamics are and some of that maybe accounting for where the software goes? I'd love to understand that a little bit better, please.\nKelly Kramer: Yes. I would say -- I've talked about this. On the service increase, there's been no change on the accounting side for how we account for software. Service improvement, we've been really driving that. Maria Martinez, the lead CX for customer experience, has been really focused on driving renewal rates and adoption. And you've seen our services business from a revenue perspective tick up over the last four quarters. So, I'd say, that 5% growth you saw in services is just continued performance by that team to do that. I'd say, on the infrastructure platform side, it does go back to, again, just very, very -- we were peak -- not peak, but we were very, very high ramping of Campus, switching last year that -- so that's a tougher compare. I mean, it's still growing like crazy, but that's a big driver. Routing is still down, driven by the SP segment. And then in terms of the last piece from a year, again, we talk about, and you saw that applications was up 24%, again, which was all Collab basically, a year ago as well. So it's nothing more than those things, I would say. Combined with, just the data center server market, is -- we're starting to feel that, you can see what's happening in the market there.\nJeff Kvaal: Does that imply, Kelly, that that 5% services growth rate is a durable number? Or should we be thinking it will fluctuate between that and the sort of low single-digit growth that we've seen?\nKelly Kramer: Well, we certainly \u2013 we're certainly trying to make that a sustainable kind of range. We have no desire to have that slowdown. But again, it's \u2013 the team is doing everything they can. They're offering new solutions not just \u2013 they're trying to find more ways to drive incremental growth versus just being tied to the maintenance to the product orders. And they're driving much more solutions along software and everything else, so they're working a lot of plays in the services area.\nJeff Kvaal: Obviously they are. Congratulations. Thank you.\nKelly Kramer: Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Next question, please.\nOperator: Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead, sir.\nRod Hall: Yeah. Thanks for fitting me in. I just had a quick question trying to juxtapose the guidance with the order rates. If you look at the total product orders, the rate they're down 6%; after down 4%. So that deteriorated. And yeah, your revenue guidance for the midpoint at least your revenue decline is a little better than last the quarter you just printed. So you printed down 3.5%; and the guide down 2.5%. So kind of tailing on Jeff's question there is the services making that up? And what should we be expecting for product revenue in the guided quarter? And then, I also \u2013 I'm hoping Chuck maybe you'll make a comment on this whole 5G investment commentary coming out of the press and maybe the government. What do you think about \u2013 how interested is Cisco in potentially helping deploy U.S. wireless infrastructure not the stuff you do today, but actual base stations and things like that? Could you just comment on how you see some of those \u2013 that commentary, how you think that might develop?\nChuck Robbins: You want to go first?\nKelly Kramer: Yeah. I can go first. Yes. Your question is a good question Rod, but I would say really the \u2013 where we ended up at the minus 6% was not a surprise. That's kind of when I gave guidance for the Q2 kind of what the expectation was. I would say, as you know when we roll up \u2013 when we roll up the guide as we go for Q3 we just \u2013 it's the same process and we know exactly what's coming off the balance sheet. We have \u2013 we know exactly what's in backlog. We know exactly what we expect for orders coming in and it's just pure math. I think again back to a lot of the decline in the order rate was there's a bit of compares. But the rest when you do the math and add it all up to what you expect to come through for the next quarter it gives you the number I guided the midpoint. If you look at that it's very consistent with what our normal Q3 to Q2 sequentials are.\nRod Hall: Excellent.\nChuck Robbins: And then Rod on the question around the 5G discussions in Washington, I mean, obviously they're very interested in having U.S. companies participating in 5G and frankly lead in 5G. And so we have spent a lot of time educating different folks in Washington about what technologies actually constitute an entire 5G network. So you rightly said not the stuff we have, but the radio which is pretty much what we don't have. But I think that \u2013 I think the U.S. is in really good shape. I think we have packet core. We've got cell site and radio backhaul. We got the IP routing core. We got security and we have \u2013 obviously, there's a couple of companies in Europe one in South Korea that provide the radio technology. There's also software players that are out there right now that are building disaggregated open RAN solutions that can be used in the future. And so we're spending a lot of time helping them understand that and working to just make sure that there's a recognition that there's a lot of technology that's been built and being built here in the United States that is leading in these 5G infrastructures. And I actually, think the U.S. is in fine shape. I think both from a carrier deployment perspective, I think we're in great shape, and I think we're in good position with the technology. I don't think the U.S. government should make investments in these companies, but we are certainly working with lots of industry peers again on both education, and then trying to just make sure that the U.S. does have solutions with combining these European players with a lot of our technologies to make sure that everyone's comfortable with those solutions.\nRod Hall: That's great Thanks, Chuck.\nChuck Robbins: Yeah.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks Chuck. Next question, please.\nOperator: Sami Badri from Credit Suisse. You may go ahead.\nSami Badri: Thank you. I would like to ask about the SP orders that were down 11% in the quarter. And looking forward to the back half of this year and any kind of forward-looking indicator trajectory commentary would be helpful. If we look at two scenarios; one scenario assuming a recent telecom consolidation, right that we've all heard about in the last two days; and then the scenario where no consolidation actually happens for the rest of the year. Should we expect service provider orders to inflect positively in one of those scenarios or in both of those scenarios as we look at the back half and maybe kind of mid to back half of 2020?\nChuck Robbins: That's a tough question to answer. We've been dealing with challenges in this segment for a long time. I think the -- history would tell you that when we see consolidation, it creates a slowing. I'm not sure that this particular one represents that because I think they are going to be an investment mode and is triggering investment with other players as well. And I think the 5G build-out that all of them are working on will probably fuel investment. I think for us it just depends on how quickly they do that and how soon they decide to build a standalone 5G network for enterprises. I think most of them are looking at their consumer networks and believing they can accommodate them on their existing backbones with perhaps some minor upgrades, but I think that will determine it. So, I think it's more connected to how fast they move on that than it has to do with any of the consolidation or no consolidation right now.\nSami Badri: Got it. Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Next question please.\nOperator: Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan, you may go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to see if we can drill down a bit more on the Cat 9000 product portfolio. You mentioned already a couple of times on the call that the product momentum -- the revenue momentum there is quite strong. I was just wondering if you can kind of talk about the impact on the growth rate that you've kind of seen directionally through this kind of broader landscape of slowing enterprise spending and if the growth rate there is kind of still substantially different from what you're seeing for the rest of the portfolio. Is it -- do you think it's more a reflection of the subscription kind of model that you're going with on that portfolio or more kind of the refresh that's driving that difference and kind of what you're seeing related to the rest of the portfolio?\nKelly Kramer: Yes. I'll just say the growth rate of the Cat 9000 is unbelievable still. I mean it is a very high double-digit number. I would say there's no -- we haven't heard issues. I'd say for maybe some of the smaller DCEs there's a question about the subscription but we've managed through that. But I would say those the new products from the 9200 through the 9600 that isn't slowing and the growth rates are very, very strong. Obviously, the legacy products that they have replaced are falling off as you would expect, but we have not seen any slow on the transition. It's the fast -- and again, we mentioned this in the early ramp of the Cat 9000, but at this point the percentage of what the Cat 9000 as of total campus switching is the fastest ramp of any transition we've done.\nChuck Robbins: And if you look at the -- what Kelly talked about earlier with Wi-Fi 6 beginning to ramp, that's a subscription model. Our Meraki business is a subscription model which is still growing very well. So, I don't think the subscription model has anything to do with it. I just think in certain cases some of our larger customers who are watching some of the things going on just decided to just take a pause and take a look at what's happening and then I think they'll kick back in.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay. Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Great. Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Tal Liani from Bank of America Securities, you may go ahead sir.\nTal Liani: Yes. Hi. I want to ask you a broader question and I will call it secular versus cyclical. Switching had a small cycle short cycle with a new switch. There was growth acceleration. Now, we see a decline overall in switching and there's probably substitution between new and old and routing is also declining. And the question I'm asking is of the trends you see today, data center switching, campus switching, routing, service providers what is cyclical and what is secular? Meaning when are we going to see a reversal -- or not when in terms of timing. What's going to drive I should say -- what's going to drive a reversal of the trends in routing? What could drive? What could drive a reversal in data centers and campuses? What are the things that could drive at least a cyclical growth from here or even secular growth kind of longer term? Thanks.\nChuck Robbins: So Tal, it's great question. I think in the routing space is simply it's the 5G backbone build-out that we've been talking about for a few years. Once that starts I think -- given the percentage of our routing business that is attributed to service providers, I think that's the key as well as us winning these Cisco 8000 insertions that we have proof of concepts going on today with many of the large customers both service provider and web-scale players. So, I think that's that one. And I think on the campus side, I just think that's just a timing issue. I think that the growth we're seeing in the Catalyst 9000 is tremendous. And I think that customers that began to build out their refresh. Given where we are as a percentage of the installed base that we have replaced, it's got a long road ahead of it. I think that the only reason that we saw a little slowdown is just because customers just decided to pause the deployments a bit. But I think that that will come back when this uncertainty and the capital spending frees up.\nTal Liani: And routing?\nChuck Robbins: Routing, I answered first with the SP with the 5G backbone stuff, because of how big a percentage service provider represents in our routing portfolio.\nTal Liani: Okay. Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Tal. Next question please.\nOperator: Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.\nMeta Marshall: Great, thanks. With subscriptions being 72% of software revenue, which you stated, I wondered if you kind of had an update as to how much of a headwind that kind of business model transition is. In the past you kind of said a couple of hundred basis points. But just any \u2013 directionally, if that's still about right would be helpful. Thanks.\nKelly Kramer: Yeah. I mean again, I think back a few years ago before we adopted the new revenue standards, it was a bigger impact. It was up to like 250 or 300 basis points with ASC 606. It's come back down to the 100 basis points. But at this point, we don't even talk about it that way because we've been ramping so quickly the entire portfolio to that. But at max, it would be I'd say 100 bps or so.\nMeta Marshall: Great, thanks.\nMarilyn Mora: Yes. We have time for one more question, Michelle, for one more.\nOperator: Thank you. Jim Fish from Piper Sandler. You may go ahead, sir.\nJim Fish: Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. One part that we haven't talked about here today is on the security side. We have RSA coming up at the end of the month. So just wondering if we could double-click on where we are with Duo and Umbrella together as it seems like they're the biggest drivers of the business? Can you guys talk a little bit more about the contribution of these two specifically to the portfolio and how Umbrella specifically is impacting your adoption of secure SD-WAN versus some of the other vendors that are out there? Thanks.\nChuck Robbins: Yes. So, I'll give you the sort of the qualitative answer and Kelly can give you something on the data. But I think the secure SD-WAN is, the solution that our customers are looking for. I mean they want the integration with their cloud gateways from their branches. And so, it is a key differentiator for us. Our teams are working hard on continuing to build that out. And I think, over the next couple of years, it will continue to -- it will be even more of a differentiator as we continue to get more and more integration between those two portfolios. Kelly?\nKelly Kramer: Yeah. No. I'd say that's absolutely right. And in terms of how important Umbrella and Duo are they absolutely are the key growth drivers for us, the whole cloud security space for us. And will continue to be so. And I'd say we recently launched our Security in a great way, which is just starting. And that will be all part of our cloud security portfolio as well. And we expect that to be a huge growth driver as well.\nJim Fish: Got it, thanks.\nMarilyn Mora: Yes.\nChuck Robbins: Thank you. All right, well let me just thank everyone for joining us today. And I'll just recap by saying that while we have seen a bit of a pause, we actually feel really good. The conversations I have with our customers, I mean all of the things they're trying to do I believe, our technology is at the heart of. Whether it's, rebuilding their applications, whether securing their data, transforming their infrastructure in this new era or changing their user experience as well as the way they interface with their customers. I think that we're in a very good position to help them do that. And we feel good about where we are. So thank you all for joining us today. And we'll look forward to catching up with you next quarter.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Chuck. Just to wrap the call, Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call which will reflect our fiscal 2020 third quarter results will be on, Wednesday May 13 2020 at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time, 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.

            "name": "Kelly Kramer",
            "content": "Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter followed by the guidance for Q3. Our overall Q2 results were consistent with our expectations. We executed well with strong margins and EPS growth. Total revenue was down $12 billion -- was at $12 billion, down 4%. Our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 33.7%, up 1.6 points. Non-GAAP net income was $3.3 billion, flat year-over-year; and non-GAAP EPS was $0.77, up 5%. Let me provide some more detail on our Q2 revenue. Total product revenue was down 6% to $8.7 billion. Infrastructure Platforms was down 8%. Switching revenue declined in both Campus and Data Center. We did see growth with the continued ramp of our Cat 9K and strength of the Nexus 9K. Routing declined driven by weakness in service provider. Wireless declined overall, but we did see strong growth in Meraki and are starting to see the ramp of our WiFi six products. Data Center revenue declined driven by servers offset by strong growth in HyperFlex. Applications was down 8% driven by a decline in Unified Communications, partially offset by double-digit growth in AppDynamics. Security was 9% with strong performance in identity and access, advanced threat and unified threat management. Service revenue was up 5% driven by software and solution support. We continue to transform our business delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions. Software subscriptions were 72% of total software revenue, up 7 points year-over-year. In terms of orders in Q2, total product orders were down 6%. Looking at our geographies, the Americas was down 8%, EMEA was down 1% and APJC was down 4%. Total emerging markets were down 7% with the BRICs plus Mexico down 20%. In our customer segments, public sector was flat while enterprise was down 7%. Commercial was down 4% and service provider was down 11%. Remaining performance obligations or RPO at the end of Q2 were $24.9 billion, up 11%. From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q2 gross margin was 66.4%, up 2.3 points. Product gross margin was 65.9%, up 3.1 points; and service gross margin was 67.7% flat year-over-year. In terms of the bottom line from a GAAP perspective Q2 net income was $2.9 billion and EPS was $0.68. We ended Q2 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $27.1 billion. Operating cash flow was $3.8 billion flat year-over-year. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $2.4 billion to shareholders during the quarter that was comprised of $0.9 billion of share repurchases and $1.5 billion for our quarterly dividend. Today we announced a $0.01 increase to the quarterly dividend to $0.36 per share up 3% year-over-year. This represents a yield of approximately 2.9% based on today's closing price. This dividend increase reinforces our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders and our confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. In early Q3, we closed our acquisition of Exablaze a designer and manufacturer of advanced network devices aimed at reducing latency and improving network performance. To summarize we executed well with strong margins and EPS growth. We're seeing the returns on the investments we're making in innovation and driving the shift to more software and subscriptions delivering long-term growth and shareholder value. Let me reiterate our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2020. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. We expect revenue to decline in the range of minus 1.5% to minus 3.5% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 64.5% to 65.5%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 32.5% to 33.5% and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 20%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.79 to $0.81. Our guidance does not reflect any potential disruptions in our global supply chain that could result from the coronavirus. We will continue to monitor the situation closely. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into Q&A. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, sure. Happy to. And I know we're really happy about where the -- both gross margins and op margins are. But as you know Paul it's driven by a few things. This software transformation has been benefiting us through both \u2013 you can see it in the mix of our products when we show you the gross margin walks in our Qs as well as just overall so we're benefiting from that. I'd say the second big driver is price. We've been very, very disciplined on price, meaning we're taking advantage of raising prices where we have elasticity for example on really older products that we want to shift to newer products or where we know we have room to move. We've been doing that I think very effectively. We've been managing the decline in the pricing and the server market fairly well balancing that with the DRAM prices that are going down dramatically. So what you're going to see in the reporting this quarter Paul and I know you always ask you'll see our pricing. I mentioned in the last quarter's call that pricing was at an all-time lowest level of impact meaning the most beneficial it's been. We're right back at 1.1 points on our year-over-year gross margin walk, so it's still very, very good for us and more in line of what it was I'd say a couple of quarters before Q1. So that's going well. DRAM is benefiting us this quarter for sure. And as you know that's becoming less and less of a benefit to us now as we're starting to see the DRAM prices tick back up. But we again manage that pricing and DRAM cost equation very well. So just in general I think you can expect a little bit more pressure from DRAM pricing the year-over-year compares getting less which is why I guided what I guided. But overall you're still going to see the goodness coming through from the continued increase of our business being software driven. Yes. I mean, again, I would say yes, because what we're doing on the portfolio is more and more software content. So by definition it will be good for us. We will always have the potential for large swings for things like component costs like DRAM plus or minus. But as always, we'll let you know when those are happening. But yes, I mean, if you go back and look three years back from where we were there to where we are now it is long term just the shift of the overall portfolio that we've been driving. Yes. Hey, Jim good question and let me take a crack at it. So when I look at the segment it's \u2013 if I focus on enterprise, a lot of it is the Q2 2019 really, really strong product cycle ramps we had. So if I go back to Q2 2019, it was a record for the campus switching for \u2013 as well as for Collaboration back in Q2 2019. No excuse, but that's what that was. I would say beyond that if I would isolate overall kind of our regions from a bookings point of view, the Americas was down 8%. And if I look at that the U.S. itself was slightly better but in that range and I'd say it was driven by two areas. It was driven by the routing portfolio largely SP segment. That was the biggest driver. And the second biggest driver was the decline we're seeing in the server market. And again that's directly related to the decline of DRAM prices flowing through the entire market and we saw that last quarter as well. So that drove the Americas. Europe was at minus 1% basically flat. But that \u2013 the biggest driver when I look at Europe was really the U.K. We are seeing a slowdown because of Brexit and we did see it in the public sector significantly, which is always a big growth driver for the U.K. for us. So U.K. both enterprise and public sector has slowed down for us, which drove Europe. Europe would have been up 2 points without the U.K. And then for APJC, it continues to be the rapid decline of China. China, as I've talked about and the BRICS plus Mexico being down, China was down again over 30%. It's still only about 2% of our total business, but it still hurts the overall -- I mean, Asia Pac, excluding China, would have been up a couple of points as well, 3 points. So from geography, those are the key drivers. And, again, to your point, we are going off against some tough compares in enterprise for both the Catalyst 9K ramp a year ago and Collab just had a record quarter. Thanks Jim. Yes. I mean, I'll just give you the -- I'd say, the largest driver was the UC business and the revenue being down, the huge majority followed, by a bit on the endpoints on the TP. And conferencing was down marginally, hardly anything. So the biggest driver was for sure on the Unified Communications side. Thank you. Yes. I would say -- I've talked about this. On the service increase, there's been no change on the accounting side for how we account for software. Service improvement, we've been really driving that. Maria Martinez, the lead CX for customer experience, has been really focused on driving renewal rates and adoption. And you've seen our services business from a revenue perspective tick up over the last four quarters. So, I'd say, that 5% growth you saw in services is just continued performance by that team to do that. I'd say, on the infrastructure platform side, it does go back to, again, just very, very -- we were peak -- not peak, but we were very, very high ramping of Campus, switching last year that -- so that's a tougher compare. I mean, it's still growing like crazy, but that's a big driver. Routing is still down, driven by the SP segment. And then in terms of the last piece from a year, again, we talk about, and you saw that applications was up 24%, again, which was all Collab basically, a year ago as well. So it's nothing more than those things, I would say. Combined with, just the data center server market, is -- we're starting to feel that, you can see what's happening in the market there. Well, we certainly \u2013 we're certainly trying to make that a sustainable kind of range. We have no desire to have that slowdown. But again, it's \u2013 the team is doing everything they can. They're offering new solutions not just \u2013 they're trying to find more ways to drive incremental growth versus just being tied to the maintenance to the product orders. And they're driving much more solutions along software and everything else, so they're working a lot of plays in the services area. Thank you. Yeah. I can go first. Yes. Your question is a good question Rod, but I would say really the \u2013 where we ended up at the minus 6% was not a surprise. That's kind of when I gave guidance for the Q2 kind of what the expectation was. I would say, as you know when we roll up \u2013 when we roll up the guide as we go for Q3 we just \u2013 it's the same process and we know exactly what's coming off the balance sheet. We have \u2013 we know exactly what's in backlog. We know exactly what we expect for orders coming in and it's just pure math. I think again back to a lot of the decline in the order rate was there's a bit of compares. But the rest when you do the math and add it all up to what you expect to come through for the next quarter it gives you the number I guided the midpoint. If you look at that it's very consistent with what our normal Q3 to Q2 sequentials are. Yes. I'll just say the growth rate of the Cat 9000 is unbelievable still. I mean it is a very high double-digit number. I would say there's no -- we haven't heard issues. I'd say for maybe some of the smaller DCEs there's a question about the subscription but we've managed through that. But I would say those the new products from the 9200 through the 9600 that isn't slowing and the growth rates are very, very strong. Obviously, the legacy products that they have replaced are falling off as you would expect, but we have not seen any slow on the transition. It's the fast -- and again, we mentioned this in the early ramp of the Cat 9000, but at this point the percentage of what the Cat 9000 as of total campus switching is the fastest ramp of any transition we've done. Yeah. I mean again, I think back a few years ago before we adopted the new revenue standards, it was a bigger impact. It was up to like 250 or 300 basis points with ASC 606. It's come back down to the 100 basis points. But at this point, we don't even talk about it that way because we've been ramping so quickly the entire portfolio to that. But at max, it would be I'd say 100 bps or so. Yeah. No. I'd say that's absolutely right. And in terms of how important Umbrella and Duo are they absolutely are the key growth drivers for us, the whole cloud security space for us. And will continue to be so. And I'd say we recently launched our Security in a great way, which is just starting. And that will be all part of our cloud security portfolio as well. And we expect that to be a huge growth driver as well."

            "name": "Chuck Robbins",
            "content": "Thanks Marilyn and good afternoon everyone. As we told you last quarter and still see now the feedback from our customers is that they remain strongly committed to both our products and services. However, like many in our industry, we are seeing longer decision-making cycles across our customer segments for a variety of reasons including macro uncertainty as well as unique geographical issues. The good news is once this uncertainty passes for our customers, we expect to see spending recover as technology continues to be at the heart of all they do. You'll see in our numbers this quarter that we continue to make progress on several key metrics including our shift to more software and subscriptions with 72% of our software now being sold as a subscription. While we still have a lot more work to do, I firmly believe we have a tremendous opportunity ahead of us. The long-term secular growth trends of 5G, Wi-Fi 6, 400 gig, and the shift to the cloud remain and we expect to benefit from them. This is a multiyear transformation and we are managing our business well while staying focused on helping our customers build simpler, more secure, and cost-effective networks. The broad adoption of multi-cloud and modern application environments is changing how the world's largest networks are built, operated, and secured and Cisco is at the center of this transition. We have made significant investments in the development of software, silicon, and optics; the building blocks for the Internet of the future. We believe this strategy will change the economics of how the Internet will be built to support 5G, 400 gig, and the demands of the future, while helping our customers innovate and move faster than ever before. In December, we introduced Cisco Silicon One, a first-ever single unified silicon architecture; and the Cisco 8000 carrier-class router family built on Silicon One; as well as our new iOS XR7 operating system. We also announced new flexible purchasing options that enable customers to consume our technology however they choose. We also collaborated closely with several of the largest web-scale and SP companies throughout the development process. Their participation in our launch demonstrates their strong support of our strategy as well as our commitment to continued innovation. Our goal is to accelerate the deployment of next-generation Internet infrastructure by offering our customers choices of components, white box, or integrated systems in a flexible consumption model. Now, let me share a brief update on our businesses starting with infrastructure platforms. As the global leader in networking, we believe we are well positioned with our intent-based networking portfolio given the strategic investments we've been making. Over the past several quarters, we've made tremendous progress integrating automation, analytics, and security across our enterprise networking portfolio, while at the same time shifting to a subscription-based model. A great example of our success is the ongoing strong adoption of our Catalyst 9000 platforms. We continue to extend our secure SD-WAN solutions as customers move more applications to the cloud. To do this, we are actively engaging with web-scale companies to help our customers extend their wide-area networks to the cloud and secure their business applications. Recently, we announced integration with Microsoft, Azure Virtual WAN and Office 365 along with a deeper partnership with Amazon Web Services to deliver highly secure end-to-end connectivity and better application performance. Now to Security. We had another solid quarter with strength across our advanced threat and cloud-based solutions including Duo and Umbrella, which are important growth drivers of our business. We continue to see significant opportunity as we execute on our strategy to deliver an integrated security platform. As the market moves to a multi-cloud environment and the need for visibility grows, we're benefiting from our strong position as our customers' most trusted partner. Our differentiated end-to-end approach across the network, cloud and endpoint is winning customers with 100% of the Fortune 100 now using one or more of Cisco security solutions. This quarter, we expanded our security portfolio from the cloud to the edge. We brought to market an integrated IoT architecture, providing enhanced visibility, insights and threat detection across our customers' entire environment. This architecture includes our new software-based security solutions Cyber Vision; and our Edge Intelligence data collection tool to enable our customers to make better business decisions. Finally Applications. There is no question that customers are undergoing a significant workplace transformation and they are turning to Cisco to help them with this transition. As a global market leader, we believe we are the only company providing a cognitive highly secure and analytics-driven collaboration platform which is the foundation for their workplace transformation. This platform is becoming increasingly critical to how enterprises empower their teams by allowing their employees to work more effectively together. To extend our value proposition, we continue to make strategic investments. For example, we recently brought to market several key WebEx capabilities, which combine context, AI and machine learning to enable our customers and their teams to further enhance their meeting experiences. We achieved another strong quarter of growth with AppDynamics demonstrating our ability to deliver unique real-time AI-powered insights from a single pane of glass providing complete visibility. Our customers are looking to connect application performance monitoring with infrastructure automation to simplify IT and increase productivity. Two weeks ago, we announced we are bringing together AppDynamics and our Intersight Workload Optimizer to deliver comprehensive visibility of applications and infrastructure both on-prem and in the cloud using machine learning and AI to proactively remediate problems and optimize user experiences. To summarize, I am pleased with our business transformation and with the new innovative platforms we're bringing to market. While we continue to experience some pause in customer spending related to the uncertainty in the global macro environment, our long-term growth opportunities remain unchanged. Going forward, we will continue to focus on developing groundbreaking technologies and building a new Internet for the 5G era that will help our customers innovate faster than ever before. I remain incredibly confident that our execution against our strategy will drive profitable growth and generate strong shareholder returns for the long-term. I will now turn it over to Kelly. Yes. Tim thanks. It's a great question. So I think first of all, there are many secular growth drivers that are lined up the 5G transition the 400-gig transition WiFi 6 the shift to cloud. And what we're seeing from customers is really just -- it's just pausing just trying to see what's going on. Now what I'll say is that clearly late in the quarter, if you look at some of the issues that had been outstanding that were creating some of the uncertainty like Brexit, we got closer to resolution. We obviously got a signature late in the quarter on a first phase of the U.S./China trade deal and USMCA has now gone through in the U.S.. So hopefully those will give our customers a little more viability. When I speak to the customers, they're still fully planning on moving forward. They're just a little cautious and trying to see what's going on. We obviously have the virus now that we'll see how it plays out. But overall, I don't think it's deep. And we expect that given some of this uncertainty has now dissipated, notwithstanding what we see obviously from the virus that hopefully, we'll see our customers pick up again. That's a very good question. Thank you. We have done a lot of work on the transformation of being able to support the software model and the subscription software model in particular with the automation. And we have -- if you go back to 2017 when we first launched the Catalyst 9000, and we announced subscription businesses on our enterprise networking portfolio, the second half of this year will have some -- a number of -- a small amount of the early renewals on that. So our team has been working hard to be prepared for those renewals. And then in fiscal 2021 we'll see a material number, a reasonably material number associated with that. So I think the sales organization, we've run pilots and now we've scaled things. We're running other pilots and we're scaling things. And we've got the customer experience organization that Maria Martina is leading that has been building out their capabilities. So we have more to do, but I feel good about the progress we've made, and I think that we're in a pretty good position right now. Simon, it's a lot better just to wave hands. Now let me tell you a little bit. I don't think that it's a market that we are ignoring or we -- in fact, if you look at the announcements we made in December let me give you a little update on that. We have about five years of R&D effort in what we announced in December. So that's a lot of commitment to the market. So we do believe that there will be a resurgence. I think that-- I will talk about 5G and 400 gig as well. But just to give you an update on -- in December as you know we launched Silicon One, which is at the heart of these new systems called Cisco 8000 that we launched. And we also announced that we would be willing to sell our Silicon to go into a white box or sell it just directly to a customer if that's how they like to procure it. I will tell you that across the cloud titans there, we're engaged with all of them on variations of those architectures. Several of them were with us at the announcement in December, which shows you their belief in what we're doing. We have taken orders for both from different cloud players, and so we feel good about the acceptance of that launch. The 8000 series will be a fundamental backbone product for 5G networks and I will tell you that we have early wins on IP infrastructure to support 5G rollouts in over 30 customers around the world. They're early. Some of those are cell site, aggregation, backhaul, some core wins. Most of them are in non-standalone, which means they're enhancing their current networks, and then they'll look to build standalone networks. As we've said, we believe that will start in 2021 where we could begin to see some of that pick up. So we think the 400 gig transition as well as the 5G build-out will be the drivers that we'd be looking for over the next couple of years. Yes. I think the -- first of all, they have re-architected all those platforms, integrated the back ends and have a very modern set of solutions to take to market. And we're currently working -- I was talking to the team yesterday. I think, there's 11 workshops with major customers in the next 30 days to work on plans, to get them to the modern portfolio, because some customers have been running variations of the stuff that we've had out there for 10 to 15 years, so we're in good shape. In fact, there was a great analyst report that was written just a couple of days ago about -- industry analyst, about the portfolio and how far it's come and how effective it is right now. So I feel good about what they're doing. I think if you look back a year ago flat out -- Collab was up 24%. I mean -- and it's a huge business to be up that much. So they had a very tough year to compare against, but I'm pleased with where they are. There is competition. Obviously, there's some good competition in the space, which frankly should just keep making us better. But the team is doing, I think, a really good job. Kelly, do you want to comment on -- You want to go first? And then Rod on the question around the 5G discussions in Washington, I mean, obviously they're very interested in having U.S. companies participating in 5G and frankly lead in 5G. And so we have spent a lot of time educating different folks in Washington about what technologies actually constitute an entire 5G network. So you rightly said not the stuff we have, but the radio which is pretty much what we don't have. But I think that \u2013 I think the U.S. is in really good shape. I think we have packet core. We've got cell site and radio backhaul. We got the IP routing core. We got security and we have \u2013 obviously, there's a couple of companies in Europe one in South Korea that provide the radio technology. There's also software players that are out there right now that are building disaggregated open RAN solutions that can be used in the future. And so we're spending a lot of time helping them understand that and working to just make sure that there's a recognition that there's a lot of technology that's been built and being built here in the United States that is leading in these 5G infrastructures. And I actually, think the U.S. is in fine shape. I think both from a carrier deployment perspective, I think we're in great shape, and I think we're in good position with the technology. I don't think the U.S. government should make investments in these companies, but we are certainly working with lots of industry peers again on both education, and then trying to just make sure that the U.S. does have solutions with combining these European players with a lot of our technologies to make sure that everyone's comfortable with those solutions. Yeah. That's a tough question to answer. We've been dealing with challenges in this segment for a long time. I think the -- history would tell you that when we see consolidation, it creates a slowing. I'm not sure that this particular one represents that because I think they are going to be an investment mode and is triggering investment with other players as well. And I think the 5G build-out that all of them are working on will probably fuel investment. I think for us it just depends on how quickly they do that and how soon they decide to build a standalone 5G network for enterprises. I think most of them are looking at their consumer networks and believing they can accommodate them on their existing backbones with perhaps some minor upgrades, but I think that will determine it. So, I think it's more connected to how fast they move on that than it has to do with any of the consolidation or no consolidation right now. And if you look at the -- what Kelly talked about earlier with Wi-Fi 6 beginning to ramp, that's a subscription model. Our Meraki business is a subscription model which is still growing very well. So, I don't think the subscription model has anything to do with it. I just think in certain cases some of our larger customers who are watching some of the things going on just decided to just take a pause and take a look at what's happening and then I think they'll kick back in. So Tal, it's great question. I think in the routing space is simply it's the 5G backbone build-out that we've been talking about for a few years. Once that starts I think -- given the percentage of our routing business that is attributed to service providers, I think that's the key as well as us winning these Cisco 8000 insertions that we have proof of concepts going on today with many of the large customers both service provider and web-scale players. So, I think that's that one. And I think on the campus side, I just think that's just a timing issue. I think that the growth we're seeing in the Catalyst 9000 is tremendous. And I think that customers that began to build out their refresh. Given where we are as a percentage of the installed base that we have replaced, it's got a long road ahead of it. I think that the only reason that we saw a little slowdown is just because customers just decided to pause the deployments a bit. But I think that that will come back when this uncertainty and the capital spending frees up. Routing, I answered first with the SP with the 5G backbone stuff, because of how big a percentage service provider represents in our routing portfolio. Thanks. Yes. So, I'll give you the sort of the qualitative answer and Kelly can give you something on the data. But I think the secure SD-WAN is, the solution that our customers are looking for. I mean they want the integration with their cloud gateways from their branches. And so, it is a key differentiator for us. Our teams are working hard on continuing to build that out. And I think, over the next couple of years, it will continue to -- it will be even more of a differentiator as we continue to get more and more integration between those two portfolios. Kelly? Thank you. All right, well let me just thank everyone for joining us today. And I'll just recap by saying that while we have seen a bit of a pause, we actually feel really good. The conversations I have with our customers, I mean all of the things they're trying to do I believe, our technology is at the heart of. Whether it's, rebuilding their applications, whether securing their data, transforming their infrastructure in this new era or changing their user experience as well as the way they interface with their customers. I think that we're in a very good position to help them do that. And we feel good about where we are. So thank you all for joining us today. And we'll look forward to catching up with you next quarter."

At the request of Cisco, today's conference is being recorded [Operator Instructions]. Now, I would like to introduce, Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Michelle. Welcome everyone to Cisco's First Quarter Fiscal 2020 Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. And I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chairman and CEO and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our Web site in the Investor Relations section following the call. As discussed in early in Q1, we have made certain reclassifications to prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information, can also be found in the financial information section of our Investor Relations Web site. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for second first quarter of fiscal 2020. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. In Q2 of fiscal 2019, we completed the sale of our SPVSS business and accordingly, had no revenue or expense from that business in Q1 fiscal 2020. As such, all of the revenue, non-GAAP and product orders information we will be discussing today is normalized to exclude the SPVSS business from our historical results. We have provided historical financial information for the SPVSS business in the slides that accompany this call and on our Web site to help to understand these impacts. The guidance we provided during our Q4 earnings call has been normalized in the same way. I will now turn it over to Chuck.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks Marilyn. We delivered a solid quarter against a challenging macro environment. While we're pleased with this performance, we're most focused on the environment as we move forward. We'll discuss this more in a moment. What's happening inside Cisco regardless of the macro is an unrelenting focus on driving innovation, transforming our business and exceeding our customers' expectations.  In Q1, as you've seen, we have revenue growth of 2% and double digit non-GAAP earnings per share growth. We also delivered strong non-GAAP gross margins and non-GAAP operating margins along with solid operating cash flow. We continued to invest in innovation and expand our market opportunities, while maintaining our commitment to maximizing shareholder return. Over the last year, many of you have heard me talk about the resilience of the global macro environment. However, on our last earnings call, we indicated that we had begun to see some weakness and that weakness continued throughout Q1 and was more broad-based. While the main challenges continue to be service provider in emerging markets, this quarter we also saw relative weakness in enterprise and commercial. Despite these headwinds and because of key decisions we made four years ago to change our business model, we remain well positioned to capitalize on the tremendous opportunities across cloud, automation, 5G, security and collaboration. Our transition to software continues to progress and we are on track with where we said we would be at the end of fiscal year 2020. This transition to software not only aligns to how our customers want to consume our technology, but we also believe it will lessen the impact of macroeconomic shifts in the future. Despite the current uncertainty, our innovation pipeline remains strong. At our annual partner summit last week, we announced several exciting additions to our portfolio, including network automation and analytics, cloud based networking, collaboration, as well as new security capabilities. Over the next couple of months, you will see us deliver even more innovation to help our customers achieve their business objectives. Now, I'd like to share some recent highlights across the business. Our enterprise networking portfolio continued to grow as customers increasingly adopt our intent-based networking portfolio, spanning our Catalyst 9000 family of switches, Meraki cloud based platforms and next generation data center solutions. Our customers today are running applications across multiple cloud environments and this shift requires a fundamental change in how they build their networks and their security architectures. To help them achieve this, we are automating connectivity across any cloud. A good example of this is our recently announced partnership with Microsoft to help our customers improve network connectivity with the highest level of security from branch offices to cloud based applications by integrating Cisco's SD-WAN solution with Azure\u2019s virtual WAN. To further extend our enterprise networking leadership, we continue to expand our cloud managed network and security offerings. Last week, we also announced an expansion of our Meraki portfolio, including continued integration between Meraki's dashboard and Cisco's switching portfolio, as well as innovative new LTE based WAN connectivity solutions. We believe our planned acquisition of Acacia will also play a critical role in building upon the strength of our switching, routing and optical networking portfolio. By utilizing our innovations across silicon, software and optics, we are enabling our customers to transform their networks. Now let's turn to security, which is always at the heart of everything we do. It's deeply integrated into the fabric of our entire portfolio to help secure our customers' data and address their modern application and multi cloud environments. Cyber security continues to be a top concern for our customers as they evolve their enterprise architectures to address the challenges of an ever changing threat environment. We have the most comprehensive integrated cyber security platform in the market designed to enable our customers to securely connect any application running on any cloud and deliver to any device. We've been building an expansive zero trust framework for securing access across the workforce, the workplace and the workload. As the leader in zero trust, our customers are increasingly turning to us to help them extend simple and trusted access to their users in hybrid and multi cloud environments. This is leading to strong uptake of Duo, our identity access management solution, which provides continuous authentication, ensuring the right people are able to access the right applications. To further reduce complexity in our customers' environments, we recently announced new enhanced capabilities in our firewall, breach defense, endpoint protection and Talos incident response solutions. These innovations are designed to provide greater threat protection and enhance the benefits of our platform. We also continue to leverage AI and ML capabilities through our industry leading threat intelligence platform Talos, along with Stealthwatch and Umbrella to bring our customers simplicity, visibility and insight that no other company can deliver. Moving to applications. We are rapidly becoming the center of our customer strategy for empowering teams and increasing productivity, as 95% of the Fortune 500 use our collaboration portfolio. This is leading to the solid performance in our businesses as growing number of customers adopt our unique solutions. During the quarter, we expanded our offerings to empower our customers for the modern workplace protecting data from ever increasing cyber threats and delivering highly secure productivity and collaboration solutions. A good example of this is our next generation WebEx, our cloud based team collaboration platform, enabling better teamwork while helping users stay secure with integrated end-to-end encryption. We also launched Single Platform Advantage, delivering all collaboration workloads, including calling, messaging, meeting and contact center from a single platform. In addition, we announced our new Cisco WebEx Edge for devices, as well as hardware-as-a-service options for phones, desks and room-based video systems. We're raising the bar for the industry by continuing to drive innovation in our expanding family of cognitive collaboration offers with AI and ML integrated capabilities. During the quarter, we acquired CloudCherry, a market leading customer experience management solution to augment our contact center portfolio with cloud analytics and AI to increase productivity and enhance user experiences. We also achieved a strong quarter in our App Dynamics business with yet another quarter of double digit growth, Our investments in App Dynamics have made Cisco the leader in application monitoring and analytics. We're helping our customers transform their digital businesses through our comprehensive portfolio of solutions that turns data into actionable real time insights by linking application performance to business outcomes. To summarize, while we remain in a challenging macroeconomic environment, I'm proud of our progress, both in our own continued transformation and in how we are empowering customers to drive their own transformation and shift to the cloud. We have a clear vision and strategy and are executing well against it to capture the many opportunities ahead. I feel great about our portfolio and I believe fully in our customers' commitment to our technology solutions. We will also continue to invest in organic and inorganic innovation to position Cisco for the long term. We also remain committed to managing our business to ensure we drive the greatest long term value for our customers, employees, partners and shareholders. Now, let me turn it over to Kelly.\nKelly Kramer: Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter, followed by the guidance for Q2. Our overall Q1 results were solid. We executed well with revenue growth and strong margins, net income and EPS. Total Revenue was $13.2 billion, up 2%. Our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 33.6%, up 1.3 points; non-GAAP net income was $3.6 billion, up 5%; and non-GAAP EPS was $0.84, up 12%. Let me provide some more detail on our Q1 revenue. Total product revenue was up 1% to $9.9 billion. Infrastructure platform was down 1%. All of the businesses were up except for routing. Switching had growth in both campus and data center with the continued ramp of the Cat9K and strength of the Nexus 9K. Wireless grew driven by Meraki. Data center had solid growth, led by HyperFlex. Routing declined due to weakness in service provider. Applications was up 6% with growth across all the businesses, including double digit growth in app dynamics. Security was at 22% with strong performance in Identity and Access, advanced threat, unified threat and web security. Service revenue was up 4%, driven by software and solution support. And we continue to transform our business delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions. Software subscriptions were 71% of total software revenue, up 12 points year-over-year. When we look at the impact of acquisitions on our Q1 results year-over-year, there was a 50 basis point positive impact on revenue. In terms of orders in Q1, total product orders were down 4%. Looking at the geographies, Americas and EMEA were each down 3% and APJC was down 5%. Total emerging markets were down 13% with the BRICS plus Mexico down 26%. In our customer segments, public sector was up 6%, enterprise and commercial were each down 5% and service provider was down 13%. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, at the end of Q1 were $24.9 billion, up 11%. RPO is our total deferred revenue plus unbilled differed and represents total committed non-cancelable future revenue. From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q1 gross margin was 65.9%, up 1.7 points. Product gross margin was 66.1%, up 2.5 points and service gross margin was 65.4%, down 0.4 points. In terms of the bottom line from a GAAP perspective, Q1 net income was $2.9 billion and EPS was $0.68. We ended Q1 the total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $28 billion. Operating cash flow was $3.6 billion, down 5%. Normalized for the $400 million legal settlement we received from a risk debt in Q1 of fiscal '19, operating cash flow was up 7%. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $2.3 billion to shareholders during the quarter that was comprised of $0.8 billion of share repurchases and $1.5 billion for our quarterly dividend. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. During Q1, we closed four acquisitions all in the applications area. These moves are consistent with our strategy of increasing investment in innovation and R&D for our growth areas. To summarize, we had a solid Q1. We executed well with top line growth and strong profitability. We're seeing the returns on the investments we're making in innovation, and driving the shift to more software and subscription, delivering long term growth and shareholder value. Let me reiterate our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal '20. This guidance includes the type of forward looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier; we expect revenues to decline in the range of minus 3% to minus 5% year-over-year; we anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 64.5% to 65.5%; the non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 32.5% to 33.5%, and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 20%; non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.75 to $0.77. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn. So we can move into the Q&A.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Kelly. Michelle, let's go ahead and open the line for questions. And while Michelle is doing that, I'd like to ask the audience to address one question only, so that we have plenty of time for the others. Michelle, I'll turn it over to you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer, you may go ahead.\nIttai Kidron: Chuck, maybe you can kind of walk us through a little bit kind of how the quarter evolved as far as the demand pattern. You're talked about weakness became, first of all, more broad based but also started into the enterprise and commercial. Any more color you can give us there, either from a product or regional standpoint. And with regards to your working assumptions into the next quarter, into the January quarter, is it your assumption that the intensity of the softness you're seeing right now will just stay as is, or getting worse? Help us think about the framework you have in mind when you give the guidance.\nChuck Robbins: If you recall in the last earnings call, I did say that we began to see some early signs of some macro impact towards the end of Q4. And then we just basically saw that continue throughout the quarter and as obviously the entire quarter was worse than we had expected when we began. And it was fairly broad based. It was -- I mean Kelly just read the regional numbers off from an orders perspective. So you saw negative 3, negative 3, negative 5, from Americas, EMEA and Asia. I'd say across the technology areas, it was pretty broad based. The segments that we saw, public sector continue to be strong but the rest were -- enterprise commercial did weaken. Service provider and emerging markets, which were stressed last quarter, were about the same. We had shown the ability to offset that with strength in commercial, and enterprise and public sector. And when those weakened, obviously this quarter that impacted our ability to offset them. And while all that might seem like this excuse, it also had to happen in a quarter where we did have incredibly tough compare. So this is the worst quarter that could have occurred for us. But that's really what we saw. As far as what we've modeled going forward, we've effectively assumed that it will stay as is. I don't think -- we haven't modeled any material further deterioration or improvement, I think than what we what we put forward today.\nOperator: Thank you. Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan, you may go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Chuck, thanks for the detail on the last question. I just wanted to get a sense of what you're hearing from your customers in terms of are you hearing that if some of the trade aspects of that are depressing the macro get resolved. Do you expect some of them to come back in terms of spending, what are you hearing from your customers? And if you can give us an update on the order trends in China as well that would be helpful?\nChuck Robbins: So from the customers, it feels like there's not a broad base loud noise out there. It feels like there's a bit of a pause. We saw things like conversion rates on our pipeline were lower than normal, which says that things didn't closed the way we've historically seen it. We didn't see any incremental loss ratios. It was really just stuff slipping. We saw some large deals get done but got done smaller. Kelly and I were involved in a couple personally that we saw that when we began talking to the customers about the transactions and by the time they got done, they were smaller than when we have begun. So that happened. And then we just saw deals that slipped, and so we saw little bit of all that. But it's not -- I'd say we also had our teams telling us that the approval process in several customers across different number of industries were changing, which is usually indicative of, hey, let's add another signature requirement, because we want to just put another set of eyes on every expenditure right now. So those are the things we've seen. And unfortunately, I've done this long enough that I've seen it before. So you recognize it when you see it, and that's really effectively what we saw during the quarter. In China, Kelly was\u2026\nKelly Kramer: China continued its decline. It was down 31% versus last quarter we -- it was down 26%. So that momentum continuing to just accelerate the decline in China.\nOperator: Thank you. Paul Silverstein from Cowen, you may go ahead.\nPaul Silverstein: Kelly, if you could tell us pricing, I know we're going to see in the Q. But if you could tell us the rate of price erosion, if there has been a change. And then if I did the math correctly on OpEx, it looks like your guidance would suggest around $3.8 billion for the January quarter, that'd be down $400 million sequentially and $150 million year-over-year. Do I have that right? Is that the way you're thinking about it? And related to that, how should we think about OpEx going forward throughout the year? How do you plan on managing expenses given the less than expected revenue outlook?\nKelly Kramer: So let me take those. So on price, we had a really very, very good quarter on price. It is the lowest in some time in terms of the least amount of price erosion. So from impact on our product gross margin rate, Paul, which is I know the metric you're looking at, it was only 40 basis points. Now I will say, that's great, and I think we've done a lot of great things on our pricing. For example, we've been selectively -- where we have price elasticity, we will raise prices, and we've been effective on driving some product transitions and we've been realizing that benefit. I will say we are starting to see, we didn't feel the impact of it this quarter, but we are starting to see pricing pressure in the server market that we expect to accelerate next quarter, but that's, of course, including the guide. But for Q1, it was a very, very strong pricing quarter, which has been fantastic. From an OpEx perspective, if you play down the ranges I just gave you, it does show that OpEx will be down and how you're thinking about it. And yes, we are managing it like we always do, which is balancing the investments we're making plus driving trade off and cost out. So you're looking at it correctly and that's what we're driving it to.\nPaul Silverstein: Kelly, the real question is, can operating margin go up with revenue being slightly down, could you drive higher operating margin\u2026\nKelly Kramer: So let me break down the margins overall, because I think that is the key question. I would say our margins are -- there's positive certainly driving the margin increase that you're seeing and you're seeing that in the guide. On the positive side, we are definitely feeling the positive impact of the software mix on our margins. So that is driving benefit to us just purely on the increased software content that we have and what we're selling, so that's helping tremendously. I do think we're going to see some more pricing erosion as we go forward for some of the things that are specific, like of course, the server market is going to get tougher now that the DRAM prices are going down. So that will be a little bit of a negative next quarter, but that's okay. And then of course, we are still benefiting from the DRAM price decrease related to the server market, that we started to feel the benefit of a couple quarters ago. It's a very large impact this quarter favorable to us that will I expect to continue next quarter. But after that, as you recall, we started seeing the benefit on the Q3 of '19. So that'll become less of a year-over-year favor ability for us. And then, we'll see what happens to the pricing there. So net-net to your question, I don't think it will stay at this rate that we delivered in Q1, which is the highest than it's been, because of those key things. But the underlying trends are all going in the right direction with software that's benefiting and driving the favorable mix. And then the real strong product management we're doing around managing pricing elasticity.\nOperator: Thank you. James Faucette from Morgan Stanley Investment Research, you may go ahead.\nJames Faucette: I'm wondering, Chuck, or Kelly or maybe both of you. Can you talk a little bit about the order of growth versus your current expectations for economic development? Clearly, Chuck, as you pointed out and Kelly, we saw weakness kind of across the board in orders. But if we think about kind of a relatively flat environment from here going forward, as you said you're forecasting on. How long does it take us to start to get to more of a flattish and then even recovering order book in that kind of scenario and environment? Thanks a lot.\nChuck Robbins: Kelly, I'll let you handle that.\nKelly Kramer: James, that's a tough question, right? I mean, I'd say, certainly, the headwinds we have right now are going to be with us I think in the short term. Again, whether it's just the -- I don't see any catalyst to changed momentum right now with uncertainty and business confidence in the macro like Chuck talked about. I do think from a portfolio perspective, obviously, we feel good about portfolio and you're seeing still, regardless of macro the improvement we're making on the software metric that continues regardless. Going forward, we do have easier compares as the second half comes around, it's not that that's a big victory but that is the reality. And I think we're just going to keep executing through whatever the macro is. I don't know if you want to add, Chuck.\nChuck Robbins: James, I would say that, if you just go around the world right now and you look at what's happening in Hong Kong, you look at the China-U.S. trade situation, you look at what's going on in DC. You've got Brexit. And you've got uncertainty in Latin America. I mean, I think it's -- in any of those that are big issues if they get resolved then you could see some of the uncertainty removed, and I think that's what -- business confidence just suffers when there's lack of clarity. And there's been lack of clarity for so long that I think it's finally just came into play. So I think, you're probably able to guess that, as well as we are, based on some of these bigger issues sort of coming to some level of conclusion. And then obviously, we have the elections coming in next year that we have to see how they work. But I will reiterate what Kelly said. Despite the order growth rate, this software transition that we've been embarking on is going exactly as we planned. It continued this quarter. We had solid results in our software portfolio again this quarter. And we put up some numbers at our analyst conference that we said we would hit by the end of 2020, we're on track to get there. So we feel good about that. And we're going to keep on executing. I think the teams have done a phenomenal job of getting our portfolio in the position that it's at. And that's why I said I have full confidence that our customers are committed to these technologies, just because they pause and we see a slowdown in one quarter. I think for the long term, we're in good shape, and I feel good about where we are.\nOperator: Thank you. Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs, you may go ahead, sir.\nRod Hall: I wanted to ask about the commercial order rate deterioration. I think last quarter you guys hadn't really seen much deterioration at that at the end of the quarter. And then I'm assuming through this quarter, it's been getting worse. But wondering if you could just comment on what you're seeing there in that particular market. And regionally, are you seeing -- is it mainly in U.S. where you see that weakness, do you see the weakness all over the place. Just any further color you could give there would be helpful.\nChuck Robbins: Rod, that was one of the big -- that's a good question. That was one of the big signals to us that this thing is -- that there's definitely something going on to, because the commercial business is usually fairly resilient. And it was broad based across the globe in each of the regions. I think all three were negative. So it was it was broad based. But I think that also be one of the first to bounce back when we start seeing that come back, that's a good sign.\nOperator: Thank you. Tejas Venkatesh from UBS, you may go ahead.\nTejas Venkatesh: I wonder if you could provide more color on what you're seeing in the U.S. service provider business and also more broadly, how you're thinking about the service provider vertical going forward. Obviously, it's been weak for a while, but assuming that that environment stays that way. Are there product refreshes and so forth coming down the pipe that can better the year-over-year trends? Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: So in the U.S., I think it's pretty clear if you just follow what's going on with the major players here, and we talked about this on the last call that they're currently focused on building out their trials and then their broader consumer based 5G services. And that's an area that frankly they'll run most of that traffic across their existing networks. We've said that when they begin to build out the broad based enterprise service delivery 5G networks that that's where we would really come into play on helping re-engineer backbones for higher throughput and more traffic. And I would suspect that we'll see them start to do some of that maybe in the second half of 2021, we'll have to see how fast they get moving. And we have some announcements coming over the next couple of months that I think line up with what they're trying to accomplish. And so we'll see how it moves. But that's the transition that we would be looking for that could help get this business to a little better position. It was -- and on a global basis, I'll tell you, it was -- it got much weaker in Europe. It was about the same in the U.S., I think. And we've had some pockets of strength in Asia. Outside of China, we had some strength in, particularly in Japan. So as we've always said about this business, it's so big deal driven. But for right now, I think that's the story of what we see.\nOperator: Thank you. Tal Liani with Bank of America, you may go ahead, sir.\nTal Liani: So if I take a five quarter view, six quarter view, on your results, not just this quarter on the guidance, I see constant deterioration in the growth rate, organically from about 4.5% now we're getting to minus 5%, or I have to look exactly at the guidance where we are. And the question I have is, not about the environment but rather about the portfolio. If you ignore the environment as much as we can, what can you do with the portfolio in order to change the trend line and reaccelerate the growth? Maybe even start with, can you identify what are the weak areas versus what are the strong areas and then what's in your power to change versus something that may take longer? Thanks.\nChuck Robbins: Tal, it's a good question and that's actually what we spend every day doing. I will tell you that we saw strength, continued strength in the campus refresh in the portfolio that we brought forward there, which obviously, if you think about what we've been doing over the last couple of years, and I made a comment in my opening remarks about this is, we have now transitioned our entire enterprise networking portfolio to a mandatory subscription model and those products and that those area, those new products are still, they're growing very strongly right now as customers continue to deploy. So one of the big things we want to do is continue to transition towards the software model. We had 30 years of a net 30 CapEx model. So it's, we're in the midst of that transition. We're making progress on the timeline that we expected. That's the biggest strategic thing I think we can do. From a portfolio perspective, I think you have -- if you go across the portfolio, we made a lot of new announcements last week, we've got new announcements coming up. And I think that, clearly, we have a lot of customers that are still buying a lot of stuff. So while there's a slowdown, I think there's still meaningful value that our customers are seeing with our technology, and we'll continue to do everything we can to try to find those areas that resonate the most right now. I think you saw you see it with security given the importance of that technology to them. And we're working on some other things that we haven't announced yet. So we're going to continue to do all the things that you described.\nOperator: Thank you. Jim Suva from Citigroup Global Markets, you may go ahead, sir.\nJim Suva: Obviously, you laid out a lot of the details about the challenges. When we look back historically over Cisco, their history, the last time we kind of saw such negative trends, were kind of July 2017. There was kind of about a fourth quarter pause before recovery. Is there anything different about it this time? And some people will say, well, white boxes starting to hurt you a lot. Is it white boxes? Is it generally macro? Or why wouldn't it be, like four quarters, like what we saw last year in 2017? Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: First of all, I think that given the broad based and the rapid change that we saw, I don't believe it's anything like white box or anything like that. It's broad across the portfolio. It's broad across geographies. And we're, as Kelly said, obviously, in the second half. We don't like to talk about comps. But the math is different in the second half of the year. But we also have all the things that I just talked about with Tal. We also have this Wi-Fi 6 transition. At some point, we will have some spinning going on around the 5G backbone transitions. We got 400 gig coming next year. So there are a lot of things. And I also believe that our customers, they will pause for a while. But technology is so absolutely core to their fundamental strategies that it just seems to me that the time that they're going to be able to pause is going to be shorter than what you would have seen in the past. I mean, they worry about their competitors' investments, they worry about falling behind. So I think they'll hit the pause button because of all the uncertainty. I think we have to just see how long it lasts in today's world, given the strategic value of all the technology. And frankly, everything that we're building is incredibly important to them as they deal with this new cloud world and re-architecting their traffic flows and their security architecture. And there's only so long they're going to build a pause on doing that. But we'll see how it turns out.\nOperator: Thank you. Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo, you may go ahead.\nAaron Rakers: I want to go back to kind of the comments earlier made around kind of the software expansion, and kind of progressing to what you laid out at past analyst days. If I recall, it seemed to kind of map out that you would have about 20% of your total kind of revenue being -- product revenue being contributed from software. As we think about the product portfolio and the push to subscription, is that the right trajectory to think about? And as we look even beyond that, could you see even higher mix of kind of just recurring nature of your business? I'm just trying to understand what more is left to kind of build out the product portfolio around this kind of subscription motion for the company.\nKelly Kramer: I'd say what we laid out is we said by the end of '20, we should have 30% of our revenue be software, and software and services be 50%. So that's the metric we are pacing towards. And your 20% number, we are already passed. So we are driving to be at that that 30% by the end of this year. So like Jeff mentioned, we are pacing well with that. This transition that we're driving has greatly increased the amount of software we are selling with our system. So that is all going well.\nChuck Robbins: Yes, I think if you just -- I think Kelly said, by the end of 2020, our target was to be at 30% of our revenue coming from software. And if you also correlate the metric we shared today, which is in Q1 71% of our software was coming from subscription and SaaS, which four years ago that number was probably a third or less. So that's the nature of the success of the transition that we've been driving so far.\nKelly Kramer: Yes, it\u2019s a good point. Actually, the target for the end of '20 for that was to be 66%, so we've passed that metric already.\nOperator: Thank you. James Fish from Piper Jaffray, you may go ahead, sir.\nJames Fish: I just hoping to get more color on sort of the campus switching cycles with the Cat9K, and just kind of where you think we are, especially with large enterprises as that really drives, it seems like more of the growth of the business anyways and just trying to understand that. And then just make sure that we're thinking about it correct. When you're talking subscription within this business line, you're talking more of a term license than kind of recurring monthly, correct?\nKelly Kramer: Yes, on that one, subscription meaning. Yes. So if I sell a Catalyst 9K switch now, it's sold with a subscription that gets renewed three or five years since putting on the term from now. So that's what we're talking about. So of all the software we're selling is it based on a term based value that gets renewed.\nChuck Robbins: And Jim, just to give you a little sense of where we are. I mean, we're still -- we're seeing very strong growth year-over-year on those platforms, the transitions happening from the old to the new, just like we would have expected. And we were actually talking about yesterday how we would answer the question relative to where we are in this, because I think I said last time we were in the second inning, and we joked that maybe we're in the bottom of the second inning now. But we're still very early in this transition and it's going very well. And we now have the entire enterprise networking portfolio in refresh mode with Wi-Fi 6 access points, with the new Catalyst 9000. And then one of the things we announced last week was the ability to manage the Cat 9K, one of the products in the Cat 9K under the Meraki platform, so customers could take advantage of it and we'll continue to extend that across the other portfolio of products. So it's going very well and it's still early.\nJames Fish: Thanks for that color, Chuck.\nChuck Robbins: Thank you, Jim. So let me just wrap up and say that, obviously, it's a complicated world right now. And we certainly felt the continuing impact that we talked about at the end of our last quarter. That being said, I have great confidence in where we are with the portfolio. We shared some metrics today on the software transition that I think is going incredibly well. And notwithstanding, you know, the short term challenges, we feel really good about the future. And so thank you all for being with us today. And I'll kick it back to Marilyn.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Chuck.

            "name": "Kelly Kramer",
            "content": "Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter, followed by the guidance for Q2. Our overall Q1 results were solid. We executed well with revenue growth and strong margins, net income and EPS. Total Revenue was $13.2 billion, up 2%. Our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 33.6%, up 1.3 points; non-GAAP net income was $3.6 billion, up 5%; and non-GAAP EPS was $0.84, up 12%. Let me provide some more detail on our Q1 revenue. Total product revenue was up 1% to $9.9 billion. Infrastructure platform was down 1%. All of the businesses were up except for routing. Switching had growth in both campus and data center with the continued ramp of the Cat9K and strength of the Nexus 9K. Wireless grew driven by Meraki. Data center had solid growth, led by HyperFlex. Routing declined due to weakness in service provider. Applications was up 6% with growth across all the businesses, including double digit growth in app dynamics. Security was at 22% with strong performance in Identity and Access, advanced threat, unified threat and web security. Service revenue was up 4%, driven by software and solution support. And we continue to transform our business delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions. Software subscriptions were 71% of total software revenue, up 12 points year-over-year. When we look at the impact of acquisitions on our Q1 results year-over-year, there was a 50 basis point positive impact on revenue. In terms of orders in Q1, total product orders were down 4%. Looking at the geographies, Americas and EMEA were each down 3% and APJC was down 5%. Total emerging markets were down 13% with the BRICS plus Mexico down 26%. In our customer segments, public sector was up 6%, enterprise and commercial were each down 5% and service provider was down 13%. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, at the end of Q1 were $24.9 billion, up 11%. RPO is our total deferred revenue plus unbilled differed and represents total committed non-cancelable future revenue. From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q1 gross margin was 65.9%, up 1.7 points. Product gross margin was 66.1%, up 2.5 points and service gross margin was 65.4%, down 0.4 points. In terms of the bottom line from a GAAP perspective, Q1 net income was $2.9 billion and EPS was $0.68. We ended Q1 the total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $28 billion. Operating cash flow was $3.6 billion, down 5%. Normalized for the $400 million legal settlement we received from a risk debt in Q1 of fiscal '19, operating cash flow was up 7%. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $2.3 billion to shareholders during the quarter that was comprised of $0.8 billion of share repurchases and $1.5 billion for our quarterly dividend. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. During Q1, we closed four acquisitions all in the applications area. These moves are consistent with our strategy of increasing investment in innovation and R&D for our growth areas. To summarize, we had a solid Q1. We executed well with top line growth and strong profitability. We're seeing the returns on the investments we're making in innovation, and driving the shift to more software and subscription, delivering long term growth and shareholder value. Let me reiterate our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal '20. This guidance includes the type of forward looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier; we expect revenues to decline in the range of minus 3% to minus 5% year-over-year; we anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 64.5% to 65.5%; the non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 32.5% to 33.5%, and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 20%; non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.75 to $0.77. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn. So we can move into the Q&A. China continued its decline. It was down 31% versus last quarter we -- it was down 26%. So that momentum continuing to just accelerate the decline in China. So let me take those. So on price, we had a really very, very good quarter on price. It is the lowest in some time in terms of the least amount of price erosion. So from impact on our product gross margin rate, Paul, which is I know the metric you're looking at, it was only 40 basis points. Now I will say, that's great, and I think we've done a lot of great things on our pricing. For example, we've been selectively -- where we have price elasticity, we will raise prices, and we've been effective on driving some product transitions and we've been realizing that benefit. I will say we are starting to see, we didn't feel the impact of it this quarter, but we are starting to see pricing pressure in the server market that we expect to accelerate next quarter, but that's, of course, including the guide. But for Q1, it was a very, very strong pricing quarter, which has been fantastic. From an OpEx perspective, if you play down the ranges I just gave you, it does show that OpEx will be down and how you're thinking about it. And yes, we are managing it like we always do, which is balancing the investments we're making plus driving trade off and cost out. So you're looking at it correctly and that's what we're driving it to. So let me break down the margins overall, because I think that is the key question. I would say our margins are -- there's positive certainly driving the margin increase that you're seeing and you're seeing that in the guide. On the positive side, we are definitely feeling the positive impact of the software mix on our margins. So that is driving benefit to us just purely on the increased software content that we have and what we're selling, so that's helping tremendously. I do think we're going to see some more pricing erosion as we go forward for some of the things that are specific, like of course, the server market is going to get tougher now that the DRAM prices are going down. So that will be a little bit of a negative next quarter, but that's okay. And then of course, we are still benefiting from the DRAM price decrease related to the server market, that we started to feel the benefit of a couple quarters ago. It's a very large impact this quarter favorable to us that will I expect to continue next quarter. But after that, as you recall, we started seeing the benefit on the Q3 of '19. So that'll become less of a year-over-year favor ability for us. And then, we'll see what happens to the pricing there. So net-net to your question, I don't think it will stay at this rate that we delivered in Q1, which is the highest than it's been, because of those key things. But the underlying trends are all going in the right direction with software that's benefiting and driving the favorable mix. And then the real strong product management we're doing around managing pricing elasticity. James, that's a tough question, right? I mean, I'd say, certainly, the headwinds we have right now are going to be with us I think in the short term. Again, whether it's just the -- I don't see any catalyst to changed momentum right now with uncertainty and business confidence in the macro like Chuck talked about. I do think from a portfolio perspective, obviously, we feel good about portfolio and you're seeing still, regardless of macro the improvement we're making on the software metric that continues regardless. Going forward, we do have easier compares as the second half comes around, it's not that that's a big victory but that is the reality. And I think we're just going to keep executing through whatever the macro is. I don't know if you want to add, Chuck. I'd say what we laid out is we said by the end of '20, we should have 30% of our revenue be software, and software and services be 50%. So that's the metric we are pacing towards. And your 20% number, we are already passed. So we are driving to be at that that 30% by the end of this year. So like Jeff mentioned, we are pacing well with that. This transition that we're driving has greatly increased the amount of software we are selling with our system. So that is all going well. Yes, it's a good point. Actually, the target for the end of '20 for that was to be 66%, so we've passed that metric already. Yes, on that one, subscription meaning. Yes. So if I sell a Catalyst 9K switch now, it's sold with a subscription that gets renewed three or five years since putting on the term from now. So that's what we're talking about. So of all the software we're selling is it based on a term based value that gets renewed."

            "name": "Chuck Robbins",
            "content": "Thanks Marilyn. We delivered a solid quarter against a challenging macro environment. While we're pleased with this performance, we're most focused on the environment as we move forward. We'll discuss this more in a moment. What's happening inside Cisco regardless of the macro is an unrelenting focus on driving innovation, transforming our business and exceeding our customers' expectations.  In Q1, as you've seen, we have revenue growth of 2% and double digit non-GAAP earnings per share growth. We also delivered strong non-GAAP gross margins and non-GAAP operating margins along with solid operating cash flow. We continued to invest in innovation and expand our market opportunities, while maintaining our commitment to maximizing shareholder return. Over the last year, many of you have heard me talk about the resilience of the global macro environment. However, on our last earnings call, we indicated that we had begun to see some weakness and that weakness continued throughout Q1 and was more broad-based. While the main challenges continue to be service provider in emerging markets, this quarter we also saw relative weakness in enterprise and commercial. Despite these headwinds and because of key decisions we made four years ago to change our business model, we remain well positioned to capitalize on the tremendous opportunities across cloud, automation, 5G, security and collaboration. Our transition to software continues to progress and we are on track with where we said we would be at the end of fiscal year 2020. This transition to software not only aligns to how our customers want to consume our technology, but we also believe it will lessen the impact of macroeconomic shifts in the future. Despite the current uncertainty, our innovation pipeline remains strong. At our annual partner summit last week, we announced several exciting additions to our portfolio, including network automation and analytics, cloud based networking, collaboration, as well as new security capabilities. Over the next couple of months, you will see us deliver even more innovation to help our customers achieve their business objectives. Now, I'd like to share some recent highlights across the business. Our enterprise networking portfolio continued to grow as customers increasingly adopt our intent-based networking portfolio, spanning our Catalyst 9000 family of switches, Meraki cloud based platforms and next generation data center solutions. Our customers today are running applications across multiple cloud environments and this shift requires a fundamental change in how they build their networks and their security architectures. To help them achieve this, we are automating connectivity across any cloud. A good example of this is our recently announced partnership with Microsoft to help our customers improve network connectivity with the highest level of security from branch offices to cloud based applications by integrating Cisco's SD-WAN solution with Azure's virtual WAN. To further extend our enterprise networking leadership, we continue to expand our cloud managed network and security offerings. Last week, we also announced an expansion of our Meraki portfolio, including continued integration between Meraki's dashboard and Cisco's switching portfolio, as well as innovative new LTE based WAN connectivity solutions. We believe our planned acquisition of Acacia will also play a critical role in building upon the strength of our switching, routing and optical networking portfolio. By utilizing our innovations across silicon, software and optics, we are enabling our customers to transform their networks. Now let's turn to security, which is always at the heart of everything we do. It's deeply integrated into the fabric of our entire portfolio to help secure our customers' data and address their modern application and multi cloud environments. Cyber security continues to be a top concern for our customers as they evolve their enterprise architectures to address the challenges of an ever changing threat environment. We have the most comprehensive integrated cyber security platform in the market designed to enable our customers to securely connect any application running on any cloud and deliver to any device. We've been building an expansive zero trust framework for securing access across the workforce, the workplace and the workload. As the leader in zero trust, our customers are increasingly turning to us to help them extend simple and trusted access to their users in hybrid and multi cloud environments. This is leading to strong uptake of Duo, our identity access management solution, which provides continuous authentication, ensuring the right people are able to access the right applications. To further reduce complexity in our customers' environments, we recently announced new enhanced capabilities in our firewall, breach defense, endpoint protection and Talos incident response solutions. These innovations are designed to provide greater threat protection and enhance the benefits of our platform. We also continue to leverage AI and ML capabilities through our industry leading threat intelligence platform Talos, along with Stealthwatch and Umbrella to bring our customers simplicity, visibility and insight that no other company can deliver. Moving to applications. We are rapidly becoming the center of our customer strategy for empowering teams and increasing productivity, as 95% of the Fortune 500 use our collaboration portfolio. This is leading to the solid performance in our businesses as growing number of customers adopt our unique solutions. During the quarter, we expanded our offerings to empower our customers for the modern workplace protecting data from ever increasing cyber threats and delivering highly secure productivity and collaboration solutions. A good example of this is our next generation WebEx, our cloud based team collaboration platform, enabling better teamwork while helping users stay secure with integrated end-to-end encryption. We also launched Single Platform Advantage, delivering all collaboration workloads, including calling, messaging, meeting and contact center from a single platform. In addition, we announced our new Cisco WebEx Edge for devices, as well as hardware-as-a-service options for phones, desks and room-based video systems. We're raising the bar for the industry by continuing to drive innovation in our expanding family of cognitive collaboration offers with AI and ML integrated capabilities. During the quarter, we acquired CloudCherry, a market leading customer experience management solution to augment our contact center portfolio with cloud analytics and AI to increase productivity and enhance user experiences. We also achieved a strong quarter in our App Dynamics business with yet another quarter of double digit growth, Our investments in App Dynamics have made Cisco the leader in application monitoring and analytics. We're helping our customers transform their digital businesses through our comprehensive portfolio of solutions that turns data into actionable real time insights by linking application performance to business outcomes. To summarize, while we remain in a challenging macroeconomic environment, I'm proud of our progress, both in our own continued transformation and in how we are empowering customers to drive their own transformation and shift to the cloud. We have a clear vision and strategy and are executing well against it to capture the many opportunities ahead. I feel great about our portfolio and I believe fully in our customers' commitment to our technology solutions. We will also continue to invest in organic and inorganic innovation to position Cisco for the long term. We also remain committed to managing our business to ensure we drive the greatest long term value for our customers, employees, partners and shareholders. Now, let me turn it over to Kelly. If you recall in the last earnings call, I did say that we began to see some early signs of some macro impact towards the end of Q4. And then we just basically saw that continue throughout the quarter and as obviously the entire quarter was worse than we had expected when we began. And it was fairly broad based. It was -- I mean Kelly just read the regional numbers off from an orders perspective. So you saw negative 3, negative 3, negative 5, from Americas, EMEA and Asia. I'd say across the technology areas, it was pretty broad based. The segments that we saw, public sector continue to be strong but the rest were -- enterprise commercial did weaken. Service provider and emerging markets, which were stressed last quarter, were about the same. We had shown the ability to offset that with strength in commercial, and enterprise and public sector. And when those weakened, obviously this quarter that impacted our ability to offset them. And while all that might seem like this excuse, it also had to happen in a quarter where we did have incredibly tough compare. So this is the worst quarter that could have occurred for us. But that's really what we saw. As far as what we've modeled going forward, we've effectively assumed that it will stay as is. I don't think -- we haven't modeled any material further deterioration or improvement, I think than what we what we put forward today. So from the customers, it feels like there's not a broad base loud noise out there. It feels like there's a bit of a pause. We saw things like conversion rates on our pipeline were lower than normal, which says that things didn't closed the way we've historically seen it. We didn't see any incremental loss ratios. It was really just stuff slipping. We saw some large deals get done but got done smaller. Kelly and I were involved in a couple personally that we saw that when we began talking to the customers about the transactions and by the time they got done, they were smaller than when we have begun. So that happened. And then we just saw deals that slipped, and so we saw little bit of all that. But it's not -- I'd say we also had our teams telling us that the approval process in several customers across different number of industries were changing, which is usually indicative of, hey, let's add another signature requirement, because we want to just put another set of eyes on every expenditure right now. So those are the things we've seen. And unfortunately, I've done this long enough that I've seen it before. So you recognize it when you see it, and that's really effectively what we saw during the quarter. In China, Kelly was... Kelly, I'll let you handle that. James, I would say that, if you just go around the world right now and you look at what's happening in Hong Kong, you look at the China-U.S. trade situation, you look at what's going on in DC. You've got Brexit. And you've got uncertainty in Latin America. I mean, I think it's -- in any of those that are big issues if they get resolved then you could see some of the uncertainty removed, and I think that's what -- business confidence just suffers when there's lack of clarity. And there's been lack of clarity for so long that I think it's finally just came into play. So I think, you're probably able to guess that, as well as we are, based on some of these bigger issues sort of coming to some level of conclusion. And then obviously, we have the elections coming in next year that we have to see how they work. But I will reiterate what Kelly said. Despite the order growth rate, this software transition that we've been embarking on is going exactly as we planned. It continued this quarter. We had solid results in our software portfolio again this quarter. And we put up some numbers at our analyst conference that we said we would hit by the end of 2020, we're on track to get there. So we feel good about that. And we're going to keep on executing. I think the teams have done a phenomenal job of getting our portfolio in the position that it's at. And that's why I said I have full confidence that our customers are committed to these technologies, just because they pause and we see a slowdown in one quarter. I think for the long term, we're in good shape, and I feel good about where we are. Rod, that was one of the big -- that's a good question. That was one of the big signals to us that this thing is -- that there's definitely something going on to, because the commercial business is usually fairly resilient. And it was broad based across the globe in each of the regions. I think all three were negative. So it was it was broad based. But I think that also be one of the first to bounce back when we start seeing that come back, that's a good sign. So in the U.S., I think it's pretty clear if you just follow what's going on with the major players here, and we talked about this on the last call that they're currently focused on building out their trials and then their broader consumer based 5G services. And that's an area that frankly they'll run most of that traffic across their existing networks. We've said that when they begin to build out the broad based enterprise service delivery 5G networks that that's where we would really come into play on helping re-engineer backbones for higher throughput and more traffic. And I would suspect that we'll see them start to do some of that maybe in the second half of 2021, we'll have to see how fast they get moving. And we have some announcements coming over the next couple of months that I think line up with what they're trying to accomplish. And so we'll see how it moves. But that's the transition that we would be looking for that could help get this business to a little better position. It was -- and on a global basis, I'll tell you, it was -- it got much weaker in Europe. It was about the same in the U.S., I think. And we've had some pockets of strength in Asia. Outside of China, we had some strength in, particularly in Japan. So as we've always said about this business, it's so big deal driven. But for right now, I think that's the story of what we see. Tal, it's a good question and that's actually what we spend every day doing. I will tell you that we saw strength, continued strength in the campus refresh in the portfolio that we brought forward there, which obviously, if you think about what we've been doing over the last couple of years, and I made a comment in my opening remarks about this is, we have now transitioned our entire enterprise networking portfolio to a mandatory subscription model and those products and that those area, those new products are still, they're growing very strongly right now as customers continue to deploy. So one of the big things we want to do is continue to transition towards the software model. We had 30 years of a net 30 CapEx model. So it's, we're in the midst of that transition. We're making progress on the timeline that we expected. That's the biggest strategic thing I think we can do. From a portfolio perspective, I think you have -- if you go across the portfolio, we made a lot of new announcements last week, we've got new announcements coming up. And I think that, clearly, we have a lot of customers that are still buying a lot of stuff. So while there's a slowdown, I think there's still meaningful value that our customers are seeing with our technology, and we'll continue to do everything we can to try to find those areas that resonate the most right now. I think you saw you see it with security given the importance of that technology to them. And we're working on some other things that we haven't announced yet. So we're going to continue to do all the things that you described. First of all, I think that given the broad based and the rapid change that we saw, I don't believe it's anything like white box or anything like that. It's broad across the portfolio. It's broad across geographies. And we're, as Kelly said, obviously, in the second half. We don't like to talk about comps. But the math is different in the second half of the year. But we also have all the things that I just talked about with Tal. We also have this Wi-Fi 6 transition. At some point, we will have some spinning going on around the 5G backbone transitions. We got 400 gig coming next year. So there are a lot of things. And I also believe that our customers, they will pause for a while. But technology is so absolutely core to their fundamental strategies that it just seems to me that the time that they're going to be able to pause is going to be shorter than what you would have seen in the past. I mean, they worry about their competitors' investments, they worry about falling behind. So I think they'll hit the pause button because of all the uncertainty. I think we have to just see how long it lasts in today's world, given the strategic value of all the technology. And frankly, everything that we're building is incredibly important to them as they deal with this new cloud world and re-architecting their traffic flows and their security architecture. And there's only so long they're going to build a pause on doing that. But we'll see how it turns out. Yes, I think if you just -- I think Kelly said, by the end of 2020, our target was to be at 30% of our revenue coming from software. And if you also correlate the metric we shared today, which is in Q1 71% of our software was coming from subscription and SaaS, which four years ago that number was probably a third or less. So that's the nature of the success of the transition that we've been driving so far. And Jim, just to give you a little sense of where we are. I mean, we're still -- we're seeing very strong growth year-over-year on those platforms, the transitions happening from the old to the new, just like we would have expected. And we were actually talking about yesterday how we would answer the question relative to where we are in this, because I think I said last time we were in the second inning, and we joked that maybe we're in the bottom of the second inning now. But we're still very early in this transition and it's going very well. And we now have the entire enterprise networking portfolio in refresh mode with Wi-Fi 6 access points, with the new Catalyst 9000. And then one of the things we announced last week was the ability to manage the Cat 9K, one of the products in the Cat 9K under the Meraki platform, so customers could take advantage of it and we'll continue to extend that across the other portfolio of products. So it's going very well and it's still early. Thank you, Jim. So let me just wrap up and say that, obviously, it's a complicated world right now. And we certainly felt the continuing impact that we talked about at the end of our last quarter. That being said, I have great confidence in where we are with the portfolio. We shared some metrics today on the software transition that I think is going incredibly well. And notwithstanding, you know, the short term challenges, we feel really good about the future. And so thank you all for being with us today. And I'll kick it back to Marilyn."

At the request of Cisco, today's conference is being recorded. if you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now, I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Michelle, and welcome everyone to Cisco's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2021 Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO, and Scott Herren, our CFO. By now, you should've seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and other financial information can also be found in the financial information section of our Investor Relations website.  Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non - GAAP financial results, and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the first quarter and full year of fiscal 2022.  They are subject to the risks and uncertainties, including COVID-19 that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press releases that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. With that, I'll now turn it over to Chuck.\nChuck Robbins: Thank you, Marilyn. And good afternoon, everyone. I hope you're all remaining healthy and staying safe. Our team at Cisco ended fiscal 2021 with an incredibly strong finish. We had an outstanding Q4 performance and fiscal year revenue reflecting strength across our portfolio, customer segments, and geographies. Our product order growth was the highest we've seen in over a decade and we're continuing to see strong customer reception to the accelerated investments in software and subscriptions. This great momentum is reaffirming our position as the worldwide leader in technology that powers the internet and a digital enterprise.  As I think about our achievements over the past year, three things stand out to me: First, the exceptional execution of our teams. We achieved these results through the extraordinary efforts of our leadership team, our partners, and most importantly, our people around the world, who operated with incredible speed and at an unprecedented scale to deliver this growth. Second, our transformation and strategic investments are paying off. The benefits of our shift to software and subscriptions are clear and they are helping both Cisco and our customers move with greater speed and agility. And third, the power of our portfolio. The groundbreaking innovation we are investing in today will serve as the foundation for our customers' futures.  These three factors position us exceptionally well for growth as we enter our next fiscal year, as evidenced by our results this quarter. We're more confident than ever that we are in a strong position to help our customers be successful. As we look forward, we are laser-focused on providing our customers the technologies they will need to successfully navigate highly dynamic environments at an incredibly rapid pace. With the rise of COVID variance and the inconsistent pace of vaccine deployment around the globe, organizations must be resilient and adaptable as we've seen how quickly the world around us can change. While this may impact certain short-term plans, like a return to the office for many, one thing is clear, there's tremendous demand for Cisco's technology.  No matter how or when the global recovery takes shape, we are executing on our vision of rebuilding a better world, one that is digital, sustainable, inclusive, and highly secure. I believe we're at a pivotal moment in our Company's history as we have a massive opportunity to transform what has been the traditional office and define the future of hybrid work. As our customers look to create safer hybrid workplaces, as well as collaborative, and engaging experiences for their customers and employees, we believe they are becoming increasingly reliant on Cisco technologies to help them with their transformation and resiliency.  Enterprises are increasingly seeking digital and cloud-enabled services, which is driving demand for our solutions and leading to new and expansive market opportunities for Cisco. We're in a unique leadership position to build and deliver innovative cloud-to-edge infrastructure platforms that our customers need. With the depth and breadth of our hardware, software, silicon, and optics solutions, we are helping companies solve their biggest challenges. Whether it's adopting modern application architectures, shifting to hybrid work and hybrid cloud, securing their enterprise, or meeting their ESG goals, Cisco is helping our customers thrive in a hybrid world. These industry dynamics helped drive our strong fourth-quarter performance.  The momentum we saw in Q3 accelerated through Q4 as we delivered robust revenue growth, increased earnings, strong margins, and record operating cash flow. We also generated strong double-digit growth in product deferred revenue, reflecting the success of our transformation around driving subscriptions and recurring revenues which increases our visibility into future performance. We're seeing IT budgets grow as companies begin to implement their critical future plans and business confidence increases.  However, we do recognize that uncertainty remains around COVID-19, and we're closely monitoring the delta variant and its impact on customer spending. Right now, we are not seeing any additional impact on our business, aside from the components shortage we've been facing over the past several months. Moving to the performance of our customer segments. As I mentioned, we delivered the highest product order growth in over a decade with a growth of 31% driven by strength across all of our end markets.  This outstanding performance is also up over 17% from our pre-COVID Q4 levels in the Fiscal year 2019. We saw double-digit growth in every one of our customer segments. This strength is being driven by stronger customer investment in substantial network upgrades to help modernize and secure their environment to support the new way of working. Specifically, in our enterprise business, we had the best quarter in terms of product orders in over a decade and saw a very strong order growth of 25%. We also had our third consecutive quarter of acceleration in our commercial Service Provider and public sector businesses, with all of these segments showing growth in excess of 20%.  In our web-scale business, we saw increased momentum delivering record performance with over 160% order growth. And on a trailing four-quarter basis, orders grew over 80% due to customers adopting products across the portfolio and early traction of our 400-gig Solutions, a huge testament to the investments we have made in accelerating innovation and the differentiated value we're bringing to these customers from a product portfolio perspective, we also had a very balanced performance. As customers prepare for office re-openings and hybrid work, they are increasing their investment across our networking, Cloud Security, and Unified Communications portfolios.  In Q4, we saw double-digit revenue growth in campus switching, Catalyst 9000, high-end routing, wireless, and in our Zero Trust solutions, along with strength in our security endpoint portfolio. We also had a very strong adoption of our Acacia optical solutions driven by increasing customer demand for leading-edge technology to address their growing bandwidth requirements. The transformation of our business to more software and subscriptions continues to show tremendous progress, as we achieved over $4 billion in software revenue in Q4, an increase of 7% sequentially and up 6% year-over-year.  Within that, subscription revenue grew 9% in Q4 and 15% for the full fiscal year. For perspective, Software represented 31% of our business in Q4. And for the full year, when combined with our services business, they represent over 53% of revenue, clearly highlighting the success of our continued business transformation. In addition to delivering strong financial results, our innovation engine continues to accelerate. Over the last year, we introduced an impressive number of new capabilities across our entire portfolio, while also doubling down on more flexible consumption models, including our core networking capabilities as a service highlighted by the recent launch of Cisco Plus.  Our new Cisco Plus solutions deliver cross-portfolio technologies to help solve our customers' biggest needs with faster time-to-value network-as-a-service as-a-service offerings that deliver hybrid cloud technologies and will later expand to a broader catalog of services built and delivered with our partner ecosystem. Cisco Plus improved speed, agility, and scale with on-demand solutions that intelligently adapt to our customers' business needs. While still early days in its launch, Cisco Plus directly aligns with our transformation goals around driving more subscription-based recurring revenue via the cloud.  Our unique strengths improvement strategy gives us the confidence to move at a more accelerated pace. You will see us continue to invest in our key growth areas in technology shifts like hybrid cloud, hybrid work, 5G, Wi-Fi 6, Edge, security, and cloud-native architectures to extend our technology leadership positions. You will also see us deliver even more strategic offers to enable our customers to thrive in a Cloud-first digital world. These include full-stack observability to improve their digital experiences by providing visibility and insights across their entire technology stack and Secure Access Service Edge or SASE, designed to enable seamless secure access to applications anywhere their users work.  Given the momentum we're seeing in our business, we have more conviction than ever that we are investing in the right areas and will continue to extend our competitive advantages and drive growth. Before I turn it over to Scott for more details on the quarter and our expectations for the next Fiscal year, let me give you an update on the supply environment. While we're seeing increasing demand for our technology, we're also continuing to manage through the component shortage challenges that nearly every Company is experiencing our world-class supply chain team, as always, is doing an incredible job navigating this complex situation by working with our global suppliers to meet customer demand as quickly as possible.  Looking ahead, we expect the supply challenges and cost impacts to continue through at least the first half of our fiscal year and potentially into the second half. In summary, demand for our technology is very strong and our strategy is more relevant than ever. This allows us to deliver greater value to our customers, partners, and communities as we all adapt to new ways of living and working. I am very encouraged by the recovery trajectory across the board and with our momentum. I am confident in our strategy and investments. I feel great about the innovation we're driving in our portfolio, and I'm incredibly proud of what our teams and partners have achieved.  I look forward to building on these insights with a more comprehensive, deep dive on our multiyear vision and strategic growth drivers at our virtual Investor Day on September 15th and I hope you'll join us. Thank you again for your time. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott for additional detail.\nScott Herren: Thanks, Chuck. Our fourth quarter reflects a strong close to our fiscal year with significant momentum across our business. We saw robust customer demand, demonstrating the third consecutive increase in product order growth and solid execution by our teams. I'll provide some detail on our financial results for the quarter, then cover the full fiscal year, followed by our guidance. Q4 was a very strong quarter and a very dynamic environment. We executed exceptionally well, with greater than 30% product order growth year on year, and more than 17% order growth versus our pre-COVID Q4 fiscal 19 product bookings, driven by strength across our portfolio.  In fact, it was the strongest product order growth rate in over a decade. We also had strong results across revenue, net income, earnings per share, and as Chuck said earlier, record operating cash flows. Total revenue increased to 13.1 billion, up 8% year-over-year, coming in at the high end of our guidance range for the quarter. We saw strength in a number of product areas and across all geographies. Our business continues to recover well and build momentum with sequential revenue growth of 3%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 33.5%, up 50 basis points. Non-GAAP net income was 3.6 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.84. Both up 5% year-over-year and exceeding the high-end of our guidance range.  Now let me turn to provide more detail on our Q4 revenue. Total product revenue was 9.7 billion, up 10%. Service revenue was 3.4 billion, up 3%. infrastructure platforms performed very well with revenues up 13%. All businesses saw double-digit growth with the exception of the Data Center. Switching had strong growth driven by a double-digit increase in Campus Switching, led by our Catalyst 9K and Meraki Switching offerings. We also had solid growth in our Data Center Switching portfolio with the Nexus 9000 products. Routing grew driven by both the Service Provider and Enterprise markets as we saw strong adoption across our portfolio, including a robust uptake of our Cisco 8000 platform.  Wireless had a strong growth driven by the continued ramp of our WIFI 6 products and our Meraki wireless offerings. Data Center revenue declined driven primarily by servers as we expended -- experienced continued market contraction. Applications were down 1% driven by a slight decline in our collaboration portfolio. However, recurring subscription revenue within our WebEx suite grew 9% in Q4. We also saw solid growth in IoT software, AppDynamics, Cloud Contact Center, and our Cloud Calling platforms.  Security was up 1%. Our Cloud security and Zero Trust portfolios performed well with greater than 20% growth as we had continued momentum in our Duo and Umbrella offerings. Our Security recurring subscription revenue grew 13% in Q4 and 18% for the full fiscal year. In both applications and security, we're seeing strong revenue growth in the strategic areas that we and our customers are investing in. We continue to transform our business, delivering more software offerings and driving growth in subscriptions and recurring revenue. Software revenue was 4 billion, an increase of 6%, subscriptions were 81% of total software revenue up 3 points year-over-year. Software subscription revenue grew 9% in Q4 and 15% for the full Fiscal year.  As we continue to increase our software subscriptions, we're driving higher levels of recurring revenue. Additionally, the strength of our portfolio and transition to more software and services is driving growth in remaining performance obligations or RPO. At the end of Q4, RPO crossed the 30 billion marks at 30.9 billion up 9%. RPO for the product was up 18% and service was up 3%. Approximately 53% of the total RPO is short-term, meaning it will be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months. As I mentioned, we had exceptionally strong order momentum in Q4 as total product orders were up 31% with strength across the business.  Looking at our geographies, the Americas was up 34%, EMEA was up 24%, and APJC was up 29%. Total emerging markets were up 25% with the BRICs plus Mexico up 37%. In our customer segments, the commercial was up 41%, the service provider was up 40%, enterprise returned to growth, it was up 25% while the public sector was up 22%. Non-GAAP total gross margins came in at 65.6% up 60 basis points year-over-year. Product gross margin was 65% up 180 basis points and Services gross margin was 67.4%, down 240 basis points, which was in line with our expectations as we do see variability from quarter to quarter. The increase in product gross margin was driven by productivity improvements from lower freight and other costs, partially offset by relatively modest price erosion.  As we discussed last quarter, we continue to manage through the supply chain constraints scene industry-wide due to component shortages. We've closely partnered with our key suppliers, leveraging our volume purchasing and extended supply commitments as we address the supply challenges and cost impacts, which we expect will continue at least through the first half of our fiscal year, and potentially into the second half. Our number one rank global supply chain team continues to perform at a world-class level. When you look at the impact of acquisitions on our Q4 results year-over-year, there was a positive 210 basis point impact on revenue and no material impact on our non-GAAP earnings per share.  From a cash perspective, operating cash flow for the quarter was a record 4.5 billion up 18% year-over-year, driven by strong cash collections. We ended Q4 with total cash, cash equivalents, and investments of 24.5 billion up approximately $900 million sequentially. In terms of capital allocation, we returned 2.4 billion to shareholders during the quarter. That was comprised of 1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and 791 million of share repurchases. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline.  During Q4, we closed 5 acquisitions: Kenna Security, Socio Labs, Slido, Sedona Systems, and Involvio. These investments are consistent with our strategy of complementing our internal innovation and R&D with targeted M&A to allow us to further strengthen and differentiate our market position in our key growth areas. Turning to the full fiscal year results, overall, our financial results were solid in a very challenging global pandemic environment with strong operational execution. Revenue was 49.8 billion, up 1%. The total non-GAAP gross margin was 66.1%, up 10 basis points. And our non-GAAP operating margin was 33.5%, down 30 basis points. From a bottom-line perspective, our non-GAAP net income was flat at 13.6 billion, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $3.22.  We delivered an operating cash flow of 15.5 billion, flat compared to fiscal '20. From a cap allocation perspective, we returned 9.1 billion in value to shareholders over the fiscal year, which represents 61% of our free cash flow. That was comprised of 6.2 billion in quarterly cash dividends and 2.9 billion of share repurchases. We also increased our dividend for the 10th consecutive year in fiscal 2021, reinforcing our commitment to return capital to our shareholders, and our confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows. We remain firmly committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet to fuel our organic and inorganic growth initiatives, as well as continuing our cap allocation strategy of returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders annually.  To summarize, we had a great Q4 and a solid fiscal year, with strong operational execution. We're seeing returns on the investments we're making in innovation, and driving the continued shift to more software and subscriptions, driving more recurring revenue, delivering growth, and driving shareholder value. Now let me provide forward-looking guidance. We're pleased to initiate the additional practice of providing an annual outlook to complement our regular quarterly look ahead for the fiscal year 2022. The successful transformation we've been executing around driving a higher proportion of our revenues from subscriptions, recurring and deferred revenue, is affording us additional visibility into our outlook for future growth. Please note our guidance is subject to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier.  Our financial guidance for Q1 is as follows. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 7.5% to 9.5% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 63.5% to 64.5%, reflecting the continuing increase in supply chain costs we are incurring as we protect shipments to our customers. Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 31.5% to 32.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to range from $0.79 to $0.81. Our financial guidance for the full-year fiscal '22 is as follows.  We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 5% to 7% year-on-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to range from $3.38 to $3.45, also up 5% to 7% year-over-year. In both our Q1 and full-year outlook, we are assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. Looking ahead, we're excited to host a Cisco virtual Investor Day on Wednesday, September 15th, 2021, which we will webcast live, and hope you can join us. I will now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Scott. Michelle, let's go ahead and queue up the Q&A line.\nOperator: Thank you. Samik Chatterjee from JP Morgan, you may go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, Chuck, Scott, just wanted to get your thoughts on getting -- in terms of the timing of getting a full-year guide out here. I would think other companies would have said, with the supply chain uncertainty, \"This is probably not the right time to get a full-year guide out,\" so definitely appreciate the full-year guide. And I wanted to understand, what's providing that higher visibility? You mentioned the transformation, but also how are the orders feeding into that visibility, and what are you kind of baking in terms of the supply chain in that full-year guide? Overall, how much of -- what you're baking in terms of headwinds into that full-year guide from a supply chain perspective. Thank you.\nScott Herren: Yeah, that's a great question, Samik. Thanks for that. It really is one of the benefits of the transformation we're making. As we move to more and more software and services and a recurring revenue base, we have greater visibility.  One of the stats that we just talked about is our remaining performance obligations of 30.9 billion of which 53% that will turn into revenue in the next 12 months. We also have a good feel for what other renewals are going to come up and what our renewal rate is as we work our way through this.  So, we have a pretty good sense of a big chunk of our revenue and how it's going to grow. We also have a good view of pipeline and what that looks like ahead, and one of the things that I would say about that pipeline is it's one of the -- we've seen year-over-year growth in the pipeline for Q1 better than we've ever seen in the last several years.  So, we see good growth in the pipeline as well. So, it's when you add all that up, that's what gives us the confidence to give a full-year guide. What I would say is that -- to your question about supply chain and what's the assumption on supply chain, the way to think about that as that's the difference between the high-end and the low-end of the guide. We expect the supply chain to impact us through the first half of the year.  And then at the low-end of the guide, we think we continue to have supply-chain impacts through most of the second half as well, with some clear up at the end. At the high-end of the guide, we think that we've begun to clear up the supply chain issues, supply and demand come back more into balance earlier in the second half. That's why we gave the full-year guide. I think -- certainly, we have the confidence with the visibility we have, and what's baked into that based on some of the uncertainty. It's still out there with the supply chain.\nSamik Chatterjee: Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Samik. We'll take the next question, please.\nOperator: Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley Investment Research, you may go ahead.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. Maybe coupling onto that question, just how should we think about kind of the incremental 150 basis point sequential gross margin decline in the guidance and just how much of that is incremental supply chain impact, and would you expect to abate that through either price changes or supply chain improvement to improve that throughout the year? Thanks.\nScott Herren: Yeah. Thanks, Meta, for that. When you look at the Q4 gross margin, obviously it came in better than what we had expected and what we had guided to, and there was a really favorable product mix built into that, some of that being driven by a good quarter for software as you heard on the call earlier.  Looking ahead, we've taken several steps to ensure that we can continue to have supply and deliver products to our customers. They are in the midst of their own transformations, they're all in the midst of doing the things they have to do to adapt to a world that's not only a hybrid work world but one, with the rise of the delta variant, that -- it's added\nScott Herren: complexity. It's not a, \"Hey, the world's going to go back to normal at some point.\" It's, \"I need to continue to have this flexibility ahead.\" We're trying to support that and at the same time, there are supply and demand imbalances and some of the key components around semiconductors and memory and some of the same things you hear from others of our peers.  That turns into higher component costs as we buy from those suppliers. We're also to ensure even greater supply going to brokers to get additional supply from versus what we can get directly from our suppliers. And in some cases, qualifying second sources where we have to. Each of those, obviously, drives costs and it takes a while for those costs -- We've been in that process through Q4, and we'll be in it through Q1.  It takes a while for those costs to flow through our standard costing system and show up in the cost of goods sold. There's a little bit of unfavorable product mix headwind as well in Q1 as we have a good sense of the products that don't have those same impacts that we will be able to ship, that are sitting in backlog, so that's what's driving that sequential change.  As you know, we did put in place a price increase; very selective, very targeted, only on the products where we were seeing the higher component costs. That went into effect August 7th, but we always honor quotes that are out there for 30 days, beyond that price because it goes -- maybe those quotes were produced before the price increase was put in.  So, scroll 30 days ahead from August 7th before the first orders come in with those higher prices, and then it takes a while for those orders to come in, get built, and shipped back out to customers and for us to realize the benefit of that on the top line. Think of those price increases as being something that we'll feel more of the benefit of in Q2 and Q3 versus what we see in Q1.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks.\nMarilyn Mora: Thank you. Next question, please?\nOperator: Paul Silverstein from Cowen, you may go ahead.\nPaul Silverstein: I appreciate Scott's pick-up on the previous two questions. If I look at your annual guidance, it's strong revenue, it's almost a billion above the consensus number. The EPS is more in line, it's slightly light but not meaningfully.  But the difference obviously is gross margin and or OpEx. I appreciate that COVID has elevated your cost structure, as well as all of your peers. Can you give us any granular insight in terms of translating the revenue upside that you're looking at that you're expecting relatively to the more modest EPS outlook for the year in terms of gross margin versus OpEx?\nScott Herren: Yes. Paul, it really is gross margin driven. And there's still -- there continues to be uncertainty on when the supply and demand get back into balance on many of those components. That's why you see the range that we put out there at 5% to 7%, and that ripples through to the bottom line as well.  I think that the only other comment I'd add on that front, I don't want to get into parsing it down to the various elements, at least at this point, but there's still uncertainty, and given that uncertainty, and this being the first time we've given you annual guide, it's prudent. We're trying to be prudent with the guide we've put out there as well.\nPaul Silverstein: Scott, with respect to OPEX. It is your plan to grow OpEx more modestly than revenue? You're going to -- you're looking at some pretty healthy revenue growth this year. Would you restrain your Opex growth below revenue to try to drive some leverage?\nScott Herren: Yeah. I'll start, and Chuck, you may want to add to this. The way that you see the guidance laid out, 5% to 7% growth on the top line and 5% to 7% growth on the bottom line, we are looking at balanced, profitable growth, and I think that's the way you should expect us to run the business going forward, is balanced profitable growth.  5% to 7% on both the top and bottom line is a pretty strong performance, certainly relative to where we've been over the last few years. And so again, I don't want to get into -- Paul, I know what you're poking at. I really don't want to get into parsing down the elements of that, but the core principle is balanced profitable growth.\nChuck Robbins: Paul --\nPaul Silverstein: Can I ask --\nChuck Robbins: Go ahead, Paul. Go ahead.\nPaul Silverstein: Just one last question on this. Is there any reason why your cost structure from a gross margin perspective -- we envision going back to the 21st Century and getting beyond COVID? Is there any reason why your gross margin structure would not go back to where it was if not better, I recognize you've got mixed in other factors that influence one way or the other from quarter to quarter, but as a general proposition, should we expect the gross margin structure will return to what it was pre-COVID?\nScott Herren: That is our expectation, Paul. Over time, I mean, again, I don't want to predict that for this fiscal year, just given some of the uncertainties in the supply chain, but it is our expectation that it gets back there and over the longer term as we continue to build a bigger mix of software into our revenue stream, that should also provide a bit of a tailwind to our margins.\nPaul Silverstein: I appreciate it.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Paul. Michelle, next question.\nOperator: Aaron Breakers from Wells Fargo. You may go ahead.\nAaron Breakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on a good quarter. I wanted to ask the supply chain question a little bit differently. As you see the order momentum in the pipeline build commentary that you laid out, obviously, is quite positive. How are you assessing the perishability of demand? Are you seeing any signs where customers might be double ordering, or how do you just think about that in the function of the guidance that you've laid out?\nChuck Robbins: Aaron, this is Chuck Thank you for that. Look, we expected to be asked about pull-ahead. I think there's a couple of things that I would say, we obviously can't calculate that directly.  We've looked at several indicators; our pipeline analysis, channel orderings, our salesforce opportunity movement, order cancellation rates, future pipeline build, and we don't see any signs of ordering well ahead of needs other than lining up with what our lead times are. And we have customers that are large carriers, large telcos, Cloud players, who have 12, 18, to 24-month capacity plans.  And so, they look at our lead times and they are going to order into that based on what they have, but we would not say there was a significant amount of pull ahead of other than dealing with the lead times.  The other thing that I would just highlight is that Scott pointed out earlier, after the real strong order growth we saw in Q4, we're sitting with the best start from a forecast pipeline perspective that we've had in several years. That would lead us to believe that this is a trend that we should see to continue for a little while.\nAaron Breakers: Great, thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: All right, great. Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Tim Long from Barclays, you may go ahead.\nTim Long: Thank you. Could you just dig into the software angle a little bit? Numbers seem pretty strong, yet the applications and security lines trail a little bit on the product side. So, could you just parse that through for us? And then, second, just did want to follow up on that cloud piece that was so strong in the quarter. Chuck, any other color you can give on that? It sounded pretty broad-based, but I'm assuming some of your peers also, to the last question, saw a little bit more advanced, longer lead time orders, or is there anything else in that huge cloud number? Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Tim. So, on the Applications front, we expected that you guys might want to ask about that and there's a couple of things to keep in mind in both Applications and Security. The order rates were certainly higher than the revenue rates, so that's the first thing I would tell you. The recurring subscription portions within each of those businesses were also very positive. As Scott said, in Security within Web -- I mean, in collaboration within the applications WebEx suite, the recurring subscriptions within WebEx suite revenue was up 9% in Q4, 16% for the year. We had solid growth in IoT, [Indiscernible] Cloud Contact Center, and Cloud Calling.  What's also in there, if you will recall, is there are phones and handsets, and there's some on-prem software that's associated with collaboration. And some of those were impacted by the supply chain. But the future growth areas actually for us looked really good. On the security front, Cloud Security, Zero Trust over 20%. The Security recurring subscription revenue was up 13% in Q4, up 18% for the year so that was solid as well.  And again, our Next-Generation Firewall demand was really good but some of the legacy products in the supply chain created a little bit of a revenue headwind there. But again, orders were stronger than the revenues. We would expect those to normalize over the next few quarters. As we get to Web scale, this is I have to tell you that preparing for this call, I reflected over the last 5, 6 years of having this discussion.  And I always said that we would start talking about web-scale when it was meaningful, and I guess I can now declare it meaningful. We made multi-year investments building the Cisco 8000 with new silicon, optics, and software, and we had phenomenal growth. And it was a 160% order growth this quarter, over almost 30% order growth a year ago in the same quarter. And the customers are really adopting our entire portfolio, including the enterprise side, but over half of that business landed in their cloud infrastructure.  We also see 400G taking off, really, in a meaningful way, I'll give you a couple of stats on that because someone's probably going to ask it. In Q4, 400G ports, our orders were up 668%, and for the year, 400G port orders were up 831%. We have over 400 customers that have deployed and we've taken orders for almost 180,000 ports total. So, it's really moving forward, and I think those are the things that -- we won several franchises in the cloud Web scale space, we continue to do proof of concepts, we're in validation and certification stages in others. So, we always said that we missed the first transition with these players and that we wanted to be prepared for this next architectural transition and I think our teams have done a great job putting us in a good position.\nTim Long: Okay, thank you very much for the color.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Tim. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead, sir.\nRod Hall: Great. Thanks for the question. A lot of ports, Chuck. A lot of ports. So, I had two questions for you. One is regarding the order growth. I'm curious about linearity there. That last time we talked, the handle on that was back in 2010 when you guys are exiting the GSD, but it seems like those orders could accelerate from here, and I'm curious whether you think that's a possibility or how probable an acceleration is from that 31% growth rate? And then I wanted to come back to this pricing commentary, and I'm curious what the durability of these prices is. What your intention would be once the component cost, these underlying costs go down, will you flex these prices right back down again or do you expect them to sustain themselves a little bit longer? Just curious what your plan on pricing would be as these underlying costs change. Thanks.\nChuck Robbins: Let me start and I'll let Scott comment on the pricing issue as well. You asked a couple of questions there, Rod. On linearity just to give you the quarter, it started hot and ended hot. It was from day one to the end, so this was not like we were 5% growth until the last month, and then it accelerated. It was pretty consistent throughout the entire quarter.  You mentioned the ability to accelerate. I certainly wouldn't expect 31% order growth to be the new standard, but I think that there are certainly going to be -- it just feels like our customers are dealing with -- they're coming out, they're making decisions about modernizing their infrastructure, and their technology assets to deal with this new hybrid work.  And I think now what they're seeing is, that with the Delta variant, they're understanding that this may not be a one -- this may not be one move back to the office. This is going to -- they have to -- they're going to have to be resilient, they're going to have to build adaptability in for future because we could have the next variant six months from now.  And I think that's what customers are thinking through right now. The comment I'd make on pricing and then I'll let Scott talk about the durability of them is, one thing that as we talk about gross margin in the quarter we just finished, the pricing element of gross margin was actually at the very low end of our normal range, which means we're holding pricing with our sales teams, which is a good sign right now. So once these things start flowing through, if that trend continues, then we would certainly see the favorable impact that we expect. Scott?\nScott Herren: Yeah, I think that's right. I think, Rod, the other way that I would ask you to think about the price increases we just announced on August 7th, those are really -- they're not motivated by driving top line as much as they're motivated by offsetting some of the cost increases, we're seeing.  Now, there's a lag effect, right? It's going to take time before we see those prices show up actually in our revenue stream, but they are really motivated by that. And so, we'll continue to assess as we always do, if we need to make another price adjustment, up or down. We'll continue to make those assessments going forward.  Don't think about them as being motivated, though, by top-line drivers. It's really motivated by offsetting some of the higher costs that we're seeing. But the other thing I would just close on this one is that we have a price increase methodology that we deploy on a regular basis for different portfolios. We just don't talk about it on our earnings calls every time, but this is a muscle we have that we actually use on a fairly regular basis when the conditions warrant it.\nRod Hall: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Sami Badri from Credit Suisse. You may go ahead.\nSami Badri: Thank you. My first question is on your gross margin s and just the cost of products and the question really is just around how much of these cost inputs can Cisco control versus how many of them are not controllable at all? So that's the first question. And then the second question is, going back to some of your wins with the Series 8000, how much of these wins are completely new deployments versus you going head-to-head with an incumbent or going head-to-head with other competing vendors for those deployments, right? Or existing replacement or new deployments, and that would be great. Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Sure. Sami, I'll start on the cost of goods sold. It's overwhelmingly driven by the component costs and the contract manufacturing costs to do the various levels of assembly inside there versus something that we have the ability to flux -- to flex up or down. I would think of that as being significantly driven by some of the factors that we've talked about with the imbalance of supply and demand.  And Sami, on your second question, it's really difficult to say which ones are new, which ones that we compete with an incumbent. But I will tell you we're in -- we're competing with incumbents on every one of them because even if it's a new architecture they are building, they have incumbents who are certainly competing with us.\nChuck Robbins: These are all super competitive and our teams have built some great technology. And so, it's -- and the cloud providers, they like diversity in their supply chain. They like diversity from a supplier perspective, and one other data point I meant to give earlier when Tim asked about the cloud business that we gave on the call last time, I want to make sure we share with you again, Web scale comprised 30% of our Service Provider segment from an orders perspective for the quarter.\nSami Badri: Got it. Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks. Chuck, next question?\nOperator: Simon Leopold from Raymond James, you may go ahead, sir.\nSimon Leopold: Thank you very much for taking the question. I think you've alluded to 31% order growth not being sustainable. Can you give us some idea of what you see as really the sustainable or more normalized level? And also, if you could comment on your purchase order commitment because I've assumed that the substantial commitments you've made help you lock in and secure pricing when you made those commitments and represents, I guess, a way of controlling the headwind as we think about the full-year model. I want to make sure I'm understanding that correctly. Thank you.\nScott Herren: Sure. I'll start on the second part of that and then I'll let Chuck weigh in on the order growth. Clearly, as we locked in some of that -- some of the work that we did on supply and particularly going after components that are particularly at an imbalance between supply and demand, we locked in both. We looked at both for costs that would come in for that and what the committed delivery schedule was on those.  We have a good sense of that for a subset of our components. There's still going to be fluctuation in some areas, memory is a good example, there's going to continue to be fluctuation in pricing and we'll continue to monitor that.  You saw us -- you've seen us in the past, make price adjustments based on memory cost increases, and I would expect that to be kind of an ongoing process there. But for the ones that we locked in, which were the -- I think the ones that are -- that had the greatest imbalance and the highest demand, both for us and for our competitors, we locked in both from that standpoint.\nChuck Robbins: Yes. And on the side of the order, that's a difficult question to answer. What I would say is that this is the first time we've given long-range guidance or annual guidance on both revenue and EPS. We have Investor Day coming up on the 15th where we're going to talk about the key growth drivers in our business and we're also going to begin to share new metrics that will give you a flavor of the business in a different way.  So, I think that's what as we spend time on that day, I think the drivers of growth will be clear to you, and I think that bookings will only be one metric that we'll look at, relative to future performance.\nSimon Leopold: Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Next question, please.\nOperator: Fahad Najam from MKM Partners. You may go ahead, sir.\nFahad Najam: Thank you very much for taking my question. In terms of the order strength, do you have any way of parsing out any double ordering or forward pull-in orders from your customers, and have you adjusted for that? And I have a follow-up.\nScott Herren: So, Fahad, as I was saying earlier, what we've looked at is, we've compared a lot of the -- our pipeline pulls ahead activity, we've looked at our future pipeline, we looked at order cancellation rates, and we just don't see anything.  So based on what we know now, we certainly think customers are placing orders further in advance because of lead times, which is just logical, but that's basically -- when you see the order growth, we saw in Q4 and then you see the forecast pipeline that we see going forward, it would suggest that there's still a fair amount of demand out there.  Fahad, we're staying on top of that as much as possible as you can imagine, and Chuck talked earlier about some of the data points we're looking at to try to get a feel for it. Order cancellations would be one indication of double ordering from us and another party.  Order cancellation rates have actually come down modestly. Return rates, looking at the pipeline and the pipeline growth, we're not seeing it at any material level. I think the other thing, the other data point we gave is the growth of commercial.  So, if you look at the orders, the overall order growth, Commercial is up 41%. And I think where you might expect to see some of what you're talking about is actually in the Enterprise segment or EPS. We saw significant growth in Commercials and I don't think you'd expect to see as much of that kind of a double ordering process happen in that customer size.\nFahad Najam: I appreciate that. Chuck, if I could ask you big picture questions. Before COVID-19 happened, I think you had mentioned that for the first time, virtually every product line in Cisco's family of products had been repriced.  To the extent, how much of the strength you're seeing the function of the product refresh cycle that is taking place across all your product lines versus total new growth? For example, like Edge Cloud, which I think is going to be a totally new network of growth architecture that's never been deployed before, so it's like the new phase of growth.  How much of the strength you're seeing in the function of this refresh versus a new phase of growth in [Indiscernible]?\nChuck Robbins: What I would say is there are several transformations that are occurring or transitions that are occurring across our customer base that we're just well-positioned for. If you think about what's happened with 5G and WIFI 6, this whole move now to hybrid work, the whole re-architecting of infrastructure to support Hybrid Cloud, this 400 Gig transition that we spoke about earlier, these are all things that we have been working on our portfolio.  So, I think the refreshed portfolio and the new innovation that has been brought forward is just timely because we're on the front end of some of these big transitions that we've been talking about for several years. So, I think that's really what's driving it.  The teams have -- at the Investor and Analysts Day, on the 15th of September, we're going to have our engineering leaders talking about what all they've done, and what the future looks like, and what the innovation pipeline looks like. And I feel really good about what they've built, but we have a lot of plans for new technology and new capabilities.\nFahad Najam: I appreciate the answer, thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Jim Suva from Citigroup Global Markets, you may go ahead, sir.\nJim Suva: Thanks very much. It's Jim Suva. I had one question. The long-term full-year outlook of sales and EPS is greatly appreciated, and I noticed that's a big difference and shows a lot of conviction. But on the EPS, normally you also have some stock buyback going in. But some companies include stock buyback in their EPS guide, some don't.  So, what I'm wondering is, on your EPS guide, does it include some normal stock buyback? I know this year was different when you bought Acacia for about 4.5 billion and COVID, but I wondering, how we should think about that EPS. Does it include stock buyback or what are the components of the EPS growth that match sales growth?\nScott Herren: Great question, Jim. It only assumes that our share buybacks offset dilution. So, think of that as you're doing your own modeling, think of the share count to be roughly flat to where it ends this year.\nJim Suva: Got you. Thank you so much for the clarification. It's great to hear all the details.\nScott Herren: Thanks, Jim.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Jim. Next question.\nOperator: Jeff Kvaal from Wolfe Research, you may go ahead.\nJeff Kvaal: Thanks very much. I am hoping to get a little bit of clarification into the software growth trajectory. It sounds like it's a great year overall, and the fourth quarter maybe didn't close as well as you'd like, and if we can talk about the trajectory, we should expect for Software growth in 2022, that would be splendid.\nChuck Robbins: I'll start with some color, and then, Scott, you can chime in. I think we continue to add more software capabilities across the portfolio. We continue to transition. We've, we've transitioned a lot of our portfolio to subscription-based even for the hardware side of the business. Most of the acquisitions that we do come in subscription or SaaS software businesses. So, we would expect to continue just this move towards it becoming a greater percentage of our portfolio.  In the next couple of years, we think we also will see some of the renewal volumes will start kicking in on top of it as well, but it's already -- the transformation has already made a big difference. Scott, and I we're looking at last quarter when we did guidance for Q4. having the software revenue that came off the balance sheet significantly altered positively what we were able to guide from a revenue perspective in Q4 versus what we would have done 5 or 6 years ago.  It was meaningful. And so, we're going to continue to invest in this capability, we are going to continue to drive software. It's a hugely important part of the business, the teams have done a great job, Scott?\nScott Herren: Yeah. Jeff, what I'd say is at 4 billion of software revenue over the last 90 days, we're one of the biggest software companies in the world. I mean, annualize that or look at the trailing 12 months, makes us somewhere in the top 10 in software companies in the world. We posted 6% overall growth and 9% growth in subscriptions even off that base. So, I think the software business is actually doing quite well for us.  What's underneath your question is that what you saw on applications, I'll go back to what we said earlier, about what's happening in Applications. Underneath that, you got to remember that includes the entire collaboration portfolio, so not just the software pieces and not just the recurring software pieces, there are hardware elements there, there are some legacy on-prem elements there, both of those were headwinds.  In the subscription software revenue piece of both Applications and Security, we saw double-digit growth. We had nice growth year-on-year for the full year in both of those. So, I actually feel good about where we're headed on that.\nJeff Kvaal: Great. And then a quick clarification. Do you all plan to update the annual guidance every quarter for us?\nScott Herren: We will assess it every quarter and update it as needed. I -- the big variable in there, of course, is what happens with the supply chain and when do we start to see a little more balance come to supply and demand across some of our key components. And I think that will -- that will dictate when we've got a good view for updating.\nJeff Kvaal: Thank you both very much.\nScott Herren: Thanks, Jeff.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks Jeff, and we've got time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. Ben Bolan from Cleveland Research. You may go ahead, sir.\nBen Bolan: Thanks for getting me in at the end. I also want to focus a little bit on software. A few specific items. First, I'm curious how you think about your average contract duration and what you're seeing on average invoice duration as you shift more to software and any high-level implications you see for cash flow over time? The second item is I'm curious if you've seen any trends with early renewals from the early DNA customers, what's happened at those renewals? And then the last piece, how do you think about longer-term, making sure you're driving good utilization and consumption of the software licenses within the customer base? Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: You want to take the first?\nScott Herren: Yeah, okay. You managed to get in three there, Ben, on the one-question limit. I'll talk a bit about duration first. You see in our remaining performance obligations, you see the nice growth, 30.9 billion in total RPO is a record for us. What I'd say is underneath there, the short-term is about 53% of that.  They're growing, somewhat balanced, slightly more growth in the long-term than in short term, but that's what you'd expect given that many of them -- remember the short term is just the next 12 months, so the first year, the long term is anything beyond that. So, it's not surprising to see long-term growth a little bit more.  We're not seeing a big change in duration overall. And maybe I'll go ahead and hit the last one, Chuck, and then leave the DNA question for you. As we look at the renewal rates and the actions we have to take, our renewal base is obviously growing and becoming much more important to us ahead. And obviously, renewals are dependent on adoption.  We've put in place very specific processes to understand where our customers are on usage and on adoption. And you've got to -- if you don't drive the adoption, you don't get the renewal. And so, we're attacking it at that level. I think the team's done a nice job getting some headlights on that, some early warning, and getting ahead of ensuring that we actually get the adoption we need.\nChuck Robbins: Yeah, that's connected to the DNA renewal thing because we actually have Customer Service -- I mean, Customer Success Specialists that are in the field that are working with customers every day, we've got virtual teller inside the organization also doing Customer Success, so the adoption piece is really important.  As it relates to DNA, then -- we've had sort of a handful in the first half of this year of those renewals that will come through, there's a little bit more in the second half and then fiscal '23 is where it's actually a much more meaningful number.  And our teams have been working on the underlying processes, the metric. the process, the systems, measurements, and the engineering teams have been working really hard on continuing to evolve the offer to ensure that there's enough innovation going forward that will optimize our opportunity on the renewal side of it. It's a bit early and I'd say maybe the second half of next year we can get -- or this fiscal year, we can give you a little more on that. And then, into fiscal '23 is when it's a decent size number.\nBen Bolan: Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Great. Thanks, Ben, for the question. And Chuck will want to come with some closing remarks or I can close it up?\nChuck Robbins: I'll close it now and head it to you. I'm really proud of our team. I'm really proud of the performance, and we're certainly pleased with the demand that we've seen. I'm super happy with the transformation, we believe our investments are paying off, our software business, the work we're doing with the web-scale and the cloud providers, and across the portfolio.  I think our technology will help our customers deal with this emerging focus on resiliency and agility and adaptability, and then most of all, I want to thank our teams for the incredible execution, not only in Q4 but over the last 12 to 18 months during a very complicated time. And I'd like to also just remind you and encourage you all to join us on September 15th for Investor Day. Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Chuck. So, Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call which will reflect our fiscal 2022 first-quarter results, will be on Wednesday, November 17th, 2021 at 1:30 PM Pacific Time, 4:30 PM Eastern Time.  Again, I'd like to remind the audience that in light of Regulation FD, Cisco's policy is not to comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. We will now plan to close the call. If you have any further questions, feel free to contact the Cisco Investor Relations group, and we thank you all very much for joining today's call.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's conference call. If you would like to listen to the call in its entirety, you may call 1800-388-4923. For participants dialing from outside the U.S., please dial 1-203-369-3800. This concludes today's call. You may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Chuck Robbins",
            "content": "Thank you, Marilyn. And good afternoon, everyone. I hope you're all remaining healthy and staying safe. Our team at Cisco ended fiscal 2021 with an incredibly strong finish. We had an outstanding Q4 performance and fiscal year revenue reflecting strength across our portfolio, customer segments, and geographies. Our product order growth was the highest we've seen in over a decade and we're continuing to see strong customer reception to the accelerated investments in software and subscriptions. This great momentum is reaffirming our position as the worldwide leader in technology that powers the internet and a digital enterprise.  As I think about our achievements over the past year, three things stand out to me: First, the exceptional execution of our teams. We achieved these results through the extraordinary efforts of our leadership team, our partners, and most importantly, our people around the world, who operated with incredible speed and at an unprecedented scale to deliver this growth. Second, our transformation and strategic investments are paying off. The benefits of our shift to software and subscriptions are clear and they are helping both Cisco and our customers move with greater speed and agility. And third, the power of our portfolio. The groundbreaking innovation we are investing in today will serve as the foundation for our customers' futures.  These three factors position us exceptionally well for growth as we enter our next fiscal year, as evidenced by our results this quarter. We're more confident than ever that we are in a strong position to help our customers be successful. As we look forward, we are laser-focused on providing our customers the technologies they will need to successfully navigate highly dynamic environments at an incredibly rapid pace. With the rise of COVID variance and the inconsistent pace of vaccine deployment around the globe, organizations must be resilient and adaptable as we've seen how quickly the world around us can change. While this may impact certain short-term plans, like a return to the office for many, one thing is clear, there's tremendous demand for Cisco's technology.  No matter how or when the global recovery takes shape, we are executing on our vision of rebuilding a better world, one that is digital, sustainable, inclusive, and highly secure. I believe we're at a pivotal moment in our Company's history as we have a massive opportunity to transform what has been the traditional office and define the future of hybrid work. As our customers look to create safer hybrid workplaces, as well as collaborative, and engaging experiences for their customers and employees, we believe they are becoming increasingly reliant on Cisco technologies to help them with their transformation and resiliency.  Enterprises are increasingly seeking digital and cloud-enabled services, which is driving demand for our solutions and leading to new and expansive market opportunities for Cisco. We're in a unique leadership position to build and deliver innovative cloud-to-edge infrastructure platforms that our customers need. With the depth and breadth of our hardware, software, silicon, and optics solutions, we are helping companies solve their biggest challenges. Whether it's adopting modern application architectures, shifting to hybrid work and hybrid cloud, securing their enterprise, or meeting their ESG goals, Cisco is helping our customers thrive in a hybrid world. These industry dynamics helped drive our strong fourth-quarter performance.  The momentum we saw in Q3 accelerated through Q4 as we delivered robust revenue growth, increased earnings, strong margins, and record operating cash flow. We also generated strong double-digit growth in product deferred revenue, reflecting the success of our transformation around driving subscriptions and recurring revenues which increases our visibility into future performance. We're seeing IT budgets grow as companies begin to implement their critical future plans and business confidence increases.  However, we do recognize that uncertainty remains around COVID-19, and we're closely monitoring the delta variant and its impact on customer spending. Right now, we are not seeing any additional impact on our business, aside from the components shortage we've been facing over the past several months. Moving to the performance of our customer segments. As I mentioned, we delivered the highest product order growth in over a decade with a growth of 31% driven by strength across all of our end markets.  This outstanding performance is also up over 17% from our pre-COVID Q4 levels in the Fiscal year 2019. We saw double-digit growth in every one of our customer segments. This strength is being driven by stronger customer investment in substantial network upgrades to help modernize and secure their environment to support the new way of working. Specifically, in our enterprise business, we had the best quarter in terms of product orders in over a decade and saw a very strong order growth of 25%. We also had our third consecutive quarter of acceleration in our commercial Service Provider and public sector businesses, with all of these segments showing growth in excess of 20%.  In our web-scale business, we saw increased momentum delivering record performance with over 160% order growth. And on a trailing four-quarter basis, orders grew over 80% due to customers adopting products across the portfolio and early traction of our 400-gig Solutions, a huge testament to the investments we have made in accelerating innovation and the differentiated value we're bringing to these customers from a product portfolio perspective, we also had a very balanced performance. As customers prepare for office re-openings and hybrid work, they are increasing their investment across our networking, Cloud Security, and Unified Communications portfolios.  In Q4, we saw double-digit revenue growth in campus switching, Catalyst 9000, high-end routing, wireless, and in our Zero Trust solutions, along with strength in our security endpoint portfolio. We also had a very strong adoption of our Acacia optical solutions driven by increasing customer demand for leading-edge technology to address their growing bandwidth requirements. The transformation of our business to more software and subscriptions continues to show tremendous progress, as we achieved over $4 billion in software revenue in Q4, an increase of 7% sequentially and up 6% year-over-year.  Within that, subscription revenue grew 9% in Q4 and 15% for the full fiscal year. For perspective, Software represented 31% of our business in Q4. And for the full year, when combined with our services business, they represent over 53% of revenue, clearly highlighting the success of our continued business transformation. In addition to delivering strong financial results, our innovation engine continues to accelerate. Over the last year, we introduced an impressive number of new capabilities across our entire portfolio, while also doubling down on more flexible consumption models, including our core networking capabilities as a service highlighted by the recent launch of Cisco Plus.  Our new Cisco Plus solutions deliver cross-portfolio technologies to help solve our customers' biggest needs with faster time-to-value network-as-a-service as-a-service offerings that deliver hybrid cloud technologies and will later expand to a broader catalog of services built and delivered with our partner ecosystem. Cisco Plus improved speed, agility, and scale with on-demand solutions that intelligently adapt to our customers' business needs. While still early days in its launch, Cisco Plus directly aligns with our transformation goals around driving more subscription-based recurring revenue via the cloud.  Our unique strengths improvement strategy gives us the confidence to move at a more accelerated pace. You will see us continue to invest in our key growth areas in technology shifts like hybrid cloud, hybrid work, 5G, Wi-Fi 6, Edge, security, and cloud-native architectures to extend our technology leadership positions. You will also see us deliver even more strategic offers to enable our customers to thrive in a Cloud-first digital world. These include full-stack observability to improve their digital experiences by providing visibility and insights across their entire technology stack and Secure Access Service Edge or SASE, designed to enable seamless secure access to applications anywhere their users work.  Given the momentum we're seeing in our business, we have more conviction than ever that we are investing in the right areas and will continue to extend our competitive advantages and drive growth. Before I turn it over to Scott for more details on the quarter and our expectations for the next Fiscal year, let me give you an update on the supply environment. While we're seeing increasing demand for our technology, we're also continuing to manage through the component shortage challenges that nearly every Company is experiencing our world-class supply chain team, as always, is doing an incredible job navigating this complex situation by working with our global suppliers to meet customer demand as quickly as possible.  Looking ahead, we expect the supply challenges and cost impacts to continue through at least the first half of our fiscal year and potentially into the second half. In summary, demand for our technology is very strong and our strategy is more relevant than ever. This allows us to deliver greater value to our customers, partners, and communities as we all adapt to new ways of living and working. I am very encouraged by the recovery trajectory across the board and with our momentum. I am confident in our strategy and investments. I feel great about the innovation we're driving in our portfolio, and I'm incredibly proud of what our teams and partners have achieved.  I look forward to building on these insights with a more comprehensive, deep dive on our multiyear vision and strategic growth drivers at our virtual Investor Day on September 15th and I hope you'll join us. Thank you again for your time. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott for additional detail. Paul -- Go ahead, Paul. Go ahead. Aaron, this is Chuck Thank you for that. Look, we expected to be asked about pull-ahead. I think there's a couple of things that I would say, we obviously can't calculate that directly.  We've looked at several indicators; our pipeline analysis, channel orderings, our salesforce opportunity movement, order cancellation rates, future pipeline build, and we don't see any signs of ordering well ahead of needs other than lining up with what our lead times are. And we have customers that are large carriers, large telcos, Cloud players, who have 12, 18, to 24-month capacity plans.  And so, they look at our lead times and they are going to order into that based on what they have, but we would not say there was a significant amount of pull ahead of other than dealing with the lead times.  The other thing that I would just highlight is that Scott pointed out earlier, after the real strong order growth we saw in Q4, we're sitting with the best start from a forecast pipeline perspective that we've had in several years. That would lead us to believe that this is a trend that we should see to continue for a little while. Thanks, Tim. So, on the Applications front, we expected that you guys might want to ask about that and there's a couple of things to keep in mind in both Applications and Security. The order rates were certainly higher than the revenue rates, so that's the first thing I would tell you. The recurring subscription portions within each of those businesses were also very positive. As Scott said, in Security within Web -- I mean, in collaboration within the applications WebEx suite, the recurring subscriptions within WebEx suite revenue was up 9% in Q4, 16% for the year. We had solid growth in IoT, [Indiscernible] Cloud Contact Center, and Cloud Calling.  What's also in there, if you will recall, is there are phones and handsets, and there's some on-prem software that's associated with collaboration. And some of those were impacted by the supply chain. But the future growth areas actually for us looked really good. On the security front, Cloud Security, Zero Trust over 20%. The Security recurring subscription revenue was up 13% in Q4, up 18% for the year so that was solid as well.  And again, our Next-Generation Firewall demand was really good but some of the legacy products in the supply chain created a little bit of a revenue headwind there. But again, orders were stronger than the revenues. We would expect those to normalize over the next few quarters. As we get to Web scale, this is I have to tell you that preparing for this call, I reflected over the last 5, 6 years of having this discussion.  And I always said that we would start talking about web-scale when it was meaningful, and I guess I can now declare it meaningful. We made multi-year investments building the Cisco 8000 with new silicon, optics, and software, and we had phenomenal growth. And it was a 160% order growth this quarter, over almost 30% order growth a year ago in the same quarter. And the customers are really adopting our entire portfolio, including the enterprise side, but over half of that business landed in their cloud infrastructure.  We also see 400G taking off, really, in a meaningful way, I'll give you a couple of stats on that because someone's probably going to ask it. In Q4, 400G ports, our orders were up 668%, and for the year, 400G port orders were up 831%. We have over 400 customers that have deployed and we've taken orders for almost 180,000 ports total. So, it's really moving forward, and I think those are the things that -- we won several franchises in the cloud Web scale space, we continue to do proof of concepts, we're in validation and certification stages in others. So, we always said that we missed the first transition with these players and that we wanted to be prepared for this next architectural transition and I think our teams have done a great job putting us in a good position. Let me start and I'll let Scott comment on the pricing issue as well. You asked a couple of questions there, Rod. On linearity just to give you the quarter, it started hot and ended hot. It was from day one to the end, so this was not like we were 5% growth until the last month, and then it accelerated. It was pretty consistent throughout the entire quarter.  You mentioned the ability to accelerate. I certainly wouldn't expect 31% order growth to be the new standard, but I think that there are certainly going to be -- it just feels like our customers are dealing with -- they're coming out, they're making decisions about modernizing their infrastructure, and their technology assets to deal with this new hybrid work.  And I think now what they're seeing is, that with the Delta variant, they're understanding that this may not be a one -- this may not be one move back to the office. This is going to -- they have to -- they're going to have to be resilient, they're going to have to build adaptability in for future because we could have the next variant six months from now.  And I think that's what customers are thinking through right now. The comment I'd make on pricing and then I'll let Scott talk about the durability of them is, one thing that as we talk about gross margin in the quarter we just finished, the pricing element of gross margin was actually at the very low end of our normal range, which means we're holding pricing with our sales teams, which is a good sign right now. So once these things start flowing through, if that trend continues, then we would certainly see the favorable impact that we expect. Scott? Sure. Sami, I'll start on the cost of goods sold. It's overwhelmingly driven by the component costs and the contract manufacturing costs to do the various levels of assembly inside there versus something that we have the ability to flux -- to flex up or down. I would think of that as being significantly driven by some of the factors that we've talked about with the imbalance of supply and demand.  And Sami, on your second question, it's really difficult to say which ones are new, which ones that we compete with an incumbent. But I will tell you we're in -- we're competing with incumbents on every one of them because even if it's a new architecture they are building, they have incumbents who are certainly competing with us. These are all super competitive and our teams have built some great technology. And so, it's -- and the cloud providers, they like diversity in their supply chain. They like diversity from a supplier perspective, and one other data point I meant to give earlier when Tim asked about the cloud business that we gave on the call last time, I want to make sure we share with you again, Web scale comprised 30% of our Service Provider segment from an orders perspective for the quarter. Yes. And on the side of the order, that's a difficult question to answer. What I would say is that this is the first time we've given long-range guidance or annual guidance on both revenue and EPS. We have Investor Day coming up on the 15th where we're going to talk about the key growth drivers in our business and we're also going to begin to share new metrics that will give you a flavor of the business in a different way.  So, I think that's what as we spend time on that day, I think the drivers of growth will be clear to you, and I think that bookings will only be one metric that we'll look at, relative to future performance. What I would say is there are several transformations that are occurring or transitions that are occurring across our customer base that we're just well-positioned for. If you think about what's happened with 5G and WIFI 6, this whole move now to hybrid work, the whole re-architecting of infrastructure to support Hybrid Cloud, this 400 Gig transition that we spoke about earlier, these are all things that we have been working on our portfolio.  So, I think the refreshed portfolio and the new innovation that has been brought forward is just timely because we're on the front end of some of these big transitions that we've been talking about for several years. So, I think that's really what's driving it.  The teams have -- at the Investor and Analysts Day, on the 15th of September, we're going to have our engineering leaders talking about what all they've done, and what the future looks like, and what the innovation pipeline looks like. And I feel really good about what they've built, but we have a lot of plans for new technology and new capabilities. I'll start with some color, and then, Scott, you can chime in. I think we continue to add more software capabilities across the portfolio. We continue to transition. We've, we've transitioned a lot of our portfolio to subscription-based even for the hardware side of the business. Most of the acquisitions that we do come in subscription or SaaS software businesses. So, we would expect to continue just this move towards it becoming a greater percentage of our portfolio.  In the next couple of years, we think we also will see some of the renewal volumes will start kicking in on top of it as well, but it's already -- the transformation has already made a big difference. Scott, and I we're looking at last quarter when we did guidance for Q4. having the software revenue that came off the balance sheet significantly altered positively what we were able to guide from a revenue perspective in Q4 versus what we would have done 5 or 6 years ago.  It was meaningful. And so, we're going to continue to invest in this capability, we are going to continue to drive software. It's a hugely important part of the business, the teams have done a great job, Scott? You want to take the first? Yeah, that's connected to the DNA renewal thing because we actually have Customer Service -- I mean, Customer Success Specialists that are in the field that are working with customers every day, we've got virtual teller inside the organization also doing Customer Success, so the adoption piece is really important.  As it relates to DNA, then -- we've had sort of a handful in the first half of this year of those renewals that will come through, there's a little bit more in the second half and then fiscal '23 is where it's actually a much more meaningful number.  And our teams have been working on the underlying processes, the metric. the process, the systems, measurements, and the engineering teams have been working really hard on continuing to evolve the offer to ensure that there's enough innovation going forward that will optimize our opportunity on the renewal side of it. It's a bit early and I'd say maybe the second half of next year we can get -- or this fiscal year, we can give you a little more on that. And then, into fiscal '23 is when it's a decent size number. I'll close it now and head it to you. I'm really proud of our team. I'm really proud of the performance, and we're certainly pleased with the demand that we've seen. I'm super happy with the transformation, we believe our investments are paying off, our software business, the work we're doing with the web-scale and the cloud providers, and across the portfolio.  I think our technology will help our customers deal with this emerging focus on resiliency and agility and adaptability, and then most of all, I want to thank our teams for the incredible execution, not only in Q4 but over the last 12 to 18 months during a very complicated time. And I'd like to also just remind you and encourage you all to join us on September 15th for Investor Day. Thank you."

            "name": "Scott Herren",
            "content": "Thanks, Chuck. Our fourth quarter reflects a strong close to our fiscal year with significant momentum across our business. We saw robust customer demand, demonstrating the third consecutive increase in product order growth and solid execution by our teams. I'll provide some detail on our financial results for the quarter, then cover the full fiscal year, followed by our guidance. Q4 was a very strong quarter and a very dynamic environment. We executed exceptionally well, with greater than 30% product order growth year on year, and more than 17% order growth versus our pre-COVID Q4 fiscal 19 product bookings, driven by strength across our portfolio.  In fact, it was the strongest product order growth rate in over a decade. We also had strong results across revenue, net income, earnings per share, and as Chuck said earlier, record operating cash flows. Total revenue increased to 13.1 billion, up 8% year-over-year, coming in at the high end of our guidance range for the quarter. We saw strength in a number of product areas and across all geographies. Our business continues to recover well and build momentum with sequential revenue growth of 3%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 33.5%, up 50 basis points. Non-GAAP net income was 3.6 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.84. Both up 5% year-over-year and exceeding the high-end of our guidance range.  Now let me turn to provide more detail on our Q4 revenue. Total product revenue was 9.7 billion, up 10%. Service revenue was 3.4 billion, up 3%. infrastructure platforms performed very well with revenues up 13%. All businesses saw double-digit growth with the exception of the Data Center. Switching had strong growth driven by a double-digit increase in Campus Switching, led by our Catalyst 9K and Meraki Switching offerings. We also had solid growth in our Data Center Switching portfolio with the Nexus 9000 products. Routing grew driven by both the Service Provider and Enterprise markets as we saw strong adoption across our portfolio, including a robust uptake of our Cisco 8000 platform.  Wireless had a strong growth driven by the continued ramp of our WIFI 6 products and our Meraki wireless offerings. Data Center revenue declined driven primarily by servers as we expended -- experienced continued market contraction. Applications were down 1% driven by a slight decline in our collaboration portfolio. However, recurring subscription revenue within our WebEx suite grew 9% in Q4. We also saw solid growth in IoT software, AppDynamics, Cloud Contact Center, and our Cloud Calling platforms.  Security was up 1%. Our Cloud security and Zero Trust portfolios performed well with greater than 20% growth as we had continued momentum in our Duo and Umbrella offerings. Our Security recurring subscription revenue grew 13% in Q4 and 18% for the full fiscal year. In both applications and security, we're seeing strong revenue growth in the strategic areas that we and our customers are investing in. We continue to transform our business, delivering more software offerings and driving growth in subscriptions and recurring revenue. Software revenue was 4 billion, an increase of 6%, subscriptions were 81% of total software revenue up 3 points year-over-year. Software subscription revenue grew 9% in Q4 and 15% for the full Fiscal year.  As we continue to increase our software subscriptions, we're driving higher levels of recurring revenue. Additionally, the strength of our portfolio and transition to more software and services is driving growth in remaining performance obligations or RPO. At the end of Q4, RPO crossed the 30 billion marks at 30.9 billion up 9%. RPO for the product was up 18% and service was up 3%. Approximately 53% of the total RPO is short-term, meaning it will be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months. As I mentioned, we had exceptionally strong order momentum in Q4 as total product orders were up 31% with strength across the business.  Looking at our geographies, the Americas was up 34%, EMEA was up 24%, and APJC was up 29%. Total emerging markets were up 25% with the BRICs plus Mexico up 37%. In our customer segments, the commercial was up 41%, the service provider was up 40%, enterprise returned to growth, it was up 25% while the public sector was up 22%. Non-GAAP total gross margins came in at 65.6% up 60 basis points year-over-year. Product gross margin was 65% up 180 basis points and Services gross margin was 67.4%, down 240 basis points, which was in line with our expectations as we do see variability from quarter to quarter. The increase in product gross margin was driven by productivity improvements from lower freight and other costs, partially offset by relatively modest price erosion.  As we discussed last quarter, we continue to manage through the supply chain constraints scene industry-wide due to component shortages. We've closely partnered with our key suppliers, leveraging our volume purchasing and extended supply commitments as we address the supply challenges and cost impacts, which we expect will continue at least through the first half of our fiscal year, and potentially into the second half. Our number one rank global supply chain team continues to perform at a world-class level. When you look at the impact of acquisitions on our Q4 results year-over-year, there was a positive 210 basis point impact on revenue and no material impact on our non-GAAP earnings per share.  From a cash perspective, operating cash flow for the quarter was a record 4.5 billion up 18% year-over-year, driven by strong cash collections. We ended Q4 with total cash, cash equivalents, and investments of 24.5 billion up approximately $900 million sequentially. In terms of capital allocation, we returned 2.4 billion to shareholders during the quarter. That was comprised of 1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and 791 million of share repurchases. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline.  During Q4, we closed 5 acquisitions: Kenna Security, Socio Labs, Slido, Sedona Systems, and Involvio. These investments are consistent with our strategy of complementing our internal innovation and R&D with targeted M&A to allow us to further strengthen and differentiate our market position in our key growth areas. Turning to the full fiscal year results, overall, our financial results were solid in a very challenging global pandemic environment with strong operational execution. Revenue was 49.8 billion, up 1%. The total non-GAAP gross margin was 66.1%, up 10 basis points. And our non-GAAP operating margin was 33.5%, down 30 basis points. From a bottom-line perspective, our non-GAAP net income was flat at 13.6 billion, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $3.22.  We delivered an operating cash flow of 15.5 billion, flat compared to fiscal '20. From a cap allocation perspective, we returned 9.1 billion in value to shareholders over the fiscal year, which represents 61% of our free cash flow. That was comprised of 6.2 billion in quarterly cash dividends and 2.9 billion of share repurchases. We also increased our dividend for the 10th consecutive year in fiscal 2021, reinforcing our commitment to return capital to our shareholders, and our confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows. We remain firmly committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet to fuel our organic and inorganic growth initiatives, as well as continuing our cap allocation strategy of returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders annually.  To summarize, we had a great Q4 and a solid fiscal year, with strong operational execution. We're seeing returns on the investments we're making in innovation, and driving the continued shift to more software and subscriptions, driving more recurring revenue, delivering growth, and driving shareholder value. Now let me provide forward-looking guidance. We're pleased to initiate the additional practice of providing an annual outlook to complement our regular quarterly look ahead for the fiscal year 2022. The successful transformation we've been executing around driving a higher proportion of our revenues from subscriptions, recurring and deferred revenue, is affording us additional visibility into our outlook for future growth. Please note our guidance is subject to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier.  Our financial guidance for Q1 is as follows. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 7.5% to 9.5% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 63.5% to 64.5%, reflecting the continuing increase in supply chain costs we are incurring as we protect shipments to our customers. Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 31.5% to 32.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to range from $0.79 to $0.81. Our financial guidance for the full-year fiscal '22 is as follows.  We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 5% to 7% year-on-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to range from $3.38 to $3.45, also up 5% to 7% year-over-year. In both our Q1 and full-year outlook, we are assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. Looking ahead, we're excited to host a Cisco virtual Investor Day on Wednesday, September 15th, 2021, which we will webcast live, and hope you can join us. I will now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A. Yeah, that's a great question, Samik. Thanks for that. It really is one of the benefits of the transformation we're making. As we move to more and more software and services and a recurring revenue base, we have greater visibility.  One of the stats that we just talked about is our remaining performance obligations of 30.9 billion of which 53% that will turn into revenue in the next 12 months. We also have a good feel for what other renewals are going to come up and what our renewal rate is as we work our way through this.  So, we have a pretty good sense of a big chunk of our revenue and how it's going to grow. We also have a good view of pipeline and what that looks like ahead, and one of the things that I would say about that pipeline is it's one of the -- we've seen year-over-year growth in the pipeline for Q1 better than we've ever seen in the last several years.  So, we see good growth in the pipeline as well. So, it's when you add all that up, that's what gives us the confidence to give a full-year guide. What I would say is that -- to your question about supply chain and what's the assumption on supply chain, the way to think about that as that's the difference between the high-end and the low-end of the guide. We expect the supply chain to impact us through the first half of the year.  And then at the low-end of the guide, we think we continue to have supply-chain impacts through most of the second half as well, with some clear up at the end. At the high-end of the guide, we think that we've begun to clear up the supply chain issues, supply and demand come back more into balance earlier in the second half. That's why we gave the full-year guide. I think -- certainly, we have the confidence with the visibility we have, and what's baked into that based on some of the uncertainty. It's still out there with the supply chain. Yeah. Thanks, Meta, for that. When you look at the Q4 gross margin, obviously it came in better than what we had expected and what we had guided to, and there was a really favorable product mix built into that, some of that being driven by a good quarter for software as you heard on the call earlier.  Looking ahead, we've taken several steps to ensure that we can continue to have supply and deliver products to our customers. They are in the midst of their own transformations, they're all in the midst of doing the things they have to do to adapt to a world that's not only a hybrid work world but one, with the rise of the delta variant, that -- it's added complexity. It's not a, \"Hey, the world's going to go back to normal at some point.\" It's, \"I need to continue to have this flexibility ahead.\" We're trying to support that and at the same time, there are supply and demand imbalances and some of the key components around semiconductors and memory and some of the same things you hear from others of our peers.  That turns into higher component costs as we buy from those suppliers. We're also to ensure even greater supply going to brokers to get additional supply from versus what we can get directly from our suppliers. And in some cases, qualifying second sources where we have to. Each of those, obviously, drives costs and it takes a while for those costs -- We've been in that process through Q4, and we'll be in it through Q1.  It takes a while for those costs to flow through our standard costing system and show up in the cost of goods sold. There's a little bit of unfavorable product mix headwind as well in Q1 as we have a good sense of the products that don't have those same impacts that we will be able to ship, that are sitting in backlog, so that's what's driving that sequential change.  As you know, we did put in place a price increase; very selective, very targeted, only on the products where we were seeing the higher component costs. That went into effect August 7th, but we always honor quotes that are out there for 30 days, beyond that price because it goes -- maybe those quotes were produced before the price increase was put in.  So, scroll 30 days ahead from August 7th before the first orders come in with those higher prices, and then it takes a while for those orders to come in, get built, and shipped back out to customers and for us to realize the benefit of that on the top line. Think of those price increases as being something that we'll feel more of the benefit of in Q2 and Q3 versus what we see in Q1. Yes. Paul, it really is gross margin driven. And there's still -- there continues to be uncertainty on when the supply and demand get back into balance on many of those components. That's why you see the range that we put out there at 5% to 7%, and that ripples through to the bottom line as well.  I think that the only other comment I'd add on that front, I don't want to get into parsing it down to the various elements, at least at this point, but there's still uncertainty, and given that uncertainty, and this being the first time we've given you annual guide, it's prudent. We're trying to be prudent with the guide we've put out there as well. Yeah. I'll start, and Chuck, you may want to add to this. The way that you see the guidance laid out, 5% to 7% growth on the top line and 5% to 7% growth on the bottom line, we are looking at balanced, profitable growth, and I think that's the way you should expect us to run the business going forward, is balanced profitable growth.  5% to 7% on both the top and bottom line is a pretty strong performance, certainly relative to where we've been over the last few years. And so again, I don't want to get into -- Paul, I know what you're poking at. I really don't want to get into parsing down the elements of that, but the core principle is balanced profitable growth. That is our expectation, Paul. Over time, I mean, again, I don't want to predict that for this fiscal year, just given some of the uncertainties in the supply chain, but it is our expectation that it gets back there and over the longer term as we continue to build a bigger mix of software into our revenue stream, that should also provide a bit of a tailwind to our margins. Yeah, I think that's right. I think, Rod, the other way that I would ask you to think about the price increases we just announced on August 7th, those are really -- they're not motivated by driving top line as much as they're motivated by offsetting some of the cost increases, we're seeing.  Now, there's a lag effect, right? It's going to take time before we see those prices show up actually in our revenue stream, but they are really motivated by that. And so, we'll continue to assess as we always do, if we need to make another price adjustment, up or down. We'll continue to make those assessments going forward.  Don't think about them as being motivated, though, by top-line drivers. It's really motivated by offsetting some of the higher costs that we're seeing. But the other thing I would just close on this one is that we have a price increase methodology that we deploy on a regular basis for different portfolios. We just don't talk about it on our earnings calls every time, but this is a muscle we have that we actually use on a fairly regular basis when the conditions warrant it. Sure. I'll start on the second part of that and then I'll let Chuck weigh in on the order growth. Clearly, as we locked in some of that -- some of the work that we did on supply and particularly going after components that are particularly at an imbalance between supply and demand, we locked in both. We looked at both for costs that would come in for that and what the committed delivery schedule was on those.  We have a good sense of that for a subset of our components. There's still going to be fluctuation in some areas, memory is a good example, there's going to continue to be fluctuation in pricing and we'll continue to monitor that.  You saw us -- you've seen us in the past, make price adjustments based on memory cost increases, and I would expect that to be kind of an ongoing process there. But for the ones that we locked in, which were the -- I think the ones that are -- that had the greatest imbalance and the highest demand, both for us and for our competitors, we locked in both from that standpoint. So, Fahad, as I was saying earlier, what we've looked at is, we've compared a lot of the -- our pipeline pulls ahead activity, we've looked at our future pipeline, we looked at order cancellation rates, and we just don't see anything.  So based on what we know now, we certainly think customers are placing orders further in advance because of lead times, which is just logical, but that's basically -- when you see the order growth, we saw in Q4 and then you see the forecast pipeline that we see going forward, it would suggest that there's still a fair amount of demand out there.  Fahad, we're staying on top of that as much as possible as you can imagine, and Chuck talked earlier about some of the data points we're looking at to try to get a feel for it. Order cancellations would be one indication of double ordering from us and another party.  Order cancellation rates have actually come down modestly. Return rates, looking at the pipeline and the pipeline growth, we're not seeing it at any material level. I think the other thing, the other data point we gave is the growth of commercial.  So, if you look at the orders, the overall order growth, Commercial is up 41%. And I think where you might expect to see some of what you're talking about is actually in the Enterprise segment or EPS. We saw significant growth in Commercials and I don't think you'd expect to see as much of that kind of a double ordering process happen in that customer size. Great question, Jim. It only assumes that our share buybacks offset dilution. So, think of that as you're doing your own modeling, think of the share count to be roughly flat to where it ends this year. Thanks, Jim. Yeah. Jeff, what I'd say is at 4 billion of software revenue over the last 90 days, we're one of the biggest software companies in the world. I mean, annualize that or look at the trailing 12 months, makes us somewhere in the top 10 in software companies in the world. We posted 6% overall growth and 9% growth in subscriptions even off that base. So, I think the software business is actually doing quite well for us.  What's underneath your question is that what you saw on applications, I'll go back to what we said earlier, about what's happening in Applications. Underneath that, you got to remember that includes the entire collaboration portfolio, so not just the software pieces and not just the recurring software pieces, there are hardware elements there, there are some legacy on-prem elements there, both of those were headwinds.  In the subscription software revenue piece of both Applications and Security, we saw double-digit growth. We had nice growth year-on-year for the full year in both of those. So, I actually feel good about where we're headed on that. We will assess it every quarter and update it as needed. I -- the big variable in there, of course, is what happens with the supply chain and when do we start to see a little more balance come to supply and demand across some of our key components. And I think that will -- that will dictate when we've got a good view for updating. Thanks, Jeff. Yeah, okay. You managed to get in three there, Ben, on the one-question limit. I'll talk a bit about duration first. You see in our remaining performance obligations, you see the nice growth, 30.9 billion in total RPO is a record for us. What I'd say is underneath there, the short-term is about 53% of that.  They're growing, somewhat balanced, slightly more growth in the long-term than in short term, but that's what you'd expect given that many of them -- remember the short term is just the next 12 months, so the first year, the long term is anything beyond that. So, it's not surprising to see long-term growth a little bit more.  We're not seeing a big change in duration overall. And maybe I'll go ahead and hit the last one, Chuck, and then leave the DNA question for you. As we look at the renewal rates and the actions we have to take, our renewal base is obviously growing and becoming much more important to us ahead. And obviously, renewals are dependent on adoption.  We've put in place very specific processes to understand where our customers are on usage and on adoption. And you've got to -- if you don't drive the adoption, you don't get the renewal. And so, we're attacking it at that level. I think the team's done a nice job getting some headlights on that, some early warning, and getting ahead of ensuring that we actually get the adoption we need."

If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now, I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.\nMarilyn Mora: Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's third quarter fiscal 2021 quarterly earnings call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chairman and CEO; and Scott Herren, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides including supplemental information will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and will discuss product results in terms of revenue, and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties, including COVID-19, that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify the important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. I will now turn it over to Chuck.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Marilyn. Good afternoon and thanks for joining today. I hope everyone is staying healthy and safe as we start to see the benefits of vaccine deployments and the continuing improvement in economic activity. I want to start by acknowledging our employees, customers and partners in India who are experiencing a devastating surge of COVID cases. Cisco is providing critical resources during this challenging time, and our thoughts remain with all of you. While many of us are seeing great progress in our recovery efforts, we must remain vigilant and adaptable as we manage the ongoing pandemic around the world. Turning to the quarter, we had impressive momentum in Q3, which gives me a great sense of optimism going forward. We returned to growth, with revenue up 7%, driven by an improving macro environment, the strongest product portfolio in our history and great execution by our teams. We saw broad-based demand across the business, led by our biggest growth opportunities: hybrid work, digital transformation, cloud and continued strong uptake of our subscription-based offerings. We are also seeing early momentum in the ramping of key technology cycles that are long-term growth drivers for our business, such as 5G, 400 gig and Edge. The next phase of the recovery and the future of work will be heavily reliant on our technology. Cisco's end-to-end portfolio will serve as the foundation for next-generation infrastructure solutions as well as cloud-enabled delivery models and innovation, allowing our customers to move with even greater speed and agility. This will require a significant investment cycle and reinforces the strength of our strategy while driving greater opportunity to create a world that is more connected, inclusive and secure. We remain focused on accelerating innovation while simplifying the adoption of our offerings with network-wide automation, analytics and flexible as a service consumption models, all aimed at improving our customer's network performance capabilities and security, which we believe will drive tremendous long-term opportunities for us. Our Q3 performance only reinforces my confidence about the future. These results reflect a return to a strong spending environment and an economic recovery that has gained momentum driven by vaccine rollouts and the easing of restrictions. As the economy has improved, customers have increased their investment across our portfolio to prepare for the upturn and return to office. In Q3, we saw 10% growth in product orders, the highest growth rate since Q1 of fiscal 2012, reflecting robust improvement across all of our customer segments and geographies. From a product revenue perspective, we saw 6% growth, led by strength across our portfolio including campus switching, routing, wireless, security, collaboration, and Webscale, as well as from our acquisition of Acacia, which closed during Q3. We continue to aggressively shift our business to more recurring revenue streams which we expect to grow over time as we expand our offerings. In Q3, we achieved $3.8 billion in software revenue, with 81% of our software revenue sold as a subscription, up from 76% last quarter. We also saw another quarter of double-digit growth in our deferred revenue and remaining performance obligations. Over the past six years, we have made significant progress and now have one of the largest software businesses in the industry with an annual run-rate well over $14 billion. Let me now touch on Infrastructure Platforms. We saw strong demand across a majority of our portfolio, led by our next-generation Enterprise Networking and Service Provider solutions, as companies accelerate the modernization of their infrastructure. This modern infrastructure delivers higher performance and faster access to data, while offering the best user experience in an increasingly distributed environment. Customers are turning to us to help them create the trusted workplace of the future, with Wi-Fi access points, video endpoints, cameras and IoT sensors feeding data into DNA Center and DNA spaces. We're enabling operations teams to remotely monitor workplace conditions for a safe return to office. We're also working to provide visibility beyond corporate networks, which is increasingly critical as our customers accelerate their adoption of SaaS and cloud solutions for hybrid work. At Cisco Live, we launched the industry's first enterprise-wide full stack observability offering by integrating ThousandEyes cloud intelligence with our Catalyst switching portfolio and AppDynamics. This provides IT with visibility and actionable insights across both external and internal networks to provide a seamless digital experience for users. And with users more distributed than ever, it is vital that they have the most efficient and secure connection to the cloud. Our deep partnerships with Google, Amazon and Microsoft allow native connectivity from our SD-WAN fabric to each of these cloud offerings. With our technology, customers can reduce deployment times and connect branch offices to cloud workloads in minutes. In our Webscale business, we delivered our sixth consecutive quarter of strong order growth, which increased over 25% in the quarter, and over 50% on a trailing 12-month basis. Our Webscale customers are starting their 400 gig upgrade cycles and aggressively pursuing long-haul build-outs while our Carrier customers are exploring new architectures to realize the full potential of 5G. We are building the internet for the future by creating breakthrough innovation with our routing, optical and automation technologies to deliver significant economic benefits. Recently, we launched a new routed optical networking solution, integrating our scalable, high-performance routers and Acacia's pluggable optics, which offers significant cost savings. Last week, we announced our intent to acquire Sedona Systems to extend our cross-work automation platform to build on these capabilities. We also expanded our Silicon One platform, from a routing-focused solution to one which addresses the Webscale switching market, offering 10 networking chips ranging from 3.2 terabits to 25.6 terabits per second, making it the highest performance programmable routing and switching silicon on the market. We know our customers increasingly want to consume Cisco's technology in new and more flexible ways. At Cisco Live, we launched our new As a Service portfolio, Cisco Plus, and our first offer, Cisco Plus Hybrid Cloud, combining our data center compute, networking and storage portfolio. Cisco Plus includes our plans to deliver networking as a service, which will unify networking, Security, and observability across Access, WAN and Cloud domains to deliver an unparalleled experience for our customers. Turning to Security, we had a record quarter, surpassing $875 million in revenue, up 13% as we expanded our reach with customers around the world. Our Security strategy is focused on delivering a simple and secure experience. We have an unrivaled ability to provide end-to-end Security capabilities across users, devices, applications and data, on any network or any cloud. This is the key reason why our customers trust us to help them proactively protect against and remediate threats. In fact, leading customers in every industry, including 100% of the Fortune 100, are using Cisco Security solutions. These customers are increasingly deploying our Zero Trust and Secure Access Service Edge or SASE architectures, along with automation, authentication and analytics capabilities. With today's distributed workforce, companies must quickly deploy highly secure, trusted access to critical applications everywhere without compromising performance. Customers like Ford are using our cloud-delivered Security platform umbrella, as they secure over 100,000 of their remote team members. And this quarter, Lyft turned to Cisco to strengthen their security protection for all of their users accessing their applications. By deploying our duo portfolio, Lyft was able to provide strong access controls, as they protect their users' sensitive personal and financial information while reducing their total cost of ownership by more than 50%. With nearly $6 billion in annual R&D, the investment that Cisco is making in both Security and the Network continues to lead the momentum across our portfolio, with 23 consecutive quarters of double-digit umbrella cloud Security growth, nearly 7,000 customers using our cloud native SecureX platform and strong platform growth with Security enterprise agreements. We continue to expand our leadership with new innovations, including passwordless authentication, data loss prevention, observability, cloud-based malware detection and enhancements to SecureX. We're also complementing our organic innovation with assets that enable greater security efficacy. Our intent to acquire Kenna Security will bring together their risk-based vulnerability management platform, with SecureX's threat management capabilities to prioritize and more effectively manage overall risk. Lastly, let me touch on Applications. Our collaboration business continues to perform well. We had a record quarter in WebEx, as we execute against our strategy to power the future of hybrid work. Over the last six months we've added more than 400 new features and devices to our WebEx portfolio. We are enabling seamless experiences through our desk camera and desk hub solutions while extending the WebEx suite of devices, including digital signage, touchless calls, room capacity alerts and environmental sensors to help enable a safe return to the office. Wellbeing is top of mind for so many right now as we face a new way of working. This is why we launched People Insights to help people monitor and manage their wellbeing. These new features, devices and capabilities combined with Cloud Calling and Cloud Contact Center provide our customers with the most comprehensive and inclusive hybrid work platform. Last week, we announced our intent to acquire Socio Labs. By integrating Slido and Socio Labs into our WebEx platform, we will also be able to provide the most comprehensive internal and external event management solution on the market. In summary, we had a very good quarter. I'm so proud of the continued success of the business transformation our teams are driving. As I mentioned earlier, we are experiencing the strongest demand in nearly a decade. We are also seeing similar component shortage supply issues as our peers. The good news, and this is reflected in our guidance, is that we are confident we will work through this as we have already put in place revised arrangements with several of our key suppliers. We believe these actions will enable us to optimize our access to critical components, including semiconductors, and take care of our customers by fulfilling their demand as quickly as possible. Our strategy and commitment to leading with trust, innovation and choice, along with our continued focus and discipline, are positioning us well for growth and profitability. As we accelerate the pace of innovation for our customers and partners, it's critical that we continue to support our people, our communities and our planet. I'm very proud that Cisco was recently named the Number One Best Place to Work in the United States by Fortune and Great Place to Work. This is a tremendous honor for us, as it recognizes the incredible work of our people and the power of the culture we have created. And lastly, in terms of actions we are taking to protect the planet. Last month, the Cisco Foundation announced $100 million over 10 years to fund nonprofit grants and impact investing in climate solutions. We have already achieved 100% renewable energy in the U.S. and in many countries across Europe, and this is another strong step forward. Whether it's our deep focus on delivering the best results for our customers, partners and employees or our commitment to making a difference in communities across the world, Cisco remains committed to our purpose, to power an inclusive future for all. I'm quite optimistic about what's ahead and confident in our team's ability to deliver. I'll now turn it over to Scott.\nScott Herren: Thanks, Chuck. Last quarter I identified four key priorities that we are using to define our financial strategy: driving profitable growth, a continued disciplined focus on financial management and operating efficiency, setting a long-term plan to maximize value creation through strategic transformation and examining investments, both organic and inorganic. We made progress on all these fronts in Q3 and are continuing to build our financial approach based on these core pillars, providing a strong foundation for enhanced financial performance as well as long-term value creation for our shareholders. Now, let's turn to our results. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter followed by the guidance for Q4. As Chuck said, Q3 was a strong quarter, across the business. We executed well, with strong product orders and solid growth in revenue, net income and earnings per share. Total revenue increased to $12.8 billion up 7% year-on-year, exceeding the high end of our guidance range for the quarter. We saw broad strength in all product areas and geographies. We also saw continued recovery in our business and building momentum was sequential revenue growth of 7%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 33.6%. Non-GAAP net income was $3.5 billion up 4%, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.83, up 5% year-on-year, coming in above the high end of our EPS guidance range. Now let me provide more detail on our Q3 revenue. Total product revenue was $9.1 billion, up 6%. Service revenue was $3.7 billion, up 8%. Infrastructure Platforms has rebounded nicely, with revenues up 6%. Within that, Switching Revenue increased overall with growth in campus driven by strong double-digit growth of our Catalyst 9K products. Routing had strong double-digit growth, driven by strength in the Service Provider market. Wireless had strong growth, driven by the continued ramp of our Wi-Fi 6 products and strength in Meraki. Data Center revenue declined, driven primarily by servers as we experienced continued market contraction. Applications were up 5%. We continue to see double-digit growth in WebEx, driven by our product innovations and the value we bring to remote working. We saw growth in Unified Communications, IoT software, and AppDynamics, offset by a decline in TelePresence endpoints. Security was up 13%, with growth across the entire portfolio. Our Cloud Security portfolio performed well, with strong double-digit growth and continued momentum of our Duo and Umbrella offerings. So we continued to transform our business, delivering more software offerings and driving growth in subscriptions and recurring revenue. Software revenue was $3.8 billion, and subscriptions were 81% of total software revenue, up 7 points year-on-year. As we continue to increase our software subscriptions, we're driving higher levels of recurring revenues. In fact the majority of our total revenue growth in the quarter came from recurring revenue streams. Additionally, the strength of our portfolio and transition to more software and services is driving growth in remaining performance obligations or RPO. At the end of Q3, RPOs were $28.1 billion, up 10%. RPO for Product was up 15% and for Service was up 7%. There was a 90 basis points positive impact on revenue growth in the quarter related to the acquisitions of Acacia and IMImobile, which both closed during the quarter. As a reminder, these acquisitions were not factored into our Q3 revenue guide. We had strong order momentum in Q3, with total product orders up 10%. Looking at our geographies, the Americas were up 6%, EMEA was up 10% and APJC was up 31%. Total Emerging Markets were up 13%, with the BRICs plus Mexico up 31%. In our Customer segments, Service Provider was up 17%, Commercial was up 16%, Public Sector was up 11%. Enterprise was flat, which is a significant improvement from last quarter. Non-GAAP total gross margin came in at the high end of our guidance range at 66%, down 60 basis points year-over-year. Product gross margin was 64.9%, down 90 basis points, and service gross margin was 68.7% down 20 basis points. The decrease in product gross margin was largely driven by ongoing costs related to the supply chain challenges, offset by positive product mix which includes some software benefit. Price erosion was relatively moderate and in-line with our historical range. On the supply chain front, we continue to manage through the constraints seen industry-wide and continue to incur additional costs. We are partnering with our key suppliers, leveraging our volume purchasing and expending supply commitments as we address the supply chain challenges which we expect will continue. The quarter did include an extra week, as we discussed on our last call. Consistent with our guidance for the quarter, the benefit to total revenue was approximately 3 points of growth. Total impact on our cost of sales and operating expenses was approximately $150 million. Operating cash flow was $3.9 billion, down 8%, driven by the timing of payments and restructuring costs. We expect operating cash flow to normalize for the full fiscal year. We ended Q3 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $23.6 billion, down $7 billion sequentially, driven by $5.5 billion in payments for acquisitions, as well as 3 billion in repayments of our long-term debt. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $2.1 billion to shareholders during the quarter. It was comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly dividend and $510 million of share repurchases. Year-to-date, we returned $6.7 billion to shareholders, which represents 64% of our free cash flow, and we have $8.7 billion in capacity remaining under our current share repurchase program authorization. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. During Q3 we closed three acquisitions, Acacia Communications, IMImobile, and Dashbase. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we also successfully closed on our acquisition of Slido on May 4. These investments are consistent with our strategy of complementing our internal innovation in R&D with targeted M&A to allow us to further strengthen and differentiate our market position in our growth areas. To summarize, we had a great Q3. We executed well, with strong top line growth and profitability. We're seeing returns on the investments we're making in innovation and driving the continued shift to more software and subscriptions, delivering growth and driving shareholder value. Now, let's turn to our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21. This guidance is subject to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. Our financial guidance for Q4 is as follows: we expect revenue growth to be in the range of 6% to 8% year-on-year, reflecting again, the strong demand we're seeing. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 64% to 65%, reflecting the ongoing increase in supply chain costs we're incurring as we protect shipments to our customers. Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 32% to 33%, and the non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 19%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.81 to $0.83. Looking ahead, we're excited to announce we will host a virtual Cisco Financial Analyst Day on Wednesday, September 15, 2021. We will post event details in the coming weeks and look forward to sharing more with you at that time. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Scott. Michelle, let's go ahead and begin the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs, you may go ahead.\nRod Hall: Yes, guys, thanks for the question. I wanted to start off I guess with the margin guidance. And that's the thing most people are asking me about. And I heard, Scott, I heard you talking about the impact from increased costs. I guess maybe could you give us some more color on how sustainable those impacts are and also address the OpEx line? it looks like those costs are inflated too, I assume, for some of the same reasons. But just the sustainability of these cost pressures and these kinds of margins you're guiding for, as we look forward. Thanks.\nScott Herren: Yes. Thanks, Rod. On starting with the gross margin, the impact you're seeing in the Q4 guide on gross margin is really driven by supply chain. It has a couple of elements to it. One is unit cost. So we've got and actually it was announced today from Gartner, we've got the number one supply chain team in the world, two years in a row. And that team has done a great job getting ahead of the issues that everyone in the industry is seeing. So with that, though, we've locked in both supply and pricing with some of the key component providers that we've got going ahead. That's what you see built into the margin guide and I think the supply chain issues will stay with us from what I can see at least through the end of this calendar year. On the OpEx side, it's a little bit different. When you look at the -- we're right on track, let me just start by saying, before you ask, we're right on track with the savings associated with the restructuring that we announced earlier this year, earlier this fiscal year. We said at the time we would reinvest some of that into the growth of the business overall, and that's what you see happening. So when you look at the year-on-year growth in OpEx, it's driven by the integration of the acquisitions that closed during the quarter, a little bit of a headwind from FX as the dollar has weakened and then the higher commissions given the robust strength of the top line. Commissions are up and reset at a variable comp plans. But that's what's driving it and I think the sustainability, to get to your point, is I expect to see some of these supply chain issues linger with us through the end of the calendar year, first half of our fiscal year.\nChuck Robbins: Yes. Hey, Rod, this is Chuck. I just want to add a little color to that. And as we began to realize that we were going to have the incremental costs, we had to make some decisions, and I think obviously, we do believe these are temporary. We'll have to see how long they last, but based on that and based on the fact that we are seeing such momentum in the business right now, we decided to continue to invest in the business to drive the growth that we are feeling right now. And when you see the balance of the growth across all the businesses, you see the regional balance it was balanced across the technology areas. It was balanced across segments. And then, you think about that in the context of some of these real major trends that are occurring that we're on the front end of, like the 400 gig transition, like the success we're having in Webscale, the Service Provider 5G build-out, the hybrid work and return to office, we talked about Wi-Fi 6 leading to campus switching, which we're seeing play out now and the Security business had a record quarter at a time where most every customer is suggesting that they're going to be spending more over the next 12 months in cybersecurity. So, we feel like it was prudent to continue to invest to meet the demand and deal with some of the short-term pain and then we think we'll get to the other side of it.\nRod Hall: Great, okay. Thanks a lot, appreciate it.\nScott Herren: Thanks, Rod.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Rod. Next question, please?\nOperator: Samik Chatterjee from J.P. Morgan, you may go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Chuck, I guess, somewhat following up on Rod's question here, I think the macro expectation is that we will be going through a period of higher inflation and you're seeing that somewhat in the supply chain but also in other aspects as well. Can you just help us think through what are the levels that the company has as you navigate through that? And particularly, how are you trying to balance that against the raise that some of the customers might be pulling ahead orders or pulling ahead demand just to secure product from you?\nChuck Robbins: Yes, a couple great questions. Number one, what we do know is that if we come to the conclusion that any of these cost increases or this inflation as you mentioned are going to be more sustained then we will look at strategic price increases where we have to. And that work's already underway. There's already some decisions that we've made, so we will do that. It's a pretty dynamic situation as you know. And then on the pull-ahead, this is a question that we've been asked. And while it's impossible to really quantify what that might be, it's going to be pretty obvious that if a customer has extended lead times, they're probably going to place orders sooner than they would. That just makes sense. But we also have proxies that we would be looking for to really reflect that being a major issue like order cancellations if they're placing these orders against multiple channels and then canceling when they get it out of one channel. We don't see that. You would see more of that pull-ahead from the Enterprise and obviously Commercial and Small Business, you probably wouldn't see as much and those were pretty significant growth engines for us this past quarter. So we don't see any glaring red flags, although we would certainly agree that there's probably some level of early ordering going on.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay, thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Chuck. Next question?\nOperator: Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley, you may go ahead.\nMeta Marshall: Great, thanks. Appreciate the question. Where do you think customers are on return to work planning? Are your larger customers may be further along than smaller customers or vice versa? And then just what are you seeing from some of the spending from the impacted industries from last year? Thanks.\nChuck Robbins: Great question. So, first of all, I think it's the inverse. I think we're seeing the Small Businesses and the Commercial customers moving a little faster, although we saw Enterprise pick up in Asia and in Europe, and we've done a deep analysis with our team. The U.S. improved, and we would expect next quarter and then next fiscal year for U.S. Enterprise to actually improve significantly from where we are today. And I think on the industry front, we were doing the review in the U.S. and we've actually seen double-digit growth in hospitality, in healthcare, in retail. And we've even seen the cruise lines making significant purchases as they prepare to go back out. So, we think that that is definitely a sign that we're on the road to recovery. And I would say that the other thing I would highlight is, as our customers think about hybrid work and they think about the return to office, we've talked about the prevalence of Wi-Fi 6 we saw continued strength in Wi-Fi. And we said once that begins to happen, that we believe there would be a campus switching upgrade follow and the CAT 9K has had four quarters of increasing growth in double digits the last few quarters from a demand perspective, so we've seen that happen as well. So, I think that -- overall, I think it's happening as we thought it would and perhaps even at an accelerated pace.\nMeta Marshall: Great, thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Meta. Next question, please?\nOperator: Tal Liani from Bank of America, you may go ahead.\nTal Liani: Hi, guys. I have two questions, related and not related. First question is the pricing environment. We see price increases across the board. We see component shortages. Does it impact pricing of your products? And is there any plan or have you already adjusted prices for that? That's number one. The second one, I'm trying to understand the year-over-year trends in the context of easy comps versus real growth. And I know it's hard to say, but it's hard to quantify, but can you at least qualitatively speak about the fact of when you grow 7% and we deduct the acquisition impact, etcetera, what's the impact of the environment really improving in your comments versus just easy comps because last year was so weak because of COVID? Thanks.\nChuck Robbins: Yes, Tal, it's great. I'll comment on the first one, I'll comment on both of them and then Scott can add on to it. So on the pricing front, as I said a few minutes ago, I think we have made some decisions on certain products that we will be making price increases on, and we're looking surgically at the rest of the portfolio based on where we have costs that we believe are going to be sustained. But you know, we're erring hard right now on taking care of our customers and trying to optimize our ability to deliver to them right now because we think that improves our relationships and it improves our position over the long term with these customers; so that's what we're doing. On the year-over-year trends, I think that what I would point to is the real thing that I think is substantive is the demand side of what we've seen, and -- because you're right. You can do some math that gets at the revenue in Q3, but I think that based on what we see and the demand that we see, we do believe this is certainly, it's a positively evolving marketplace for us and I think the work we've done over the last year, we pivoted our strategy a year ago based on what we thought would happen post-pandemic. The teams have been executing really hard, and it's great to see the customers embracing the solutions that we're delivering out there; so we feel like it's sustainable.\nScott Herren: Yes. I think, Tal, when you look at the year-on-year, I think the context you need to put around that is the improving trend that we've seen. We've seen four to five now consecutive quarters of quarter-on-quarter improvement, and really, the improvements across-the-board. It's in each geo, and it's in each product line. So we're seeing continued improvement and that, obviously, bodes well for looking out at Q4 and into the future. I think the other thing that we've talked about the robust demand that we've had and you see the revenue that we printed in Q3. What you didn't see is we also built up a healthy backlog at this point. And so I think that coming into Q4, not only do we have a very high percentage of recurring revenue as, that we know will come into the revenue stream during Q4. We've got a sizable backlog at this point, of orders to fulfill, and we know exactly what's in the pipeline. So, really feel good about the sequential trend that we're seeing across the business.\nChuck Robbins: Yes. I think, Tal, it's a really good point that Scott makes. There is a revenue headwind that we're facing based on the supply chain, so notwithstanding what's going on in the supply chain, our revenue guide would have been higher, which could have probably flowed through to improving EPS as well. So it's a complicated thing that we're navigating through right now. But notwithstanding that it's the best I've felt about the business and our momentum and where we are in quite a while.\nTal Liani: Great, thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Next question, please?\nOperator: Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer, you may go ahead sir.\nIttai Kidron: Oh, thanks, a couple questions for me. Chuck, I do want to follow up again on the demand side. I'm trying to gauge how much of what you're seeing right now is things that were delayed during COVID that are being fulfilled now versus acceleration of future plans into now. I'm just trying to think of sort of what is a normalized demand pattern for you once the noise of COVID, for worse last year and for better right now, kind of goes away. Maybe you can help us think about that. And then for Scott on the growth guidance for next quarter, can you call out specifically the impact of the acquisitions? What is the growth guidance without Acacia, IMI, Dashbase and Slido that you just closed on?\nChuck Robbins: Yes, Ittai. Thanks. So, I'll try to do what you -- I'll try to answer what you asked, but I think it's a difficult one to really be definitive about, but I think there's a couple of aspects going on. I certainly believe there are projects that customers put on hold that they're now accelerating now that they have better visibility into what the return looks like. I definitely think that's happening. I also think your second point is happening. I think that they're, every customer is looking at modernizing their infrastructure because no one wants to be caught flat-footed by the next crisis, and everyone has realized the power of technology during this time frame and so I think there's an element of increased investments that we'll see across all the technology areas as well as obviously cybersecurity, etcetera. But the other thing I think that's really important is that we've been investing for a long time against a lot of these big market transitions that are starting to come to life. You remember, Ittai, we didn't play in the Webscale space five years ago. We didn't play. And now, we're seeing that was almost a quarter of our Service Provider business again this quarter, and it's still growing robustly. I mean, it grew over 25% this quarter against a quarter a year ago that was in excess of 70% growth, so it's still accelerating. And then, you've got 5G that's starting to play out the way, as we've all been waiting for it to play out. You've got this return to office and hybrid work with Wi-Fi 6 and the campus upgrades that we've talked about. And you've got this cybersecurity concern that is only exacerbated by everything we see in the press by all the continuing attacks and at a time where we had record revenues. So, I think all of those things are playing into it, and that's what leads us to feel pretty good about where we are right now.\nScott Herren: And Ittai, on your second question about the impact of acquisitions. We said in the opening commentary that for Q3, it was about 90 basis points of growth, and that was not part of our Q3 guide. They each closed during the quarter so we look ahead at Q4 of the revenue growth that we've let out there, about a point and a half is driven by the acquisitions, mostly driven by Acacia.\nChuck Robbins: Two other things, Ittai, on that particular question that I wanted to point out if you don't mind. The first is we see a revenue headwind from the supply chain issue in Q4. As I said earlier, if we didn't have the supply chain challenges, we would have been guiding higher on revenue, which is reflected what Scott mentioned about the backlog coming into the quarter. The second thing is this business transformation that we have been working on for the last five or six years, if we go back to the first quarter I was CEO and then we look at the quarter that we're entering into, the recurring revenue that we're pulling off the balance sheet that we have visibility to today that will be part of Q4 revenue is up 64% during that time frame. So we have a lot more visibility, and it just says that the whole rationale for why we've been driving this business model transformation, which is a big complex change to get to, but that has helped us in a big way in allowing us to actually deliver the revenue we're talking about next quarter. So, the benefits that we believe were there for the business model, I think this is probably the quarter where we're feeling the positive impact of that more than any other quarter.\nIttai Kidron: That's great, thanks. Appreciate it.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Ittai.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Ittai. Next question, please?\nOperator: Simon Leopold from Raymond James, you may go ahead.\nSimon Leopold: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nMarilyn Mora: Simon? Sounds like we lost you.\nChuck Robbins: We lost you, Simon.\nMarilyn Mora: Are you there, Simon?\nOperator: We'll go to the next question. [Operator Instructions] Amit Daryanani from Evercore, you may go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Perfect. Thanks for taking my question. I have a question and a follow-up. Just when I think about your guide and the gross margin drop of 150 basis points, I'm curious would you attribute the entire drop due to supply chain issues or is there anything else at play as well? That's one. And then second question was really hoping you could unpack the Service Provider growth which sort of accelerated a fair amount as we just talk about the trends you're seeing in the traditional Service Provider versus the Webscale business and where that acceleration is coming from would be helpful. Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Scott, you want to take the gross margin?\nScott Herren: Yes, I will. It is driven by supply chain and it comes in a couple of flavors. Having done the work that we've done to protect shipment to our customers, there are unit price increases, unit cost increases on certain components that's built into it. There's also increased expedite fees, again to ensure that we get the components in and we can get the product back out the door and a slight increase in freight. So it really is all tied to supply chain.\nChuck Robbins: And then, Amit, on the Service Provider growth, I'm glad you asked the question because I should have pointed it out. We saw double-digit growth across all of the sub-segments of Service Provider, so Cable, Carrier as well as Webscale. So it was very balanced across the three and it's not one segment carrying it, which is why, another reason that we're optimistic. The demand side we saw was so consistent across all our customers and so consistent across geographies and so consistent across the product portfolio, but in the ESP space it was double-digit across all of those segments.\nMarilyn Mora: Next question, please?\nOperator: Simon Leopold from Raymond James, you may go ahead.\nSimon Leopold: Sorry about that. Can you hear me now?\nChuck Robbins: Yes, we can.\nSimon Leopold: My AirPods decided they wanted to stop working. Sorry about that. So, I was looking to see if maybe you could help bridge the gross margin headwinds in terms of the supply chain in that we know there are multiple aspects. It's not just the chip shortages, but things like air freight and then having to add maybe extra hours and paying overtime when things come later because of the shortages. So if there was some way to maybe bridge the components that would help us understand how the recovery might manifest itself. Thanks.\nChuck Robbins: Yes, Simon. When your AirPods went out, Amit was on the same wavelength as you and asked the exact same question. So I'll give the same answer. It really is kind of two or three aspects that are driving it, all related to supply chain. Unit costs are up and that's based on the work that our supply chain team has dong to ensure that we get supply and so that such we can deliver for our customers the gear they need to get from us. They've all got significant transformation underway as well within their shops to support the new hybrid work environment, and so we're working as hard as we can to make sure we can deliver the product to them. But unit costs are slightly higher and that's semis, that's memory and it's certain other smaller commodities across the board. The second is, freight costs are higher, and as freight costs go up, obviously that hits gross margin. And then finally, expedite fees as we're getting product in the door. So, it's all tied to various elements of supply chain.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Simon.\nSimon Leopold: Appreciate it. Sorry you had to repeat yourself.\nChuck Robbins: No problem, that's okay. That's all right.\nMarilyn Mora: All right. Michelle, queue us up with the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research, you may go ahead.\nPierre Ferragu: Hey, guys, thank you for taking my question. I have two. A quick follow-up after that, if I may. The first one, so if I look at your software revenue sequentially, it went from $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion. So that's rounded number, but it suggests you have like a kind of mid-single-digit sequential growth in software, which is very exciting. Is that the kind of right run-rate level of growth we should expect for your software business? And then, Scott, just to confirm, given that move in mix, in revenue mix and product offering, in a situation in which the supply chain were not disrupted, we could have expected some tiny sequential improvement in gross margins, right?\nScott Herren: Yes, that's right. Mix is definitely, as we continue to add more recurring revenue particularly around software, as you pointed out, but also our tech support services, those are higher gross margins. Those long term will be a tailwind to our gross margins. The supply chain issues obviously more than offset that. In terms of your question on software growth, the numbers that you're using are a little bit rounded, but you're on the right tread. We're seeing nice growth in software and in fact, mentioned that 81% now of that is driven by subscription and recurring revenue, so a 7-point improvement in the amount of that software revenue that's recurring. That is great news longer-term as you know, with recurring revenue particularly when it's ratable you see less of the impact upfront. So there's a bit of a bow wave, and you see it in the growth of our RPOs and the growth of our deferred revenue on product so each of those are growing. That's also a sign of the growth within our software product set. When you just do the quick math, right, we're now one of the biggest software companies in the world, right, north of $14 billion in software revenue. And I don't think anyone thinks of Cisco in those terms.\nPierre Ferragu: Thanks. And a quick follow-up for you, Chuck, if I may. You have in your press release you're talking about the next uptake of your subscription base offering. So could you give us a sense of it almost sounds like you feel you are on an inflection point or on a turning point on that front. Are you expanding your portfolio in terms of software like subscription base offering at the moment? Or are you expecting the uptake of these products to reaccelerate on the back of the pandemic? What did you mean exactly?\nChuck Robbins: Yes, so, Pierre, I think there's a couple things going on. Number one we have seen just over the last few years continued acceleration in our software business. Every acquisition we do, that's the business model. So from that perspective it comes in. From an organic perspective, we're building more software assets. We're delivering more Software Solutions. And then we're actually looking now, we announced Cisco Plus at Cisco Live, which is how do we deliver virtually anything we build as a service should our customers want to consume it that way. So we're just embarking on that, which is another big part of our portfolio, which will create more recurring revenue for the future, so that's what I'm talking about.\nPierre Ferragu: Okay, that makes sense. Thank you very much.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Pierre. Next question?\nOperator: Paul Silverstein from Cowen, you may go ahead.\nPaul Silverstein: Appreciate you taking the questions. Two quick questions. One, Chuck, I think it's been a long time since you all have disclosed what the size of your various customer segments and given the impact or what I would expect would be the impact of U.S. Federal stimulus, what's going on Service Provider, Enterprise, the different trends, can update us on how big those sectors are including U.S. Federal? And then the other question would be your Services business. You had a great quarter. It was extremely strong, up 8%. Is that -- is there a one-off in that or is that indicative up from what it had been low single-digit growth? It was a very prominent number. Any insight you can share on what we should expect going forward and what's driving it?\nChuck Robbins: Yes, Paul, I don't have the percentage. We haven't given that information out on the percentage of segments for a while. I would say if we could couch that until perhaps September when we do our Analyst Meeting unless you have.\nScott Herren: No, the only thing I would add is when you compare us to some of our peers where we break out Enterprise versus Commercial many of them combine those two together.\nChuck Robbins: Most of them do.\nScott Herren: Yes. So just bear that in mind as you're trying to compare us across the board.\nPaul Silverstein: Scott, I am aware, but if I may, obviously, with the magnitude of the U.S. Federal stimulus that's already been passed and the various additional progress that's been proposed, not only will that impact the public sector but it also would impact Enterprise, not just for you but for a lot of folks. It would be great if you updated us at some point with those numbers.\nScott Herren: Yes, that makes sense. I get it.\nChuck Robbins: And what was the second question, Paul?\nMarilyn Mora: The services growth.\nChuck Robbins: Oh, the services growth.\nPaul Silverstein: The services growth; what's driving it? Is it an anomaly? Is it the new norm?\nChuck Robbins: Overall, obviously quite pleased with the progress on our services business. There is in Q3 though, remember there was an extra week. And so it's a lot of services, a lot of that is ratable. That extra week turns into an extra week of revenue during the quarter so there is a one-off anomaly that's driving that outsized growth in Q3.\nScott Herren: Yes. And then, once you normalize that out, you should think about the same normal rates you've been seeing.\nPaul Silverstein: All right, I appreciate it. Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks.\nMarilyn Mora: Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Tim Long from Barclays, you may go ahead.\nTim Long: Thank you. Two questions for me too, both on gross margins. Actually I'm just kidding. First one here. Can you just talk a little bit about kind of your visibility? So some of your peer companies and others in the industry, given what's gone on with lead times, you obviously have a revenue and a cost impact here. But what has that done to kind of how far out you can see and plan and kind of the whole backlog versus book and ship for the business for the next few quarters? And then, second, if you could just touch on the Cloud vertical. It sounded like it was pretty strong again. Could you just give us a little color of kind of what is driving that? I think there had been some campus strength with those customers, but can you talk to us a little bit about the breadth of product that's driving that? Is it a lot of 8-K, are you starting to see software and silicon starting to contribute a little bit? So any color there would be great. Thanks.\nChuck Robbins: Yes, Tim. Thanks. I'll make one quick comment on the visibility thing, and then I'll let Scott comment and then I'll take the Cloud one. I would say that the thing that I will tell you is we're in the middle of Q3, I can tell you our supply chain team was a little, I guess, concerned about what they could see for the next two months at that time. And when we started building the guide and working through what we thought they could deliver and build in Q4, they had a reasonable degree of confidence. So what that says to me is they're getting better visibility. And so I think it's just going to improve from here. So that's what we've been dealing with the last couple months Scott, you want to add anything?\nScott Herren: Yes. From a reported revenue standpoint, which I think is probably at least part of your question, Tim, we've got good visibility at this point, given the size of our backlog that we roll into Q4 with, as well as the amount of revenue that's now occurring that will come off the balance sheet. So you add those two together and then look at the -- we have a good feel obviously for what's in the pipeline at this point too. We have pretty good visibility at this point.\nChuck Robbins: And then, on the Cloud vertical; I would say that one of the customers we have had a very strong sort of Enterprise Networking portfolio relationship with, but beyond that, all of it is really being driven by infrastructure going into their Cloud assets. And so we have sold significant amounts of 8-Ks into that infrastructure, but we have sold silicon, stand-alone as well. We have our software running on one of their pieces of hardware, and in some case, we have their software running on our switching hardware. And we're working on White Box ODM with a couple of them relative to our silicon. So, we have all the variations that we announced in December of 2019 we're actively involved in right now; and the good news is there's a lot of Systems desire as well.\nTim Long: Okay, thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Just as an add-on to that, last time, we talked about 400 gig, and there always seems to be a question about 400 gig. And our customer count on 400 gig went up by 50% during the quarter. So we did see a continued uptake on that technology, and that's super early, as you know.\nTim Long: Great, thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Next question, please?\nOperator: Jim Suva from Citigroup Investment Research, you may go ahead.\nJames Suva: Thank you so much for all the details and clarification. I just had one question. Can you give us some commentary on your hyperscale traction? It appears Service Provider's bouncing back pretty strong. And for a while it seemed like the hyperscale wasn't quite as strong as you'd hoped and you were putting more efforts into it and it seems like now your commentary is quite a bit more positive. Is that some new product wins, some share gains, permanency and traction of it? But any commentary on that would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Yes, Jim. So we've had six consecutive quarters of very strong double-digit growth, ranging from mid-teens to triple-digits. And so that's in the Webscale vertical, and it certainly has been share gains because we didn't have any presence before. So as I've joked on calls before, it's one of the few markets where we actually have the opportunity to go gain share, and so that's been positive. We've worked hard on these relationships, and so that has expanded. We had a two-day customer briefing with one of them two weeks ago and it was, that particular briefing was all about our Enterprise portfolio. So we're seeing both sides but we are definitely seeing success that I just mentioned with Tim's question around the Cloud vertical in the Cloud infrastructure.\nJames Suva: Thank you so much.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Jim. And we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. Jeff Kvaal from Wolfe Research, you may go ahead sir.\nJeff Kvaal: Thank you. It was nicely said. My question is actually on the margin side. It sounds as though you are getting better visibility on the component availability. So I guess I'm wondering should we be expecting that the margin headwind would abate through the year? And then as part of that, has anything changed in terms of what you expect to happen to the margin structure over time as we get past these constraints? Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Yes, Jeff. As we've talked about earlier, I think some of the supply chain issues we have that we're seeing certainly from a supply standpoint are going to be with us through the end of the calendar year. But there's no question we've also got some good tailwinds in the gross margin line. When you think of the amount of -- the faster growth rate of services and the ratability of that, which contributes significantly now to the revenue line, that's at a higher margin than our software business, which year-on-year grew at 13% and is now on a run-rate of about a $14 billion per year software business. That obviously comes at a higher margin too. So while we do have supply chain headwinds, we've also got some nice tailwinds that are coming in.\nScott Herren: Okay. And then, the concept is that once we get past these fairly ephemeral, in the grand scheme of things, supply challenges, then we should expect the gross margins to reflect the mix shift software and drift higher. That's the right way to think about it.\nJeff Kvaal: Yes. Okay, excellent. And then, I'm sorry, did you give us a number on how much you might have shipped had you not had supply chain constraints?\nChuck Robbins: Yes. We talked about that in the last day or so. And it's really difficult to get a number. I'd say it'd been a point or two, I mean particularly in the guide front, I think it's a reasonable thing to think about. I mean, our guys were stressed, and in Q4, they have very little, they're committed to what they think they can build, but it's tough. It's tough right now. So you can extrapolate with the growth rate we saw on the product side and then with the corresponding guide that our backlog is certainly increasing, so if we had the capacity to ship, we would but we just don't have it. All right, let me just wrap up by first and foremost thanking all of you for spending time with us today, and, despite the predominant discussion point here, which has been around gross margins relative to the supply chain, I hope our confidence came across and that we feel really good about the portfolio. We feel really good about the reopening. We feel good about our teams, I'm really proud of what they've accomplished. Look, I'm really pleased that our customers are choosing to spend their dollars with us, as they come back. I think that's a great statement of confidence, and I think that it also proves that we are going to be critical to the rebound and the recovery and the return to office. So, thanks for being with us, and we look forward to spending time with you all. And I'm going to kick it back to Marilyn.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Chuck.

            "name": "Chuck Robbins",
            "content": "Thanks, Marilyn. Good afternoon and thanks for joining today. I hope everyone is staying healthy and safe as we start to see the benefits of vaccine deployments and the continuing improvement in economic activity. I want to start by acknowledging our employees, customers and partners in India who are experiencing a devastating surge of COVID cases. Cisco is providing critical resources during this challenging time, and our thoughts remain with all of you. While many of us are seeing great progress in our recovery efforts, we must remain vigilant and adaptable as we manage the ongoing pandemic around the world. Turning to the quarter, we had impressive momentum in Q3, which gives me a great sense of optimism going forward. We returned to growth, with revenue up 7%, driven by an improving macro environment, the strongest product portfolio in our history and great execution by our teams. We saw broad-based demand across the business, led by our biggest growth opportunities: hybrid work, digital transformation, cloud and continued strong uptake of our subscription-based offerings. We are also seeing early momentum in the ramping of key technology cycles that are long-term growth drivers for our business, such as 5G, 400 gig and Edge. The next phase of the recovery and the future of work will be heavily reliant on our technology. Cisco's end-to-end portfolio will serve as the foundation for next-generation infrastructure solutions as well as cloud-enabled delivery models and innovation, allowing our customers to move with even greater speed and agility. This will require a significant investment cycle and reinforces the strength of our strategy while driving greater opportunity to create a world that is more connected, inclusive and secure. We remain focused on accelerating innovation while simplifying the adoption of our offerings with network-wide automation, analytics and flexible as a service consumption models, all aimed at improving our customer's network performance capabilities and security, which we believe will drive tremendous long-term opportunities for us. Our Q3 performance only reinforces my confidence about the future. These results reflect a return to a strong spending environment and an economic recovery that has gained momentum driven by vaccine rollouts and the easing of restrictions. As the economy has improved, customers have increased their investment across our portfolio to prepare for the upturn and return to office. In Q3, we saw 10% growth in product orders, the highest growth rate since Q1 of fiscal 2012, reflecting robust improvement across all of our customer segments and geographies. From a product revenue perspective, we saw 6% growth, led by strength across our portfolio including campus switching, routing, wireless, security, collaboration, and Webscale, as well as from our acquisition of Acacia, which closed during Q3. We continue to aggressively shift our business to more recurring revenue streams which we expect to grow over time as we expand our offerings. In Q3, we achieved $3.8 billion in software revenue, with 81% of our software revenue sold as a subscription, up from 76% last quarter. We also saw another quarter of double-digit growth in our deferred revenue and remaining performance obligations. Over the past six years, we have made significant progress and now have one of the largest software businesses in the industry with an annual run-rate well over $14 billion. Let me now touch on Infrastructure Platforms. We saw strong demand across a majority of our portfolio, led by our next-generation Enterprise Networking and Service Provider solutions, as companies accelerate the modernization of their infrastructure. This modern infrastructure delivers higher performance and faster access to data, while offering the best user experience in an increasingly distributed environment. Customers are turning to us to help them create the trusted workplace of the future, with Wi-Fi access points, video endpoints, cameras and IoT sensors feeding data into DNA Center and DNA spaces. We're enabling operations teams to remotely monitor workplace conditions for a safe return to office. We're also working to provide visibility beyond corporate networks, which is increasingly critical as our customers accelerate their adoption of SaaS and cloud solutions for hybrid work. At Cisco Live, we launched the industry's first enterprise-wide full stack observability offering by integrating ThousandEyes cloud intelligence with our Catalyst switching portfolio and AppDynamics. This provides IT with visibility and actionable insights across both external and internal networks to provide a seamless digital experience for users. And with users more distributed than ever, it is vital that they have the most efficient and secure connection to the cloud. Our deep partnerships with Google, Amazon and Microsoft allow native connectivity from our SD-WAN fabric to each of these cloud offerings. With our technology, customers can reduce deployment times and connect branch offices to cloud workloads in minutes. In our Webscale business, we delivered our sixth consecutive quarter of strong order growth, which increased over 25% in the quarter, and over 50% on a trailing 12-month basis. Our Webscale customers are starting their 400 gig upgrade cycles and aggressively pursuing long-haul build-outs while our Carrier customers are exploring new architectures to realize the full potential of 5G. We are building the internet for the future by creating breakthrough innovation with our routing, optical and automation technologies to deliver significant economic benefits. Recently, we launched a new routed optical networking solution, integrating our scalable, high-performance routers and Acacia's pluggable optics, which offers significant cost savings. Last week, we announced our intent to acquire Sedona Systems to extend our cross-work automation platform to build on these capabilities. We also expanded our Silicon One platform, from a routing-focused solution to one which addresses the Webscale switching market, offering 10 networking chips ranging from 3.2 terabits to 25.6 terabits per second, making it the highest performance programmable routing and switching silicon on the market. We know our customers increasingly want to consume Cisco's technology in new and more flexible ways. At Cisco Live, we launched our new As a Service portfolio, Cisco Plus, and our first offer, Cisco Plus Hybrid Cloud, combining our data center compute, networking and storage portfolio. Cisco Plus includes our plans to deliver networking as a service, which will unify networking, Security, and observability across Access, WAN and Cloud domains to deliver an unparalleled experience for our customers. Turning to Security, we had a record quarter, surpassing $875 million in revenue, up 13% as we expanded our reach with customers around the world. Our Security strategy is focused on delivering a simple and secure experience. We have an unrivaled ability to provide end-to-end Security capabilities across users, devices, applications and data, on any network or any cloud. This is the key reason why our customers trust us to help them proactively protect against and remediate threats. In fact, leading customers in every industry, including 100% of the Fortune 100, are using Cisco Security solutions. These customers are increasingly deploying our Zero Trust and Secure Access Service Edge or SASE architectures, along with automation, authentication and analytics capabilities. With today's distributed workforce, companies must quickly deploy highly secure, trusted access to critical applications everywhere without compromising performance. Customers like Ford are using our cloud-delivered Security platform umbrella, as they secure over 100,000 of their remote team members. And this quarter, Lyft turned to Cisco to strengthen their security protection for all of their users accessing their applications. By deploying our duo portfolio, Lyft was able to provide strong access controls, as they protect their users' sensitive personal and financial information while reducing their total cost of ownership by more than 50%. With nearly $6 billion in annual R&D, the investment that Cisco is making in both Security and the Network continues to lead the momentum across our portfolio, with 23 consecutive quarters of double-digit umbrella cloud Security growth, nearly 7,000 customers using our cloud native SecureX platform and strong platform growth with Security enterprise agreements. We continue to expand our leadership with new innovations, including passwordless authentication, data loss prevention, observability, cloud-based malware detection and enhancements to SecureX. We're also complementing our organic innovation with assets that enable greater security efficacy. Our intent to acquire Kenna Security will bring together their risk-based vulnerability management platform, with SecureX's threat management capabilities to prioritize and more effectively manage overall risk. Lastly, let me touch on Applications. Our collaboration business continues to perform well. We had a record quarter in WebEx, as we execute against our strategy to power the future of hybrid work. Over the last six months we've added more than 400 new features and devices to our WebEx portfolio. We are enabling seamless experiences through our desk camera and desk hub solutions while extending the WebEx suite of devices, including digital signage, touchless calls, room capacity alerts and environmental sensors to help enable a safe return to the office. Wellbeing is top of mind for so many right now as we face a new way of working. This is why we launched People Insights to help people monitor and manage their wellbeing. These new features, devices and capabilities combined with Cloud Calling and Cloud Contact Center provide our customers with the most comprehensive and inclusive hybrid work platform. Last week, we announced our intent to acquire Socio Labs. By integrating Slido and Socio Labs into our WebEx platform, we will also be able to provide the most comprehensive internal and external event management solution on the market. In summary, we had a very good quarter. I'm so proud of the continued success of the business transformation our teams are driving. As I mentioned earlier, we are experiencing the strongest demand in nearly a decade. We are also seeing similar component shortage supply issues as our peers. The good news, and this is reflected in our guidance, is that we are confident we will work through this as we have already put in place revised arrangements with several of our key suppliers. We believe these actions will enable us to optimize our access to critical components, including semiconductors, and take care of our customers by fulfilling their demand as quickly as possible. Our strategy and commitment to leading with trust, innovation and choice, along with our continued focus and discipline, are positioning us well for growth and profitability. As we accelerate the pace of innovation for our customers and partners, it's critical that we continue to support our people, our communities and our planet. I'm very proud that Cisco was recently named the Number One Best Place to Work in the United States by Fortune and Great Place to Work. This is a tremendous honor for us, as it recognizes the incredible work of our people and the power of the culture we have created. And lastly, in terms of actions we are taking to protect the planet. Last month, the Cisco Foundation announced $100 million over 10 years to fund nonprofit grants and impact investing in climate solutions. We have already achieved 100% renewable energy in the U.S. and in many countries across Europe, and this is another strong step forward. Whether it's our deep focus on delivering the best results for our customers, partners and employees or our commitment to making a difference in communities across the world, Cisco remains committed to our purpose, to power an inclusive future for all. I'm quite optimistic about what's ahead and confident in our team's ability to deliver. I'll now turn it over to Scott. Yes. Hey, Rod, this is Chuck. I just want to add a little color to that. And as we began to realize that we were going to have the incremental costs, we had to make some decisions, and I think obviously, we do believe these are temporary. We'll have to see how long they last, but based on that and based on the fact that we are seeing such momentum in the business right now, we decided to continue to invest in the business to drive the growth that we are feeling right now. And when you see the balance of the growth across all the businesses, you see the regional balance it was balanced across the technology areas. It was balanced across segments. And then, you think about that in the context of some of these real major trends that are occurring that we're on the front end of, like the 400 gig transition, like the success we're having in Webscale, the Service Provider 5G build-out, the hybrid work and return to office, we talked about Wi-Fi 6 leading to campus switching, which we're seeing play out now and the Security business had a record quarter at a time where most every customer is suggesting that they're going to be spending more over the next 12 months in cybersecurity. So, we feel like it was prudent to continue to invest to meet the demand and deal with some of the short-term pain and then we think we'll get to the other side of it. Yes, a couple great questions. Number one, what we do know is that if we come to the conclusion that any of these cost increases or this inflation as you mentioned are going to be more sustained then we will look at strategic price increases where we have to. And that work's already underway. There's already some decisions that we've made, so we will do that. It's a pretty dynamic situation as you know. And then on the pull-ahead, this is a question that we've been asked. And while it's impossible to really quantify what that might be, it's going to be pretty obvious that if a customer has extended lead times, they're probably going to place orders sooner than they would. That just makes sense. But we also have proxies that we would be looking for to really reflect that being a major issue like order cancellations if they're placing these orders against multiple channels and then canceling when they get it out of one channel. We don't see that. You would see more of that pull-ahead from the Enterprise and obviously Commercial and Small Business, you probably wouldn't see as much and those were pretty significant growth engines for us this past quarter. So we don't see any glaring red flags, although we would certainly agree that there's probably some level of early ordering going on. Great question. So, first of all, I think it's the inverse. I think we're seeing the Small Businesses and the Commercial customers moving a little faster, although we saw Enterprise pick up in Asia and in Europe, and we've done a deep analysis with our team. The U.S. improved, and we would expect next quarter and then next fiscal year for U.S. Enterprise to actually improve significantly from where we are today. And I think on the industry front, we were doing the review in the U.S. and we've actually seen double-digit growth in hospitality, in healthcare, in retail. And we've even seen the cruise lines making significant purchases as they prepare to go back out. So, we think that that is definitely a sign that we're on the road to recovery. And I would say that the other thing I would highlight is, as our customers think about hybrid work and they think about the return to office, we've talked about the prevalence of Wi-Fi 6 we saw continued strength in Wi-Fi. And we said once that begins to happen, that we believe there would be a campus switching upgrade follow and the CAT 9K has had four quarters of increasing growth in double digits the last few quarters from a demand perspective, so we've seen that happen as well. So, I think that -- overall, I think it's happening as we thought it would and perhaps even at an accelerated pace. Yes, Tal, it's great. I'll comment on the first one, I'll comment on both of them and then Scott can add on to it. So on the pricing front, as I said a few minutes ago, I think we have made some decisions on certain products that we will be making price increases on, and we're looking surgically at the rest of the portfolio based on where we have costs that we believe are going to be sustained. But you know, we're erring hard right now on taking care of our customers and trying to optimize our ability to deliver to them right now because we think that improves our relationships and it improves our position over the long term with these customers; so that's what we're doing. On the year-over-year trends, I think that what I would point to is the real thing that I think is substantive is the demand side of what we've seen, and -- because you're right. You can do some math that gets at the revenue in Q3, but I think that based on what we see and the demand that we see, we do believe this is certainly, it's a positively evolving marketplace for us and I think the work we've done over the last year, we pivoted our strategy a year ago based on what we thought would happen post-pandemic. The teams have been executing really hard, and it's great to see the customers embracing the solutions that we're delivering out there; so we feel like it's sustainable. Yes. I think, Tal, it's a really good point that Scott makes. There is a revenue headwind that we're facing based on the supply chain, so notwithstanding what's going on in the supply chain, our revenue guide would have been higher, which could have probably flowed through to improving EPS as well. So it's a complicated thing that we're navigating through right now. But notwithstanding that it's the best I've felt about the business and our momentum and where we are in quite a while. Yes, Ittai. Thanks. So, I'll try to do what you -- I'll try to answer what you asked, but I think it's a difficult one to really be definitive about, but I think there's a couple of aspects going on. I certainly believe there are projects that customers put on hold that they're now accelerating now that they have better visibility into what the return looks like. I definitely think that's happening. I also think your second point is happening. I think that they're, every customer is looking at modernizing their infrastructure because no one wants to be caught flat-footed by the next crisis, and everyone has realized the power of technology during this time frame and so I think there's an element of increased investments that we'll see across all the technology areas as well as obviously cybersecurity, etcetera. But the other thing I think that's really important is that we've been investing for a long time against a lot of these big market transitions that are starting to come to life. You remember, Ittai, we didn't play in the Webscale space five years ago. We didn't play. And now, we're seeing that was almost a quarter of our Service Provider business again this quarter, and it's still growing robustly. I mean, it grew over 25% this quarter against a quarter a year ago that was in excess of 70% growth, so it's still accelerating. And then, you've got 5G that's starting to play out the way, as we've all been waiting for it to play out. You've got this return to office and hybrid work with Wi-Fi 6 and the campus upgrades that we've talked about. And you've got this cybersecurity concern that is only exacerbated by everything we see in the press by all the continuing attacks and at a time where we had record revenues. So, I think all of those things are playing into it, and that's what leads us to feel pretty good about where we are right now. Two other things, Ittai, on that particular question that I wanted to point out if you don't mind. The first is we see a revenue headwind from the supply chain issue in Q4. As I said earlier, if we didn't have the supply chain challenges, we would have been guiding higher on revenue, which is reflected what Scott mentioned about the backlog coming into the quarter. The second thing is this business transformation that we have been working on for the last five or six years, if we go back to the first quarter I was CEO and then we look at the quarter that we're entering into, the recurring revenue that we're pulling off the balance sheet that we have visibility to today that will be part of Q4 revenue is up 64% during that time frame. So we have a lot more visibility, and it just says that the whole rationale for why we've been driving this business model transformation, which is a big complex change to get to, but that has helped us in a big way in allowing us to actually deliver the revenue we're talking about next quarter. So, the benefits that we believe were there for the business model, I think this is probably the quarter where we're feeling the positive impact of that more than any other quarter. Thanks, Ittai. We lost you, Simon. Scott, you want to take the gross margin? And then, Amit, on the Service Provider growth, I'm glad you asked the question because I should have pointed it out. We saw double-digit growth across all of the sub-segments of Service Provider, so Cable, Carrier as well as Webscale. So it was very balanced across the three and it's not one segment carrying it, which is why, another reason that we're optimistic. The demand side we saw was so consistent across all our customers and so consistent across geographies and so consistent across the product portfolio, but in the ESP space it was double-digit across all of those segments. Yes, we can. Yes, Simon. When your AirPods went out, Amit was on the same wavelength as you and asked the exact same question. So I'll give the same answer. It really is kind of two or three aspects that are driving it, all related to supply chain. Unit costs are up and that's based on the work that our supply chain team has dong to ensure that we get supply and so that such we can deliver for our customers the gear they need to get from us. They've all got significant transformation underway as well within their shops to support the new hybrid work environment, and so we're working as hard as we can to make sure we can deliver the product to them. But unit costs are slightly higher and that's semis, that's memory and it's certain other smaller commodities across the board. The second is, freight costs are higher, and as freight costs go up, obviously that hits gross margin. And then finally, expedite fees as we're getting product in the door. So, it's all tied to various elements of supply chain. No problem, that's okay. That's all right. Yes, so, Pierre, I think there's a couple things going on. Number one we have seen just over the last few years continued acceleration in our software business. Every acquisition we do, that's the business model. So from that perspective it comes in. From an organic perspective, we're building more software assets. We're delivering more Software Solutions. And then we're actually looking now, we announced Cisco Plus at Cisco Live, which is how do we deliver virtually anything we build as a service should our customers want to consume it that way. So we're just embarking on that, which is another big part of our portfolio, which will create more recurring revenue for the future, so that's what I'm talking about. Yes, Paul, I don't have the percentage. We haven't given that information out on the percentage of segments for a while. I would say if we could couch that until perhaps September when we do our Analyst Meeting unless you have. Most of them do. And what was the second question, Paul? Oh, the services growth. Overall, obviously quite pleased with the progress on our services business. There is in Q3 though, remember there was an extra week. And so it's a lot of services, a lot of that is ratable. That extra week turns into an extra week of revenue during the quarter so there is a one-off anomaly that's driving that outsized growth in Q3. Thanks. Yes, Tim. Thanks. I'll make one quick comment on the visibility thing, and then I'll let Scott comment and then I'll take the Cloud one. I would say that the thing that I will tell you is we're in the middle of Q3, I can tell you our supply chain team was a little, I guess, concerned about what they could see for the next two months at that time. And when we started building the guide and working through what we thought they could deliver and build in Q4, they had a reasonable degree of confidence. So what that says to me is they're getting better visibility. And so I think it's just going to improve from here. So that's what we've been dealing with the last couple months Scott, you want to add anything? And then, on the Cloud vertical; I would say that one of the customers we have had a very strong sort of Enterprise Networking portfolio relationship with, but beyond that, all of it is really being driven by infrastructure going into their Cloud assets. And so we have sold significant amounts of 8-Ks into that infrastructure, but we have sold silicon, stand-alone as well. We have our software running on one of their pieces of hardware, and in some case, we have their software running on our switching hardware. And we're working on White Box ODM with a couple of them relative to our silicon. So, we have all the variations that we announced in December of 2019 we're actively involved in right now; and the good news is there's a lot of Systems desire as well. Just as an add-on to that, last time, we talked about 400 gig, and there always seems to be a question about 400 gig. And our customer count on 400 gig went up by 50% during the quarter. So we did see a continued uptake on that technology, and that's super early, as you know. Yes, Jim. So we've had six consecutive quarters of very strong double-digit growth, ranging from mid-teens to triple-digits. And so that's in the Webscale vertical, and it certainly has been share gains because we didn't have any presence before. So as I've joked on calls before, it's one of the few markets where we actually have the opportunity to go gain share, and so that's been positive. We've worked hard on these relationships, and so that has expanded. We had a two-day customer briefing with one of them two weeks ago and it was, that particular briefing was all about our Enterprise portfolio. So we're seeing both sides but we are definitely seeing success that I just mentioned with Tim's question around the Cloud vertical in the Cloud infrastructure. Yes, Jeff. As we've talked about earlier, I think some of the supply chain issues we have that we're seeing certainly from a supply standpoint are going to be with us through the end of the calendar year. But there's no question we've also got some good tailwinds in the gross margin line. When you think of the amount of -- the faster growth rate of services and the ratability of that, which contributes significantly now to the revenue line, that's at a higher margin than our software business, which year-on-year grew at 13% and is now on a run-rate of about a $14 billion per year software business. That obviously comes at a higher margin too. So while we do have supply chain headwinds, we've also got some nice tailwinds that are coming in. Yes. We talked about that in the last day or so. And it's really difficult to get a number. I'd say it'd been a point or two, I mean particularly in the guide front, I think it's a reasonable thing to think about. I mean, our guys were stressed, and in Q4, they have very little, they're committed to what they think they can build, but it's tough. It's tough right now. So you can extrapolate with the growth rate we saw on the product side and then with the corresponding guide that our backlog is certainly increasing, so if we had the capacity to ship, we would but we just don't have it. All right, let me just wrap up by first and foremost thanking all of you for spending time with us today, and, despite the predominant discussion point here, which has been around gross margins relative to the supply chain, I hope our confidence came across and that we feel really good about the portfolio. We feel really good about the reopening. We feel good about our teams, I'm really proud of what they've accomplished. Look, I'm really pleased that our customers are choosing to spend their dollars with us, as they come back. I think that's a great statement of confidence, and I think that it also proves that we are going to be critical to the rebound and the recovery and the return to office. So, thanks for being with us, and we look forward to spending time with you all. And I'm going to kick it back to Marilyn."

            "name": "Scott Herren",
            "content": "Thanks, Chuck. Last quarter I identified four key priorities that we are using to define our financial strategy: driving profitable growth, a continued disciplined focus on financial management and operating efficiency, setting a long-term plan to maximize value creation through strategic transformation and examining investments, both organic and inorganic. We made progress on all these fronts in Q3 and are continuing to build our financial approach based on these core pillars, providing a strong foundation for enhanced financial performance as well as long-term value creation for our shareholders. Now, let's turn to our results. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter followed by the guidance for Q4. As Chuck said, Q3 was a strong quarter, across the business. We executed well, with strong product orders and solid growth in revenue, net income and earnings per share. Total revenue increased to $12.8 billion up 7% year-on-year, exceeding the high end of our guidance range for the quarter. We saw broad strength in all product areas and geographies. We also saw continued recovery in our business and building momentum was sequential revenue growth of 7%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 33.6%. Non-GAAP net income was $3.5 billion up 4%, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.83, up 5% year-on-year, coming in above the high end of our EPS guidance range. Now let me provide more detail on our Q3 revenue. Total product revenue was $9.1 billion, up 6%. Service revenue was $3.7 billion, up 8%. Infrastructure Platforms has rebounded nicely, with revenues up 6%. Within that, Switching Revenue increased overall with growth in campus driven by strong double-digit growth of our Catalyst 9K products. Routing had strong double-digit growth, driven by strength in the Service Provider market. Wireless had strong growth, driven by the continued ramp of our Wi-Fi 6 products and strength in Meraki. Data Center revenue declined, driven primarily by servers as we experienced continued market contraction. Applications were up 5%. We continue to see double-digit growth in WebEx, driven by our product innovations and the value we bring to remote working. We saw growth in Unified Communications, IoT software, and AppDynamics, offset by a decline in TelePresence endpoints. Security was up 13%, with growth across the entire portfolio. Our Cloud Security portfolio performed well, with strong double-digit growth and continued momentum of our Duo and Umbrella offerings. So we continued to transform our business, delivering more software offerings and driving growth in subscriptions and recurring revenue. Software revenue was $3.8 billion, and subscriptions were 81% of total software revenue, up 7 points year-on-year. As we continue to increase our software subscriptions, we're driving higher levels of recurring revenues. In fact the majority of our total revenue growth in the quarter came from recurring revenue streams. Additionally, the strength of our portfolio and transition to more software and services is driving growth in remaining performance obligations or RPO. At the end of Q3, RPOs were $28.1 billion, up 10%. RPO for Product was up 15% and for Service was up 7%. There was a 90 basis points positive impact on revenue growth in the quarter related to the acquisitions of Acacia and IMImobile, which both closed during the quarter. As a reminder, these acquisitions were not factored into our Q3 revenue guide. We had strong order momentum in Q3, with total product orders up 10%. Looking at our geographies, the Americas were up 6%, EMEA was up 10% and APJC was up 31%. Total Emerging Markets were up 13%, with the BRICs plus Mexico up 31%. In our Customer segments, Service Provider was up 17%, Commercial was up 16%, Public Sector was up 11%. Enterprise was flat, which is a significant improvement from last quarter. Non-GAAP total gross margin came in at the high end of our guidance range at 66%, down 60 basis points year-over-year. Product gross margin was 64.9%, down 90 basis points, and service gross margin was 68.7% down 20 basis points. The decrease in product gross margin was largely driven by ongoing costs related to the supply chain challenges, offset by positive product mix which includes some software benefit. Price erosion was relatively moderate and in-line with our historical range. On the supply chain front, we continue to manage through the constraints seen industry-wide and continue to incur additional costs. We are partnering with our key suppliers, leveraging our volume purchasing and expending supply commitments as we address the supply chain challenges which we expect will continue. The quarter did include an extra week, as we discussed on our last call. Consistent with our guidance for the quarter, the benefit to total revenue was approximately 3 points of growth. Total impact on our cost of sales and operating expenses was approximately $150 million. Operating cash flow was $3.9 billion, down 8%, driven by the timing of payments and restructuring costs. We expect operating cash flow to normalize for the full fiscal year. We ended Q3 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $23.6 billion, down $7 billion sequentially, driven by $5.5 billion in payments for acquisitions, as well as 3 billion in repayments of our long-term debt. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $2.1 billion to shareholders during the quarter. It was comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly dividend and $510 million of share repurchases. Year-to-date, we returned $6.7 billion to shareholders, which represents 64% of our free cash flow, and we have $8.7 billion in capacity remaining under our current share repurchase program authorization. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. During Q3 we closed three acquisitions, Acacia Communications, IMImobile, and Dashbase. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we also successfully closed on our acquisition of Slido on May 4. These investments are consistent with our strategy of complementing our internal innovation in R&D with targeted M&A to allow us to further strengthen and differentiate our market position in our growth areas. To summarize, we had a great Q3. We executed well, with strong top line growth and profitability. We're seeing returns on the investments we're making in innovation and driving the continued shift to more software and subscriptions, delivering growth and driving shareholder value. Now, let's turn to our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21. This guidance is subject to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. Our financial guidance for Q4 is as follows: we expect revenue growth to be in the range of 6% to 8% year-on-year, reflecting again, the strong demand we're seeing. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 64% to 65%, reflecting the ongoing increase in supply chain costs we're incurring as we protect shipments to our customers. Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 32% to 33%, and the non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 19%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.81 to $0.83. Looking ahead, we're excited to announce we will host a virtual Cisco Financial Analyst Day on Wednesday, September 15, 2021. We will post event details in the coming weeks and look forward to sharing more with you at that time. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A. Yes. Thanks, Rod. On starting with the gross margin, the impact you're seeing in the Q4 guide on gross margin is really driven by supply chain. It has a couple of elements to it. One is unit cost. So we've got and actually it was announced today from Gartner, we've got the number one supply chain team in the world, two years in a row. And that team has done a great job getting ahead of the issues that everyone in the industry is seeing. So with that, though, we've locked in both supply and pricing with some of the key component providers that we've got going ahead. That's what you see built into the margin guide and I think the supply chain issues will stay with us from what I can see at least through the end of this calendar year. On the OpEx side, it's a little bit different. When you look at the -- we're right on track, let me just start by saying, before you ask, we're right on track with the savings associated with the restructuring that we announced earlier this year, earlier this fiscal year. We said at the time we would reinvest some of that into the growth of the business overall, and that's what you see happening. So when you look at the year-on-year growth in OpEx, it's driven by the integration of the acquisitions that closed during the quarter, a little bit of a headwind from FX as the dollar has weakened and then the higher commissions given the robust strength of the top line. Commissions are up and reset at a variable comp plans. But that's what's driving it and I think the sustainability, to get to your point, is I expect to see some of these supply chain issues linger with us through the end of the calendar year, first half of our fiscal year. Thanks, Rod. Yes. I think, Tal, when you look at the year-on-year, I think the context you need to put around that is the improving trend that we've seen. We've seen four to five now consecutive quarters of quarter-on-quarter improvement, and really, the improvements across-the-board. It's in each geo, and it's in each product line. So we're seeing continued improvement and that, obviously, bodes well for looking out at Q4 and into the future. I think the other thing that we've talked about the robust demand that we've had and you see the revenue that we printed in Q3. What you didn't see is we also built up a healthy backlog at this point. And so I think that coming into Q4, not only do we have a very high percentage of recurring revenue as, that we know will come into the revenue stream during Q4. We've got a sizable backlog at this point, of orders to fulfill, and we know exactly what's in the pipeline. So, really feel good about the sequential trend that we're seeing across the business. And Ittai, on your second question about the impact of acquisitions. We said in the opening commentary that for Q3, it was about 90 basis points of growth, and that was not part of our Q3 guide. They each closed during the quarter so we look ahead at Q4 of the revenue growth that we've let out there, about a point and a half is driven by the acquisitions, mostly driven by Acacia. Yes, I will. It is driven by supply chain and it comes in a couple of flavors. Having done the work that we've done to protect shipment to our customers, there are unit price increases, unit cost increases on certain components that's built into it. There's also increased expedite fees, again to ensure that we get the components in and we can get the product back out the door and a slight increase in freight. So it really is all tied to supply chain. Yes, that's right. Mix is definitely, as we continue to add more recurring revenue particularly around software, as you pointed out, but also our tech support services, those are higher gross margins. Those long term will be a tailwind to our gross margins. The supply chain issues obviously more than offset that. In terms of your question on software growth, the numbers that you're using are a little bit rounded, but you're on the right tread. We're seeing nice growth in software and in fact, mentioned that 81% now of that is driven by subscription and recurring revenue, so a 7-point improvement in the amount of that software revenue that's recurring. That is great news longer-term as you know, with recurring revenue particularly when it's ratable you see less of the impact upfront. So there's a bit of a bow wave, and you see it in the growth of our RPOs and the growth of our deferred revenue on product so each of those are growing. That's also a sign of the growth within our software product set. When you just do the quick math, right, we're now one of the biggest software companies in the world, right, north of $14 billion in software revenue. And I don't think anyone thinks of Cisco in those terms. No, the only thing I would add is when you compare us to some of our peers where we break out Enterprise versus Commercial many of them combine those two together. Yes. So just bear that in mind as you're trying to compare us across the board. Yes, that makes sense. I get it. Yes. And then, once you normalize that out, you should think about the same normal rates you've been seeing. Yes. From a reported revenue standpoint, which I think is probably at least part of your question, Tim, we've got good visibility at this point, given the size of our backlog that we roll into Q4 with, as well as the amount of revenue that's now occurring that will come off the balance sheet. So you add those two together and then look at the -- we have a good feel obviously for what's in the pipeline at this point too. We have pretty good visibility at this point. Okay. And then, the concept is that once we get past these fairly ephemeral, in the grand scheme of things, supply challenges, then we should expect the gross margins to reflect the mix shift software and drift higher. That's the right way to think about it."

If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.\nMarilyn Mora: Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's second quarter fiscal 2021 quarterly earnings conference Call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chairman and CEO; and I\u2019m very pleased to welcome Scott Herren, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the third quarter of fiscal 2021. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties, including COVID-19, that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. With that, I'll now turn it over to Chuck.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Marilyn. First of all, I hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy. This year is full of promise as vaccines give us a path to healing and recovery. We are optimistic about the future and look forward to what lies ahead. This past quarter, our team delivered strong performance with revenues coming in at the top of our guidance range and non-GAAP EPS landing above the high end of our expectations all supported by margin expansion and a further strengthening of our balance sheet. More importantly, we are seeing encouraging signs of strength across our business as the recovery takes shape with all customer segments showing improvement in year-over-year growth rates. Our employees and partners have done a remarkable job executing and innovating throughout the pandemic to help our customers connect, secure and automate to accelerate their digital agility in a cloud-first world. We are partnering with them on core issues that are essential to their success: business resiliency, modernizing their IT environments and embracing secure hybrid work. Over the past year, our customers have relied on our innovation to accelerate their digital and cloud capabilities while protecting them from an expanding threat environment. In my numerous conversations with customers, it is clear that our technology will be a powerful engine for their recovery and growth as their technology needs continue to evolve at a rapid pace. Building on the strength of our broad portfolio, we are focused on six strategic pillars that will deliver highly secure next-generation architectures with unprecedented insights, automation and visibility. First, we are building networking solutions with built-in simplicity, security, agility and automation that can be consumed as a service. Second, we are optimizing our customers' application experiences, enabling greater speed, agility and scale of cloud-native applications and DevOps that deliver the best end user experience. Third, with the future of work being hybrid, we're delivering highly secure access, a safer workplace and the best collaboration experiences no matter whether workers are at home or in an office. Fourth, with our customers and partners, we are building the internet for the future by transforming connectivity and efficiently meeting the ever-growing demand for low latency and higher speeds. Fifth, with security and privacy a top priority, we are building integrated high efficacy end-to-end security solutions that are delivered on-prem or in the cloud. Lastly, as apps and workloads move closer to users and devices, we are developing new edge capabilities for a distributed world while enhancing the developer experience and extending enterprise and carrier networks. I am confident that this is the right strategy to deliver the innovation and integrated network solutions that our customers need no matter what the future holds. Now moving to our performance this quarter, we continue to see signs of gradual improvement led by order growth in our commercial, public sector and service provider businesses, which together account for nearly three quarters of product orders. The Enterprise market remains soft, driven by some elongated sales cycles and a continued pause in spending among some customers brought on by the pandemic. From a product revenue perspective, we saw strength in our Catalyst 9K, Data Center Switching, Security, Wireless and WebEx portfolios. The transformation of our business to more software and subscriptions continues to show great progress, as we achieved $3.6 billion in software revenue, with 76% of our software revenue sold as a subscription. We also saw our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in our deferred product revenue. We continue to accelerate our pace of innovation, delivering unique solutions and digital capabilities as we invest in flexible consumption models. I am confident in our ability to capture the long-term opportunities ahead in areas such as Cloud, 400 gig, 5G, Security, hybrid work and next-generation applications. Looking ahead, we are cautiously optimistic, as recent surveys of IT spending indicate year-over-year IT budget growth for calendar 2021. And Cisco remains well-positioned among CIOs' top forward-looking spending priorities, including network infrastructure, cybersecurity software, as well as cloud migration and cloud infrastructure. We are also mindful and vigilant about the uncertainty of the pandemic and its influence in the market, which is not fully behind us yet. Now, let me touch on Infrastructure Platforms. To manage the highly distributed and complex nature of modern IT environments, our customers must fundamentally change how their networks are architected. To help them achieve this, we are building a unified cloud-native platform suite to deliver secure, agile networking. A good example of this is our subscription-based, intent-based networking portfolio and is reflected in the momentum of our Catalyst 9K family, which saw another quarter of double-digit revenue growth. We are also delivering full stack observability from the application to the infrastructure to give our customers greater insights for faster, better decision-making. We are doing this through key elements of our portfolio like Intersight, ThousandEyes and AppDynamics, as well as our leading security innovations. As a global leader in transport network infrastructure, we are playing an important role in helping customers build their networks for the future. We continue to invest heavily to capture 5G, 400 gig and Wi-Fi 6 transitions to enable Open RAN and Edge services. This is reflected in our SD-WAN portfolio, routing, 5G mobile core platforms, optics and automation capabilities. In our web-scale business, we delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of very rapid order growth, increasing to triple digits. And on a trailing 12-month basis, our orders grew over 60% as we focus on delivering routing, data center switching and optical platforms built on Cisco Silicon One which had a \u2013 has a better efficiency over other silicon on the market. While we can see our performance vary quarter-to-quarter due to the timing of large deals, we are incredibly confident in our ability to further strengthen our position. By building a network on Silicon One, our customers can also save up to 30% of network switching power, resulting in a meaningful reduction in their environmental footprint as well as significant energy cost savings. Our agreement to acquire Acacia will enable us to deliver leading-edge optical technology to meet both the bandwidth requirements and the economics of next generation networks, which is critical to providing high-speed connectivity. This is just another reason why I'm still confident we will continue to win in the web-scale space. As I've mentioned, we plan to transition the majority of our portfolio to be cloud-driven, cloud-managed and delivered-as-a-service. If we can deliver it from the cloud, we will. For example, we are looking at offering SD-WAN plus cloud security as a service along with creating other new solutions. We will also provide simplified end-to-end networking with security, reliability control, and automation, plus seamless on-ramp capabilities to the cloud that no one else can deliver. Moving to Security, we delivered another strong quarter of revenue growth driven by increasing adoption of our next generation cloud-based architectures, which can enable fast and secured access to applications and data from anywhere. With the rapid growth in modern applications and more distributed work environments, our customers are adopting new security architectures as identity and data privacy are increasingly critical. The recent SolarWinds breach only highlights the urgent need for advanced threat defense. Our comprehensive security portfolio offers simplified protection for any workload on any cloud while minimizing the attack surface and automating security policies across an organization's hybrid cloud footprint. This extends to our secure access service edge framework and Zero Trust architecture, where we have developed a best-in-class cloud delivered stack across Umbrella, secure internet gateway, Meraki SD-WAN and Viptela. We're also delivering leading unified detection and response capabilities built on Cisco SecureX, our cloud native platform. Over 5,400 customers are already seeing the benefits of this platform since it became generally available last June. We remain committed to delivering simple, integrated and highly effective end-to-end security solutions delivered on-prem and in the cloud. Turning to Applications which includes our collaboration portfolio, we're focused on building solutions that will enable an engaged, productive workforce and an intelligent workplace, built with secured collaboration, automation, and insights. Our aim is to deliver the best collaboration experience for our customers, no matter where they are. Our strong momentum with WebEx continued, resulting in double-digit revenue growth. I'm still proud of the work that WebEx team has done to ensure our nearly 600 million quarterly average users are able to stay connected and productive. In addition, we are connecting over 6 billion calls every month for our customers around the world. We are bringing incredible innovation to the collaboration market at an unprecedented pace. Our goal is to deliver a 10X better experience than just in-person interactions. At our recent WebexOne event, we introduced more than 50 new product and feature innovations, integrating security and privacy to deliver inclusive experiences. Some of the new powerful capabilities we announced include noise cancellation, real-time language translation, and our Webex Desk Pro series platforms. Our recently announced intent to acquire cloud-based IMImobile and Slido furthers our vision of building a WebEx suite of applications as we combine these technologies with our Webex Contact Center to improve customer interactions. In summary, our strategy is clear and our business remains strong. We are executing and innovating with speed and delivered solid results with our Q2 revenue coming in at the high-end and earnings coming in above our stated guidance. As we move into the gradual recovery phase, we believe our customers will continue to turn to Cisco as their partner of choice. I am so proud of what our teams have achieved. The incredible innovation and trusted partnerships we're building will serve us well in the years ahead. While the past year has highlighted far too many inequities in our society, we believe in the power of technology to drive more inclusivity and opportunity to underserved populations and communities around the world, which is why we are committed to powering an inclusive future for all. With our ongoing disciplined approach to investment and innovation, we expect to be in an even stronger position post-pandemic as our customers look to deploy their next generation networks at the heart of their organizations. I firmly believe Cisco is well positioned to capture the long-term growth opportunities ahead and win for years to come. I'll now turn it over to Scott, our new CFO to walk through our financial results. As you know, Scott has strong experience in software and a proven track record of leading successful business model transitions from perpetual licenses to SaaS and recurring subscriptions. Scott has proven to be a powerful addition to our team, and I'll look forward to partnering with him as we plan the next phase of Cisco's continued transformation Scott, over to you.\nScott Herren: Thanks, Chuck. Let me start by saying how excited I am to join the Cisco team at such a pivotal time in the company's transformation. Before turning to our performance in the quarter, I thought I'd share my initial observations and key priorities. I'm impressed by the team here at Cisco and the progress the company has made on its transformation. Achieving the goals laid out three years ago of driving 50% of our revenue from software and services. It's also clear that leadership team is unified and focused, and that the strategies Chuck laid out earlier in the call will drive our growth over the next several years. It's an exciting time to be joining the company in this role. In terms of my key priorities, they include the following; driving profitable growth, a continued disciplined focus on financial management and operating efficiency, setting a long-term plan to maximize value creation through strategic transformation and examining investments, both organic and inorganic. I'm also committed to providing you the insight and metrics needed to understand and properly value our business longer term. Now let's turn to our results. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter, followed by the guidance for Q3. Our overall Q2 results reflect very good execution with strong margins and growth in non-GAAP net income and earnings per share in a continuing challenging environment. Total revenue of $12.0 billion came in at the top of our guidance range, flat year-over-year, as we see gradual recovery in several key product areas and sequential growth rate improvement in two out of three of our geographies. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 34.4%, up 70 basis points; non-GAAP net income was $3.4 billion up 2%, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.79 coming in above the high end of our guidance range and up 3% year-over-year. Now let me provide some more detail on our Q2 revenue. Total product revenue was $8.6 billion, down 1%, infrastructure platforms was down 3%. As a reminder, this is the product area most impacted by the COVID environment. Switching revenue was flat overall, we saw solid growth in data center switching with strong growth of the Nexus 9000, we also saw continued strong momentum of the Cat 9000 products within campus switching. Routing declined driven by weakness and service provider, wireless had solid growth driven by the continued ramp of our Wi-Fi 6 products and strengthened Meraki. Data center revenue declined driven primarily by servers, as we experienced continued market contraction. Applications was flat overall, we continue to see strong double-digit growth in Webex driven by our continuing product innovations and the criticality of remote working. This was offset by declines in Unified Communication and TP endpoints. Security was up 10% with growth across the portfolio. Our cloud security portfolio performed well with strong double-digit growth and continued momentum of our Duo and Umbrella offerings. Service revenue was up 2% driven by growth in our maintenance business, as well as solution support. And we continue to transform our business delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions. Software subscriptions were 76% of total software revenue, up 4 points year-over-year, as Chuck mentioned earlier. Remaining performance obligations or RPO at the end of Q2 were $28.2 billion, up 13%, RPO for product was up 17% and for service was up 10%. The continued growth in RPO demonstrates the strength of our portfolio of software and services and as another indicator of the broad recovery we see happening. In terms of orders in Q2, total product orders were up 1%, a significant improvement from Q1. Looking at our geographies, the Americas was down 1%, EMEA was up 7% and APJC was down 5%. Total emerging markets were down 14% with the BRICS plus Mexico down 11%. In our customer segments, public sector was up 10%, service provider was up 5% and commercial was up 1%, enterprise down 9%. Non-GAAP total gross margin was 66.9% up 50 basis points, product gross margins were 66.6% up 70 basis points and service gross margin was 67.9% up 20 basis points year-over-year. The growth in product gross margin was driven by positive product mix, including some software benefit and productivity improvements partially offset by pricing. In terms of the bottom line from a GAAP perspective, Q2 net income was $2.5 billion and earnings per share with $0.60. We ended Q2 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $30.6 billion up $600 million sequentially. Operating cash flow was $3 billion down 22% as expected, driven by a lower beginning receivables balance for the quarter, timing of payments and the restructuring payments. We expect operating cash flow growth to normalize over the course of the fiscal year. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $2.3 billion to shareholders during the quarter that was comprised of $1.5 billion for our quarterly dividends and $800 million of share repurchases. Year-to-date, we've returned $4.6 billion to shareholders, which represents 69% of our free cash flow. And today we announced the $0.01 increase to the quarterly dividend to $0.37 per share, up 3% year-over-year. This dividend increase reflects the 10th consecutive year of increasing our dividend and reinforces our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders and our confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. During Q2, we announced an amendment to the definitive merger agreement under which we previously agreed to acquire Acacia Communications. We expect to complete the Acacia acquisition in our fiscal Q3 subject to closing conditions, including Acacia stockholder approval. In addition, we announced our intent to acquire IMImobile, the cloud communications software and services company and Slido a provider of SaaS based solutions to enhance our Webex platform and our new cloud native contact center offerings. These investments are consistent with our strategy of complimenting our internal innovation and R&D with targeted M&A to allow us to further strengthen and differentiate our market position in our focus growth areas. To summarize, we executed well with strong margins and growth in non-GAAP net income and earnings per share growth. We're seeing returns on the investments, we're making an innovation and driving the continued shift to more software and subscriptions delivering long-term growth and shareholder value. Now, let me reiterate our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2021. This guidance is subject to the disclaimer regarding forward looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. Q3 does include an extra week, which occurs every five to six years. We've factored this extra week into our guidance for both revenue and expenses, although it's difficult to forecast the impact of the extra week, we have assumed roughly 2% to 3% year-over-year impact on total revenue growth, along with approximately $185 million of incremental cost of sales and operating expenses. The guidance for Q3 is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of 3.5% to 5.5% growth year-over-year, we anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 65% to 66%. The non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 33% to 34%, and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 19%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.80 to $0.82. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn, so we can move into the Q&A.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Scott. Michelle, let's go ahead and queue up the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. Maybe to start off for me, I just wanted to get a sense of where you feel like organizations are in planning for a return to work and what the hybrid workplace looks like? And when do you think that investment will take place in that architecture versus kind of when employees return to the office? Thanks.\nChuck Robbins: Yes, Meta, thank you. I think that the \u2013 what we have been operating under is a premise that customers will probably begin to come back to the offices in \u2013 we had been thinking sort of mid to late summer. I think if you were watching the news this morning, you heard some of the New York companies say that they may be September. But I would suspect that as companies look to prepare their offices for the return, in our case, we\u2019ve seen significant uptake in Wi-Fi 6, as an example, as they have begun to get ready for that return. We believe that that will require switching infrastructure as people come back to the office and begin to put load on those wireless networks. We also believe that every meeting in the future is going to be a hybrid meeting, even when people are back in the office. You\u2019ll have people in the office, and you\u2019ll have people remote. And in order to accommodate that, we suspect most of our customers will be putting video units in every conference room they have, which again will also accommodate the hybrid work model but will also drive bandwidth requirements which could lead to switching infrastructure. So that\u2019s the way we see it playing out over the next few months. And we would expect that with some of the solutions we have around worker safety and the collaboration portfolio and the Wi-Fi 6 build outs that we\u2019ll continue to see some progress from our customers as they prepare to return.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks.\nMarilyn Mora: Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Jim Suva from Citigroup Investment Research. You may go ahead.\nJim Suva: Thank you very much. Looking at your guidance, I think some investors are asking a little bit about, hey, the revenue guidance is up year-over-year quite impressively off a little bit of easy comps and also an extra week. But the EPS year-over-year, there\u2019s not much leverage there. There are additional costs I think with less travel. Why wouldn\u2019t there be more flow-through to the bottom line of earnings per share?\nScott Herren: Yes, thanks, Jim, for the question. And I think there\u2019s a couple things you have to bear in mind. Not only does the extra week in Q3 bring along with it additional revenue, it brings along additional spend as well. And we touched on this in the opening commentary. It\u2019s about $185 million. Our expectation is about $185 million of additional spend. Coming through, when you compare year-on-year coming through from last year, we also have comp plans reset. So as you\u2019d expect, commissions and bonuses are on a different track this year than they were last year, and FX. The weakness of the dollar is having an effect on us as well. And so when you add those up, that\u2019s what drops through to the COGS and the OpEx line. We are on track, just to get ahead of maybe what your next question would have been. We\u2019re on track with the $1 billion of savings that we talked about through the restructuring. That continues to go well. Almost all of that is behind us at this point, but there are some year-on-year things there that are factoring into our spend rate for this year, for this coming quarter.\nJim Suva: Thank you, Scott. And welcome. And thanks for the color and details. I\u2019m looking forward to working with you. Thanks, Scott. It\u2019s Jim.\nChuck Robbins: And you, Jim. Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Jim. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. You may go ahead, sir.\nIttai Kidron: Thanks, and good luck, Scott, in your new role. I guess I have a couple of questions, first on the declined 9% in orders on Enterprise, Chuck, can you give us a little bit more color? It seems like a significant lag growth to the others. When do you expect that to normalize and improve? And then perhaps a second question, more of a bigger picture one for you, Chuck. It\u2019s been a clearly a very difficult year all around. Maybe you could give us a little bit more, the bigger picture perspective that you have here about the company. In what ways Cisco here and now different in the way it operates and thinks and moves going forward versus the Cisco of a year ago just before heading into the pandemic? I\u2019m trying to understand kind of the lessons learned and how they\u2019re implemented and impacting the company. And how should we think about you differently going forward?\nChuck Robbins: Yes, Ittai, thank you. And, look, first of all I think that if you look at the customer segments, we saw improvement across Service Provider, Commercial and Public sector. And we saw improvement in Enterprise, although it\u2019s still negative year-over-year. But what I would tell you is, from a vertical industry perspective, we did see positive movement from industries that are not directly impacted by the pandemic. Think financial services. Think manufacturing. Think technical services. And then those that are still in the midst of the pandemic continue to struggle \u2013 hospitality, retail, transportation, energy. And so I think from that perspective, it gives us confidence that as we come out of this thing that those industries that are being depressed by the pandemic will obviously look to the future and will recover as well. So the other thing that we\u2019ve reflected on is that when we came out of the 2008 crisis, we saw Commercial lead, and then Enterprise followed. And it\u2019s just been a really good sign that the U.S. Commercial business this past quarter grew 6% from an orders perspective, which I think is a nice bounce. And obviously it was 1% globally. But seeing that go positive gives us also confidence in the future of the Enterprise following. As it relates to the bigger picture, I think we talked a lot about giving our customers consumption flexibility. Earlier in my comments, I actually outlined six of the strategic pillars that we\u2019re all focused on. I\u2019d say that we are super optimistic about the progress we\u2019ve made in the web-scale space. We continue to deliver on our software revenues, which were $3.6 billion this quarter. And again, 76% of it coming from software, and I think that will only increase. So I think that those six pillars combined with more flexibility and consumption options for our customers and continued transition to software and a continued focus on web-scale and other growth opportunities is what we\u2019re trying to do over the next two to three years.\nIttai Kidron: Very good. Good luck.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Ittai. Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Paul Silverstein from Cowen & Company. You may go ahead.\nPaul Silverstein: Thanks for taking the questions. Scott, can you tell us what the rate of price degradation was? In connection with that, any thoughts in terms of the mortgage structure of the company at both the gross and operating line asset both resiliency and even hopefully better as to upside and where you can drive that from?\nScott Herren: Yes, thanks, Paul. The pricing mix was really in line with what we\u2019d seen over the last several quarters. And you\u2019ll see this next week, obviously, in the Q, but I\u2019ll go ahead and give you the data point. It was 1.6% for the second quarter, slightly better actually than what we had seen in Q1 and actually modestly better than what we\u2019ve seen over the trailing four quarters. So pricing mix was as expected during the second quarter. I think as you look longer-term, the gross margin is going to bounce around a little. It always does. I think part of what is factoring into our view of gross margin ahead is that the benefit of a greater mix of software and services in there being somewhat offset by some of the supply chain concerns that we have right now that I think you\u2019ve seen, not just from us, but from everyone who is building products that contain a significant amount of semiconductors. So we\u2019re doing what you\u2019d expect us to do on the supply chain front. We are contacting all of our key suppliers on that front. We\u2019re leveraging kind of the volume purchase that we have, extending that supply chain further out, all with a goal of ensuring we can protect customer shipments. So there\u2019s a little bit of a headwind coming in those lines from just the supply \u2013 the current supply chain.\nPaul Silverstein: Hey Scott, I trust though, the supply chain commentary, that\u2019s a transitory issue that\u2019s going to pass if we look beyond assuming the world goes back to normal. It sounds like if you net that out, there should be a positive trajectory at some point.\nScott Herren: I think that\u2019s right. I mean, we\u2019ve talked about growing the percent of our business, and you\u2019ve seen Cisco do a really nice job of growing the percent of the business coming from software and services. And, obviously, that comes through at a higher margin.\nPaul Silverstein: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research. You may go ahead.\nPierre Ferragu: Hey. Thank you for taking my question. Scott, I have a question for you on your gross margin. I was just checking my model, and I think the 66.9% you reported this quarter is actually a record for as far back as my model goes. I think it goes back quite far. So congratulations, like, a great stuff on that front.\nScott Herren: Thanks.\nPierre Ferragu: And my question is actually how should we think about gross margin in this transition you want to accelerate and continue throughout the Cloud? Are we now in a phase where we should expect gross margins to head up over-time with ups and down, of course? But should we expect structural margin expansion going along with your transformation?\nScott Herren: Yes, again, Pierre, your model must go back to our fiscal 2006, because this was the highest gross margin we\u2019d reported since second quarter of 2006. So you\u2019re right from that standpoint. And again, I would just in terms of where this goes longer-term, I expect there to be a little bouncing around over the next couple of quarters given some of the supply chain concerns that everyone that\u2019s building product based on semis. And a slight headwind still from memory. But I think everyone in the market is going to see that same set of trends. Longer-term, again, as we drive up the mix of software and services that should have a positive impact on gross margins.\nPierre Ferragu: Great. And maybe if I have a quick follow up on the same theme. You mention extending the transition. What\u2019s up next for grab for you to evolve in the product portfolio to increase the share of technology that you deliver as a service in Cloud-based?\nScott Herren: Hey, Pierre. It\u2019s Chuck. I\u2019ll take that one. And Scott is pretty proud of the immediate impact he had by delivering the record gross margins being here very short time.\nPierre Ferragu: I\u2019m very impressed.\nChuck Robbins: Yes, exactly, high impact. So I think as you look at the as-a-service offerings, what we\u2019re going to do is take \u2013 we\u2019re taking intellectual property we have in our core enterprise portfolio, we\u2019re delivering a lot of that as both Cloud-delivered as well as Cloud-managed. Think about what we\u2019ve done with the whole discussion we\u2019ve had over the years about the Meraki platform and how we bring those capabilities to the rest of the portfolio, taking technologies like SD-WAN and Cloud Security and integrating those together and delivering those as a service, which, frankly, are uniquely capability \u2013 that\u2019s a unique capability that we have. And so I think those are areas where you\u2019ll see that continue to move forward. In addition to anything that we've sort of virtualized over the years, you can now deliver that as a service, anything that's pure software. So we're looking at every aspect of the portfolio.\nPierre Ferragu: Thanks, Chuck.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks Pierre. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Jeff Kvaal from Wolfe Research. You may go ahead.\nJeff Kvaal: Yes. Thanks very much. I'm hoping to ask two, I guess first is I'm wondering, could you help us understand better the dynamics involved in the web-scale progress, which product lines and what type of applications are you into, is that a Silicon One story? And then secondly, I was just wondering if you could help us with the expectation for the durability of the public sector strengths. Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Yes. Thanks, Jeff. So let me start with the second one, the durability of the public sector. I think two comments on this one, clearly there is stimulus that\u2019s flowing in both in the U.S. and around the world and I think that'll continue for some period of time, obviously and that's certainly helping. But the other thing that I think has occurred over the last year is that countries have realized that they have to invest in infrastructure, and digital infrastructure and technology to be prepared for these sorts of crises in the future. So I think that notwithstanding stimulus, I think the spending we see post-pandemic will be greater than what we saw pre-pandemic. And in fact, some of these countries have come to the conclusion that they need to take more dependency on themselves and less on some of their allies given sort of what we've seen over the last few years and so they're beefing up their technology investments from that perspective. So I think net, once a stimulus goes out, I still think you see a positive segment for a few years to come. On the web-scale front, I'll just take a minute to explain, we actually gave more information today than we've given. And over the last few years, many of you have heard me say that this was a marathon and we got a lot of work to do. And what has become clear to me over the last five quarters is that, the work that our teams have put in over the last five years has begun to pay-off. And so this quarter we saw triple digit growth year-over-year in our web-scale portfolio. As I said in earlier comments the prior four quarters, I will tell you that the growth rates range from 17% to 74%. So it's been up for the last five quarters as we've talked about. From a portfolio perspective, you asked we're selling the 8000 series which we announced in December of 2019, we're winning 400 gig franchises. We are selling some silicon, we're selling our Catalyst 9000 and we're selling the rest of the portfolio as well. And so it's been pretty broad-based relative to what we are selling them, but we feel good about the investments we've made, the hard work we put in. And the last thing I'll tell you is that, the other question you're probably going to ask is how material it is from a size perspective. And I'll tell you that last quarter that we just finished, it was 25% of our service provider segment. And over the last four quarters, it's averaged 21% of that SP segment. So it's gotten to a point where it it's meaningful. So that's why we decided to give the additional information today. Again, this business much like the service provider business that we've talked about over the years we'll have \u2013 will be big deal driven, big customer driven. So it will have a tendency to be lumpy. But I think if you look at it over the course of four quarters, six quarters, eight quarters, it's going to be a \u2013 it should continue to be positive.\nJeff Kvaal: Thank you, Chuck. Congratulations.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks.\nMarilyn Mora: Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs, you may go ahead.\nRod Hall: Yes, thanks for the question. I had two as well. One would be, I guess, one of the most surprising numbers in here is the service provider order growth rate of 5%. I think huge turnaround from last quarter. And I think you just gave me part of the answer to that, Chuck. But just curious if you could dig into that a little bit more color, what drove that? Just a little bit unexpected for me. And then the second thing I wanted to ask, back to you Scott on the FX impact, is there any way you could quantify those, if you help us understand how the dollar move has affected for instance, revenue growth year-over-year and maybe margins as well. If anything, you can help us with based on quantification there. Thanks.\nChuck Robbins: Hi Rod I'll take the first one. On the SP space, so yes, if you look at what we saw in the quarter from an order perspective, we saw a positive growth in cable, which represents about 15% of segment. We saw triple digit growth in web-scale, which is representing 25% of the segment. And then our telco business was down and that's roughly 60% of the business and primarily that is because where we are in the stages with 5G. We have roughly 35 customers around the world that were working on 5G solutions with mobile backhaul, with orchestration, with packet core. And so we're just early in that transition. And I think that particular sub-segment of SP will begin to show progress for us as we see the core backbone build-outs as we've been saying over the last few years. And the good news is we're seeing the backhaul stuff being built. We're seeing the packet core decisions get made, which means that the core network backbone decisions will be made. And the fact that we are being \u2013 having some positive success in a web-scale space would give me a high degree of confidence that those same products will bode well in the service provider space. So I think, this has been a tough segment for us for many, many years, and we're hopeful right now with the web-scale success and then with the 5G build outs underway that this could be a tailwind over the next few years for us.\nScott Herren: And Rod this is Scott on the FX impact. As you know in most markets we price in USD. So there's a limited impact from FX on the top line. But of course with the weaker dollar, we have employees worldwide and obviously you pay them in local currency. And so when you translate that back, it has a \u2013 it creates a bit of a headwind for us on the OpEx side. I'm hesitant to give you an exact figure on that, but just so you can understand the dynamics that's the way it works. And it has created a headwind for us during the second quarter.\nRod Hall: Okay. Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks Rod. Next question.\nOperator: Tal Liani from Bank of America Securities, you may go ahead.\nTal Liani: Hello, I have two questions. One is just clarification from my understanding and I'll ask it in a general way. What's holding up the closure of Acacia and what will change now versus the delays we've seen so far, so that's the easy one. The second question is I want to understand your outlook on a product basis rather than a vertical. When you \u2013 we focus on legacy switches and routers. Can you discuss the trends that you're seeing for the next four quarters or the next kind of calendar year? Where is the change, meaning what are the areas where you see increase versus the previous four quarters? Thanks.\nChuck Robbins: So Tal, I am going to ask for clarification on the second one before I start. So are you talking about in the enterprise space? Are you just or you're just talking about what do we feel good about from a product perspective over the next few quarters in general?\nTal Liani: Exactly. I'm trying to understand it at the product level rather than the vertical level.\nChuck Robbins: Yes, got it. Okay. So on the Acacia thing, I think it's quite clear what occurred, we didn't have China approval, we thought we did, we didn't have it in time. So we renegotiated the price because our contract with them had expired and candidly the performance they put up in the 18 months between our original deal and this deal was pretty astounding, so the price was not was not out of the question. And then we subsequently got Chinese approval and I think Scott keep me honest, but I think they have to get shareholder approval and the proxies out. So we expect that should happen, it'll happen during Q3 Tal. So China approval is done, there's no more approvals to get. It's just up to the shareholder vote at this point. So we think that is in pretty good shape. On the on the second front, let me just run through the portfolio and I'll tell you sort of how I feel about everything right now. So I think, if you look at the Mass-Scale Infrastructure, the service provider portfolio, whatever you want to call it, where the 8000 is and some of the other stuff that's being built for 5G and for 400 gig, in the mass-scale data centers, I think that portfolio is in really good shape, and I would expect it to be a very positive contributor, not only over the next year but over the next two to three years. I think that there's if I look at the campus switching infrastructure, I think with customers begin to come back they are going to look at upgrading. We've seen \u2013 we saw significant growth last quarter in demand for WiFi 6. Just to give you a data point that we don't disclose anywhere, but we had \u2013 I think our orders for WiFi grew 20% last quarter. And what typically happens is that when you effectively put a lot of load on WiFi, like WiFi 6 is going to accommodate, it's going to require an underlying infrastructure upgrade to accommodate it. And when you add to that, the video load that will likely go on to these customers as they come back to the office and put video in every conference room and continue to use video the way they've used it during the pandemic. We think that that will also be a driver. So I think we have the Catalyst 9000 portfolio, the WiFi 6portfolio. We feel good about as well. The SD-WAN technology continues to move forward. We're seeing good growth there. And I think as we deliver that technology as a service integrated with our cloud security, I think that's going to be a differentiator for us. Within the security portfolio the teams are working on a couple of very differentiated tracks on strategy, I'd say that we need \u2013 I'd say we need another six months or so to see how that evolves, but I feel good about what they plan to do. Our current portfolio is performing well and they just need to execute. So we have to see that. I think the teams have done an amazing job on what they've brought forward with the WebEx platform. Again, you have to remember in the applications space, there's probably a view on that, when it's not performing the way you would think, you got to remember all the phones are included in that space too. So while WebEx was up double digits as Scott said. You've also got the drag of the handset business, that's in there as well. But I think the WebEx work and the pace of innovation, the feature velocity, the suite aspect that they're looking at I think the teams are doing a really good job. And I think over the next year, you'll see us actually, that portfolio will continue to improve and I think we have a chance to take share back. What did I miss? And then we're working on things like full stack observability which are somewhat nascent. We're working on our edge service strategy, which is somewhat nascent, but I feel like the team \u2013 I think the portfolio is in probably as good a shape as has been in awhile. And we just have to execute.\nTal Liani: Right. Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Next question, please.\nOperator: Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan, you may go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi, thanks for the question. Chuck just wanted to see if you can dig a bit deeper into the demand drivers for the security segment here, particularly how have you seen customers respond to the recent events on SolarWinds. If we would have expected a bit more momentum on the security segment here? Is that more particularly to come or particularly is it more going to be hardware or software that we should expect the demand from?\nChuck Robbins: Yes. I think that what we see across that portfolio is we had a really good quarter actually in network firewall and cloud security. So it was a good quarter across the board, across the portfolio. And I think what you'll see is that, we're in the early phases I think of any positive impact that you would see from a SolarWinds buildup, because most of the customers are going into assess like, where am I, what have I missed, what do I need, what caused me to miss what I missed, and then they're going to move from there. So I think we're sort of in the midst of that right now, with a lot of our customers doing those kinds of assessments. But, it's been from the early parts of the pandemic when we saw VPN technology being absorbed as much as we could possibly build and then the network firewall, and then combine that with the cloud security, it feels like customers are consuming whatever security they can consume right now to try to avoid those sorts of situations. So I would think that that will continue to be positive for us.\nSamik Chatterjee: Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Simon Leopold with Raymond James & Associates. You may go ahead, sir.\nSimon Leopold: Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask first an easy one and then more of a thematic one. On the easy side hopefully, is just wondering if the supply chain constraints, your ability to get components, if that cost you any revenue in the quarter, if you could quantify that. And then in terms of the broader trend, maybe you could help me understand how you see the campus environment developing because it sounds like you've highlighted a number of positives \u2013 getting back to work, long legs in the CAT 9K cycle, Wi-Fi sounds good. But I have to imagine there are some offsets as well \u2013 maybe not as many people go back to work, legacy products rolling over. Just if you could build a bridge on what's going on in Campus over the longer term. Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: All right. Scott, you want to take supply chain?\nScott Herren: Yes, we didn't really see any impact on our ability to get product out the door during the second quarter. The team has stayed on top of the supply chain scenario, and it's been evolving, as you know, throughout the quarter. As we look ahead at Q3, that is something that is factored into our guide, both in our expectations on the top line and on the gross margin line. But it really hasn't been \u2013 in the second quarter at least, it hasn't been a significant headwind for us.\nChuck Robbins: Yes, I think that our teams are doing a good job on that of trying to buy ahead, trying to build inventory. And I think that there's certainly some unknowns and it's certainly complex. But I think the teams have done a pretty good job navigating, and it is built into the guide. On the Campus front, I think what I described is actually what I would expect for most customers. I think, Simon, the question you ask is a philosophical discussion that we have a lot in that when customers go back, what is it going to look like? Are more employees going to stay at home? Does that mean they're going to shrink their footprint? Does COVID stay with us? Do people now believe that they want to be, they want to maintain somewhat of a social distance in the office even post-COVID until we really get well beyond it? And does that mean that you need more footprint? What's the future of shared space? Are employees comfortable coming in and sitting in a shared space that someone else occupied the day before or do they want their own space when they come in so that they feel safe in it? And I think those are the kinds of things that we don't understand. But if I net it out, I don't think, personally \u2013 this my own opinion based on customer discussions and everything else. I don't think that some of the earlier beliefs in the pandemic where the early days is like no one is going to go back to the office because we're actually productive at home. I think we sort of moved into that phase where people actually struggle mentally. People are \u2013 they're not enjoying it. One of our employees said to me the other day, I don't mind the option of working from home. I don't like being forced to work from home. And so I really believe it's going to be hybrid, where people are going to work from home and everybody's sort of landing here where they're going to work from home three days a week and work from the office two days a week or vice versa. The question is what accommodations does that lead to for customers, based on employees' concern over space issues, concern over future pandemics or other concern. That's what we just don't know yet. But I do believe, based on what we've seen with Wi-Fi 6, that tells me customers are getting ready, and they're upgrading the wireless infrastructure now. And in the Commercial space, we've seen a fair amount of the follow-on with the switching, and hopefully we'll see that in the Enterprise space beyond this quarter.\nSimon Leopold: Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Simon. Next question?\nOperator: Tim Long from Barclays. You may go ahead, sir.\nTim Long: Thank you. Yes, two if I could as well. First, maybe, Chuck, on the Cat 9K still doing very well. Just curious what you think the impacts will be when some of the kind of earlier adopters licenses are coming due. So kind of what impact is that? Kind of what inning are we in there? And then second on the Cloud business, curious kind of who you're winning against there. Is this against just traditional competitors or are you starting to see any wins back from white box or are you just serving to maybe limit where white box can go with that Cloud customer base? Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Tim, thanks. So on the Cat 9K, I think the way I would think about it is that the license \u2013 I think you're really asking about the renewal side of that piece, which in this fiscal year is \u2013 it's not significantly material. And I think I've said on a couple of calls before it's really good, the size it is this year because it gives us a chance to test our processes and our renewal value proposition and all that stuff because it's meaningful in fiscal 2022. So the teams are working hard right now to try to get ahead of that and be ready for it. On the Cloud front, what I would say is that when we announced in December of 2019 we had a launch, the future of the internet launch, we talked about that we would be \u2013 we would sell our customers systems, integrated systems. We would sell them silicon or we would sell them white boxes. I mean, I'm sorry, our software. And we have all three of those scenarios actually playing out right now. So we have customers who have standardized on our systems for 400 gig. We have customers who are testing our silicon and actually putting it in white boxes, which is what we would expect them to do. We have some customers running our software stack on their hardware. And the people we're competing with are, they would be quite evident to you, short of me calling them out. I think these are the traditional players that have been successful in that space, and we talked a lot back years ago about the fact that we missed the first wave and we were going to work hard to be in a position when the 400 gig transition occurred and try to work our way back in and earn that business back. And I think the teams have begun to do that. So I'm really proud of what they've done.\nTim Long: Okay. Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Hey, we have time for one last question. Michelle?\nOperator: Thank you. Sami Badri from Credit Suisse. You may go ahead.\nMarilyn Mora: Sami?\nOperator: Sami, your line is open.\nMarilyn Mora: Sami, are you on mute?\nSami Badri: I don't think so.\nChuck Robbins: There you are.\nMarilyn Mora: We hear you now. We didn't hear you before.\nSami Badri: Okay. Perfect. Sorry about that. First question is for Chuck. One thing that I think has not come up in this call is anything regarding the 5G really, and we're about year three in the telecommunications 5G cycle. And at this point, a lot of people are just trying to understand what's really the effect to the equipment supply chain and how these telecommunication providers are going to consume equipment from the different vendors? And then the other question is for Scott. You do have some M&A that has already closed in fiscal 3Q, and there are projections for other closures of deals in fiscal 3Q. Does any of the guide include acquired or inorganic revenues? And if you're prepared to give us a breakout of organic versus inorganic, that would be helpful.\nChuck Robbins: Let me take the 5G. I think what you're seeing right now is most customers \u2013 most of our customers that are working on 5G, they've been building out the radio networks; they've been building out packet core capabilities; they've been building out mobile backhaul; and in many cases, they're running these hybrid 4G/5G backbones, with some exceptions where you have like a standalone 5G network that's been built. And in that case, what we participate in, in there with the packet core for sure, mobile backhaul, and some elements of orchestration. And what we believe is that over the next couple of years as these providers begin to build out a standalone 5G backbones and in many cases to serve up enterprise services that they will be making decisions on core upgrades to support the bandwidth and the traffic that's going to load those networks. And I think that's when we believe that we will see this \u2013 most of the benefit from the 5G build-out. So that's kind of where we are right now. And we're having good success in the areas that we participate based on where they are in the life cycle of these networks. Scott, you want to touch on the M&A question?\nScott Herren: Sure. Sami, we did have a couple of acquisitions that closed during the second quarter but they were both quite small. Strategically important but not meaningful in terms of adding to the Q3 guide, we've got some more meaningful ones that we do expect to close during the quarter. Obviously, Acacia would be meaningful. We've got IMImobile which we expect to close during the quarter, which will have some level of impact on the guide. Neither of those are factored in at this point. So as we get those closed \u2013 and at this point it's not exactly certain when they'll close, which is why they're not currently factored into the guide \u2013 as those close, we'll give you some insight into what our expectations are for them.\nSami Badri: Got it. Thank you very much.\nChuck Robbins: All right. Just to wrap up, I want to thank everybody for spending time with us today and again, just hope that everybody stays safe as we work through what we're all hopeful is the beginning of the recovery. And I think that from a business perspective, we continue to feel like that is definitely the case; that we are in the midst of a recovery, which gives us a lot of optimism. I'm proud of what our teams have done. I'm proud of the innovation that we have built during this complicated time. And we have Cisco Live coming up at the end of March where there'll be a lot of innovation that we'll be announcing. And based on that and some of the performance that we see and the continued improvement in our business, I remain fairly optimistic about where we are right now as we come through this pandemic. So we'll look forward to talking to all of you on the next call. And, Marilyn, I'll turn it back over to you.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Chuck. Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call, which will reflect our fiscal 2021 third quarter results, will be on Wednesday, May 19, 2021, at 1:30 PM Pacific Time, 4:30 PM Eastern Time. As a reminder, we will be presenting and hosting meetings at several investor conferences over the next few weeks including the Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet Conference tomorrow. Again, I'd like to remind the audience that in light of Regulation FD, Cisco's policy is not to comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through explicit public disclosure. We now plan to close the call. If you have any further questions, feel free to contact the Investor Relations team. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you for participating on today's conference call. If you would like to listen to the call in its entirety, you may call 1800-391-9851. For participants dialing from outside the U.S., please dial 203-369-3268. This concludes today's call. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "Chuck Robbins",
            "content": "Thanks, Marilyn. First of all, I hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy. This year is full of promise as vaccines give us a path to healing and recovery. We are optimistic about the future and look forward to what lies ahead. This past quarter, our team delivered strong performance with revenues coming in at the top of our guidance range and non-GAAP EPS landing above the high end of our expectations all supported by margin expansion and a further strengthening of our balance sheet. More importantly, we are seeing encouraging signs of strength across our business as the recovery takes shape with all customer segments showing improvement in year-over-year growth rates. Our employees and partners have done a remarkable job executing and innovating throughout the pandemic to help our customers connect, secure and automate to accelerate their digital agility in a cloud-first world. We are partnering with them on core issues that are essential to their success: business resiliency, modernizing their IT environments and embracing secure hybrid work. Over the past year, our customers have relied on our innovation to accelerate their digital and cloud capabilities while protecting them from an expanding threat environment. In my numerous conversations with customers, it is clear that our technology will be a powerful engine for their recovery and growth as their technology needs continue to evolve at a rapid pace. Building on the strength of our broad portfolio, we are focused on six strategic pillars that will deliver highly secure next-generation architectures with unprecedented insights, automation and visibility. First, we are building networking solutions with built-in simplicity, security, agility and automation that can be consumed as a service. Second, we are optimizing our customers' application experiences, enabling greater speed, agility and scale of cloud-native applications and DevOps that deliver the best end user experience. Third, with the future of work being hybrid, we're delivering highly secure access, a safer workplace and the best collaboration experiences no matter whether workers are at home or in an office. Fourth, with our customers and partners, we are building the internet for the future by transforming connectivity and efficiently meeting the ever-growing demand for low latency and higher speeds. Fifth, with security and privacy a top priority, we are building integrated high efficacy end-to-end security solutions that are delivered on-prem or in the cloud. Lastly, as apps and workloads move closer to users and devices, we are developing new edge capabilities for a distributed world while enhancing the developer experience and extending enterprise and carrier networks. I am confident that this is the right strategy to deliver the innovation and integrated network solutions that our customers need no matter what the future holds. Now moving to our performance this quarter, we continue to see signs of gradual improvement led by order growth in our commercial, public sector and service provider businesses, which together account for nearly three quarters of product orders. The Enterprise market remains soft, driven by some elongated sales cycles and a continued pause in spending among some customers brought on by the pandemic. From a product revenue perspective, we saw strength in our Catalyst 9K, Data Center Switching, Security, Wireless and WebEx portfolios. The transformation of our business to more software and subscriptions continues to show great progress, as we achieved $3.6 billion in software revenue, with 76% of our software revenue sold as a subscription. We also saw our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in our deferred product revenue. We continue to accelerate our pace of innovation, delivering unique solutions and digital capabilities as we invest in flexible consumption models. I am confident in our ability to capture the long-term opportunities ahead in areas such as Cloud, 400 gig, 5G, Security, hybrid work and next-generation applications. Looking ahead, we are cautiously optimistic, as recent surveys of IT spending indicate year-over-year IT budget growth for calendar 2021. And Cisco remains well-positioned among CIOs' top forward-looking spending priorities, including network infrastructure, cybersecurity software, as well as cloud migration and cloud infrastructure. We are also mindful and vigilant about the uncertainty of the pandemic and its influence in the market, which is not fully behind us yet. Now, let me touch on Infrastructure Platforms. To manage the highly distributed and complex nature of modern IT environments, our customers must fundamentally change how their networks are architected. To help them achieve this, we are building a unified cloud-native platform suite to deliver secure, agile networking. A good example of this is our subscription-based, intent-based networking portfolio and is reflected in the momentum of our Catalyst 9K family, which saw another quarter of double-digit revenue growth. We are also delivering full stack observability from the application to the infrastructure to give our customers greater insights for faster, better decision-making. We are doing this through key elements of our portfolio like Intersight, ThousandEyes and AppDynamics, as well as our leading security innovations. As a global leader in transport network infrastructure, we are playing an important role in helping customers build their networks for the future. We continue to invest heavily to capture 5G, 400 gig and Wi-Fi 6 transitions to enable Open RAN and Edge services. This is reflected in our SD-WAN portfolio, routing, 5G mobile core platforms, optics and automation capabilities. In our web-scale business, we delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of very rapid order growth, increasing to triple digits. And on a trailing 12-month basis, our orders grew over 60% as we focus on delivering routing, data center switching and optical platforms built on Cisco Silicon One which had a \u2013 has a better efficiency over other silicon on the market. While we can see our performance vary quarter-to-quarter due to the timing of large deals, we are incredibly confident in our ability to further strengthen our position. By building a network on Silicon One, our customers can also save up to 30% of network switching power, resulting in a meaningful reduction in their environmental footprint as well as significant energy cost savings. Our agreement to acquire Acacia will enable us to deliver leading-edge optical technology to meet both the bandwidth requirements and the economics of next generation networks, which is critical to providing high-speed connectivity. This is just another reason why I'm still confident we will continue to win in the web-scale space. As I've mentioned, we plan to transition the majority of our portfolio to be cloud-driven, cloud-managed and delivered-as-a-service. If we can deliver it from the cloud, we will. For example, we are looking at offering SD-WAN plus cloud security as a service along with creating other new solutions. We will also provide simplified end-to-end networking with security, reliability control, and automation, plus seamless on-ramp capabilities to the cloud that no one else can deliver. Moving to Security, we delivered another strong quarter of revenue growth driven by increasing adoption of our next generation cloud-based architectures, which can enable fast and secured access to applications and data from anywhere. With the rapid growth in modern applications and more distributed work environments, our customers are adopting new security architectures as identity and data privacy are increasingly critical. The recent SolarWinds breach only highlights the urgent need for advanced threat defense. Our comprehensive security portfolio offers simplified protection for any workload on any cloud while minimizing the attack surface and automating security policies across an organization's hybrid cloud footprint. This extends to our secure access service edge framework and Zero Trust architecture, where we have developed a best-in-class cloud delivered stack across Umbrella, secure internet gateway, Meraki SD-WAN and Viptela. We're also delivering leading unified detection and response capabilities built on Cisco SecureX, our cloud native platform. Over 5,400 customers are already seeing the benefits of this platform since it became generally available last June. We remain committed to delivering simple, integrated and highly effective end-to-end security solutions delivered on-prem and in the cloud. Turning to Applications which includes our collaboration portfolio, we're focused on building solutions that will enable an engaged, productive workforce and an intelligent workplace, built with secured collaboration, automation, and insights. Our aim is to deliver the best collaboration experience for our customers, no matter where they are. Our strong momentum with WebEx continued, resulting in double-digit revenue growth. I'm still proud of the work that WebEx team has done to ensure our nearly 600 million quarterly average users are able to stay connected and productive. In addition, we are connecting over 6 billion calls every month for our customers around the world. We are bringing incredible innovation to the collaboration market at an unprecedented pace. Our goal is to deliver a 10X better experience than just in-person interactions. At our recent WebexOne event, we introduced more than 50 new product and feature innovations, integrating security and privacy to deliver inclusive experiences. Some of the new powerful capabilities we announced include noise cancellation, real-time language translation, and our Webex Desk Pro series platforms. Our recently announced intent to acquire cloud-based IMImobile and Slido furthers our vision of building a WebEx suite of applications as we combine these technologies with our Webex Contact Center to improve customer interactions. In summary, our strategy is clear and our business remains strong. We are executing and innovating with speed and delivered solid results with our Q2 revenue coming in at the high-end and earnings coming in above our stated guidance. As we move into the gradual recovery phase, we believe our customers will continue to turn to Cisco as their partner of choice. I am so proud of what our teams have achieved. The incredible innovation and trusted partnerships we're building will serve us well in the years ahead. While the past year has highlighted far too many inequities in our society, we believe in the power of technology to drive more inclusivity and opportunity to underserved populations and communities around the world, which is why we are committed to powering an inclusive future for all. With our ongoing disciplined approach to investment and innovation, we expect to be in an even stronger position post-pandemic as our customers look to deploy their next generation networks at the heart of their organizations. I firmly believe Cisco is well positioned to capture the long-term growth opportunities ahead and win for years to come. I'll now turn it over to Scott, our new CFO to walk through our financial results. As you know, Scott has strong experience in software and a proven track record of leading successful business model transitions from perpetual licenses to SaaS and recurring subscriptions. Scott has proven to be a powerful addition to our team, and I'll look forward to partnering with him as we plan the next phase of Cisco's continued transformation Scott, over to you. Yes, Meta, thank you. I think that the \u2013 what we have been operating under is a premise that customers will probably begin to come back to the offices in \u2013 we had been thinking sort of mid to late summer. I think if you were watching the news this morning, you heard some of the New York companies say that they may be September. But I would suspect that as companies look to prepare their offices for the return, in our case, we've seen significant uptake in Wi-Fi 6, as an example, as they have begun to get ready for that return. We believe that that will require switching infrastructure as people come back to the office and begin to put load on those wireless networks. We also believe that every meeting in the future is going to be a hybrid meeting, even when people are back in the office. You'll have people in the office, and you'll have people remote. And in order to accommodate that, we suspect most of our customers will be putting video units in every conference room they have, which again will also accommodate the hybrid work model but will also drive bandwidth requirements which could lead to switching infrastructure. So that's the way we see it playing out over the next few months. And we would expect that with some of the solutions we have around worker safety and the collaboration portfolio and the Wi-Fi 6 build outs that we'll continue to see some progress from our customers as they prepare to return. And you, Jim. Thank you. Yes, Ittai, thank you. And, look, first of all I think that if you look at the customer segments, we saw improvement across Service Provider, Commercial and Public sector. And we saw improvement in Enterprise, although it's still negative year-over-year. But what I would tell you is, from a vertical industry perspective, we did see positive movement from industries that are not directly impacted by the pandemic. Think financial services. Think manufacturing. Think technical services. And then those that are still in the midst of the pandemic continue to struggle \u2013 hospitality, retail, transportation, energy. And so I think from that perspective, it gives us confidence that as we come out of this thing that those industries that are being depressed by the pandemic will obviously look to the future and will recover as well. So the other thing that we've reflected on is that when we came out of the 2008 crisis, we saw Commercial lead, and then Enterprise followed. And it's just been a really good sign that the U.S. Commercial business this past quarter grew 6% from an orders perspective, which I think is a nice bounce. And obviously it was 1% globally. But seeing that go positive gives us also confidence in the future of the Enterprise following. As it relates to the bigger picture, I think we talked a lot about giving our customers consumption flexibility. Earlier in my comments, I actually outlined six of the strategic pillars that we're all focused on. I'd say that we are super optimistic about the progress we've made in the web-scale space. We continue to deliver on our software revenues, which were $3.6 billion this quarter. And again, 76% of it coming from software, and I think that will only increase. So I think that those six pillars combined with more flexibility and consumption options for our customers and continued transition to software and a continued focus on web-scale and other growth opportunities is what we're trying to do over the next two to three years. Yes, exactly, high impact. So I think as you look at the as-a-service offerings, what we're going to do is take \u2013 we're taking intellectual property we have in our core enterprise portfolio, we're delivering a lot of that as both Cloud-delivered as well as Cloud-managed. Think about what we've done with the whole discussion we've had over the years about the Meraki platform and how we bring those capabilities to the rest of the portfolio, taking technologies like SD-WAN and Cloud Security and integrating those together and delivering those as a service, which, frankly, are uniquely capability \u2013 that's a unique capability that we have. And so I think those are areas where you'll see that continue to move forward. In addition to anything that we've sort of virtualized over the years, you can now deliver that as a service, anything that's pure software. So we're looking at every aspect of the portfolio. Yes. Thanks, Jeff. So let me start with the second one, the durability of the public sector. I think two comments on this one, clearly there is stimulus that's flowing in both in the U.S. and around the world and I think that'll continue for some period of time, obviously and that's certainly helping. But the other thing that I think has occurred over the last year is that countries have realized that they have to invest in infrastructure, and digital infrastructure and technology to be prepared for these sorts of crises in the future. So I think that notwithstanding stimulus, I think the spending we see post-pandemic will be greater than what we saw pre-pandemic. And in fact, some of these countries have come to the conclusion that they need to take more dependency on themselves and less on some of their allies given sort of what we've seen over the last few years and so they're beefing up their technology investments from that perspective. So I think net, once a stimulus goes out, I still think you see a positive segment for a few years to come. On the web-scale front, I'll just take a minute to explain, we actually gave more information today than we've given. And over the last few years, many of you have heard me say that this was a marathon and we got a lot of work to do. And what has become clear to me over the last five quarters is that, the work that our teams have put in over the last five years has begun to pay-off. And so this quarter we saw triple digit growth year-over-year in our web-scale portfolio. As I said in earlier comments the prior four quarters, I will tell you that the growth rates range from 17% to 74%. So it's been up for the last five quarters as we've talked about. From a portfolio perspective, you asked we're selling the 8000 series which we announced in December of 2019, we're winning 400 gig franchises. We are selling some silicon, we're selling our Catalyst 9000 and we're selling the rest of the portfolio as well. And so it's been pretty broad-based relative to what we are selling them, but we feel good about the investments we've made, the hard work we put in. And the last thing I'll tell you is that, the other question you're probably going to ask is how material it is from a size perspective. And I'll tell you that last quarter that we just finished, it was 25% of our service provider segment. And over the last four quarters, it's averaged 21% of that SP segment. So it's gotten to a point where it it's meaningful. So that's why we decided to give the additional information today. Again, this business much like the service provider business that we've talked about over the years we'll have \u2013 will be big deal driven, big customer driven. So it will have a tendency to be lumpy. But I think if you look at it over the course of four quarters, six quarters, eight quarters, it's going to be a \u2013 it should continue to be positive. Thanks. Hi Rod I'll take the first one. On the SP space, so yes, if you look at what we saw in the quarter from an order perspective, we saw a positive growth in cable, which represents about 15% of segment. We saw triple digit growth in web-scale, which is representing 25% of the segment. And then our telco business was down and that's roughly 60% of the business and primarily that is because where we are in the stages with 5G. We have roughly 35 customers around the world that were working on 5G solutions with mobile backhaul, with orchestration, with packet core. And so we're just early in that transition. And I think that particular sub-segment of SP will begin to show progress for us as we see the core backbone build-outs as we've been saying over the last few years. And the good news is we're seeing the backhaul stuff being built. We're seeing the packet core decisions get made, which means that the core network backbone decisions will be made. And the fact that we are being \u2013 having some positive success in a web-scale space would give me a high degree of confidence that those same products will bode well in the service provider space. So I think, this has been a tough segment for us for many, many years, and we're hopeful right now with the web-scale success and then with the 5G build outs underway that this could be a tailwind over the next few years for us. So Tal, I am going to ask for clarification on the second one before I start. So are you talking about in the enterprise space? Are you just or you're just talking about what do we feel good about from a product perspective over the next few quarters in general? Yes, got it. Okay. So on the Acacia thing, I think it's quite clear what occurred, we didn't have China approval, we thought we did, we didn't have it in time. So we renegotiated the price because our contract with them had expired and candidly the performance they put up in the 18 months between our original deal and this deal was pretty astounding, so the price was not was not out of the question. And then we subsequently got Chinese approval and I think Scott keep me honest, but I think they have to get shareholder approval and the proxies out. So we expect that should happen, it'll happen during Q3 Tal. So China approval is done, there's no more approvals to get. It's just up to the shareholder vote at this point. So we think that is in pretty good shape. On the on the second front, let me just run through the portfolio and I'll tell you sort of how I feel about everything right now. So I think, if you look at the Mass-Scale Infrastructure, the service provider portfolio, whatever you want to call it, where the 8000 is and some of the other stuff that's being built for 5G and for 400 gig, in the mass-scale data centers, I think that portfolio is in really good shape, and I would expect it to be a very positive contributor, not only over the next year but over the next two to three years. I think that there's if I look at the campus switching infrastructure, I think with customers begin to come back they are going to look at upgrading. We've seen \u2013 we saw significant growth last quarter in demand for WiFi 6. Just to give you a data point that we don't disclose anywhere, but we had \u2013 I think our orders for WiFi grew 20% last quarter. And what typically happens is that when you effectively put a lot of load on WiFi, like WiFi 6 is going to accommodate, it's going to require an underlying infrastructure upgrade to accommodate it. And when you add to that, the video load that will likely go on to these customers as they come back to the office and put video in every conference room and continue to use video the way they've used it during the pandemic. We think that that will also be a driver. So I think we have the Catalyst 9000 portfolio, the WiFi 6portfolio. We feel good about as well. The SD-WAN technology continues to move forward. We're seeing good growth there. And I think as we deliver that technology as a service integrated with our cloud security, I think that's going to be a differentiator for us. Within the security portfolio the teams are working on a couple of very differentiated tracks on strategy, I'd say that we need \u2013 I'd say we need another six months or so to see how that evolves, but I feel good about what they plan to do. Our current portfolio is performing well and they just need to execute. So we have to see that. I think the teams have done an amazing job on what they've brought forward with the WebEx platform. Again, you have to remember in the applications space, there's probably a view on that, when it's not performing the way you would think, you got to remember all the phones are included in that space too. So while WebEx was up double digits as Scott said. You've also got the drag of the handset business, that's in there as well. But I think the WebEx work and the pace of innovation, the feature velocity, the suite aspect that they're looking at I think the teams are doing a really good job. And I think over the next year, you'll see us actually, that portfolio will continue to improve and I think we have a chance to take share back. What did I miss? And then we're working on things like full stack observability which are somewhat nascent. We're working on our edge service strategy, which is somewhat nascent, but I feel like the team \u2013 I think the portfolio is in probably as good a shape as has been in awhile. And we just have to execute. Yes. I think that what we see across that portfolio is we had a really good quarter actually in network firewall and cloud security. So it was a good quarter across the board, across the portfolio. And I think what you'll see is that, we're in the early phases I think of any positive impact that you would see from a SolarWinds buildup, because most of the customers are going into assess like, where am I, what have I missed, what do I need, what caused me to miss what I missed, and then they're going to move from there. So I think we're sort of in the midst of that right now, with a lot of our customers doing those kinds of assessments. But, it's been from the early parts of the pandemic when we saw VPN technology being absorbed as much as we could possibly build and then the network firewall, and then combine that with the cloud security, it feels like customers are consuming whatever security they can consume right now to try to avoid those sorts of situations. So I would think that that will continue to be positive for us. All right. Scott, you want to take supply chain? Yes, I think that our teams are doing a good job on that of trying to buy ahead, trying to build inventory. And I think that there's certainly some unknowns and it's certainly complex. But I think the teams have done a pretty good job navigating, and it is built into the guide. On the Campus front, I think what I described is actually what I would expect for most customers. I think, Simon, the question you ask is a philosophical discussion that we have a lot in that when customers go back, what is it going to look like? Are more employees going to stay at home? Does that mean they're going to shrink their footprint? Does COVID stay with us? Do people now believe that they want to be, they want to maintain somewhat of a social distance in the office even post-COVID until we really get well beyond it? And does that mean that you need more footprint? What's the future of shared space? Are employees comfortable coming in and sitting in a shared space that someone else occupied the day before or do they want their own space when they come in so that they feel safe in it? And I think those are the kinds of things that we don't understand. But if I net it out, I don't think, personally \u2013 this my own opinion based on customer discussions and everything else. I don't think that some of the earlier beliefs in the pandemic where the early days is like no one is going to go back to the office because we're actually productive at home. I think we sort of moved into that phase where people actually struggle mentally. People are \u2013 they're not enjoying it. One of our employees said to me the other day, I don't mind the option of working from home. I don't like being forced to work from home. And so I really believe it's going to be hybrid, where people are going to work from home and everybody's sort of landing here where they're going to work from home three days a week and work from the office two days a week or vice versa. The question is what accommodations does that lead to for customers, based on employees' concern over space issues, concern over future pandemics or other concern. That's what we just don't know yet. But I do believe, based on what we've seen with Wi-Fi 6, that tells me customers are getting ready, and they're upgrading the wireless infrastructure now. And in the Commercial space, we've seen a fair amount of the follow-on with the switching, and hopefully we'll see that in the Enterprise space beyond this quarter. Tim, thanks. So on the Cat 9K, I think the way I would think about it is that the license \u2013 I think you're really asking about the renewal side of that piece, which in this fiscal year is \u2013 it's not significantly material. And I think I've said on a couple of calls before it's really good, the size it is this year because it gives us a chance to test our processes and our renewal value proposition and all that stuff because it's meaningful in fiscal 2022. So the teams are working hard right now to try to get ahead of that and be ready for it. On the Cloud front, what I would say is that when we announced in December of 2019 we had a launch, the future of the internet launch, we talked about that we would be \u2013 we would sell our customers systems, integrated systems. We would sell them silicon or we would sell them white boxes. I mean, I'm sorry, our software. And we have all three of those scenarios actually playing out right now. So we have customers who have standardized on our systems for 400 gig. We have customers who are testing our silicon and actually putting it in white boxes, which is what we would expect them to do. We have some customers running our software stack on their hardware. And the people we're competing with are, they would be quite evident to you, short of me calling them out. I think these are the traditional players that have been successful in that space, and we talked a lot back years ago about the fact that we missed the first wave and we were going to work hard to be in a position when the 400 gig transition occurred and try to work our way back in and earn that business back. And I think the teams have begun to do that. So I'm really proud of what they've done. There you are. Let me take the 5G. I think what you're seeing right now is most customers \u2013 most of our customers that are working on 5G, they've been building out the radio networks; they've been building out packet core capabilities; they've been building out mobile backhaul; and in many cases, they're running these hybrid 4G/5G backbones, with some exceptions where you have like a standalone 5G network that's been built. And in that case, what we participate in, in there with the packet core for sure, mobile backhaul, and some elements of orchestration. And what we believe is that over the next couple of years as these providers begin to build out a standalone 5G backbones and in many cases to serve up enterprise services that they will be making decisions on core upgrades to support the bandwidth and the traffic that's going to load those networks. And I think that's when we believe that we will see this \u2013 most of the benefit from the 5G build-out. So that's kind of where we are right now. And we're having good success in the areas that we participate based on where they are in the life cycle of these networks. Scott, you want to touch on the M&A question? All right. Just to wrap up, I want to thank everybody for spending time with us today and again, just hope that everybody stays safe as we work through what we're all hopeful is the beginning of the recovery. And I think that from a business perspective, we continue to feel like that is definitely the case; that we are in the midst of a recovery, which gives us a lot of optimism. I'm proud of what our teams have done. I'm proud of the innovation that we have built during this complicated time. And we have Cisco Live coming up at the end of March where there'll be a lot of innovation that we'll be announcing. And based on that and some of the performance that we see and the continued improvement in our business, I remain fairly optimistic about where we are right now as we come through this pandemic. So we'll look forward to talking to all of you on the next call. And, Marilyn, I'll turn it back over to you."

            "name": "Scott Herren",
            "content": "Thanks, Chuck. Let me start by saying how excited I am to join the Cisco team at such a pivotal time in the company's transformation. Before turning to our performance in the quarter, I thought I'd share my initial observations and key priorities. I'm impressed by the team here at Cisco and the progress the company has made on its transformation. Achieving the goals laid out three years ago of driving 50% of our revenue from software and services. It's also clear that leadership team is unified and focused, and that the strategies Chuck laid out earlier in the call will drive our growth over the next several years. It's an exciting time to be joining the company in this role. In terms of my key priorities, they include the following; driving profitable growth, a continued disciplined focus on financial management and operating efficiency, setting a long-term plan to maximize value creation through strategic transformation and examining investments, both organic and inorganic. I'm also committed to providing you the insight and metrics needed to understand and properly value our business longer term. Now let's turn to our results. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter, followed by the guidance for Q3. Our overall Q2 results reflect very good execution with strong margins and growth in non-GAAP net income and earnings per share in a continuing challenging environment. Total revenue of $12.0 billion came in at the top of our guidance range, flat year-over-year, as we see gradual recovery in several key product areas and sequential growth rate improvement in two out of three of our geographies. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 34.4%, up 70 basis points; non-GAAP net income was $3.4 billion up 2%, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.79 coming in above the high end of our guidance range and up 3% year-over-year. Now let me provide some more detail on our Q2 revenue. Total product revenue was $8.6 billion, down 1%, infrastructure platforms was down 3%. As a reminder, this is the product area most impacted by the COVID environment. Switching revenue was flat overall, we saw solid growth in data center switching with strong growth of the Nexus 9000, we also saw continued strong momentum of the Cat 9000 products within campus switching. Routing declined driven by weakness and service provider, wireless had solid growth driven by the continued ramp of our Wi-Fi 6 products and strengthened Meraki. Data center revenue declined driven primarily by servers, as we experienced continued market contraction. Applications was flat overall, we continue to see strong double-digit growth in Webex driven by our continuing product innovations and the criticality of remote working. This was offset by declines in Unified Communication and TP endpoints. Security was up 10% with growth across the portfolio. Our cloud security portfolio performed well with strong double-digit growth and continued momentum of our Duo and Umbrella offerings. Service revenue was up 2% driven by growth in our maintenance business, as well as solution support. And we continue to transform our business delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions. Software subscriptions were 76% of total software revenue, up 4 points year-over-year, as Chuck mentioned earlier. Remaining performance obligations or RPO at the end of Q2 were $28.2 billion, up 13%, RPO for product was up 17% and for service was up 10%. The continued growth in RPO demonstrates the strength of our portfolio of software and services and as another indicator of the broad recovery we see happening. In terms of orders in Q2, total product orders were up 1%, a significant improvement from Q1. Looking at our geographies, the Americas was down 1%, EMEA was up 7% and APJC was down 5%. Total emerging markets were down 14% with the BRICS plus Mexico down 11%. In our customer segments, public sector was up 10%, service provider was up 5% and commercial was up 1%, enterprise down 9%. Non-GAAP total gross margin was 66.9% up 50 basis points, product gross margins were 66.6% up 70 basis points and service gross margin was 67.9% up 20 basis points year-over-year. The growth in product gross margin was driven by positive product mix, including some software benefit and productivity improvements partially offset by pricing. In terms of the bottom line from a GAAP perspective, Q2 net income was $2.5 billion and earnings per share with $0.60. We ended Q2 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $30.6 billion up $600 million sequentially. Operating cash flow was $3 billion down 22% as expected, driven by a lower beginning receivables balance for the quarter, timing of payments and the restructuring payments. We expect operating cash flow growth to normalize over the course of the fiscal year. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $2.3 billion to shareholders during the quarter that was comprised of $1.5 billion for our quarterly dividends and $800 million of share repurchases. Year-to-date, we've returned $4.6 billion to shareholders, which represents 69% of our free cash flow. And today we announced the $0.01 increase to the quarterly dividend to $0.37 per share, up 3% year-over-year. This dividend increase reflects the 10th consecutive year of increasing our dividend and reinforces our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders and our confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. During Q2, we announced an amendment to the definitive merger agreement under which we previously agreed to acquire Acacia Communications. We expect to complete the Acacia acquisition in our fiscal Q3 subject to closing conditions, including Acacia stockholder approval. In addition, we announced our intent to acquire IMImobile, the cloud communications software and services company and Slido a provider of SaaS based solutions to enhance our Webex platform and our new cloud native contact center offerings. These investments are consistent with our strategy of complimenting our internal innovation and R&D with targeted M&A to allow us to further strengthen and differentiate our market position in our focus growth areas. To summarize, we executed well with strong margins and growth in non-GAAP net income and earnings per share growth. We're seeing returns on the investments, we're making an innovation and driving the continued shift to more software and subscriptions delivering long-term growth and shareholder value. Now, let me reiterate our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2021. This guidance is subject to the disclaimer regarding forward looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. Q3 does include an extra week, which occurs every five to six years. We've factored this extra week into our guidance for both revenue and expenses, although it's difficult to forecast the impact of the extra week, we have assumed roughly 2% to 3% year-over-year impact on total revenue growth, along with approximately $185 million of incremental cost of sales and operating expenses. The guidance for Q3 is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of 3.5% to 5.5% growth year-over-year, we anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 65% to 66%. The non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 33% to 34%, and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 19%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.80 to $0.82. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn, so we can move into the Q&A. Yes, thanks, Jim, for the question. And I think there's a couple things you have to bear in mind. Not only does the extra week in Q3 bring along with it additional revenue, it brings along additional spend as well. And we touched on this in the opening commentary. It's about $185 million. Our expectation is about $185 million of additional spend. Coming through, when you compare year-on-year coming through from last year, we also have comp plans reset. So as you'd expect, commissions and bonuses are on a different track this year than they were last year, and FX. The weakness of the dollar is having an effect on us as well. And so when you add those up, that's what drops through to the COGS and the OpEx line. We are on track, just to get ahead of maybe what your next question would have been. We're on track with the $1 billion of savings that we talked about through the restructuring. That continues to go well. Almost all of that is behind us at this point, but there are some year-on-year things there that are factoring into our spend rate for this year, for this coming quarter. Yes, thanks, Paul. The pricing mix was really in line with what we'd seen over the last several quarters. And you'll see this next week, obviously, in the Q, but I'll go ahead and give you the data point. It was 1.6% for the second quarter, slightly better actually than what we had seen in Q1 and actually modestly better than what we've seen over the trailing four quarters. So pricing mix was as expected during the second quarter. I think as you look longer-term, the gross margin is going to bounce around a little. It always does. I think part of what is factoring into our view of gross margin ahead is that the benefit of a greater mix of software and services in there being somewhat offset by some of the supply chain concerns that we have right now that I think you've seen, not just from us, but from everyone who is building products that contain a significant amount of semiconductors. So we're doing what you'd expect us to do on the supply chain front. We are contacting all of our key suppliers on that front. We're leveraging kind of the volume purchase that we have, extending that supply chain further out, all with a goal of ensuring we can protect customer shipments. So there's a little bit of a headwind coming in those lines from just the supply \u2013 the current supply chain. I think that's right. I mean, we've talked about growing the percent of our business, and you've seen Cisco do a really nice job of growing the percent of the business coming from software and services. And, obviously, that comes through at a higher margin. Thanks. Yes, again, Pierre, your model must go back to our fiscal 2006, because this was the highest gross margin we'd reported since second quarter of 2006. So you're right from that standpoint. And again, I would just in terms of where this goes longer-term, I expect there to be a little bouncing around over the next couple of quarters given some of the supply chain concerns that everyone that's building product based on semis. And a slight headwind still from memory. But I think everyone in the market is going to see that same set of trends. Longer-term, again, as we drive up the mix of software and services that should have a positive impact on gross margins. Hey, Pierre. It's Chuck. I'll take that one. And Scott is pretty proud of the immediate impact he had by delivering the record gross margins being here very short time. And Rod this is Scott on the FX impact. As you know in most markets we price in USD. So there's a limited impact from FX on the top line. But of course with the weaker dollar, we have employees worldwide and obviously you pay them in local currency. And so when you translate that back, it has a \u2013 it creates a bit of a headwind for us on the OpEx side. I'm hesitant to give you an exact figure on that, but just so you can understand the dynamics that's the way it works. And it has created a headwind for us during the second quarter. Yes, we didn't really see any impact on our ability to get product out the door during the second quarter. The team has stayed on top of the supply chain scenario, and it's been evolving, as you know, throughout the quarter. As we look ahead at Q3, that is something that is factored into our guide, both in our expectations on the top line and on the gross margin line. But it really hasn't been \u2013 in the second quarter at least, it hasn't been a significant headwind for us. Sure. Sami, we did have a couple of acquisitions that closed during the second quarter but they were both quite small. Strategically important but not meaningful in terms of adding to the Q3 guide, we've got some more meaningful ones that we do expect to close during the quarter. Obviously, Acacia would be meaningful. We've got IMImobile which we expect to close during the quarter, which will have some level of impact on the guide. Neither of those are factored in at this point. So as we get those closed \u2013 and at this point it's not exactly certain when they'll close, which is why they're not currently factored into the guide \u2013 as those close, we'll give you some insight into what our expectations are for them."

Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's first quarter of fiscal 2021 quarterly earnings conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chairman and CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. As is customary, in Q1, we have made certain reclassifications to prior-period amounts to conform to the current period's presentation. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties, including COVID-19 that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Form 10-K, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. With that, I'll now turn it over to Chuck.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks Marilyn. First, I want to start off by saying I hope everyone is safe and healthy. I also want to thank our employees for their dedication to our customers and their relentless focus on innovation. Cisco is off to a solid start in fiscal 2021. And I am proud of these results. Our teams are executing with excellence, and we continue to make steady progress on our shift to a software and subscription-driven model. We are encouraged by the signs of improvement in our business as we continue to navigate the pandemic and other macro uncertainties. Our focus is on winning with a differentiated innovation portfolio, long-term growth and being a trusted technology partner for our customers. Over the last few quarters, we've successfully adjusted to new demands by making necessary changes and shifts within our business. We remain closely aligned with our customers to provide them with the mission critical technology they need to stay resilient and move towards adopting new hybrid work models. In fact, we see many great opportunities ahead as every company in every industry is accelerating its digital first strategy. Our customers are rethinking how they support and serve their customers and their employees. They need speed, agility and simplicity. Many customers have shared with me that they are compressing years of work into just a few months. This is why we are driving new innovation that helps our customers connect, secure and automate their environments at a faster pace than ever before. With the right technology and tools, we can be even more effective and productive, and that's what we intend to deliver for our customers. Going forward, we are focused on building innovation that helps our customers and Cisco thrive in a hybrid cloud world. As we think about the next few years, there are six key areas we are focused on. First is delivering optimized application experiences for our customers. The application is the lifeline for all organizations and is increasingly how end users access their products and consume their services. Second is continuing to deliver the secure networking capabilities that Cisco is trusted for as a service, offering even greater simplicity and automation. The third area is focused on helping communications providers succeed with significant architectural transitions like 400 gig and 5G. These will be done with a combination of our software assets, silicon and optics capabilities, as well as complete integrated systems. We will deliver these technologies on-prem as well as from the cloud. Fourth is accelerating the future of work. As many enterprises look to adopt new hybrid work models with more remotely distributed workers than before, we are focused on helping them deliver consistent experiences, whether working remotely or in the office, from connectivity to collaboration, to security. Fifth is supporting our customers with their mission of securing everything they do. We will continue to deliver the end-to-end intelligent security architecture designed to keep their data private and their people secure. And the final area is around developing edge technologies that allow application developers to run distributed applications while securely accessing and managing distributed data. We believe that these key areas will drive our growth and success over the coming years. Now, let me share more on our Q1 results. As I mentioned earlier, we saw encouraging signs of improvement in certain areas of our business. Some large customers who are already in the midst of modernizing their infrastructure continue to do so, as we've seen with the ongoing success of the Catalyst 9000. Webex, our security solutions and business resiliency offers, also saw strong growth as our customers are trusting us with their most critical projects. We are succeeding in transforming our business model with 78% of our software revenue now sold as a subscription, and we saw double-digit growth in our deferred product revenue. As I mentioned on the last call, you will see us deliver more of our technology as a service to provide more choice and flexibility across our entire portfolio. Our new technology pipeline remains strong as we continue to accelerate our pace of innovation. At our recent Partner Summit, we introduced a number of new technology solutions that help our customers adapt, accelerate and simplify their operations through new agile automation platforms. Relative to our infrastructure platforms, our Cat 9K family of switches and Meraki cloud-based platforms continue to perform well, as our customers build highly-secure, resilient and scalable networks as the foundation for their digital strategies. Our customers are also increasingly running applications across multiple cloud environments, and this requires next-generation architectures with automation, security and insights. We recently announced new cloud and SD-WAN platform innovations to help our customers connect, secure and automate across their hybrid environments with greater visibility into their applications. We are making great strides with our web-scale customers with our fourth consecutive quarter of strong double-digit growth. This reflects their belief in our strategy going forward and their ongoing commitment to invest with us to build out their future architectures. We also continue to help our customers operate in a multi-cloud environment and optimize our overall cloud experience. In Q1, we extended these capabilities through Cisco's Cloud onRamp solutions, which deeply integrate cloud services from AWS, Google and Microsoft to better enable end-to-end visibility and manageability of their distributed applications. In security, we delivered another solid quarter of growth, driven by our broad cloud-native portfolio. SecureX, which offers a simplified security experience, saw strong adoption as it has been deployed across more than 4,000 organizations since it became globally available in June. As our customers' employees remain working from home, they are looking to bolster their existing security efforts with unified user and endpoint protection. We continue to benefit from the shift to cloud-based security capabilities and had robust growth in our secure remote worker offer that includes Duo, Umbrella and AnyConnect. Our customers are also looking for highly secure, high-speed, low-latency connectivity to the Internet. This is leading to the convergence of networking and security services in the cloud to securely connect any user or device to any application to provide the best experience. Our world-class security team recently delivered new innovations, including extended detection and response, Zero Trust and secure access services edge. By combining our leading solutions, SD-WAN and Umbrella with our new secure Internet gateway capabilities, our customers can deploy solutions to enable their users to simply and securely access cloud workloads and SaaS applications. Moving to our collaboration portfolio, business continuity and resiliency remain top of mind for our customers. Organizations are focused on creating flexible work environments to drive productivity, while ensuring that employees remain safe. The future of work will be a hybrid model with employees both in the office and at home, and we are leading in this area. Our collaboration portfolio is empowering organizations and teams to be more productive and secure as they adapt to new business, healthcare and learning models. We are providing seamless collaboration with anyone anywhere, while enabling consistent experiences for hybrid workplaces and continuing our leadership in security. Cisco Webex saw significant increased usage and solid adoption as customers look to us for a flexible work solution that also enables privacy and security. Whether at home or in the office, our customers need a solution that brings together meetings, calling, file sharing and messaging with a simple and highly secure user experience. Last month alone, Webex had nearly 600 million participants, almost double the number we had in March. We recently launched new return to office solutions that provide actionable workplace analytics with Webex Room Navigator and integrated collaboration device sensors that help ensure a safe working environment. We are also accelerating our innovation with new offerings such as Webex Legislate to keep critical functions of global governments running, along with capabilities like breakout rooms, virtual huddle spaces and noise cancellation. We are reimagining every aspect of the collaboration experience with built-in AI technology, security and integrated workflow applications to create a more intelligent work environment and to improve productivity. Lastly AppDynamics. Our customers are moving to highly distributed cloud-native applications, which require greater observability and insights. By combining AppDynamics and ThousandEyes, our cloud-based networking monitoring platform, we are delivering full stack observability to help our customers better manage their applications and improve their digital experiences through end-to-end visibility, deep insights and automated action. Now, I want to share more on our CFO transition. On our last call, I shared that our CFO, Kelly Kramer, had decided to retire from Cisco. Today, I'm excited that Scott Herren will be joining Cisco as our new Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer beginning December 18. Most recently, Scott served as the CFO for Autodesk. He brings an incredible background in software and helped lead Autodesk's successful business model transformation from perpetual licenses to SaaS and subscription software. As we continue our strong progress on our business model shift and sell more of our solutions as a service, Scott's depth of expertise in this area will help us accelerate our transition. He also has strong experience operating in complex global business environments at scale and a track record of profitable business growth, focused team building and prudent financial controls. I have no doubt that he will contribute to and foster the culture we are also proud of here at Cisco. I want to thank Kelly once again for being such a great partner and for the role she has played in our transition. We will certainly miss her, but we're very excited to have Scott this role and as part of our team. In summary, we are encouraged by the start to the year. I'm proud of our progress, both in our own transformation and in how we are empowering customers to accelerate their own digital strategies. We have a clear vision and strategy, and I feel very good about our portfolio and the innovation we are driving. Our customers want partners they can trust, as well as choice and flexibility in how they purchase, consume and implement technology based on their own individual needs. These anchors of trust, innovation and choice are core to who we are at Cisco. As we focus on growing our business, we remain guided by our purpose to power an inclusive future for all. We know that pervasive access to technology and connectivity directly impacts economic growth and enables key core human needs like healthcare and education. We know that technology can help solve some of the world's biggest challenges, and we are more committed than ever to building an inclusive future in which everyone can thrive. I'll now turn it over to Kelly.\nKelly Kramer: Thanks Chuck. I also want to congratulate Scott on his new role. I've had the chance to spend some time with him, and I am super excited. I think this is a very positive news for Cisco and he will be a great addition to the team. Also thanks to you, Chuck. It's been a great time working with you over the years. Now, let me provide a summary of our financial results for the quarter, followed by guidance for Q2. Our overall Q1 results reflect good execution with strong margins in a challenging environment. Total revenue was $11.9 billion, down 9% year-over-year. Our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 32.7%, down 0.9 points. Non-GAAP net income was $3.2 billion, down 11%, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.76, down 10%. Let me provide more detail on our Q1 revenue. Total product revenue was down 13% to $8.6 billion. Infrastructure Platforms was down 16%. As a reminder, this is a product area most impacted by the COVID environment. We saw declines across switching, routing, data center and wireless, driven primarily by the weakness we saw in the enterprise and commercial markets. We continue to see growth of the Cat 9K and the ramp of our Wi-Fi 6 products. Data center revenue declined, driven by servers. Applications was down 8%. We did continue to see strong growth in Webex with the importance of remote working. This was offset by declines and Unified Communications and TelePresence endpoints. Security was up 6%. Our cloud security portfolio performed well, with strong double-digit growth and continued momentum with our Duo and Umbrella offerings. Service revenue was up 2%, driven by growth in our maintenance business as well as support services. We continue to transform our business, delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions. Software subscriptions were 78% of total software revenue up 7 points year on year. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, at the end of Q1 were $27.5 billion, up 10%. RPO for product was up 15% and service was up 8%. The continued growth in RPO demonstrates the strength of our portfolio in software and services. In terms of orders in Q1, total product orders were down 5%. Looking at our geographies, the Americas was down 5%, EMEA was down 1% and APJC was down 14%. Total emerging markets were down 15% with the BRICS plus Mexico down 19%. In our customer segments, public sector was up 5%, enterprise was down 15%, commercial was down 8% and service provider was down 5%. From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q1 gross margin was 65.8%, down 0.1 points. Product gross margin was 65.3%, down 0.8 points and service gross margin was 67.1%, up 1.7 points year-over-year. In terms of the bottom line from a GAAP perspective, Q1 net income was $2.2 billion and EPS was $0.51. GAAP results include restructuring charges of $602 million related to the plan we announced in Q1. We ended Q1 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $30 billion. Operating cash flow was $4.1 billion, up 14%. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $2.3 billion to shareholders during the quarter that was comprised of $0.8 billion of share repurchases and $1.5 billion for our quarterly dividend. Let me reiterate our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal '21. This guidance is subject to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. We expect revenue to be in the range of flat to minus 2% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 64% to 65%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 32% to 33%. And the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 19%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.74 to $0.76. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks Kelly. While the operator is queuing the line for Q&A, I'd like to remind the audience as I do every quarter that we ask you to address one question only so we have adequate time to take as many questions as possible. Michelle, I'll turn it over to you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. You may go ahead.\nIttai Kidron: Hey, guys. Good to see some stability in the business. I guess a couple of things for me. Chuck, when you look at the enterprise orders quite significantly down, should we gather from your tone that you think that reverses? Where is the bottom on order patterns? And as you look through the rest of the fiscal year, is this the sequential improvement that you're looking for? And then, Kelly, just clarification on RPO. Can you tell us if duration -- how duration is changing? It's hard to reconcile this if the duration is changing from quarter to quarter.\nChuck Robbins: Hey, Ittai, thanks for the comments and the questions. So, on the enterprise side, I'm not too concerned about it, honestly. We had -- we did have some pretty significant compares from the year earlier, which contributed to that. But the thing that I would call out is, we saw a pretty significant improvement in our commercial orders. I think that we were minus 23 last quarter in the midst of the whole SMB meltdown that we knew was going on, and it was minus 8 this quarter. And I'll tell you, in the US, it was even a greater improvement from that. So, that gives us a fair amount of optimism. I think they enterprise thing is going to be fine. There is -- again, we just -- we had some compare issues that I think just resulted in the math, but I don't see anything that concerns me there.\nKelly Kramer: And on RPO, Ittai, the duration hasn't changed much since we started reporting this over a year ago. About half -- slightly more than half of the total balance will get recognized in the next 12 months and the rest is longer term.\nIttai Kidron: Very good. And it's been a pleasure, Kelly. Good luck going forward.\nKelly Kramer: Thank you, Ittai, appreciate it.\nMarilyn Mora: Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Paul Silverstein from Cowen & Co. You may go ahead, sir.\nPaul Silverstein: First of all, Kelly, I just wanted to thank you for your help over the years and wish you all good things going forward. In terms of questions, first off, Kelly, can you update us on what you're seeing in pricing environment? And the bigger question is, Chuck, the statements you just made in terms of improvement in commercial as well as enterprise, you've been talking for a while obviously about the benefit from remote work as well as the offset, the challenge presented by -- assuming we go back to the 21st century, there's going to be organizations that leave a certain percentage of the workforce at home and with fewer or smaller offices, headquarters, branch and remote workers in those offices, one would think that would be a challenge for switching and enterprise routing and wireless LAN access points. Any insight you can offer on that particular dynamic from a longer-term perspective?\nChuck Robbins: Yeah, let me take that first, and then, Kelly, can get to the pricing question. So, Paul, I think if you look at commercial, a lot of that recovery was actually driven by collaboration and security on a global basis. And so, we feel good about that. I think that we also talked about the Cat 9K continued to show strength with double-digit demand growth, and it -- and so, what we think is going to happen is when customers go back, they are going to ensure that they have robust infrastructure. They're going to need to deal with social distancing issues. We think that in our [cloud] [ph] portfolio, you're going to see customers put high definition video in every conference room. We have technology that we've built in that I've actually seen working this week, where we have sensors in the units that -- not only will you have high definition video, but we have sensors in the units that actually monitor how many people are in a room and you get warnings if you're exceeding whatever capacity the company has defined for that room. And so, we think that the safety aspect of it will be helpful, too. So I think it's still TBD on what really happens in this space because I think 90 days to 120 days ago, there was this belief that we were going to shut down every headquarters building in the world. And now, I think people know that it's going to be a balance going back. So we've got the Cat 9K and Wi-Fi 6, which is the future modern platforms that the Company has been moving to that continue to show strength. And so, while we have to wait and see, we're optimistic about it.\nPaul Silverstein: And Kelly, prices?\nKelly Kramer: Yeah, sure. On pricing -- and thanks for the kind words there, Paul. I appreciate it. On pricing, I'd say, our Q1 pricing is in our normal range from a product gross margin walk perspective. The rate impacts, the number that we usually talk about, it was down 1.8 points, which as you know, is in our normal kind of operating range. And just as a reminder, we've annualized all of the price increases we did a year ago for the list for tariffs. So now, this is kind of where we're stated. But I'm happy to see where we are this quarter on pricing. And even sequentially from Q4, it's better. So we're stable.\nPaul Silverstein: Thanks again. \nKelly Kramer: Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks Paul. Michelle, next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Rod Hall, you may go ahead -- from Goldman Sachs.\nRod Hall: Thanks for the question. I wanted to start off with the mismatch, I guess, in the order rate and the guide. Even at the top end of the guide, revenue is flat, but orders are down 5%. So I'm wondering if you guys could just kind of connect those two dots for us, help us understand why that is. And then, I know, Chuck, you said you're not that concerned by the enterprise orders. They did deteriorate quite a bit. Could you go into a little bit more detail on that? What is that -- even though those have deteriorated, you think it's just a short-term effect or kind of what's going on within that enterprise segment would be great? Thanks a lot.\nKelly Kramer: Yeah, the orders versus revenue, it's really just timing of when things are and whatnot. That's no different than I normally go through. We know what's coming off the balance sheet with all the software. We know what's in our backlog. So it's really just the year-over-year compares. So, I feel good about the guide and you're seeing that in there.\nChuck Robbins: Yeah. On the enterprise front, I think the real thing that I would point out is, there are just a couple of significant transactions. And we see -- in our pipeline, we see a robust pipeline right now. We see large transactions showing up again in the funnel, which is positive. And so, if you look at across the core infrastructure, enterprises are going to upgrade their core infrastructure. They're going to build out a robust on-prem collaborate -- I mean, on-prem meaning hardware video units when they go back into the offices because everyone -- every meeting is going to have remote attendees and you're going to have to have it in virtually every conference room. So that's positive. Everybody is moving to this WAN re-architecture with SD-WAN and cloud security. So I think it's -- the short answer is, Rod, it's largely a couple of big deals a year ago and we see the funnel strengthening. So it's -- that's what gives me the optimism looking forward.\nRod Hall: Okay. Thanks guys. Good working with you, Kelly.\nKelly Kramer: Thanks, Rod.\nMarilyn Mora: Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley Investment Research. You may go ahead.\nMeta Marshall: Great, thanks. Chuck. I just wanted to ask maybe how linearity was during the quarter? You were pretty downtrodden on the initial earnings call, heading into fiscal Q1. Just when did you start to see that uptick? And then, maybe just are customers needing to be back in the office in order to start thinking about orders or if they just accommodated and are starting to make orders whilst still remote? Thanks.\nChuck Robbins: Yeah. So I would say that when we did the last earnings call, we had seen actually good demand in the first couple of weeks of the quarter, but clearly it was a couple of weeks. And so, we -- it was not anything that would give us a trend. But it started -- the quarter started and it stayed -- it was very linear. It was not -- we saw decent performance from the beginning, and it stayed pretty consistent throughout. So, that was a good sign for us. And the -- I'm sorry, what was the second question?\nMeta Marshall: In terms of whether people were needing to physically be in the office in order to start thinking about orders.\nChuck Robbins: What I think has happened is, I think customers have come to grips with the fact that this thing is going to be with us for some period of time. Obviously, we're optimistic, like everybody else, some of the vaccines and some of the therapeutics and all will ultimately help. We're balancing that obviously with the current peaks that we're seeing all around the world. But I think customers just basically said, we're not sure when it's going to get better, but it's going to get better. And I can't sit around and do nothing. What I kind of was hopeful was going to happen, which I think we did see, is that we had customers who were super-focused on getting their employees working from home productively and getting their security set up. I think everyone raced to do that. And then, I think they took a pause, which is what we felt in our last quarter in orders. And then, I think they re-prioritized what they were going to be spending money on, and I think we started seeing some of that come back. And it's sort of exactly what I expected, but we needed to see it and we'll see if it continues. But we're all dealing with the same macro environment, everybody is, relative to this virus, but that's sort of how it played out. Any comments, Kelly, on the linearity?\nKelly Kramer: Yeah, very good linearity.\nMeta Marshall: Great, thanks. And nice working with you, Kelly.\nKelly Kramer: Thanks.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks Chuck. Thanks Kelly. Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Tim Long from Barclays. You may go ahead.\nTim Long: Thank you. I'll offer good luck to you, Kelly, as well. Just wanted to ask on the cloud vertical. Chuck, you mentioned kind of fourth quarter [indiscernible] strong. Can you just talk a little bit about what products you're seeing strength there and what kind of breadth across that customer base you're seeing that strength? And then just a quick follow-up, if you could, on the public sector being up. Anything specific or more sustainable to that vertical being one of the better performers? Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks Tim. Yeah, in the cloud vertical, the web scale space, I think what I've said historically is that we've been rebuilding these relationships and we began to see them buying our broader portfolio as a result of them believing in both the fact that we're going to be there with them and that we were investing in technology that was being built the way that they want to consume it and aligned to the architectures that they want to build. What I will tell you now is that last December, we had a launch where we talked about disaggregating our software, our hardware and that we would sell our silicon, our optics, we would sell our software stand-alone. We would sell integrated systems, whatever our customers wanted. And I can tell you that we had now won in the web scale space across every one of those facets. And so, we've seen really good progress. And I would say now, some of the new technologies that we built and had been testing and positioning are starting to show up very well in the accounts. So we're very pleased with that. On the -- and the pipeline looks very strong. So on the -- in fact, one of the comment on that, in the US, we saw service provider flat and that -- and a lot of that was strength in the MSDC web scale space. And in Europe, we saw high-teens growth and we saw really good MSDC web scale strength there as well. On the public sector, that was reasonably consistent around the world, and a lot of it was -- there was a lot of stimulus that was put in the system by lots of governments around the world. Our federal -- federal spending in the US was strong. We saw K through 12 building out a lot of infrastructure for -- while students were not there. And E-rate was strong for sure, and we think that will stay strong. And then, we saw some spending from the CARES Act in the local and municipal governments. But -- and the teams, we spent some time with the leader, particularly in US, this week. And I think he remains fairly bullish.\nTim Long: Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Jim Suva from Citigroup Investment Research. You may go ahead, sir.\nJim Suva: Thank you. And Kelly, you will truly be missed. Please keep in touch. For either Chuck or Kelly, can you help us reconcile or bridge the gap between -- public sector orders were up 5%. Enterprise was down 15%. Why would one be so much stronger than the other? So I look back on the year-over-year comps, and last year, enterprise orders were down 7% and public sector was flattish. So we actually have comps that don't explain it either. So can you just explain, are there different purchasing decisions because everyone has been affected in the world by COVID. So if you can just help us kind of reconcile that a little bit, that'd be great.\nChuck Robbins: Well, I think a lot of it's what I just described, right? Public sector around the world saw a lot of stimulus. And in the US in particular, we saw strength and we saw everything from Department of Defense spending to the local municipal spending. States were slightly weak, but the federal government was good. Local was good. E-rate kicked in. The new E-rate program kicked in, Jim, which contributes a lot when that gets going. And that's sort of early in its next wave. And so -- and then, we just had -- there was strength in public sector in Germany. And so, I think it was just more consistency basically. And outside the US, obviously, some healthcare. Inside the US too, there's a lot of healthcare in there in public sector, particularly outside the US.\nJim Suva: Thank you so much for the details and clarifications, Chuck, and bye-bye, Kelly. Thank you.\nKelly Kramer: Thanks, Jim.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Jim.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks Jim. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Tal Liani from Bank of America. You may go ahead, sir. Analyst\nTal Liani: Hi guys. I'm trying to reconcile your comments to your numbers. Last quarter, you sounded pretty downbeat, highlighting some issues. This quarter, you sound a lot better. But on the -- and you talk about growth initiatives. On the other hand, I look at your numbers, infrastructure platforms are down 16% year-over-year, 15.9%, let's say 16%. And it's worse than all of your competitors. If I just look at switching and routing and Juniper and Arista, on a global basis, without getting into details of the composition, you're down more than they are. And the question is, why is it down so much versus competition? Do you feel that there is also share issues, market share shift issues? Can you give us some context about areas where you feel that you're growing share, maintaining share and areas where you see some challenges?\nChuck Robbins: Yeah, I'll give you my quick perspective, Tal, and then Kelly can add to it. If you look at what really drove that, it was compute, and a lot of it is sort of the pricing that came through compute, which neither of those competitors you mentioned have. Also just the exposure to data center campuses this past quarter we talked about, the broader exposure we have I think would be the two things that I would call out. Kelly, you have anything to add?\nKelly Kramer: The only other thing I would call it is some of those companies that you mentioned have different compares than we do from a year ago as well. But Chuck hit it right. Again, data center or the compute business has a big impact due to the DRAM pricing [indiscernible] pricing down, and that hurts, and then again the campus stuff.\nTal Liani: Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks Tal. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Amit Daryanani from Evercore. You make good, sir.\nAmit Daryanani: Yeah. Thanks for taking my question, guys. I guess, my question is really on the top line guide. And Chuck, as I think about the Jan. quarter expectation of sales being flat year-over-year versus I think what you've seen in the last few quarters of down 10%, 11%, I think skeptics would say, well, your compares are easy, which mathematically they are, but it would be helpful to understand what do you think are the top two, three vectors that's driving this improved revenue trajectory in Jan. and to the extent you can touch on the durability of these metrics as we go forward, that would be helpful.\nChuck Robbins: Do you want it, Kelly?\nKelly Kramer: Yeah, I'll start and you can add. I'd just say this, again, back to the earlier point, we have been consistently shifting the revenue mix. So, as you see every quarter and you can see it in our RPO, we are getting more and more of our revenue coming off the balance sheet with the software mix. We have continued to make progress, as you can see, on the services side. For services, it's still growing for us. And software and services together have become a much bigger part of our portfolio. So, that benefits us on the revenue guide. In terms of strength that we see, yes, this Q1 revenue, though it'd still a tough Q1, we feel better about what we see in the orders profile. And again, the growth drivers are the same growth that Chuck talked about. We see real momentum and collaboration on the Webex side. We see real momentum in security. And we're just -- I mean, that's kind of what is driving. I don't know, Chuck would add anything else.\nChuck Robbins: And I think also the web scale and the service provider, 5G build-outs, we feel like those are going to continue. But the short-term guide is a combination of what's coming off -- out of the RPO, what's in backlog and then we obviously assess the forecasts that the teams put forward and then we put the Kelly and Chuck factor on it. So it is -- and it is math to some extent, but I think that some of the things that we talked about earlier, the things that have given us -- it's hard to say super-optimistic because the numbers still aren't where we want them to be. But relative to where we were 90 days ago and how we felt or the uncertainty that we felt, we certainly feel like we have a little more visibility now.\nAmit Daryanani: Perfect. Thanks on a nice quarter, guys. And best of luck. Kelly.\nKelly Kramer: Thank you very much.\nMarilyn Mora: Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. You may go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Chuck, in your prepared remarks, you outlined kind of six focus areas as you align the business to where you're seeing customer demand come back. If you can share how you're thinking about it relative to kind of investing organically versus where you might kind of need M&A to fill in those priorities? And just, I didn't hear in your prepared remarks anything in relation to plans about like having hardware as a service, as some of your peers are trying. So like what are your updated thoughts? What are you seeing in terms of customer demand for those kind of models?\nChuck Robbins: That's a great question. So I think on the organic versus inorganic, I should probably clarify that our strategy there hasn't changed. And I think my comments were either misstated or misconstrued last time and some folks thought that we were thinking about some significantly larger acquisition strategy. Our acquisition strategy hasn't changed, just to be clear. But we'll use a combination. I would say that right now, there -- we are probably at the peak of internal innovation that we've -- that I've seen for a long time. If you look at the platform play, the work that our service provider, Mass-Scale Infrastructure Group, is doing and some of the wins we're seeing there, the 5G backhaul and packet core wins that we're seeing and the, at least, architectural progress we're making whenever our service provider customers start building out their 5G core standalone infrastructure, we feel good about where we are. So it'll be a combination of both and -- but again, it hasn't changed. As you think about it as a service, I do want to delineate between this because there is this offer in the marketplace today from some of our competitors around consumption-based as a service, and that's largely around compute. And so, you'll see us with a similar offer, but more of what I'm talking about is looking at what aspects of our intellectual property, can we pull, can we integrate together and can we deliver as a cloud service? So I'm not necessarily talking about selling Ethernet switch ports one port at a time. We're really talking about delivering our core intellectual property. Example, take SD-WAN, cloud security, secure Internet Gateway and deliver that capability for our customers as a service in the future, which is high value, very differentiated, those are kinds of things we're thinking -- that we're working through right now. And you'll see those kind of offers come out from us over the next 3, 6, 9, 12 months.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay, got it. Very helpful. Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks Chuck. Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. You may go ahead.\nMarilyn Mora: Aaron, we can't hear you.\nAaron Rakers: Sorry about that. I was on mute. Congrats on the quarter, and also good luck, Kelly. I guess my question is building on the last question. As we think about the CFO announcements and we think about subscription now being 78% of the software revenue, how do we think about the progression of deepening subscription across the product portfolio? And how do we think about the renewal cycle of those subscriptions as we move forward? Thank you. A - Chuck Robbins It's a good question. So I think you're going to see us continue to add more software assets, both organically and inorganically as -- and most all of those solutions are sold as a service. So I think you'll see increases from that perspective. I think that you'll see -- on the renewal front, we have a focused effort right now. I think if you look at our core portfolio where we drove mandatory subscriptions, the first meaningful renewal cycle comes about a year from now or middle of next year, and our teams are working on that right now as we speak. We currently have renewal motions in place across collab and across security, etc. So I think what I would say is that we'll be looking at more and more of our technology being delivered from the cloud and as a service. So you'll see that contribute to it as well. And we're just going to continue to move forward, and I would say, you're going to continue to see software and services tick up as a percentage of our overall business going forward.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks Aaron. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Simon Leopold from Raymond James & Associates. You may go ahead, sir.\nSimon Leopold: Thank you much for taking the question. Kelly, also send my congratulations on wherever you go next, and thanks for the help. In terms of question, I wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about the maturity of the campus refresh in terms of the opportunity in front of you for the Cat 9K, as well as whether you're seeing a benefit from renewals on DNA subscriptions. I assume you're sort of coming up on that first round of three-year subscriptions coming due. If you could elaborate on those two? Thanks.\nChuck Robbins: Yeah. Thanks Simon. I would say on the campus refresh, when you look at Wi-Fi 6, you look at the Cat 9K stuff, we're still early on, honestly. And there is -- we have a large installed base out there. And so, that's a multi-year transition that we expect will go on for some period of time going forward. On the DNA renewal stuff, that's what I was telling Meta [ph] earlier that really it is -- the first real wave of it hits sometime in '21 because if you remember, we launched that in -- I think we announced that in the summer of 2017. Kelly, is that right? And so that was a beginning of fiscal '18.\nKelly Kramer: Yes.\nChuck Robbins: And so, when we get to the end of fiscal '21 -- and you had a lot of early adopters, and we didn't hit scale till sort of the middle of next year. So, you're really talking about getting into FY '22 when we'll start to see that come about.\nSimon Leopold: Great, that's helpful. Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you, James Fish from Piper Sandler. You may go ahead, sir.\nJames Fish: Thanks for the question, and congrats again on the retirement, Kelly. We're starting to see signs of 5G core spending and, Chuck, you alluded to it on the call and also more about the desire for OpenRAN. Hoping Cisco enable more the OpenRAN infrastructure, what are you guys hearing about timing for 5G core spending in terms of materiality, now that the first mid-band spectrum auction is through and the second is coming up? And how are you feeling about the products set across infrastructure competitively for 5G? Thanks.\nChuck Robbins: Well, Jim, I would say the active ORAN projects around the world, we are deeply in the middle of and have actually seen a lot of benefit from one in Japan and there is a couple of others going on in other places. And we're in the midst -- we're in the middle of the packet core side of it. We're in the middle of backhaul. We're in the middle of infrastructure to support it. We're in the middle of orchestration layers. And so our teams continue to work on building out our overall stack for how we're playing that OpenRAN space over time. As it relates to the 5G stuff, you're right, where we are seeing benefit today is we're winning a lot of backhaul opportunities. We're winning a lot of packet core. I think we had seven more wins between those two in the last quarter. And I would say, the core standalone build-outs are going to largely be dependent upon the enterprise service delivery that we've talked about historically, and I still think that's probably -- I think we're starting to see some early stuff going on around the world. But I think in earnest, I would say that's going to be -- notwithstanding pandemic and everything else, it's probably going to be starting middle of next year, and it will take several years. But again, there's a lot of variables that can move that either way.\nJames Fish: Understood. Thanks Chuck.\nMarilyn Mora: Okay. We have time for one more question. Michelle, can you [indiscernible] the last question?\nOperator: Thank you. Sami Badri from Credit Suisse. You may go ahead.\nSami Badri: Thank you very much for fitting me in. I just wanted to touch up a little bit on the public sector order strength. Is this something that can consistently be growing from a product orders and strength perspective in at least the upcoming quarter? Or was it just strong this quarter because the government's fiscal year closed in the September quarter, and therefore, there was a big uptick offsetting some of the dynamics? And then just as a kind of a follow-up here, is there -- have you guys been able to go through the commercial and the federal segments and determine whether CARES funding or stimulus funding was able to fund some of the reversals and dynamics that you guys saw in the quarter, and then that essentially lead to a better guide than what consensus was modeling? If your could fit those two questions in, that will be great thanks.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks Sami. I'd say on public sector, we feel pretty good about it actually. And when we talk to our leaders around the world, that is one area that is pretty consistent that most of them feel pretty good about and particularly in the US where it's a big piece of the business regardless of administration. It's -- there's different priorities, but they're all dependent upon tech, and so that's good. On the commercial and federal segments, I think what I would say is it -- I would say in commercial, I would assume that there was some aspect of that. But I think looking at the collaboration and security spending. I think just a lot of those mid-size enterprises were really just putting themselves in a position to continue operating in this new world we're living in right now as much as anything. I'm not sure it's significant. I'll let Kelly comments if she thinks, but we did have a comment that I made earlier that our federal team did say that the stimulus was positive, E-rate was positive. And then we saw some local muni buying that was -- they felt like was -- and the customers were telling was connected to the CARES Act, and that's probably the extent of what I've heard on this.\nKelly Kramer: And we heard -- we also heard that, from the European team, they've [ph] got a lot of benefit from the stimulus. And again, when I look at the orders within public sector globally, again, a ton [ph] of it is in getting this -- it's in securities and collaborations are working from home, doing school from home and like Chuck said, the K through 12 education globally is very favorable.\nSami Badri: Got it. Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks Sami. Chuck, I'll turn it over to you for last comments.\nChuck Robbins: Yeah, I think, first thing I'll say is that I'm really proud of our team and how hard they're working and how committed they are to our customers and making sure that we're taking care of them during these complex times. And obviously, we're trying to take care of our employees during these complex times. But I really want to just focus on thanking Kelly. It's been an incredible partnership. We've had a lot of fun, and I think that there's a lot of love in the investor community for you. We're going to miss you. But we are excited about Scott. But Kelly, thanks for everything you've done.\nKelly Kramer: I appreciate it, Chuck. It's been great working with you. And again, I do appreciate everybody in this industry and it's been a great relationship. But. Scott, I think it's great that Scott coming. He is going to be fantastic for the Company. But thanks for everything, Chuck.\nChuck Robbins: And Kelly actually helped us make that choice. So you guys can feel good that she helped us with the candidates and was very very supportive on Scott's -- on the decision for Scott. So thank you all for joining us today and we'll look forward to talking to you again next quarter.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks Chuck. Thanks Kelly. So in closing, Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call, which will reflect our fiscal 2021 second quarter results, will be on Tuesday, February 9, 2021 at 1:30 PM Pacific Time, 4:30 PM Eastern Time.

            "name": "Kelly Kramer",
            "content": "Thanks Chuck. I also want to congratulate Scott on his new role. I've had the chance to spend some time with him, and I am super excited. I think this is a very positive news for Cisco and he will be a great addition to the team. Also thanks to you, Chuck. It's been a great time working with you over the years. Now, let me provide a summary of our financial results for the quarter, followed by guidance for Q2. Our overall Q1 results reflect good execution with strong margins in a challenging environment. Total revenue was $11.9 billion, down 9% year-over-year. Our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 32.7%, down 0.9 points. Non-GAAP net income was $3.2 billion, down 11%, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.76, down 10%. Let me provide more detail on our Q1 revenue. Total product revenue was down 13% to $8.6 billion. Infrastructure Platforms was down 16%. As a reminder, this is a product area most impacted by the COVID environment. We saw declines across switching, routing, data center and wireless, driven primarily by the weakness we saw in the enterprise and commercial markets. We continue to see growth of the Cat 9K and the ramp of our Wi-Fi 6 products. Data center revenue declined, driven by servers. Applications was down 8%. We did continue to see strong growth in Webex with the importance of remote working. This was offset by declines and Unified Communications and TelePresence endpoints. Security was up 6%. Our cloud security portfolio performed well, with strong double-digit growth and continued momentum with our Duo and Umbrella offerings. Service revenue was up 2%, driven by growth in our maintenance business as well as support services. We continue to transform our business, delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions. Software subscriptions were 78% of total software revenue up 7 points year on year. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, at the end of Q1 were $27.5 billion, up 10%. RPO for product was up 15% and service was up 8%. The continued growth in RPO demonstrates the strength of our portfolio in software and services. In terms of orders in Q1, total product orders were down 5%. Looking at our geographies, the Americas was down 5%, EMEA was down 1% and APJC was down 14%. Total emerging markets were down 15% with the BRICS plus Mexico down 19%. In our customer segments, public sector was up 5%, enterprise was down 15%, commercial was down 8% and service provider was down 5%. From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q1 gross margin was 65.8%, down 0.1 points. Product gross margin was 65.3%, down 0.8 points and service gross margin was 67.1%, up 1.7 points year-over-year. In terms of the bottom line from a GAAP perspective, Q1 net income was $2.2 billion and EPS was $0.51. GAAP results include restructuring charges of $602 million related to the plan we announced in Q1. We ended Q1 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $30 billion. Operating cash flow was $4.1 billion, up 14%. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $2.3 billion to shareholders during the quarter that was comprised of $0.8 billion of share repurchases and $1.5 billion for our quarterly dividend. Let me reiterate our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal '21. This guidance is subject to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. We expect revenue to be in the range of flat to minus 2% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 64% to 65%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 32% to 33%. And the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 19%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.74 to $0.76. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A. And on RPO, Ittai, the duration hasn't changed much since we started reporting this over a year ago. About half -- slightly more than half of the total balance will get recognized in the next 12 months and the rest is longer term. Thank you, Ittai, appreciate it. Yeah, sure. On pricing -- and thanks for the kind words there, Paul. I appreciate it. On pricing, I'd say, our Q1 pricing is in our normal range from a product gross margin walk perspective. The rate impacts, the number that we usually talk about, it was down 1.8 points, which as you know, is in our normal kind of operating range. And just as a reminder, we've annualized all of the price increases we did a year ago for the list for tariffs. So now, this is kind of where we're stated. But I'm happy to see where we are this quarter on pricing. And even sequentially from Q4, it's better. So we're stable. Thank you. Yeah, the orders versus revenue, it's really just timing of when things are and whatnot. That's no different than I normally go through. We know what's coming off the balance sheet with all the software. We know what's in our backlog. So it's really just the year-over-year compares. So, I feel good about the guide and you're seeing that in there. Thanks, Rod. Yeah, very good linearity. Thanks. Thanks, Jim. The only other thing I would call it is some of those companies that you mentioned have different compares than we do from a year ago as well. But Chuck hit it right. Again, data center or the compute business has a big impact due to the DRAM pricing [indiscernible] pricing down, and that hurts, and then again the campus stuff. Yeah, I'll start and you can add. I'd just say this, again, back to the earlier point, we have been consistently shifting the revenue mix. So, as you see every quarter and you can see it in our RPO, we are getting more and more of our revenue coming off the balance sheet with the software mix. We have continued to make progress, as you can see, on the services side. For services, it's still growing for us. And software and services together have become a much bigger part of our portfolio. So, that benefits us on the revenue guide. In terms of strength that we see, yes, this Q1 revenue, though it'd still a tough Q1, we feel better about what we see in the orders profile. And again, the growth drivers are the same growth that Chuck talked about. We see real momentum and collaboration on the Webex side. We see real momentum in security. And we're just -- I mean, that's kind of what is driving. I don't know, Chuck would add anything else. Thank you very much. Yes. And we heard -- we also heard that, from the European team, they've [ph] got a lot of benefit from the stimulus. And again, when I look at the orders within public sector globally, again, a ton [ph] of it is in getting this -- it's in securities and collaborations are working from home, doing school from home and like Chuck said, the K through 12 education globally is very favorable. I appreciate it, Chuck. It's been great working with you. And again, I do appreciate everybody in this industry and it's been a great relationship. But. Scott, I think it's great that Scott coming. He is going to be fantastic for the Company. But thanks for everything, Chuck."

            "name": "Chuck Robbins",
            "content": "Thanks Marilyn. First, I want to start off by saying I hope everyone is safe and healthy. I also want to thank our employees for their dedication to our customers and their relentless focus on innovation. Cisco is off to a solid start in fiscal 2021. And I am proud of these results. Our teams are executing with excellence, and we continue to make steady progress on our shift to a software and subscription-driven model. We are encouraged by the signs of improvement in our business as we continue to navigate the pandemic and other macro uncertainties. Our focus is on winning with a differentiated innovation portfolio, long-term growth and being a trusted technology partner for our customers. Over the last few quarters, we've successfully adjusted to new demands by making necessary changes and shifts within our business. We remain closely aligned with our customers to provide them with the mission critical technology they need to stay resilient and move towards adopting new hybrid work models. In fact, we see many great opportunities ahead as every company in every industry is accelerating its digital first strategy. Our customers are rethinking how they support and serve their customers and their employees. They need speed, agility and simplicity. Many customers have shared with me that they are compressing years of work into just a few months. This is why we are driving new innovation that helps our customers connect, secure and automate their environments at a faster pace than ever before. With the right technology and tools, we can be even more effective and productive, and that's what we intend to deliver for our customers. Going forward, we are focused on building innovation that helps our customers and Cisco thrive in a hybrid cloud world. As we think about the next few years, there are six key areas we are focused on. First is delivering optimized application experiences for our customers. The application is the lifeline for all organizations and is increasingly how end users access their products and consume their services. Second is continuing to deliver the secure networking capabilities that Cisco is trusted for as a service, offering even greater simplicity and automation. The third area is focused on helping communications providers succeed with significant architectural transitions like 400 gig and 5G. These will be done with a combination of our software assets, silicon and optics capabilities, as well as complete integrated systems. We will deliver these technologies on-prem as well as from the cloud. Fourth is accelerating the future of work. As many enterprises look to adopt new hybrid work models with more remotely distributed workers than before, we are focused on helping them deliver consistent experiences, whether working remotely or in the office, from connectivity to collaboration, to security. Fifth is supporting our customers with their mission of securing everything they do. We will continue to deliver the end-to-end intelligent security architecture designed to keep their data private and their people secure. And the final area is around developing edge technologies that allow application developers to run distributed applications while securely accessing and managing distributed data. We believe that these key areas will drive our growth and success over the coming years. Now, let me share more on our Q1 results. As I mentioned earlier, we saw encouraging signs of improvement in certain areas of our business. Some large customers who are already in the midst of modernizing their infrastructure continue to do so, as we've seen with the ongoing success of the Catalyst 9000. Webex, our security solutions and business resiliency offers, also saw strong growth as our customers are trusting us with their most critical projects. We are succeeding in transforming our business model with 78% of our software revenue now sold as a subscription, and we saw double-digit growth in our deferred product revenue. As I mentioned on the last call, you will see us deliver more of our technology as a service to provide more choice and flexibility across our entire portfolio. Our new technology pipeline remains strong as we continue to accelerate our pace of innovation. At our recent Partner Summit, we introduced a number of new technology solutions that help our customers adapt, accelerate and simplify their operations through new agile automation platforms. Relative to our infrastructure platforms, our Cat 9K family of switches and Meraki cloud-based platforms continue to perform well, as our customers build highly-secure, resilient and scalable networks as the foundation for their digital strategies. Our customers are also increasingly running applications across multiple cloud environments, and this requires next-generation architectures with automation, security and insights. We recently announced new cloud and SD-WAN platform innovations to help our customers connect, secure and automate across their hybrid environments with greater visibility into their applications. We are making great strides with our web-scale customers with our fourth consecutive quarter of strong double-digit growth. This reflects their belief in our strategy going forward and their ongoing commitment to invest with us to build out their future architectures. We also continue to help our customers operate in a multi-cloud environment and optimize our overall cloud experience. In Q1, we extended these capabilities through Cisco's Cloud onRamp solutions, which deeply integrate cloud services from AWS, Google and Microsoft to better enable end-to-end visibility and manageability of their distributed applications. In security, we delivered another solid quarter of growth, driven by our broad cloud-native portfolio. SecureX, which offers a simplified security experience, saw strong adoption as it has been deployed across more than 4,000 organizations since it became globally available in June. As our customers' employees remain working from home, they are looking to bolster their existing security efforts with unified user and endpoint protection. We continue to benefit from the shift to cloud-based security capabilities and had robust growth in our secure remote worker offer that includes Duo, Umbrella and AnyConnect. Our customers are also looking for highly secure, high-speed, low-latency connectivity to the Internet. This is leading to the convergence of networking and security services in the cloud to securely connect any user or device to any application to provide the best experience. Our world-class security team recently delivered new innovations, including extended detection and response, Zero Trust and secure access services edge. By combining our leading solutions, SD-WAN and Umbrella with our new secure Internet gateway capabilities, our customers can deploy solutions to enable their users to simply and securely access cloud workloads and SaaS applications. Moving to our collaboration portfolio, business continuity and resiliency remain top of mind for our customers. Organizations are focused on creating flexible work environments to drive productivity, while ensuring that employees remain safe. The future of work will be a hybrid model with employees both in the office and at home, and we are leading in this area. Our collaboration portfolio is empowering organizations and teams to be more productive and secure as they adapt to new business, healthcare and learning models. We are providing seamless collaboration with anyone anywhere, while enabling consistent experiences for hybrid workplaces and continuing our leadership in security. Cisco Webex saw significant increased usage and solid adoption as customers look to us for a flexible work solution that also enables privacy and security. Whether at home or in the office, our customers need a solution that brings together meetings, calling, file sharing and messaging with a simple and highly secure user experience. Last month alone, Webex had nearly 600 million participants, almost double the number we had in March. We recently launched new return to office solutions that provide actionable workplace analytics with Webex Room Navigator and integrated collaboration device sensors that help ensure a safe working environment. We are also accelerating our innovation with new offerings such as Webex Legislate to keep critical functions of global governments running, along with capabilities like breakout rooms, virtual huddle spaces and noise cancellation. We are reimagining every aspect of the collaboration experience with built-in AI technology, security and integrated workflow applications to create a more intelligent work environment and to improve productivity. Lastly AppDynamics. Our customers are moving to highly distributed cloud-native applications, which require greater observability and insights. By combining AppDynamics and ThousandEyes, our cloud-based networking monitoring platform, we are delivering full stack observability to help our customers better manage their applications and improve their digital experiences through end-to-end visibility, deep insights and automated action. Now, I want to share more on our CFO transition. On our last call, I shared that our CFO, Kelly Kramer, had decided to retire from Cisco. Today, I'm excited that Scott Herren will be joining Cisco as our new Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer beginning December 18. Most recently, Scott served as the CFO for Autodesk. He brings an incredible background in software and helped lead Autodesk's successful business model transformation from perpetual licenses to SaaS and subscription software. As we continue our strong progress on our business model shift and sell more of our solutions as a service, Scott's depth of expertise in this area will help us accelerate our transition. He also has strong experience operating in complex global business environments at scale and a track record of profitable business growth, focused team building and prudent financial controls. I have no doubt that he will contribute to and foster the culture we are also proud of here at Cisco. I want to thank Kelly once again for being such a great partner and for the role she has played in our transition. We will certainly miss her, but we're very excited to have Scott this role and as part of our team. In summary, we are encouraged by the start to the year. I'm proud of our progress, both in our own transformation and in how we are empowering customers to accelerate their own digital strategies. We have a clear vision and strategy, and I feel very good about our portfolio and the innovation we are driving. Our customers want partners they can trust, as well as choice and flexibility in how they purchase, consume and implement technology based on their own individual needs. These anchors of trust, innovation and choice are core to who we are at Cisco. As we focus on growing our business, we remain guided by our purpose to power an inclusive future for all. We know that pervasive access to technology and connectivity directly impacts economic growth and enables key core human needs like healthcare and education. We know that technology can help solve some of the world's biggest challenges, and we are more committed than ever to building an inclusive future in which everyone can thrive. I'll now turn it over to Kelly. Hey, Ittai, thanks for the comments and the questions. So, on the enterprise side, I'm not too concerned about it, honestly. We had -- we did have some pretty significant compares from the year earlier, which contributed to that. But the thing that I would call out is, we saw a pretty significant improvement in our commercial orders. I think that we were minus 23 last quarter in the midst of the whole SMB meltdown that we knew was going on, and it was minus 8 this quarter. And I'll tell you, in the US, it was even a greater improvement from that. So, that gives us a fair amount of optimism. I think they enterprise thing is going to be fine. There is -- again, we just -- we had some compare issues that I think just resulted in the math, but I don't see anything that concerns me there. Yeah, let me take that first, and then, Kelly, can get to the pricing question. So, Paul, I think if you look at commercial, a lot of that recovery was actually driven by collaboration and security on a global basis. And so, we feel good about that. I think that we also talked about the Cat 9K continued to show strength with double-digit demand growth, and it -- and so, what we think is going to happen is when customers go back, they are going to ensure that they have robust infrastructure. They're going to need to deal with social distancing issues. We think that in our [cloud] [ph] portfolio, you're going to see customers put high definition video in every conference room. We have technology that we've built in that I've actually seen working this week, where we have sensors in the units that -- not only will you have high definition video, but we have sensors in the units that actually monitor how many people are in a room and you get warnings if you're exceeding whatever capacity the company has defined for that room. And so, we think that the safety aspect of it will be helpful, too. So I think it's still TBD on what really happens in this space because I think 90 days to 120 days ago, there was this belief that we were going to shut down every headquarters building in the world. And now, I think people know that it's going to be a balance going back. So we've got the Cat 9K and Wi-Fi 6, which is the future modern platforms that the Company has been moving to that continue to show strength. And so, while we have to wait and see, we're optimistic about it. Yeah. On the enterprise front, I think the real thing that I would point out is, there are just a couple of significant transactions. And we see -- in our pipeline, we see a robust pipeline right now. We see large transactions showing up again in the funnel, which is positive. And so, if you look at across the core infrastructure, enterprises are going to upgrade their core infrastructure. They're going to build out a robust on-prem collaborate -- I mean, on-prem meaning hardware video units when they go back into the offices because everyone -- every meeting is going to have remote attendees and you're going to have to have it in virtually every conference room. So that's positive. Everybody is moving to this WAN re-architecture with SD-WAN and cloud security. So I think it's -- the short answer is, Rod, it's largely a couple of big deals a year ago and we see the funnel strengthening. So it's -- that's what gives me the optimism looking forward. Yeah. So I would say that when we did the last earnings call, we had seen actually good demand in the first couple of weeks of the quarter, but clearly it was a couple of weeks. And so, we -- it was not anything that would give us a trend. But it started -- the quarter started and it stayed -- it was very linear. It was not -- we saw decent performance from the beginning, and it stayed pretty consistent throughout. So, that was a good sign for us. And the -- I'm sorry, what was the second question? What I think has happened is, I think customers have come to grips with the fact that this thing is going to be with us for some period of time. Obviously, we're optimistic, like everybody else, some of the vaccines and some of the therapeutics and all will ultimately help. We're balancing that obviously with the current peaks that we're seeing all around the world. But I think customers just basically said, we're not sure when it's going to get better, but it's going to get better. And I can't sit around and do nothing. What I kind of was hopeful was going to happen, which I think we did see, is that we had customers who were super-focused on getting their employees working from home productively and getting their security set up. I think everyone raced to do that. And then, I think they took a pause, which is what we felt in our last quarter in orders. And then, I think they re-prioritized what they were going to be spending money on, and I think we started seeing some of that come back. And it's sort of exactly what I expected, but we needed to see it and we'll see if it continues. But we're all dealing with the same macro environment, everybody is, relative to this virus, but that's sort of how it played out. Any comments, Kelly, on the linearity? Thanks Tim. Yeah, in the cloud vertical, the web scale space, I think what I've said historically is that we've been rebuilding these relationships and we began to see them buying our broader portfolio as a result of them believing in both the fact that we're going to be there with them and that we were investing in technology that was being built the way that they want to consume it and aligned to the architectures that they want to build. What I will tell you now is that last December, we had a launch where we talked about disaggregating our software, our hardware and that we would sell our silicon, our optics, we would sell our software stand-alone. We would sell integrated systems, whatever our customers wanted. And I can tell you that we had now won in the web scale space across every one of those facets. And so, we've seen really good progress. And I would say now, some of the new technologies that we built and had been testing and positioning are starting to show up very well in the accounts. So we're very pleased with that. On the -- and the pipeline looks very strong. So on the -- in fact, one of the comment on that, in the US, we saw service provider flat and that -- and a lot of that was strength in the MSDC web scale space. And in Europe, we saw high-teens growth and we saw really good MSDC web scale strength there as well. On the public sector, that was reasonably consistent around the world, and a lot of it was -- there was a lot of stimulus that was put in the system by lots of governments around the world. Our federal -- federal spending in the US was strong. We saw K through 12 building out a lot of infrastructure for -- while students were not there. And E-rate was strong for sure, and we think that will stay strong. And then, we saw some spending from the CARES Act in the local and municipal governments. But -- and the teams, we spent some time with the leader, particularly in US, this week. And I think he remains fairly bullish. Well, I think a lot of it's what I just described, right? Public sector around the world saw a lot of stimulus. And in the US in particular, we saw strength and we saw everything from Department of Defense spending to the local municipal spending. States were slightly weak, but the federal government was good. Local was good. E-rate kicked in. The new E-rate program kicked in, Jim, which contributes a lot when that gets going. And that's sort of early in its next wave. And so -- and then, we just had -- there was strength in public sector in Germany. And so, I think it was just more consistency basically. And outside the US, obviously, some healthcare. Inside the US too, there's a lot of healthcare in there in public sector, particularly outside the US. Thanks, Jim. Yeah, I'll give you my quick perspective, Tal, and then Kelly can add to it. If you look at what really drove that, it was compute, and a lot of it is sort of the pricing that came through compute, which neither of those competitors you mentioned have. Also just the exposure to data center campuses this past quarter we talked about, the broader exposure we have I think would be the two things that I would call out. Kelly, you have anything to add? Do you want it, Kelly? And I think also the web scale and the service provider, 5G build-outs, we feel like those are going to continue. But the short-term guide is a combination of what's coming off -- out of the RPO, what's in backlog and then we obviously assess the forecasts that the teams put forward and then we put the Kelly and Chuck factor on it. So it is -- and it is math to some extent, but I think that some of the things that we talked about earlier, the things that have given us -- it's hard to say super-optimistic because the numbers still aren't where we want them to be. But relative to where we were 90 days ago and how we felt or the uncertainty that we felt, we certainly feel like we have a little more visibility now. That's a great question. So I think on the organic versus inorganic, I should probably clarify that our strategy there hasn't changed. And I think my comments were either misstated or misconstrued last time and some folks thought that we were thinking about some significantly larger acquisition strategy. Our acquisition strategy hasn't changed, just to be clear. But we'll use a combination. I would say that right now, there -- we are probably at the peak of internal innovation that we've -- that I've seen for a long time. If you look at the platform play, the work that our service provider, Mass-Scale Infrastructure Group, is doing and some of the wins we're seeing there, the 5G backhaul and packet core wins that we're seeing and the, at least, architectural progress we're making whenever our service provider customers start building out their 5G core standalone infrastructure, we feel good about where we are. So it'll be a combination of both and -- but again, it hasn't changed. As you think about it as a service, I do want to delineate between this because there is this offer in the marketplace today from some of our competitors around consumption-based as a service, and that's largely around compute. And so, you'll see us with a similar offer, but more of what I'm talking about is looking at what aspects of our intellectual property, can we pull, can we integrate together and can we deliver as a cloud service? So I'm not necessarily talking about selling Ethernet switch ports one port at a time. We're really talking about delivering our core intellectual property. Example, take SD-WAN, cloud security, secure Internet Gateway and deliver that capability for our customers as a service in the future, which is high value, very differentiated, those are kinds of things we're thinking -- that we're working through right now. And you'll see those kind of offers come out from us over the next 3, 6, 9, 12 months. Yeah. Thanks Simon. I would say on the campus refresh, when you look at Wi-Fi 6, you look at the Cat 9K stuff, we're still early on, honestly. And there is -- we have a large installed base out there. And so, that's a multi-year transition that we expect will go on for some period of time going forward. On the DNA renewal stuff, that's what I was telling Meta [ph] earlier that really it is -- the first real wave of it hits sometime in '21 because if you remember, we launched that in -- I think we announced that in the summer of 2017. Kelly, is that right? And so that was a beginning of fiscal '18. And so, when we get to the end of fiscal '21 -- and you had a lot of early adopters, and we didn't hit scale till sort of the middle of next year. So, you're really talking about getting into FY '22 when we'll start to see that come about. Well, Jim, I would say the active ORAN projects around the world, we are deeply in the middle of and have actually seen a lot of benefit from one in Japan and there is a couple of others going on in other places. And we're in the midst -- we're in the middle of the packet core side of it. We're in the middle of backhaul. We're in the middle of infrastructure to support it. We're in the middle of orchestration layers. And so our teams continue to work on building out our overall stack for how we're playing that OpenRAN space over time. As it relates to the 5G stuff, you're right, where we are seeing benefit today is we're winning a lot of backhaul opportunities. We're winning a lot of packet core. I think we had seven more wins between those two in the last quarter. And I would say, the core standalone build-outs are going to largely be dependent upon the enterprise service delivery that we've talked about historically, and I still think that's probably -- I think we're starting to see some early stuff going on around the world. But I think in earnest, I would say that's going to be -- notwithstanding pandemic and everything else, it's probably going to be starting middle of next year, and it will take several years. But again, there's a lot of variables that can move that either way. Thanks Sami. I'd say on public sector, we feel pretty good about it actually. And when we talk to our leaders around the world, that is one area that is pretty consistent that most of them feel pretty good about and particularly in the US where it's a big piece of the business regardless of administration. It's -- there's different priorities, but they're all dependent upon tech, and so that's good. On the commercial and federal segments, I think what I would say is it -- I would say in commercial, I would assume that there was some aspect of that. But I think looking at the collaboration and security spending. I think just a lot of those mid-size enterprises were really just putting themselves in a position to continue operating in this new world we're living in right now as much as anything. I'm not sure it's significant. I'll let Kelly comments if she thinks, but we did have a comment that I made earlier that our federal team did say that the stimulus was positive, E-rate was positive. And then we saw some local muni buying that was -- they felt like was -- and the customers were telling was connected to the CARES Act, and that's probably the extent of what I've heard on this. Thank you. Yeah, I think, first thing I'll say is that I'm really proud of our team and how hard they're working and how committed they are to our customers and making sure that we're taking care of them during these complex times. And obviously, we're trying to take care of our employees during these complex times. But I really want to just focus on thanking Kelly. It's been an incredible partnership. We've had a lot of fun, and I think that there's a lot of love in the investor community for you. We're going to miss you. But we are excited about Scott. But Kelly, thanks for everything you've done. And Kelly actually helped us make that choice. So you guys can feel good that she helped us with the candidates and was very very supportive on Scott's -- on the decision for Scott. So thank you all for joining us today and we'll look forward to talking to you again next quarter."

If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now, I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.\nMarilyn Mora: Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's fourth quarter fiscal 2022 quarterly earnings conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO; and Scott Herren, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be done on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the first quarter and full year of fiscal 2023. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. I will now turn it over to Chuck.\nChuck Robbins: Thank you, Marilyn, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I'm very proud to share that we had a strong end to our fiscal year in the midst of an incredibly dynamic environment. In fact, we set several records with our performance this year. Let me first touch on those. For the full year of fiscal 22, we delivered record non-GAAP EPS of $3.36. Record product orders, which fueled our backlog to the highest level ever recorded, as well as our second strongest year of revenue in the history of the company at $51.6 billion. We continue to see strong customer adoption of our software and subscriptions, driven by the targeted investments we've been making. We also had record net income, which reflects our operating discipline, despite external challenges, including supply chain and inflation. Our ongoing business transformation continues to show progress across our KPIs, with annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, and remaining performance obligations, or RPO, both setting record highs. These important metrics illustrate the increasing recurring nature of our revenue streams. This, combined with our record backlog, provides us with enhanced visibility into our business looking forward. While this was certainly a complex year, we executed well. I want to thank our teams for their perseverance, determination and unwavering commitment to our customers and our partners. Our team's commitment to accelerated innovation has put us in a unique position of strength for fiscal 2023 and over the long term. Now, I want to be clear on our outlook for fiscal 2023. We expect strong performance across our portfolio, driven by our continued focus on innovation and easing of supply constraints to drive solid top line growth and profitability. While we anticipated some moderation from the unprecedented product order growth of last year, demand signals remain solid. We do expect to continue to experience higher costs in the short term, driven primarily by higher component, freight and logistics costs, which is reflected in our Q1 guide. However, as you'll see in our annual guidance, we expect this margin pressure to begin to ease as the year progresses. Long term, there are many multi-year growth opportunities ahead of us, that gives me confidence in our future. There are currently more technology transitions occurring concurrently than I've seen in 20 years. Long-term megatrends like hybrid cloud, hybrid work, security, IoT, 400 gig and beyond, 5G and Wi-Fi 6 as well as the move towards application observability will likely provide tailwinds to our growth. With our portfolio in such a strong position to help our customers, I'm quite optimistic about what's ahead. Before we discuss the quarter in detail, I want to provide some additional color on the supply situation and how we continue to build greater resiliency. After a challenging April due to the COVID-related shutdowns in Shanghai, and the impact on semiconductor and power supplies, overall supply constraints began to ease slightly at the back half of the fourth quarter and continuing into the start of Q1. While the component supply headwinds remain, they have begun to show early signs of easing. The decisions we made and the multiple actions we have taken over the past two years are helping to improve our resiliency and will help offset cost inflation. These include adding new suppliers, leveraging alternative suppliers, redesigning hundreds of products to use alternative components with similar capability and targeted price increases, all of which position us for the future. These actions along with the tremendous efforts by our supply chain team and the investments we've made in building capacity to meet growth have the potential to drive momentum into fiscal 2023. Moving to performance highlights in the quarter. We delivered revenue above the high end of our guidance range, and non-GAAP EPS came in at the high end of our guidance range. We achieved healthy operating margins and generated solid cash flow and returned nearly $4 billion to Cisco stockholders through cash dividends and share repurchases. With annual product order growth of 14% for the fiscal year, we exited the year with record product backlog. In addition, our RPO totaled more than $31 billion, and when combined with low cancellation rates, which remain below pre-pandemic levels, this sets the stage for increased visibility and strong revenue growth as we head into fiscal 2023. In terms of our product orders this quarter, we delivered the second highest orders in absolute dollars in the history of the company. It was second only to our performance in Q4 of fiscal 2021 and on a sequential basis it was up greater than 15% with strong growth in enterprise, commercial and public sector. From an annual growth rate perspective, we clearly faced some very tough comparisons from the record orders we saw in Q4 last year, where we had over 30% growth. Based on that, the year-over-year decline was not a surprise nor is it concerning. It's important to keep in mind that in the near term, the rate and pace of our revenue growth is much more a function of component availability than on our quarterly product order growth. With RPO of over $31 billion, almost $17 billion of which will be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months and a record backlog, we have great top line visibility. Thanks to the relentless effort of our entire organization, the business remains stronger than before the pandemic. From a demand perspective, we continue to experience solid customer activity beyond our ability to deliver as is reflected in the growth of our backlog that we saw throughout the quarter. While our business is not immune to macro trends, we will remain disciplined in our operations, while benefiting from robust multiyear investment trends and the technology transitions I mentioned earlier. Our innovation is helping our customers and partners navigate an increasing amount of complexity, and there is a greater sense of urgency to leverage leading-edge technologies to deliver on their strategic objectives. This is leading them to consistently look to Cisco and our unique and differentiated innovation to help them advance their most pressing business priorities. We recently held our Cisco Live customer event in-person for the first time in three years and had over 15,000 in attendance, including thousands of our largest customers and many more participating virtually. Our discussions with them focused on strategic projects, supply assurance and the critical role Cisco can play to support their long-term technology road maps. They did not indicate any fundamental shift in their commitment to technology investments. Regardless of what the coming quarters may bring, we have a proven track record of being able to adjust in difficult environments. Our value proposition to our customers remains as strong as ever. In our web scale business, we continue to see momentum even as the business becomes larger, as product orders were up more than 50% on a trailing four-quarter basis. We see significant opportunity ahead as these customers build out massively scalable cloud networks and increasingly turn to Cisco to help them meet accelerating demand for cloud services. Our leadership in silicon, optics, software and systems enables us to win as hyperscalers value industry-leading performance and innovation. We are expanding our footprint, driven by data center build-outs with our Silicon One-based Cisco 8000 routers, the fastest-growing platforms in Cisco's history. Together with optics from Acacia, we have a strong foundation for 400-gig and beyond to rearchitect the Internet with routed optical networking. In addition, we recently booked and shipped our first 800-gig systems to one of our web scale customers. On the IoT front, we also now have more than 200 million connected things on our cloud platform with growth driven by connected car. We finished fiscal 2022 with product orders in excess of $1 billion and growing double digits. We continue to make progress on our transformation to more software and subscription-based recurring revenue. ARR of approximately $23 billion was up 8% with product ARR increasing by 13%. We had strong subscription revenue this quarter, driven by our growing portfolio of recurring offers. While our software revenue was down slightly, once supply constraints improve and we begin to increase product shipments, we expect to see an improvement in software, subscription and services that are attached to hardware products in our backlog. The investments we've made in innovation are paying off as our competitive position is very strong. In Q4, we introduced several new cloud delivered innovations across our portfolio to help organizations drive productivity and resiliency. We launched Nexus Cloud, a platform to help our customers deploy, manage and operate their data center networks from the cloud. In addition, we introduced Calisti and Panoptica, two new cloud native API-first tools for faster and better application development. We also announced AppDynamics Cloud, a next-generation version of our observability platform for cloud native applications. In addition, we shared our strategy to help our customers connect their entire security architecture with our new platform, Cisco Security Cloud, which will be a game changer for them as they look to secure their multi-cloud environments with a single cloud-delivered security platform. This is just one part of our broader security innovation cycle. Building on the double-digit growth we saw in security this quarter, we are investing across our security business, focusing on cloud based offerings, best-in-class AI driven threat detection and end-to-end security architectures. These innovations position us well for leadership in the security market. In summary, we executed well on our strategy and transformation during what remains a very dynamic time. This led to a strong close to our fiscal year, setting several records across our business, thanks to the solid execution from our teams, our market-leading innovation and our continued growth of recurring revenue. We also took decisive actions to help offset inflation and build resiliency in our supply chain, while investing in our business to position us well for long-term growth. The power of our technology continues to be a critical driver of economic growth and productivity. Our results and outlook demonstrate the critical role that Cisco plays as a leader in bringing innovative technology solutions to customers today and into the future. As we move into fiscal 2023, we remain guided by our purpose-led culture and deeply committed to delivering value for our customers, partners and investors, as well as continuing to be an amazing place to work for our employees. I will now turn it over to Scott.\nScott Herren: Thanks, Chuck. I'll first provide some detail on our financial results for the quarter, then cover the full fiscal year, followed by our guidance. Our overall Q4 results reflect strong execution in an environment with continuing supply constraints. And as Chuck mentioned, increased costs reflected in our gross margins. We're very pleased that our shipment levels were above our expectations and that total revenue of $13.1 billion exceeded the high end of our guidance range, as we saw improvement in supply as a direct result of the numerous actions we've taken over multiple quarters. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 32.4%, down 110 basis points and in line with our guidance. Non-GAAP net income was $3.4 billion, down 3% and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.83, coming in at the high end of our guidance range. Looking at our Q4 revenue in more detail. Total product revenue was $9.7 billion, and service revenue was $3.4 billion both flat year-over-year. Within product revenue, Secure, Agile Networks was down 1%. Switching declined in both data center and campus driven by supply constraints. We saw growth in our Catalyst 9000, Nexus 9000 and Meraki switching offerings. Enterprise routing decline primarily driven by Edge and SD-WAN offset by strength in access. Wireless had strong growth, driven primarily by our Meraki wireless offerings. We also had double-digit growth in servers. Internet for the future was down 10% with strength in web scale revenue, offset by declines in cable, edge and optical. Collaboration was up 2%, driven by growth in collaboration devices, partially offset by declines in our meetings and calling offerings. End-to-end security had record revenue with strong growth of 20%, driven by strength across the entire portfolio. Our Zero Trust portfolio continues to perform well, driven by strong performance in our dual offering. Optimized application experiences had solid growth of 8%, driven by double-digit growth in our SaaS-based offering, ThousandEyes. We continue to make progress on our transformation metrics, as we shift our business to more software and subscriptions. We saw strong performance in our ARR of $22.9 billion, an increase of 8% with product ARR growth of 13% driven by several large software transactions closing during the quarter. Total software revenue was $3.9 billion, a decrease of 2% with software subscription revenue up 1%. Bear in mind, we continue to have well over $2 billion of software orders in our product backlog. 83% of the software revenue was subscription based, which is up 2 percentage points year-over-year. Total subscription revenue was $5.8 billion, an increase of 2%. Total subscription revenue represented 44% of Cisco's total revenue. And RPO was $31.5 billion, up 2%, product RPO increased 6%. Service RPO decreased 1%, and our total short-term RPO grew 4% to $16.9 billion. Total product orders in Q4 were the second highest in our history. While product orders were down 6% for the quarter, it's important to keep in mind that the compare against 31% growth a year ago, which was the highest product orders in our history. On a sequential basis, product order growth was up over 15%, with double-digit growth in enterprise, commercial and public sector. Looking at our geographic segments year-over-year. The Americas was down 9%, EMEA down 4%, and APJC up 1%. In our customer markets, Enterprise was down 15%, Public Sector was down 3%, Service Provider was down 7% and commercial was up 1%. From a non-GAAP perspective, total gross margin came in at 63.3% and down 230 basis points year-on-year. Product gross margin was 61.3%, down 370 basis points, and service gross margin was 69%, up 160 basis points. In our product gross margin, higher component and commodity costs, as well as higher freight and logistics related to supply constraints, were the predominant drivers of lower-than-expected margins. We saw increased benefits from the pricing actions we have taken, as well as for mix. Once again, we had a significant increase in our backlog levels for both hardware and software, well beyond our normal historical levels. As Chuck said, our ending product backlog was a record for the year. And just a reminder, backlog is not included as part of the $31.5 billion in remaining performance obligations. It's important to note that the combined total of our backlog and RPO gives us great visibility into our fiscal 2023 top line growth. We ended Q4 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $19.3 billion. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $3.7 billion, down 18% year-over-year, primarily driven by advanced payments and inventory purchases to secure future supply. In capital allocation, we returned $4 billion to shareholders during the quarter, was comprised of $2.4 billion of share repurchases and $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend. Turning to the full fiscal year results. Overall, our financial results were solid in a year where we faced significant supply constraints, rising component and related costs and the war in Ukraine. Our financial performance was highlighted by strong demand, with product order growth of 14%, including two quarters of truly impressive 33% growth, though our performance was clearly impacted by the supply constraints. Revenue was $51.6 billion, up 3%, while non-GAAP earnings per share were up 4%, at $3.36. In terms of our software metrics, total software revenue was flat, at $15.1 billion, with the product portion up 2%, 81% of software revenue was subscription-based, which is up 2 percentage points year-on-year. Total subscription revenue was $22.4 billion, an increase of 2% and total subscription revenue represented 43% of Cisco's total revenue. Total non-GAAP gross margin was 64.6%, down 150 basis points and our non-GAAP operating margin was 33.6%, up 10 basis points. On the bottom line, non-GAAP net income was $14.1 billion, up 3%. We delivered operating cash flow of $13.2 billion, down 14% compared to fiscal 2021, driven primarily by advanced payments for inventory purchases to secure component supply. While these payments had a negative impact on full year operating cash flow, these and our other related actions helped to improve the supply situation in Q4 and future quarters. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned approximately $14 billion in value to our shareholders via cash dividends and stock repurchases, representing 109% of our free cash flow. This was comprised of $7.7 billion of share repurchases and $6.2 billion in quarterly cash dividends. We also increased our dividend for the 11th consecutive year in fiscal 2022, reinforcing our commitment to returning excess capital to our shareholders, and our confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows. Our strong balance sheet and overall financial position is clearly a competitive advantage in tough environments. To summarize, we executed well in Q4 and had a solid fiscal year and a high complex environment, while continuing to make progress in our business model shift, and making strategic investment and innovation to capitalize on our significant growth opportunities and expanding addressable markets. The demand for our products and services are strong as we drive innovation through continued investment and the shift to more recurring revenue delivering growth and driving shareholder value. Turning to our financial guidance for Q1, we expect revenue growth to be in the range of 2% to 4%. We anticipate non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 63% to 64%. Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 31.5% to 32.5%, and non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.82 to $0.84. For fiscal 2023, our guidance is as follows. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 4% to 6% year-on-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is expected to range from $3.49 to $3.56, also up 4% to 6% year-on-year. In both our Q1 and full year guidance, we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn, so we can move into the Q&A.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Scott. Michelle, let's go ahead and queue up the list of Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. You may go ahead.\nSami Badri: Hi. Thank you. I actually had two questions. First thing is for fiscal year 2023 your revenue growth expectations came in a bit stronger than most Street expectations. And maybe you could just walk us through the composition of the segment and what's driving the strength and maybe which segments may potentially lag some of the stronger segments? And then my other question is, maybe you could just give us some color on the composition of gross margin regarding pricing and productivity in fiscal 4Q of 2022, that would be helpful.\nScott Herren: Yeah. Thanks, Sami. As we look at the forecast that we've given you for fiscal 2023, balance growth again, 4% to 6% growth on the top line, 4% to 6% growth on the bottom line. When you start to peel that back, of course, we don't guide at that level, what we have seen, as you'd expect, is, again, nice demand, as Chuck talked about on the call, through the end of the fourth quarter, but a little bit different by industry vertical. Retail, not surprisingly, under a little bit of pressure. Financial services under a little bit of pressure. Pretty much strength across most of the rest of the sector, a little bit of pressure in health care as well. So that's \u2013 as we roll into fiscal 2023, that's what we're seeing kind of vertical by vertical. We saw good double-digit growth sequentially, again, Q3 to Q4, because the year-on-year compares are quite difficult with that 31% growth we had a year ago, but good sequential growth, if you look at it by customer market in both enterprise, public sector and commercial. So again, seeing pretty balanced growth across the board and that's our expectation as we roll into fiscal 2023. On the gross margin question, we are getting a benefit from price. One of the things that we've talked about, though, is there's a lag between the price increases that we put in place and what we see actually showing up in reported revenues. And I know, you know, this from prior quarters, Sami, we saw some of that benefit in Q4, and you'll see this in our filings in our 10-Q \u2013 our 10-K filing for the end of the quarter. It's about 1%, up year-on-year gross margin driven by price and then, of course, the offset coming from higher cost, both component costs and freight and logistics.\nSami Badri: Got it. Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Next question, please.\nOperator: Tim Long with Barclays. You may go ahead.\nTim Long: Thank you. Just wanted to ask on maybe two quick ones. One on the software business. Chuck, you talked about kind of flattish performance, but still have carrying a lot of backlog there. That's been a case for a few quarters here. So maybe you could just talk a little bit about what you think it's going to get taken to get this business moving a little bit more aggressively towards that software model. And then I did want to follow-up on the cloud vertical, still running really strong orders there. Can you talk a little bit about is the breadth of portfolio shipping into that growing? I know the 8-K is strong, but any other highlights of strength there that would be great? Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Tim. So let's start with the software. And you're right, the software is flattish. There's two things that I would point out. We have -- we, obviously, have been transitioning from perpetual software model, which is in decline, and that's by design. We want to decline our perpetual software and increase our subscription software. And the way I think about it is, our perpetual was down roughly 14% during the quarter. And we also, as Scott said, have over $2 billion, and it's actually a higher number exiting Q4 than it was in Q3 of software in backlog, as you said, connected to hardware. So those are two contributing factors, which is why we really should be thinking about the ARR situation because that's reflective of the ACV that we basically had exiting the quarter. And it's -- so that's an indicator of future software revenue. So we're comfortable with it. And I think once we get through some of the supply chain stuff that we'll start to see that be a little more reflective of what we've been planning on. On the cloud vertical, we continue to win new insertions. That business is approaching 3 billion annually now after just two or three short years ago, it was pretty close to nothing. And so the teams have done a fantastic job. It is, obviously, over the last four quarters, it's grown 50%. From a revenue perspective, it's very supply chain dependent. So I wouldn't get too wrapped up about the revenue versus the orders right now. I think we'll work our way through that over the next four to five quarters. But overall, really pleased with where we are.\nTim Long: Okay. Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks Tim. Next question, please.\nOperator: Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead, sir.\nRod Hall: Yeah. Hey guys, thanks for the question. I guess, I wanted to dig into this order growth a little bit. Obviously, very strong numbers there, but somewhat inconsistent with the way that we would have expected them to come out? And I just wanted -- and the thing that's inconsistent is you guys are saying up over 15% in the quarter, but then down 6% on a year-over-year basis, we would have calculated closer to flat, like minus 1. So we're just curious whether there was any restatement of the July quarter last year. You guys had called out 31% order growth there or anything else going on with the dynamics of these orders that might help us to understand that discrepancy at least in our numbers. And then I've got a follow-up.\nChuck Robbins: Yes, Rod, I saw some folks who thought we would be down 15%. So I think it's just different ways of modeling. When we were thinking about this question, and we obviously know that 31% and then in Q1, we're comparing is 33%. We were trying to find other ways to look at the business to indicate the reality of the demand signal. So let me just give you a few of those characteristics. First of all, from a product order perspective, as I said, it was the second highest in history, which would be only eclipsed by Q4 a year ago, and it grew 15%. And on a sequential basis, that's actually in range with our historicals. If you go back to -- if you take out last year, which was an abnormal sequential then it's very much in line, it's in the range of what we've seen for the last 10 years, the 15%. You had enterprise, public sector and commercial, all growing in solid double-digits on a sequential basis, and again, growing sequentially off our largest third quarter product bookings ever. We also have continued growth in the pipeline. As we exited Q4, we saw very good growth in pipeline, which is a good indicator of going forward. And the final thing I would tell you is that if you -- the way our sales teams forecasted the quarter at the beginning of month three, they revised their forecast for the quarter, and they finished stronger than they thought they would, and we had strength as we exited the quarter. And so linearity was solid. And so we just haven't seen anything that would indicate a significant shift in the demand signal from our customers.\nScott Herren: Yes, Rod, so there was not - to be clear on your question, there was no change in the way we report year-on-year. It's exactly the same. The only other thing that I would add, too, to the comments that Chuck just made, linearity in the quarter was quite strong. In fact, the last week of the quarter was actually the same size as it had been in the prior year and the month-to-month linearity was exactly in line with last year and with prior year's expectations. So we saw strength right through the end of Q4.\nRod Hall : Got you. Okay. And I -- just as a follow-up, can I ask you guys on inventory? I know inventories moved up quite a bit again. Do you think inventory starts to come down next quarter, or just curious kind of where we are in that ebb and flow of inventory given the supply shortages and so on?\nScott Herren: Yes. What's sitting in inventory, Rod, is the rest of the parts that aren't under constraint, so that as the ones that are constrained free up, of course, we can square the set and get the product shipped out the door to our customers. So it is growing. It's up about $1 billion year-on-year, sitting at $2.5 billion. Our advanced payments are up as well. Both of those are a bit of a headwind to cash flows, as you saw. But yes, it's much more a statement of making sure we've got everything we need, so that as those constrained parts clear up, which we saw a little bit of that towards the end of Q4, we can square the sets and get it out the door and in the hands of our customers.\nRod Hall : Okay. Great. Appreciate it guys. Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: All right. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Amit Daryanani from Evercore. You may go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Yes. Thanks for the taking my question. I have two as well. The question I have is just on gross margins or maybe when I think about the EPS guide of 4% to 6% for fiscal 2023. How are you thinking about gross margins in that backdrop? And then are buybacks embedded in that guide as well?\nScott Herren: Yes. So there's no added buyback in there. We've talked about our cap allocation policy. Our share buybacks have both a systemic component to it that's just offsetting the shares that we issued through our equity plans and an opportunistic component. On the -- what's our expectation on gross margin through the year. Of course, we don't guide that for the full year, Amit. But what I'd say is, my expectation is, as we go through the year and we can work through the backlog, we'll begin to ship out of that backlog more and more orders that actually reflect the price increases that we put in place last year. And as we do, of course, that will be a tailwind to margins throughout the year. So I would see margins going up as much as 50 basis points, between our first quarter guide and where we end the year.\nAmit Daryanani: And then, if I could just follow up, there\u2019s been a firm amount of fear that higher interest rates looks like impact enterprise spending across the board, your print, your guide doesn\u2019t seem to suggest you\u2019re seeing any signs of that. But, I\u2019d love to get your perspective. What are you hearing from your customers as the macroenvironment is changing? And really related to that, are you seeing any shift in how they procure or what they want to buy from you as the macroenvironment changes?\nChuck Robbins: Yes, it's a good question. And we -- what I would say is that, we are not immune to any significant change in the macro that would result in enterprise spending shifting up. My comments are just that, we haven't seen a material demand signal change as we've entered into Q1. So that's where we are. I think on last call, I believe, I talked a lot about how I believe that post pandemic, the view of technology by our customers is much different than it would have been seven, eight, nine years ago there. I think if you ask our customers if they would pause spending during a crisis, they would probably respond, when is there not going to be a crisis, given what we've dealt with the last three years. And so, in general, we don't hear a lot of difference, relative to your question around have we seen any different buying behavior or what are they trying to buy from us. In some cases, customers are looking for a little shorter ROI, so that affects how they think about what products they're buying in these kinds of times. In some cases, customers are looking ahead to lead times to fiscal 2023 budgets and trying to better understand what their budgets are going to look like, because the shipments and the payments would be in the 2023 time frame. But other than that, we're not seeing anything significantly different.\nAmit Daryanani: Perfect. Thank you. Congrats on a nice print.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Amit.\nScott Herren: Thanks, Amit.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Amit. Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley Investment Research. You may go ahead.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. A couple of questions for me. Maybe, just on kind of increasing supply availability, I just wanted to get a sense of how much of that do you feel like is just some of these lagging edge components are starting to become more available? And how much of that is a result of kind of redesigns that you've done over the course of the year that have just kind of given you more optionality? And then, maybe, just a second question for you, Chuck. Just as we've seen, kind of, evaluation, correction on a lot of kind of the software space, like, how does that change your view of strategic activity? Thanks.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Meta. So on the first one, I'd say, that it's a combination of both of those. We -- as we said earlier, we saw increased volumes in the broker network during the quarter, which candidly was an opportunity we took advantage of, which is why you saw the higher top line, we were able to get more products shipped to our customers, which we obviously were very happy about, but we had to pay more for those components, and we think that will continue probably over the next 60 to 90 days. And then, we think, some of those purchases will begin to become available from the same suppliers that have put the excess inventory into the marketplace. At the same time, we have \u2013 and I think I said this on our last call, we've had hundreds of product design \u2013 redesigns going on. And two of our high volume products that also have good margins will begin to ship in the redesigned space sort of towards the latter into Q1, and then into the balance of the year, which we think will be helpful as well. So it's a combination of both of those things. And that's what gives us a little bit of optimism that things will continue to improve during the year. On the second question, on the valuations, I've had this one a few times, and I've been asked, if our M&A strategy has changed because of the valuations. And I've said that, our strategy hasn't changed, but the openness to talk to us from some of the \u2013 the companies that thought they had different strategic exits might have changed. And so we haven't changed our strategy. We just think that, it potentially creates more opportunity for us with companies that might not have been willing because they thought there was a high-flying IPO, ahead of them that they may not believe is the case right now. And the market is obviously taking a much different view on profitability versus just growth.\nMeta Marshall: Perfect. Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Chuck. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Tal Liani with Bank of America Securities. You may go ahead.\nTal Liani: Hi, guys. I'm trying to distinguish between the growth next year, which is probably a function of better supplies and backlog, very high backlog in between the spending environment, and you started touching on it when we asked about the enterprise. So let me maybe expand the question about the environment. When you go through your various, what you call, use of coal theaters and you go through cloud and service providers and enterprise, et cetera. Can you take us through your expectations for the spending environment and maybe how long it takes to close deals versus before when you look into the next few quarters? I'm trying to understand, if the environment as you see it today, whether it deteriorates or not at all, or which are the areas where we see a slowdown or not? And I have a second question, just if you can touch on security. Security was good again. It was good, actually much better, and there is improvement throughout the quarter, if you can touch on your position in security?\nChuck Robbins: Great. Thanks, Tal. So we \u2013 I think Scott has touched on it that, the revenue for fiscal year 2023 is much more a byproduct of component availability than it necessarily is connected to demand. But I will tell you that, our current models would have us exiting fiscal 2023 with roughly the same backlog as we're entering FY 2023. And so \u2013 and then as you look at the different segments that you've described, we had small business growth in Q4. I think it was double digits on a global basis, which is a good sign that that's continuing to grow. And then when we dissect it, commercial grew 39% a year ago. So sequentially in double digits, Enterprise was up in the mid-20s last year. So, sequentially growing in high double digits. Those are good signs for us. And then the pipeline growth that, we've seen as we exited the quarter just says that, there's still a lot out there. And so right now, we're modeling for just the things to continue as we see them and taking into consideration as you ask me to go around the regions, I think Asia and Europe, we had conversations with our team this week and they seem to -- they continue to be reasonably optimistic as we are in the Americas. And so it was a pretty consistent story. Scott?\nScott Herren: Yeah. Probably the only thing I'd add is as you look at that 4% to 6% growth that we've forecasted now for fiscal 2023, it is absolutely supply constrained. So while the supply situation we saw late in our fourth quarter that we just closed, there were some easing. Easing doesn't mean it's over. We're going to have supply constraints throughout fiscal 2023 and just a few areas were it not for those, we would be growing much more quickly. It's not a case of demand. We're not demand constrained. We were supply constrained in fiscal 2023.\nTal Liani: And when it comes to your answer about service providers and cloud, same as the answer for the enterprise, meaning you don't expect much of a change as of now in the environment?\nChuck Robbins: No, we don't see anything. What I would tell you about the service provider business is that because of the long lead times, we started a process of doing long-term planning with them that I've talked about before. And so we actually have deferred bookings that don't show up anywhere right now, approaching $0.5 billion, that because they're outside of our standard shipment window when they would like to get those. So we've got orders out quarters from now from them that are all non-cancelable because of the contracts that we've done. So we feel good about that momentum. We think that those customers will continue to spend in all of the trends that we've talked about. And given that we just shipped our first 800-gig system to one of the web scale players, we can continue to see them take advantage of these higher speed platforms.\nTal Liani: Greta. Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Now, Tal, you also asked about security?\nTal Liani: Yes, I did.\nChuck Robbins: So we saw -- I think Scott mentioned this in his -- we had some really good growth and some backlog movement, to be honest, on the firewall side. So we had a really solid quarter on shipments from a firewall perspective. But we also had strength in our endpoint business. We had strengthened our Zero Trust business. And we're continuing to -- that is the number one investment area for the company this year, and it is -- we're continuing to drive, I think, greater innovation there and evolve that portfolio as we've described strategically. So I think we'll just continue to see improvement. But this quarter did get a boost from us clearing some backlog in the firewall space.\nTal Liani: Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks Tal. Next question.\nOperator: Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on the good execution this quarter. I guess, I wanted to dive into the order numbers a bit here. And historically, you've talked about SMB or commercial being a bit more of a leading indicator into enterprise trends. But when you look at the order trends right now, it does seem like you're seeing a bit more of a volatility around the enterprise orders related to the commercial segment. And so I wanted to see if there's anything that you can help us in terms of thinking about the trends we're seeing there? And just a second one there is collaboration and it seems like a very tough group turnaround collaboration results in. So how should we think about sustainability of the growth here for collaboration?\nChuck Robbins: Yeah, Samik, thank you. I'll comment on -- the small business was again strong, as I spoke about just a moment ago. I think it's really important when you have these abnormal year-over-year comparisons for us to find other ways to assess the strength, which is why we looked at the sequential growth. And sequentially, they're both up in double-digits, both commercial and enterprise, which against a very large quarter, a quarter ago. And so we're comfortable right now that they're moving as they should be. Candidly, for commercial to grow at all after the extreme growth that we had a year ago was actually quite positive. So I actually view that favorably given the strength that they showed a year ago, it was probably the highest growth rate we've had in forever in that space or at least in the last 10 years. So overall, I think we don't see any sort of significant demand shift, as I said earlier. On the collab front, it's a little bit like the security message that I gave a few minutes ago. We had a -- we did clear a lot of device business in the backlog. So the growth, as Scott said in his opening comments, was driven largely by the device business and offset by some declines we had in meetings and calling. But I will say that the teams are working really hard on the meetings and calling side. Those have been strong. The calling side has been strong for us in the past few quarters. The product portfolio is in really good shape. The Net Promoter Score for our meetings platform is now 64 and that was 1 million customer responses. So it's a huge -- it's a hugely improved experience. And this year, the teams are really focused on trying to get that back to growth. But we've got a lot of work to do.\nSamik Chatterjee: Yes. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions.\nMarilyn Mora: Next question, please.\nOperator: Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. You may go ahead.\nIttai Kidron: Thanks. A couple from me. Maybe first on the supply chain. I just want to make sure I understand your expectations for component availability, and maybe you could talk about price changes of components. It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re assuming any changes in pricing. Is that correct? And if there will be a change in pricing, what are the odds that you actually take down the prices of your products?\nScott Herren : Yes. This -- I'll start, Chuck, and if you want to jump in, let's do that. From a component availability standpoint, Ittai, that's been the most fluid area of our forecast over the last several quarters. And as we look ahead, we did see signs of stability during Q4. And as I said, in the late in Q4 that we just closed, we actually saw some improvement. The way that improvement showed up was availability of some of the constrained parts that we have been chasing in the broker network. And obviously, when you buy from the broker network, you pay a premium for those. And you see that reflected in the gross margins. I think there'll still be some of that in Q1. You see that reflected in our gross margin guide in Q1. And then it gets better as the year goes on, not because -- I'm not assuming any price declines or any cost declines coming from our suppliers. I think the -- I don't see them lining up to come back and say, hey, good news, Scott and Chuck. We're going to charge you less for the component parts. There may be some benefit in freight and logistics. We'll see, as commercial airlift comes back online. I think the benefits we'll get will be much more from shipping more out of our backlog that are orders that were received after we did the price increases last year.\nIttai Kidron: So as I think about your fiscal year, fiscal 2023 on guidance, what is the underlying assumption regarding volume component availability exiting fiscal 2023? How much better are you expecting it to be in your guidance? What's embedded there?\nScott Herren : Yes. Again, our guidance assumes that we continue to be supply constrained through the year. As I said, if we could get more supply, we would be growing more quickly in fiscal 2023. So we'll continue to be supply constrained. Our modeling shows that our backlog, as we exit fiscal 2023, Chuck touched on this earlier, that we think the dollar value, obviously, it's not the same orders, but the dollar value is roughly unchanged from the dollar value we roll into fiscal 2023 with. So I think we'll continue to face component availability headwinds throughout the year.\nIttai Kidron: Would you expect your order growth in fiscal 2023 to exceed your 4% to 6% top line guidance?\nScott Herren: Yes. We don't forecast order growth, as you know, Ittai. So that's not one that I want to jump into at this point. I think the -- probably the key takeaway would be, we're not demand constrained. We're supply constrained, as you look at 2023.\nIttai Kidron: Okay. Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Ittai.\nScott Herren: Thanks, Ittai.\nMarilyn Mora: Next question?\nOperator: Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Your may go ahead.\nPaul Silverstein: Thank you. I know my questions have been touched on previous comments and responses, Chuck. But I want to ask you anyway, there are big picture questions, one on revenue, one on margins. The first one, from your comments and the comments of your peers about networking, it looks like networking demand is in the best shape it's been in since the bubble of the late '90s? And that, of course was a bubble. But its -- the supply constraints, it\u2019s making it hard to discern what\u2019s going on from a competitive landscape standpoint. And I'm sure you guys are aware, I know it's come up in previous calls, but there's a sense, I think, created by your competitors, rightly or wrongly, but I want to let you respond that, in campus enterprise in particular, which is still core to what you all do, that you've got competitive pressures. Any thoughts you can share on what you're seeing in your campus enterprise business, both on the wireline switching and on the wireless LAN side, you clearly talked about strength from an order perspective, but I want to let you respond. And then I've got a question on margins.\nChuck Robbins: Okay. First of all, I think, market share is a very difficult thing to assess right now, to your point, because of everything sitting in the backlog. I do believe that Q4 was the second largest Cat 9000 shipment quarter in the history of the product. So that would indicate that it's strong. And I think as we continue to clear our backlog or work through it, not clear it, but as we work through our backlog, you'll see some share come out. But I would encourage you to look at market share over a trending quarter time frame as opposed to a point in time because you just never know. We've got some products that we've been redesigning that we have backlog that we'll begin to ship and mass that will actually flip market share numbers pretty significantly. And my competitor is going to be telling you exactly what I'm telling you right now. So it's something you just got to watch over time. And so, I'm not -- I mean, clearly, we have competition in the campus. We have very strong competition, we always have. And -- but given the volume of the products that we're shipping right now, I don't feel like we're losing significant share.\nPaul Silverstein: Okay. And also from a big picture perspective, once upon a time, networking in general, and Cisco, in particular, was the canary in the coal mine. When there was a macro downturn, you guys were the first to see it, networking was the easiest thing to push off, everyone let their networks run hotter with the enterprise carriers, et cetera, that seems to flip where networking is actually not seeing weakness that other technology product markets are seeing. I just want to make sure that I've got that construct right. And the real question though on the margin side, you all were at record or near record gross and operating margin levels going into the pandemic before input costs, I see semis freight, which is, et cetera, spikes. Any thoughts on where you can get \u2013 where the long-term model can get back to once supply chain normalizes. I assume that, freight and logistics mix and pricing will go back to pre-pandemic levels, it will help you and others out. But I also assume that, the increase in semi IC input costs are not going back to where they were, you'll be able to offset some but probably not all of that with your price increases. Let me let you respond.\nChuck Robbins: Yeah. So let me take the networking \u2013 the resilience of the networking market first. And then, Scott, you can take the margin question. So Paul, the \u2013 I think you're right. And I've said this repeatedly, I think what what's driven this is there are two things. Number one, the pandemic revealed the impact of not keeping your core infrastructure technology up to speed. Customers struggled, and I think it made them realize that they had a lot of tech debt that needed to be dealt with. And they don't want to get in that position again. So that's the first thing. But the second thing is all of these mega trends that I mentioned in my opening comments, I mean, these customers are re-architecting their entire infrastructure for the first time in years to deal with hybrid cloud and to deal with, all of the mobile workers. We see IoT exploding. You see, all of the climate activity is going to be a tailwind to our business, because you have to connect all these industrial systems, to be able to control them. You've got to shift to 400 gig. I mean, let me just \u2013 I'll give you a data point, 400 gig ports we're up almost 700% year-over-year for us. We've got over 1,000 customers now that have bought 400 gig and we shipped our first 800 gig. So it's just \u2013 all these trends continue, you got 5G, you've got WiFi-6. You've got this application observability, the re-architecture of applications. So I think it's a combination of the realization of the pandemic brought on around technology debt and never letting them get to that point and then these mega trends that are going on. And Scott, do you want to take the gross margin question?\nScott Herren: Yeah. I think, Paul, on the gross margin question, I think you nailed the trends. I don't expect input costs, particularly around semis to come down. I look forward to the day that I come to the office and there's a message from our semiconductor suppliers saying, hey, good news, your price is going down. I just don't see that happening. Price will offset part of it. I think you got that part right, too. I think the other \u2013 the only thing I would add that probably in your thinking, but you didn't say it, so I will. Over the longer term, as we mix more software in, that will be a tailwind at the gross margin line. So just add that to your thinking, and I think you've got it nailed.\nPaul Silverstein: Scott, can you go back to that record level?\nScott Herren: I don't want to get into forecasting the longer term at that level of granularity right now, Paul.\nPaul Silverstein: I appreciate. Thanks, guys.\nScott Herren: Okay.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Paul. Next question.\nOperator: Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research. You may go ahead.\nBen Bollin: Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. The first one, you talked about backlog expected to sustain at current levels exiting fiscal 2023. I think you said software backlog was north of $2 billion again in the quarter, but what was the product backlog? Where did that finish the quarter?\nChuck Robbins: Yeah. We didn't give that stat and that's not one that I want to start giving every quarter. Ben, what we did say qualitatively is it grew again. And what I'll tell you is, it was up actually up triple digits again on a year-on-year basis. The overall backlog, software backlog is a pretty significant headwind to our software growth it's well north of the $2 billion that we talked about.\nBen Bollin: Okay. And then one other item. I'm not asking for a forecast on RPO. I guess, that's a precursor to asking for one. But when you think about RPO in the concept of the broader 4% to 6% rev guide for the year, is the assumption as you shift more to software that RPO should consistently outperform your top line growth? How do you think about the relationship for those two metrics longer term?\nScott Herren: Yeah. There's a couple of dynamics going on in RPO. So I'd say, in general, you're right, obviously, duration has an effect on RPO as well, but it varies a bit by product line. So for the quarter, we just announced the 6% product RPO growth. We had double-digit product RPO growth in secure Agile Networks, an optimized app experiences and in security, almost forgot. And we had high single-digit growth in Internet for the future. I'd say that the headwind there, of course, is collab from an RPO standpoint. So longer term, I think you'd expect those dynamics to continue. And as we turn around the go-to-market and the sales side of collab, that will flip from being a headwind to more of a tailwind on product RPO growth.\nBen Bollin: Thanks Scott.\nMarilyn Mora: Okay. We have time for one more question.\nOperator: Simon Leopold from Raymond James. You may go ahead, sir.\nSimon Leopold: Thanks for taking the question. I've got one sort of short term and one longer term. On the short-term side, we heard some anecdotes that some multi-product projects have been split up because of the supply chain constraints. And I want to get a sense of whether or not that's something that's happening as a way for you to work around some of the bottlenecks and to get some projects out the door that might not have and how that might factor into the numbers. And in terms of the longer term, Todd Nightingale had made a comment in a meeting about Cisco no longer managing to the org chart. And I wanted to see if maybe Chuck, you can elaborate on what the implications are by that particular statement? Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: So Simon, if I could ask you to clarify for me is on the short-term question, I didn't quite understand. You're saying that we are breaking up orders or we're asking customers, or customers are making that decision, or what exactly was the question?\nSimon Leopold: Yeah. So, I'm not 100% sure, but I think it's customers asking to break apart some larger projects where they're buying a multitude of components from Cisco and essentially saying, let's not wait for the components you can't get. Ship me what you can, I'll get the other stuff elsewhere. I've heard these as anecdotes, and I'm trying to understand how substantive it is?\nChuck Robbins: Yeah. I have not heard any discussion on that particular topic, but it wouldn't surprise me. I mean, if I was a customer and if I had a project that I could actually drive some constructive ROI by doing part of it, then I would split it up to try to get the part that I could get, for sure. I'll tell you what we are seeing, we are -- we have customers are being really good with us about telling us what they desperately need and what they're okay waiting for. They've been really great about saying, look, I'm not going to come tell you this guy is falling and tell you, I need everything in backlog tomorrow. But here's what I really need, here's what I need this time. Here's what I need this time. And so we've been working through that a lot with customers and that may be a variation of what you've heard. So that's the only thing that I can think of. On the Todd comment on the org chart, I think the comment is we don't want to ship our org chart. And we talked at Cisco Live about a huge number of `cross-business unit technology combinations that we were delivering. I'll give you a couple of examples, but this is what he's talking about. Like our Secure Connects plus that we started shipping includes SD-WAN technology from the enterprise networking team and cloud security from the security team brought together in a managed as-a-service offer for customers. There's integration going on between AppDynamics and ThousandEyes that actually will be bidirectional intelligence. It will flow between those two. You've got AppDynamics doing the same thing with Talos and other aspects of the security portfolio for that exact reason. You've got -- before Jonathan took on all of the portfolio that Todd had and his own, there was a lot of work Todd was doing with Jonathan's team around private 5G and how do we build private 5G services through a combination of those. So that's what Todd is talking about. I think the teams have done a good job of really leading with what the customer needs and not building from the way the org chart is built. And that's what he's talking about.\nSimon Leopold: Great. Thanks for that clarification.\nChuck Robbins : Okay.\nMarilyn Mora : Thanks, Simon.\nChuck Robbins : Good. All right. Well, thank you all. Before we wrap, I want to make a few closing comments. I just first want to say, I'm really proud of what our teams have achieved. It's obviously a very dynamic environment, and the teams have really shown great execution and great focus. We did have tough compares, and so we worked really hard to try to give you a different way of looking at the demand, and we'll just -- we'll let you know if we see anything change when we come back together in the next call. But right now, demand remains solid. I think customers really do understand the value that technology brings to their strategy. I also appreciate what our supply chain teams have achieved, and we're encouraged by what we're seeing and how that supply, hopefully, will continue to ease throughout the year. The business model transition is really helping us, give you more visibility and predictability. And I'm also proud of how our team has rallied around our purpose. Just a couple of comments. This year, we set another a record, a record high number of employees who were given back into their communities. Our Net Zero by 2024 target and near-term targets were just approved by the science-based targets initiative under its Net Zero standard. So we're not only committed to our own goals, but also building technology that helps our customers meet their own goals. Lastly, we've been named the number one Great Place to Work in 20 countries around the world. And on any day, I will be proud of that, but this is super important right now given the competition for talent around the world, and it really does make a difference when we're trying to hire new talent into the organization. It really makes us more resilient than ever, and I think we're well positioned for long-term growth, and I want to thank all of you for spending time with us today. Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora : Thanks, Chuck. So I'll go ahead and close out the call. Cisco is the next quarterly earnings call, which will reflect our fiscal year 2023 first quarter results, will be on Wednesday, November 16, 2022 at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time, 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.

            "name": "Chuck Robbins",
            "content": "Thank you, Marilyn, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I'm very proud to share that we had a strong end to our fiscal year in the midst of an incredibly dynamic environment. In fact, we set several records with our performance this year. Let me first touch on those. For the full year of fiscal 22, we delivered record non-GAAP EPS of $3.36. Record product orders, which fueled our backlog to the highest level ever recorded, as well as our second strongest year of revenue in the history of the company at $51.6 billion. We continue to see strong customer adoption of our software and subscriptions, driven by the targeted investments we've been making. We also had record net income, which reflects our operating discipline, despite external challenges, including supply chain and inflation. Our ongoing business transformation continues to show progress across our KPIs, with annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, and remaining performance obligations, or RPO, both setting record highs. These important metrics illustrate the increasing recurring nature of our revenue streams. This, combined with our record backlog, provides us with enhanced visibility into our business looking forward. While this was certainly a complex year, we executed well. I want to thank our teams for their perseverance, determination and unwavering commitment to our customers and our partners. Our team's commitment to accelerated innovation has put us in a unique position of strength for fiscal 2023 and over the long term. Now, I want to be clear on our outlook for fiscal 2023. We expect strong performance across our portfolio, driven by our continued focus on innovation and easing of supply constraints to drive solid top line growth and profitability. While we anticipated some moderation from the unprecedented product order growth of last year, demand signals remain solid. We do expect to continue to experience higher costs in the short term, driven primarily by higher component, freight and logistics costs, which is reflected in our Q1 guide. However, as you'll see in our annual guidance, we expect this margin pressure to begin to ease as the year progresses. Long term, there are many multi-year growth opportunities ahead of us, that gives me confidence in our future. There are currently more technology transitions occurring concurrently than I've seen in 20 years. Long-term megatrends like hybrid cloud, hybrid work, security, IoT, 400 gig and beyond, 5G and Wi-Fi 6 as well as the move towards application observability will likely provide tailwinds to our growth. With our portfolio in such a strong position to help our customers, I'm quite optimistic about what's ahead. Before we discuss the quarter in detail, I want to provide some additional color on the supply situation and how we continue to build greater resiliency. After a challenging April due to the COVID-related shutdowns in Shanghai, and the impact on semiconductor and power supplies, overall supply constraints began to ease slightly at the back half of the fourth quarter and continuing into the start of Q1. While the component supply headwinds remain, they have begun to show early signs of easing. The decisions we made and the multiple actions we have taken over the past two years are helping to improve our resiliency and will help offset cost inflation. These include adding new suppliers, leveraging alternative suppliers, redesigning hundreds of products to use alternative components with similar capability and targeted price increases, all of which position us for the future. These actions along with the tremendous efforts by our supply chain team and the investments we've made in building capacity to meet growth have the potential to drive momentum into fiscal 2023. Moving to performance highlights in the quarter. We delivered revenue above the high end of our guidance range, and non-GAAP EPS came in at the high end of our guidance range. We achieved healthy operating margins and generated solid cash flow and returned nearly $4 billion to Cisco stockholders through cash dividends and share repurchases. With annual product order growth of 14% for the fiscal year, we exited the year with record product backlog. In addition, our RPO totaled more than $31 billion, and when combined with low cancellation rates, which remain below pre-pandemic levels, this sets the stage for increased visibility and strong revenue growth as we head into fiscal 2023. In terms of our product orders this quarter, we delivered the second highest orders in absolute dollars in the history of the company. It was second only to our performance in Q4 of fiscal 2021 and on a sequential basis it was up greater than 15% with strong growth in enterprise, commercial and public sector. From an annual growth rate perspective, we clearly faced some very tough comparisons from the record orders we saw in Q4 last year, where we had over 30% growth. Based on that, the year-over-year decline was not a surprise nor is it concerning. It's important to keep in mind that in the near term, the rate and pace of our revenue growth is much more a function of component availability than on our quarterly product order growth. With RPO of over $31 billion, almost $17 billion of which will be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months and a record backlog, we have great top line visibility. Thanks to the relentless effort of our entire organization, the business remains stronger than before the pandemic. From a demand perspective, we continue to experience solid customer activity beyond our ability to deliver as is reflected in the growth of our backlog that we saw throughout the quarter. While our business is not immune to macro trends, we will remain disciplined in our operations, while benefiting from robust multiyear investment trends and the technology transitions I mentioned earlier. Our innovation is helping our customers and partners navigate an increasing amount of complexity, and there is a greater sense of urgency to leverage leading-edge technologies to deliver on their strategic objectives. This is leading them to consistently look to Cisco and our unique and differentiated innovation to help them advance their most pressing business priorities. We recently held our Cisco Live customer event in-person for the first time in three years and had over 15,000 in attendance, including thousands of our largest customers and many more participating virtually. Our discussions with them focused on strategic projects, supply assurance and the critical role Cisco can play to support their long-term technology road maps. They did not indicate any fundamental shift in their commitment to technology investments. Regardless of what the coming quarters may bring, we have a proven track record of being able to adjust in difficult environments. Our value proposition to our customers remains as strong as ever. In our web scale business, we continue to see momentum even as the business becomes larger, as product orders were up more than 50% on a trailing four-quarter basis. We see significant opportunity ahead as these customers build out massively scalable cloud networks and increasingly turn to Cisco to help them meet accelerating demand for cloud services. Our leadership in silicon, optics, software and systems enables us to win as hyperscalers value industry-leading performance and innovation. We are expanding our footprint, driven by data center build-outs with our Silicon One-based Cisco 8000 routers, the fastest-growing platforms in Cisco's history. Together with optics from Acacia, we have a strong foundation for 400-gig and beyond to rearchitect the Internet with routed optical networking. In addition, we recently booked and shipped our first 800-gig systems to one of our web scale customers. On the IoT front, we also now have more than 200 million connected things on our cloud platform with growth driven by connected car. We finished fiscal 2022 with product orders in excess of $1 billion and growing double digits. We continue to make progress on our transformation to more software and subscription-based recurring revenue. ARR of approximately $23 billion was up 8% with product ARR increasing by 13%. We had strong subscription revenue this quarter, driven by our growing portfolio of recurring offers. While our software revenue was down slightly, once supply constraints improve and we begin to increase product shipments, we expect to see an improvement in software, subscription and services that are attached to hardware products in our backlog. The investments we've made in innovation are paying off as our competitive position is very strong. In Q4, we introduced several new cloud delivered innovations across our portfolio to help organizations drive productivity and resiliency. We launched Nexus Cloud, a platform to help our customers deploy, manage and operate their data center networks from the cloud. In addition, we introduced Calisti and Panoptica, two new cloud native API-first tools for faster and better application development. We also announced AppDynamics Cloud, a next-generation version of our observability platform for cloud native applications. In addition, we shared our strategy to help our customers connect their entire security architecture with our new platform, Cisco Security Cloud, which will be a game changer for them as they look to secure their multi-cloud environments with a single cloud-delivered security platform. This is just one part of our broader security innovation cycle. Building on the double-digit growth we saw in security this quarter, we are investing across our security business, focusing on cloud based offerings, best-in-class AI driven threat detection and end-to-end security architectures. These innovations position us well for leadership in the security market. In summary, we executed well on our strategy and transformation during what remains a very dynamic time. This led to a strong close to our fiscal year, setting several records across our business, thanks to the solid execution from our teams, our market-leading innovation and our continued growth of recurring revenue. We also took decisive actions to help offset inflation and build resiliency in our supply chain, while investing in our business to position us well for long-term growth. The power of our technology continues to be a critical driver of economic growth and productivity. Our results and outlook demonstrate the critical role that Cisco plays as a leader in bringing innovative technology solutions to customers today and into the future. As we move into fiscal 2023, we remain guided by our purpose-led culture and deeply committed to delivering value for our customers, partners and investors, as well as continuing to be an amazing place to work for our employees. I will now turn it over to Scott. Thanks, Tim. So let's start with the software. And you're right, the software is flattish. There's two things that I would point out. We have -- we, obviously, have been transitioning from perpetual software model, which is in decline, and that's by design. We want to decline our perpetual software and increase our subscription software. And the way I think about it is, our perpetual was down roughly 14% during the quarter. And we also, as Scott said, have over $2 billion, and it's actually a higher number exiting Q4 than it was in Q3 of software in backlog, as you said, connected to hardware. So those are two contributing factors, which is why we really should be thinking about the ARR situation because that's reflective of the ACV that we basically had exiting the quarter. And it's -- so that's an indicator of future software revenue. So we're comfortable with it. And I think once we get through some of the supply chain stuff that we'll start to see that be a little more reflective of what we've been planning on. On the cloud vertical, we continue to win new insertions. That business is approaching 3 billion annually now after just two or three short years ago, it was pretty close to nothing. And so the teams have done a fantastic job. It is, obviously, over the last four quarters, it's grown 50%. From a revenue perspective, it's very supply chain dependent. So I wouldn't get too wrapped up about the revenue versus the orders right now. I think we'll work our way through that over the next four to five quarters. But overall, really pleased with where we are. Yes, Rod, I saw some folks who thought we would be down 15%. So I think it's just different ways of modeling. When we were thinking about this question, and we obviously know that 31% and then in Q1, we're comparing is 33%. We were trying to find other ways to look at the business to indicate the reality of the demand signal. So let me just give you a few of those characteristics. First of all, from a product order perspective, as I said, it was the second highest in history, which would be only eclipsed by Q4 a year ago, and it grew 15%. And on a sequential basis, that's actually in range with our historicals. If you go back to -- if you take out last year, which was an abnormal sequential then it's very much in line, it's in the range of what we've seen for the last 10 years, the 15%. You had enterprise, public sector and commercial, all growing in solid double-digits on a sequential basis, and again, growing sequentially off our largest third quarter product bookings ever. We also have continued growth in the pipeline. As we exited Q4, we saw very good growth in pipeline, which is a good indicator of going forward. And the final thing I would tell you is that if you -- the way our sales teams forecasted the quarter at the beginning of month three, they revised their forecast for the quarter, and they finished stronger than they thought they would, and we had strength as we exited the quarter. And so linearity was solid. And so we just haven't seen anything that would indicate a significant shift in the demand signal from our customers. Yes, it's a good question. And we -- what I would say is that, we are not immune to any significant change in the macro that would result in enterprise spending shifting up. My comments are just that, we haven't seen a material demand signal change as we've entered into Q1. So that's where we are. I think on last call, I believe, I talked a lot about how I believe that post pandemic, the view of technology by our customers is much different than it would have been seven, eight, nine years ago there. I think if you ask our customers if they would pause spending during a crisis, they would probably respond, when is there not going to be a crisis, given what we've dealt with the last three years. And so, in general, we don't hear a lot of difference, relative to your question around have we seen any different buying behavior or what are they trying to buy from us. In some cases, customers are looking for a little shorter ROI, so that affects how they think about what products they're buying in these kinds of times. In some cases, customers are looking ahead to lead times to fiscal 2023 budgets and trying to better understand what their budgets are going to look like, because the shipments and the payments would be in the 2023 time frame. But other than that, we're not seeing anything significantly different. Thanks, Amit. Thanks, Meta. So on the first one, I'd say, that it's a combination of both of those. We -- as we said earlier, we saw increased volumes in the broker network during the quarter, which candidly was an opportunity we took advantage of, which is why you saw the higher top line, we were able to get more products shipped to our customers, which we obviously were very happy about, but we had to pay more for those components, and we think that will continue probably over the next 60 to 90 days. And then, we think, some of those purchases will begin to become available from the same suppliers that have put the excess inventory into the marketplace. At the same time, we have \u2013 and I think I said this on our last call, we've had hundreds of product design \u2013 redesigns going on. And two of our high volume products that also have good margins will begin to ship in the redesigned space sort of towards the latter into Q1, and then into the balance of the year, which we think will be helpful as well. So it's a combination of both of those things. And that's what gives us a little bit of optimism that things will continue to improve during the year. On the second question, on the valuations, I've had this one a few times, and I've been asked, if our M&A strategy has changed because of the valuations. And I've said that, our strategy hasn't changed, but the openness to talk to us from some of the \u2013 the companies that thought they had different strategic exits might have changed. And so we haven't changed our strategy. We just think that, it potentially creates more opportunity for us with companies that might not have been willing because they thought there was a high-flying IPO, ahead of them that they may not believe is the case right now. And the market is obviously taking a much different view on profitability versus just growth. Great. Thanks, Tal. So we \u2013 I think Scott has touched on it that, the revenue for fiscal year 2023 is much more a byproduct of component availability than it necessarily is connected to demand. But I will tell you that, our current models would have us exiting fiscal 2023 with roughly the same backlog as we're entering FY 2023. And so \u2013 and then as you look at the different segments that you've described, we had small business growth in Q4. I think it was double digits on a global basis, which is a good sign that that's continuing to grow. And then when we dissect it, commercial grew 39% a year ago. So sequentially in double digits, Enterprise was up in the mid-20s last year. So, sequentially growing in high double digits. Those are good signs for us. And then the pipeline growth that, we've seen as we exited the quarter just says that, there's still a lot out there. And so right now, we're modeling for just the things to continue as we see them and taking into consideration as you ask me to go around the regions, I think Asia and Europe, we had conversations with our team this week and they seem to -- they continue to be reasonably optimistic as we are in the Americas. And so it was a pretty consistent story. Scott? No, we don't see anything. What I would tell you about the service provider business is that because of the long lead times, we started a process of doing long-term planning with them that I've talked about before. And so we actually have deferred bookings that don't show up anywhere right now, approaching $0.5 billion, that because they're outside of our standard shipment window when they would like to get those. So we've got orders out quarters from now from them that are all non-cancelable because of the contracts that we've done. So we feel good about that momentum. We think that those customers will continue to spend in all of the trends that we've talked about. And given that we just shipped our first 800-gig system to one of the web scale players, we can continue to see them take advantage of these higher speed platforms. Now, Tal, you also asked about security? So we saw -- I think Scott mentioned this in his -- we had some really good growth and some backlog movement, to be honest, on the firewall side. So we had a really solid quarter on shipments from a firewall perspective. But we also had strength in our endpoint business. We had strengthened our Zero Trust business. And we're continuing to -- that is the number one investment area for the company this year, and it is -- we're continuing to drive, I think, greater innovation there and evolve that portfolio as we've described strategically. So I think we'll just continue to see improvement. But this quarter did get a boost from us clearing some backlog in the firewall space. Thanks. Yeah, Samik, thank you. I'll comment on -- the small business was again strong, as I spoke about just a moment ago. I think it's really important when you have these abnormal year-over-year comparisons for us to find other ways to assess the strength, which is why we looked at the sequential growth. And sequentially, they're both up in double-digits, both commercial and enterprise, which against a very large quarter, a quarter ago. And so we're comfortable right now that they're moving as they should be. Candidly, for commercial to grow at all after the extreme growth that we had a year ago was actually quite positive. So I actually view that favorably given the strength that they showed a year ago, it was probably the highest growth rate we've had in forever in that space or at least in the last 10 years. So overall, I think we don't see any sort of significant demand shift, as I said earlier. On the collab front, it's a little bit like the security message that I gave a few minutes ago. We had a -- we did clear a lot of device business in the backlog. So the growth, as Scott said in his opening comments, was driven largely by the device business and offset by some declines we had in meetings and calling. But I will say that the teams are working really hard on the meetings and calling side. Those have been strong. The calling side has been strong for us in the past few quarters. The product portfolio is in really good shape. The Net Promoter Score for our meetings platform is now 64 and that was 1 million customer responses. So it's a huge -- it's a hugely improved experience. And this year, the teams are really focused on trying to get that back to growth. But we've got a lot of work to do. Okay. First of all, I think, market share is a very difficult thing to assess right now, to your point, because of everything sitting in the backlog. I do believe that Q4 was the second largest Cat 9000 shipment quarter in the history of the product. So that would indicate that it's strong. And I think as we continue to clear our backlog or work through it, not clear it, but as we work through our backlog, you'll see some share come out. But I would encourage you to look at market share over a trending quarter time frame as opposed to a point in time because you just never know. We've got some products that we've been redesigning that we have backlog that we'll begin to ship and mass that will actually flip market share numbers pretty significantly. And my competitor is going to be telling you exactly what I'm telling you right now. So it's something you just got to watch over time. And so, I'm not -- I mean, clearly, we have competition in the campus. We have very strong competition, we always have. And -- but given the volume of the products that we're shipping right now, I don't feel like we're losing significant share. Yeah. So let me take the networking \u2013 the resilience of the networking market first. And then, Scott, you can take the margin question. So Paul, the \u2013 I think you're right. And I've said this repeatedly, I think what what's driven this is there are two things. Number one, the pandemic revealed the impact of not keeping your core infrastructure technology up to speed. Customers struggled, and I think it made them realize that they had a lot of tech debt that needed to be dealt with. And they don't want to get in that position again. So that's the first thing. But the second thing is all of these mega trends that I mentioned in my opening comments, I mean, these customers are re-architecting their entire infrastructure for the first time in years to deal with hybrid cloud and to deal with, all of the mobile workers. We see IoT exploding. You see, all of the climate activity is going to be a tailwind to our business, because you have to connect all these industrial systems, to be able to control them. You've got to shift to 400 gig. I mean, let me just \u2013 I'll give you a data point, 400 gig ports we're up almost 700% year-over-year for us. We've got over 1,000 customers now that have bought 400 gig and we shipped our first 800 gig. So it's just \u2013 all these trends continue, you got 5G, you've got WiFi-6. You've got this application observability, the re-architecture of applications. So I think it's a combination of the realization of the pandemic brought on around technology debt and never letting them get to that point and then these mega trends that are going on. And Scott, do you want to take the gross margin question? Yeah. We didn't give that stat and that's not one that I want to start giving every quarter. Ben, what we did say qualitatively is it grew again. And what I'll tell you is, it was up actually up triple digits again on a year-on-year basis. The overall backlog, software backlog is a pretty significant headwind to our software growth it's well north of the $2 billion that we talked about. So Simon, if I could ask you to clarify for me is on the short-term question, I didn't quite understand. You're saying that we are breaking up orders or we're asking customers, or customers are making that decision, or what exactly was the question? Yeah. I have not heard any discussion on that particular topic, but it wouldn't surprise me. I mean, if I was a customer and if I had a project that I could actually drive some constructive ROI by doing part of it, then I would split it up to try to get the part that I could get, for sure. I'll tell you what we are seeing, we are -- we have customers are being really good with us about telling us what they desperately need and what they're okay waiting for. They've been really great about saying, look, I'm not going to come tell you this guy is falling and tell you, I need everything in backlog tomorrow. But here's what I really need, here's what I need this time. Here's what I need this time. And so we've been working through that a lot with customers and that may be a variation of what you've heard. So that's the only thing that I can think of. On the Todd comment on the org chart, I think the comment is we don't want to ship our org chart. And we talked at Cisco Live about a huge number of `cross-business unit technology combinations that we were delivering. I'll give you a couple of examples, but this is what he's talking about. Like our Secure Connects plus that we started shipping includes SD-WAN technology from the enterprise networking team and cloud security from the security team brought together in a managed as-a-service offer for customers. There's integration going on between AppDynamics and ThousandEyes that actually will be bidirectional intelligence. It will flow between those two. You've got AppDynamics doing the same thing with Talos and other aspects of the security portfolio for that exact reason. You've got -- before Jonathan took on all of the portfolio that Todd had and his own, there was a lot of work Todd was doing with Jonathan's team around private 5G and how do we build private 5G services through a combination of those. So that's what Todd is talking about. I think the teams have done a good job of really leading with what the customer needs and not building from the way the org chart is built. And that's what he's talking about. Okay. Good. All right. Well, thank you all. Before we wrap, I want to make a few closing comments. I just first want to say, I'm really proud of what our teams have achieved. It's obviously a very dynamic environment, and the teams have really shown great execution and great focus. We did have tough compares, and so we worked really hard to try to give you a different way of looking at the demand, and we'll just -- we'll let you know if we see anything change when we come back together in the next call. But right now, demand remains solid. I think customers really do understand the value that technology brings to their strategy. I also appreciate what our supply chain teams have achieved, and we're encouraged by what we're seeing and how that supply, hopefully, will continue to ease throughout the year. The business model transition is really helping us, give you more visibility and predictability. And I'm also proud of how our team has rallied around our purpose. Just a couple of comments. This year, we set another a record, a record high number of employees who were given back into their communities. Our Net Zero by 2024 target and near-term targets were just approved by the science-based targets initiative under its Net Zero standard. So we're not only committed to our own goals, but also building technology that helps our customers meet their own goals. Lastly, we've been named the number one Great Place to Work in 20 countries around the world. And on any day, I will be proud of that, but this is super important right now given the competition for talent around the world, and it really does make a difference when we're trying to hire new talent into the organization. It really makes us more resilient than ever, and I think we're well positioned for long-term growth, and I want to thank all of you for spending time with us today. Thank you."

            "content": "Thanks, Chuck. I'll first provide some detail on our financial results for the quarter, then cover the full fiscal year, followed by our guidance. Our overall Q4 results reflect strong execution in an environment with continuing supply constraints. And as Chuck mentioned, increased costs reflected in our gross margins. We're very pleased that our shipment levels were above our expectations and that total revenue of $13.1 billion exceeded the high end of our guidance range, as we saw improvement in supply as a direct result of the numerous actions we've taken over multiple quarters. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 32.4%, down 110 basis points and in line with our guidance. Non-GAAP net income was $3.4 billion, down 3% and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.83, coming in at the high end of our guidance range. Looking at our Q4 revenue in more detail. Total product revenue was $9.7 billion, and service revenue was $3.4 billion both flat year-over-year. Within product revenue, Secure, Agile Networks was down 1%. Switching declined in both data center and campus driven by supply constraints. We saw growth in our Catalyst 9000, Nexus 9000 and Meraki switching offerings. Enterprise routing decline primarily driven by Edge and SD-WAN offset by strength in access. Wireless had strong growth, driven primarily by our Meraki wireless offerings. We also had double-digit growth in servers. Internet for the future was down 10% with strength in web scale revenue, offset by declines in cable, edge and optical. Collaboration was up 2%, driven by growth in collaboration devices, partially offset by declines in our meetings and calling offerings. End-to-end security had record revenue with strong growth of 20%, driven by strength across the entire portfolio. Our Zero Trust portfolio continues to perform well, driven by strong performance in our dual offering. Optimized application experiences had solid growth of 8%, driven by double-digit growth in our SaaS-based offering, ThousandEyes. We continue to make progress on our transformation metrics, as we shift our business to more software and subscriptions. We saw strong performance in our ARR of $22.9 billion, an increase of 8% with product ARR growth of 13% driven by several large software transactions closing during the quarter. Total software revenue was $3.9 billion, a decrease of 2% with software subscription revenue up 1%. Bear in mind, we continue to have well over $2 billion of software orders in our product backlog. 83% of the software revenue was subscription based, which is up 2 percentage points year-over-year. Total subscription revenue was $5.8 billion, an increase of 2%. Total subscription revenue represented 44% of Cisco's total revenue. And RPO was $31.5 billion, up 2%, product RPO increased 6%. Service RPO decreased 1%, and our total short-term RPO grew 4% to $16.9 billion. Total product orders in Q4 were the second highest in our history. While product orders were down 6% for the quarter, it's important to keep in mind that the compare against 31% growth a year ago, which was the highest product orders in our history. On a sequential basis, product order growth was up over 15%, with double-digit growth in enterprise, commercial and public sector. Looking at our geographic segments year-over-year. The Americas was down 9%, EMEA down 4%, and APJC up 1%. In our customer markets, Enterprise was down 15%, Public Sector was down 3%, Service Provider was down 7% and commercial was up 1%. From a non-GAAP perspective, total gross margin came in at 63.3% and down 230 basis points year-on-year. Product gross margin was 61.3%, down 370 basis points, and service gross margin was 69%, up 160 basis points. In our product gross margin, higher component and commodity costs, as well as higher freight and logistics related to supply constraints, were the predominant drivers of lower-than-expected margins. We saw increased benefits from the pricing actions we have taken, as well as for mix. Once again, we had a significant increase in our backlog levels for both hardware and software, well beyond our normal historical levels. As Chuck said, our ending product backlog was a record for the year. And just a reminder, backlog is not included as part of the $31.5 billion in remaining performance obligations. It's important to note that the combined total of our backlog and RPO gives us great visibility into our fiscal 2023 top line growth. We ended Q4 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $19.3 billion. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $3.7 billion, down 18% year-over-year, primarily driven by advanced payments and inventory purchases to secure future supply. In capital allocation, we returned $4 billion to shareholders during the quarter, was comprised of $2.4 billion of share repurchases and $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend. Turning to the full fiscal year results. Overall, our financial results were solid in a year where we faced significant supply constraints, rising component and related costs and the war in Ukraine. Our financial performance was highlighted by strong demand, with product order growth of 14%, including two quarters of truly impressive 33% growth, though our performance was clearly impacted by the supply constraints. Revenue was $51.6 billion, up 3%, while non-GAAP earnings per share were up 4%, at $3.36. In terms of our software metrics, total software revenue was flat, at $15.1 billion, with the product portion up 2%, 81% of software revenue was subscription-based, which is up 2 percentage points year-on-year. Total subscription revenue was $22.4 billion, an increase of 2% and total subscription revenue represented 43% of Cisco's total revenue. Total non-GAAP gross margin was 64.6%, down 150 basis points and our non-GAAP operating margin was 33.6%, up 10 basis points. On the bottom line, non-GAAP net income was $14.1 billion, up 3%. We delivered operating cash flow of $13.2 billion, down 14% compared to fiscal 2021, driven primarily by advanced payments for inventory purchases to secure component supply. While these payments had a negative impact on full year operating cash flow, these and our other related actions helped to improve the supply situation in Q4 and future quarters. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned approximately $14 billion in value to our shareholders via cash dividends and stock repurchases, representing 109% of our free cash flow. This was comprised of $7.7 billion of share repurchases and $6.2 billion in quarterly cash dividends. We also increased our dividend for the 11th consecutive year in fiscal 2022, reinforcing our commitment to returning excess capital to our shareholders, and our confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows. Our strong balance sheet and overall financial position is clearly a competitive advantage in tough environments. To summarize, we executed well in Q4 and had a solid fiscal year and a high complex environment, while continuing to make progress in our business model shift, and making strategic investment and innovation to capitalize on our significant growth opportunities and expanding addressable markets. The demand for our products and services are strong as we drive innovation through continued investment and the shift to more recurring revenue delivering growth and driving shareholder value. Turning to our financial guidance for Q1, we expect revenue growth to be in the range of 2% to 4%. We anticipate non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 63% to 64%. Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 31.5% to 32.5%, and non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.82 to $0.84. For fiscal 2023, our guidance is as follows. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 4% to 6% year-on-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is expected to range from $3.49 to $3.56, also up 4% to 6% year-on-year. In both our Q1 and full year guidance, we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn, so we can move into the Q&A. Yeah. Thanks, Sami. As we look at the forecast that we've given you for fiscal 2023, balance growth again, 4% to 6% growth on the top line, 4% to 6% growth on the bottom line. When you start to peel that back, of course, we don't guide at that level, what we have seen, as you'd expect, is, again, nice demand, as Chuck talked about on the call, through the end of the fourth quarter, but a little bit different by industry vertical. Retail, not surprisingly, under a little bit of pressure. Financial services under a little bit of pressure. Pretty much strength across most of the rest of the sector, a little bit of pressure in health care as well. So that's \u2013 as we roll into fiscal 2023, that's what we're seeing kind of vertical by vertical. We saw good double-digit growth sequentially, again, Q3 to Q4, because the year-on-year compares are quite difficult with that 31% growth we had a year ago, but good sequential growth, if you look at it by customer market in both enterprise, public sector and commercial. So again, seeing pretty balanced growth across the board and that's our expectation as we roll into fiscal 2023. On the gross margin question, we are getting a benefit from price. One of the things that we've talked about, though, is there's a lag between the price increases that we put in place and what we see actually showing up in reported revenues. And I know, you know, this from prior quarters, Sami, we saw some of that benefit in Q4, and you'll see this in our filings in our 10-Q \u2013 our 10-K filing for the end of the quarter. It's about 1%, up year-on-year gross margin driven by price and then, of course, the offset coming from higher cost, both component costs and freight and logistics. Yes, Rod, so there was not - to be clear on your question, there was no change in the way we report year-on-year. It's exactly the same. The only other thing that I would add, too, to the comments that Chuck just made, linearity in the quarter was quite strong. In fact, the last week of the quarter was actually the same size as it had been in the prior year and the month-to-month linearity was exactly in line with last year and with prior year's expectations. So we saw strength right through the end of Q4. Yes. What's sitting in inventory, Rod, is the rest of the parts that aren't under constraint, so that as the ones that are constrained free up, of course, we can square the set and get the product shipped out the door to our customers. So it is growing. It's up about $1 billion year-on-year, sitting at $2.5 billion. Our advanced payments are up as well. Both of those are a bit of a headwind to cash flows, as you saw. But yes, it's much more a statement of making sure we've got everything we need, so that as those constrained parts clear up, which we saw a little bit of that towards the end of Q4, we can square the sets and get it out the door and in the hands of our customers. Yes. So there's no added buyback in there. We've talked about our cap allocation policy. Our share buybacks have both a systemic component to it that's just offsetting the shares that we issued through our equity plans and an opportunistic component. On the -- what's our expectation on gross margin through the year. Of course, we don't guide that for the full year, Amit. But what I'd say is, my expectation is, as we go through the year and we can work through the backlog, we'll begin to ship out of that backlog more and more orders that actually reflect the price increases that we put in place last year. And as we do, of course, that will be a tailwind to margins throughout the year. So I would see margins going up as much as 50 basis points, between our first quarter guide and where we end the year. Thanks, Amit. Yeah. Probably the only thing I'd add is as you look at that 4% to 6% growth that we've forecasted now for fiscal 2023, it is absolutely supply constrained. So while the supply situation we saw late in our fourth quarter that we just closed, there were some easing. Easing doesn't mean it's over. We're going to have supply constraints throughout fiscal 2023 and just a few areas were it not for those, we would be growing much more quickly. It's not a case of demand. We're not demand constrained. We were supply constrained in fiscal 2023. Yes. This -- I'll start, Chuck, and if you want to jump in, let's do that. From a component availability standpoint, Ittai, that's been the most fluid area of our forecast over the last several quarters. And as we look ahead, we did see signs of stability during Q4. And as I said, in the late in Q4 that we just closed, we actually saw some improvement. The way that improvement showed up was availability of some of the constrained parts that we have been chasing in the broker network. And obviously, when you buy from the broker network, you pay a premium for those. And you see that reflected in the gross margins. I think there'll still be some of that in Q1. You see that reflected in our gross margin guide in Q1. And then it gets better as the year goes on, not because -- I'm not assuming any price declines or any cost declines coming from our suppliers. I think the -- I don't see them lining up to come back and say, hey, good news, Scott and Chuck. We're going to charge you less for the component parts. There may be some benefit in freight and logistics. We'll see, as commercial airlift comes back online. I think the benefits we'll get will be much more from shipping more out of our backlog that are orders that were received after we did the price increases last year. Yes. Again, our guidance assumes that we continue to be supply constrained through the year. As I said, if we could get more supply, we would be growing more quickly in fiscal 2023. So we'll continue to be supply constrained. Our modeling shows that our backlog, as we exit fiscal 2023, Chuck touched on this earlier, that we think the dollar value, obviously, it's not the same orders, but the dollar value is roughly unchanged from the dollar value we roll into fiscal 2023 with. So I think we'll continue to face component availability headwinds throughout the year. Yes. We don't forecast order growth, as you know, Ittai. So that's not one that I want to jump into at this point. I think the -- probably the key takeaway would be, we're not demand constrained. We're supply constrained, as you look at 2023. Thanks, Ittai. Yeah. I think, Paul, on the gross margin question, I think you nailed the trends. I don't expect input costs, particularly around semis to come down. I look forward to the day that I come to the office and there's a message from our semiconductor suppliers saying, hey, good news, your price is going down. I just don't see that happening. Price will offset part of it. I think you got that part right, too. I think the other \u2013 the only thing I would add that probably in your thinking, but you didn't say it, so I will. Over the longer term, as we mix more software in, that will be a tailwind at the gross margin line. So just add that to your thinking, and I think you've got it nailed. I don't want to get into forecasting the longer term at that level of granularity right now, Paul. Okay. Yeah. There's a couple of dynamics going on in RPO. So I'd say, in general, you're right, obviously, duration has an effect on RPO as well, but it varies a bit by product line. So for the quarter, we just announced the 6% product RPO growth. We had double-digit product RPO growth in secure Agile Networks, an optimized app experiences and in security, almost forgot. And we had high single-digit growth in Internet for the future. I'd say that the headwind there, of course, is collab from an RPO standpoint. So longer term, I think you'd expect those dynamics to continue. And as we turn around the go-to-market and the sales side of collab, that will flip from being a headwind to more of a tailwind on product RPO growth."

If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.\nMarilyn Mora: Welcome everyone to Cisco's third quarter fiscal 2022 quarterly earnings conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO; and Scott Herren, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the investor relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the financial information section of our investor relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be done on a year-over-year basis. Please note, included in the materials that accompany this call is a slide which summarizes the impacts from the war in Ukraine and the extra week in Q3 fiscal 2021. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2022. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties, including COVID-19, that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. I will now turn it over to Chuck.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Marilyn, and good afternoon, everyone. When we spoke with you back in February, we entered Q3 in the second half of our fiscal year with optimism despite the supply and component challenges and other headwinds impacting us and many of our peers. Many of those factors that fueled that optimism remain unchanged today. We continue to see strong demand resulting in record backlog, our business transformation is progressing well and our differentiated innovation across our portfolio is helping our customers embrace and adopt the multiple technology transitions happening. However, there were two unanticipated events since our last earnings call, which impacted our Q3 revenue performance. The first is the war in Ukraine. This resulted in us ceasing operations in Russia and Belarus and had a corresponding revenue impact, which Scott will discuss. The second relates to COVID related lockdowns in China, which began in late March. These lockdowns resulted in an even more severe shortage of certain critical components. This in turn prevented us from shipping products to customers at the levels we originally anticipated heading into Q3. Our Q4 guidance incorporates a wider than usual range, taking into account the revenue impact of the war in Ukraine and the continuing uncertainty related to the China COVID lockdowns. Given this uncertainty, we're being practical about the current environment and erring on the side of caution in terms of our outlook, taking it one quarter at a time. We believe that our revenue performance in the upcoming quarters is less dependent on demand and more dependent on the supply availability in this increasingly complex environment. While certain aspects of the current situation are largely out of our control, our teams have been working on several mitigation actions to help alleviate many of the component issues that we've been facing. We believe that we will begin to see the benefits of these actions in the first half of next fiscal year. Now let me talk more specifically about our third quarter performance. As I just mentioned, many of the positives we've discussed over the past few quarters remain, resulting in continued solid demand for our solutions. Total product orders grew 8% year-over-year leading to yet another record backlog of well over $15 billion, up 10% sequentially and up 130% year-over-year. This momentum reaffirms the critical role we play in our customers' futures. Our business transformation also progressed nicely. In Q3, we saw ARR growth of 11%, ending the quarter at over $22 billion, and product ARR growth of 18%. We also exited the quarter with over $30 billion in remaining performance obligations or RPO. We also delivered non-GAAP EPS at the high end of our guidance range. This was driven by effective pricing actions and spending discipline, all of which allowed us to offset lower volumes and deliver both gross and operating margins above the high end of our guidance range and deliver on our bottom-line profitability target for the quarter. I want to reiterate what I said earlier. The fundamental drivers across our business are strong. While we are facing some short-term challenges, it does not change our long-term outlook, our alignment to our customers' most critical challenges or our belief in the tremendous opportunities in front of us. Last week, we hosted our Global Customer Advisory Board meeting where we met with close to 100 customers. And they consistently shared that technology is at the heart of their strategy and has become even more important to everything they do. This driving not just their strategies, but also their overall business transformation. The technology they're adopting from Cisco is driving their business agility, allowing them to move with greater speed and empowering them to deliver differentiated experiences for their customers. Now I'd like to touch on some highlights from the quarter. We continue to see strong demand in several areas of our business. Our web-scale business remains strong as we continue to help these customers build their capabilities to connect and serve their customers and end users at scale from the data center to the edge. This is leading to continued strength in orders, which grew over 50% and on a trailing four-quarter basis, we had over 100% growth. This marks our ninth consecutive quarter of solid demand as we are winning new franchises, expanding our design wins and taking share in web scale. I remain incredibly proud of the progress we've made in the momentum we have in this space. We are also extremely pleased with the traction of our 400 gig solutions, including the Cisco 8,000, which is the fastest growing SP routing platform in Cisco's history. In addition, our Silicon One portfolio, ZR and ZR plus optics and our Acacia portfolio of optical networking products also continue to perform well. From a product revenue perspective, our performance was led by solid demand across a majority of our portfolio, including switching, SP routing, wireless, security and SD WAN. Our performance in these areas reflecting ongoing investments that our customers are making to rapidly digitize their organizations to deliver differentiated experiences. Looking forward, the shift to hybrid cloud, 5G, 400 gig, IoT, hybrid work and the explosion of applications are driving the increased need for next generation networking, connectivity, security, and observability solutions. Cisco is well positioned to deliver for our customers with our end-to-end platforms and solutions. I'm also very proud of our pace of innovation. During the quarter, Cisco announced new innovations across our networking and cloud portfolios along with technologies to enhance experiences and hybrid work environments. We also introduced our new predictive networks to help organizations learn, predict and avoid network disruptions. We have even more innovation, which we'll announce at RSA and our own Cisco Live event in June. In addition to our deep passion for innovation, all of us at Cisco believe we have a unique opportunity to help make the world a better place through both the technology we build and the purpose we rally around to power an inclusive future for all. I believe this intersection of technology and purpose is why we were named the number one Best Company to Work For in the U.S. by Fortune and Great Place to Work for the second year in a row. In summary, while the quarter clearly did not play out as expected, demand remains solid and the fundamentals of our business are strong. We remain focused on executing against the strategy we laid out at our Investor Day. We will also continue to be resolute in our focus to transform our business for more predictability and agility while bringing to market a robust pipeline of innovation. We remain confident in our long-term growth and the opportunities that we have in front of us. I want to thank our teams around the world for all that they do, executing with dedication, focus and excellence in an incredibly dynamic environment. They continue to focus on our customers with unparalleled innovation, resiliency and determination. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Scott.\nScott Herren: Thanks, Chuck. We saw solid growth in product orders, net income and earnings per share despite the challenges Chuck just outlined. Product order growth was driven by strength across most of our portfolio while disciplined spend and supply chain management drove our profitability. Total revenue was $12.8 billion, flat year-over-year. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 34.7%, up 110 basis points coming in above the high end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP net income was $3.6 billion, up 3% and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.87, up 5%, coming in at the high end of our guidance range. In March, we stopped business operations in both Russia and Belarus, which had a negative impact to revenue of approximately $200 million or two percentage points of growth. Historically, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine collectively have represented approximately 1% of our total revenue. The impact this quarter was a bit higher than our historical run rate due to additional charges to revenue we recorded for uncollectible receivables and other items. And as a reminder, Q3 of last year included an extra week, which was a benefit of total revenue in Q3 of '21 of approximately three full percentage points of growth. On a combined basis, the impact of the year-over-year total revenue growth rate for the extra week and the war in Ukraine was approximately five percentage points. Looking at our Q3 revenue in more detail, total product revenue was $9.4 billion, up 3%. Service revenue was $3.4 billion, down 8%, driven by the extra week in the prior year and the war in Ukraine, which combined, impacted our growth by approximately 8 percentage points. Within product revenue, Secure, Agile Networks was solid with revenues up 4%, switching grew driven by strength in data center switching with our Nexus 9000 products, campus switching growth was led by our Catalyst 9000 and Meraki switching offerings. Wireless had a double-digit increase driven by broad-based strength across our portfolio, including our WiFi-6 products and Meraki wireless offerings. We also had solid growth in Servers. Enterprise routing declined primarily driven by Edge and Access was slightly offset by strength in SD-WAN. Internet for the Future was up 6%, driven by strength in Acacia, optical, optics and core networking products including double-digit growth in the Cisco 8000. Collaboration was down 7%, driven by declines in our meetings, calling and contact center offerings, partially offset by the continued ramp of our communication platform-as-a-service. End-to-End Security grew 7% with broad strength across most of the portfolio. Our Zero Trust portfolio performed well with double-digit growth driven by strong performance in our Duo offering. Optimized Application Experiences was up 8%, driven by double-digit growth in both of our SaaS based offerings ThousandEyes and Intersight. We continue to make progress on our transformation metrics as we shift our business to more subscriptions and software. Total software revenue was $3.7 billion, a decrease of 3% with the product portion down 1%. Total software revenue growth would have been 5 points higher excluding the combined negative impact of the extra week in the prior year and the war in Ukraine. 83% of software revenue was subscription-based, which is up one percentage point year-on-year. Total subscription revenue was $5.5 billion, a decrease of 4%. Total subscription revenue would have been 7 points higher, excluding the combined negative impact of the extra week in the prior year and the war in Ukraine. Total subscription revenue represented 43% of Cisco's total revenue. Annualized recurring revenue or ARR was $22.4 billion, an increase of 11% with strong product ARR growth of 18%. And remaining performance obligations or RPO was $30.2 billion, up 7%. Product RPO increased 13%, service RPO increased 3%, and the total short term RPO grew 9% to $16.2 billion. We had solid product order growth in Q3 of 8% with strength across most of the business. Looking at our geographic segments, the Americas was up 9%, EMEA up 4%, and APJC up 11%. In our customer markets, commercial was up 19%, service provider was up 8%, public sector was up 4%, and enterprise was flat. From a non-GAAP perspective, total gross margin came in above the high end of our guidance range at 65.3%, down 70 basis points year-over-year. Product gross margin was 64.1%, down 80 basis points and service gross margin was 68.9%, up 20 basis points. The decrease in product gross margin was primarily driven by ongoing higher component costs related to supply constraints as well as higher freight and logistics costs, partially offset by strong positive pricing impact. We continue to manage through the supply constraints seen industrywide by us and our peers. To give a sense of scale of the shortages, we currently see constraints in Q4 on roughly 350 critical components, out of a total of 41,000 unique component part numbers. Our supply chain team is aggressively pursuing multiple options to close those shortages. Given our solid product orders, we once again saw a significant increase in our backlog levels for both hardware and software well beyond our normal historical levels. As Chuck said, our ending product backlog grew to well over $15 billion and software backlog grew to more than $2 billion, both up 10% sequentially. And just a reminder, backlog is not included as part of our $30.2 billion and remaining performance obligations. We ended Q3 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $20.1 billion. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $3.7 billion, down 6% year-over-year, primarily driven by advanced payments to secure future supply. These advanced payments had a negative 9 percentage point year-on-year impact on Q3 operating cash flow. In terms of capital allocation, we returned $1.8 billion to shareholders during the quarter, that was comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and approximately $250 million of share repurchases. Year-to-date, we have returned a total of approximately $10 billion in value to our shareholders via cash dividends and stock repurchases and more than $17 billion available under our Board stock repurchase authorization. To summarize, we're navigating the highly complex environment while continuing to make progress on our business model shift and making strategic investments in innovation to capitalize on our significant growth opportunities and expanding addressable markets. Now let me provide our financial guidance for Q4. In terms of supply, we expect the challenges we experienced in Q3 to continue into Q4. For next quarter, we expect revenue growth to be in the range of minus 1% to minus 5.5%. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 64% to 65%. Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 31.5% to 33.5% and non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.76 to $0.84. For the full year fiscal '22, guidance is as follows. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 2% to 3% year-on-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is expected to range from $3.29 to $3.37, up 2% to 5% year-on-year. In both our Q4 and full year guidance, we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Scott. Michelle, let's go ahead and queue up the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley Investment Research. You may go ahead.\nMeta Marshall: Great, thanks. Maybe Chuck, if you could just kind of give us sense and what you're seeing in macro from your customers? I know that the enterprise orders were flat year-over-year. Just -- are you seeing any change in their behavior either just given what's happening in overall macro conditions or just currency and inflation would be helpful? Thanks.\nChuck Robbins: Yes, Meta. Thank you. So on the demand issue, I'd point out a few things. Number one, without a 2-percentage point of orders that we de-booked relative to Russia and Belarus, we grew 10% against a year ago growth of 10%. So we feel good about that. Our customers are not signaling any real shift at this point. We're not hearing that from them. Again, we had our global customer advisory board just a couple of weeks ago where we had 100 of our biggest customers and they were all talking about projects in the strategic nature of everything they're trying to accomplish. The last thing I would point out is on the enterprise side, last quarter we grew 37%. Just to keep in mind the way we define enterprise is a finite list of named customers. So it tends to be more lumpy. If I look at how the industry defines enterprise, that would reflect a combination of our enterprise and our commercial business. So for comparisons to what we're hearing in the marketplace, I thought we would give you that combined number. If you combine enterprise and commercial together, we grew 9%, but without the Russia impact, we actually grew 12% and on a trailing 12 months basis it grew 28%. So we are still comfortable with the demand signals that we're seeing and our customers aren't telling us anything differently right now.\nMeta Marshall: Great, thanks. I'll pass it on.\nMarilyn Mora: Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. You may go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I guess Chuck, on the demand question again, just you're guiding to the fiscal fourth quarter to be now almost sort of similar to what the third quarter is or even down a bit, which is, if I go back historically, has never really -- I don't see many instances of that. I mean is that really a reflection of the supply environment or are there any other sort of aspects of demand stemming from the geopolitical sort of situation here that's impacting that? And when do we sort of start to see you sort of cycle past some of that? Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Yes. Samik, it's a great question. So let me start with just the basic answer is there is no reflection of demand issue in our Q4 guide, that has nothing to do with the Q4 guide. Let me try to describe how we got to that. I think it's important for everybody to understand. When we look at our Q3 results, we had -- from a revenue perspective, we had $200 million impact from us ceasing operations in Russia and corresponding revenue write-downs that occurred. Those were one-time. We then had, if you recall, our quarter ends at the end of April. Most of what you've heard from others, they are quarters into the end of March. So we experienced an entire quarter of the China lockdowns. In Shanghai, it was from March 27 until today. Shenzhen shut down, but again it opened up a week later, so we're talking really about the Shanghai situation. So we had $200 million from Russia and then we had $300 million that was completely attributed to our inability to get power supplies out of China. That's the simplicity of what caused the problem. As an example, we had 11,000 PCB assemblies built, we couldn't get power supplies for because of the lockdown. That's a simple fact of what happened in Q3. When we look at Q4 and you think about the Shanghai lockdown and what we've heard because in Shanghai, there are lots of components that go into our power supplies. So we're not able to get those components. Shanghai now is saying they're going to open up June 1. We don't know exactly what that means and what that means to when that implies that we would start getting any supply out. And correspondingly we believe when they open up and when they do allow transportation logistics to start up, we believe there is going to be a high degree of congestion. We believe that there is going to be lots of competition for ports capacity, airport capacity. And we just believe that that combined with the inbound efforts, trying to get raw materials back into the country, et cetera, we just believe that it's going to be impossible for us to catch up on this issue in Q4, which is what led to the guidance in Q4. So even though these top line numbers don't look good, it's very simple explanation as to what occurred. So then the follow-on part of your question is, when do we think this gets better. Well, if we make the assumption that China does begin to open up and we do begin to get more natural flow of the power supplies. We also have had our teams over the last six to nine months have been working on a lot of mitigating actions, redesigning 100 products, over 100 products to give us component diversity, we believe that a combination of those starting in our Q1 and in the first half of our year will start to see the benefit of that. So, that's when we expect to see it improve to some extent. We need to get through the next 90 days, but I'm just being as transparent as I can about what we see and when we think some of that improvement will occur.\nSamik Chatterjee: Thank you. Thanks for taking my question.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Samik. Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. You may go ahead, sir.\nIttai Kidron: Thanks. Hi, guys. I guess I want to dig into that a little bit, Chuck, on the supply chain. You seem to be much more impacted than some of your peers in the industry. So I'm just trying to gauge whether you have an unusually high exposure to China that others do not. Is there any color you can give us on what percentage of your components come from China and why is it that you stand out relative to a couple others? And I understand that you had in April quarter, some of them had in March, but they did report mid late April and none of them have signaled anything. And so clearly, they've seen what's happening in April and they haven't said anything. And then I guess as a second part of this, just thinking kind of longer term, just given the challenges to a geopolitically Ukraine, Russia and the risks that are associated with China on a geopolitical standpoint, but also clearly in their COVID policy, is there any some sort of a long-term planning that disconnects you from China as a source for components longer term?\nChuck Robbins: Yes, Ittai, thank you. Both good questions. I think on the first one, I think that the biggest differentiation was April. I have spoken to peers who are feeling the same thing we are that we are reporting the full month of impact and it wasn't April issue for us. So now on a normalized basis for that question across the portfolio, all of us design products with different components in. So there is opportunity for us to have a unique issue with one component that we may have designed into a product or we may have an unique advantage because we designed a certain component into a product. And those are the areas where I talked about we're redesigning where we have unique problems or just problems in general, though others may have the same problems. So we think that the exposure in general was because of the month of April. Also we do massive volumes. And in general, you would think that's a huge advantage, but just to put it in perspective, we shipped more revenue in the last week of our quarter than many of our competitors that you're referencing shipped in their entire quarter. So it's just an issue that it shows up in a bigger number for us than it would. If they have the same problem, it might be a $20 million impact for us, it might be a $200 million -- $400 million impact. So that's the first one. The second one what I would say is that we are constantly evaluating our global supply chain. And so it's not about one country, it's about resilience. And the way we've designed supply chains over the last 15-20 years as an industry, I think we all realize we're evolving that now at the same time that we're triaging all of the current issues that we have. So our teams have a dual challenge. But we are constantly driving geographic resilience. The example I would give is that we -- before COVID we had regional redundancy built in, we did not have a plan for a country to shut down. And so it takes time to go out and create that geographic resilience, but our teams are working on all of those kinds of things right now, so they will continue to do that Ittai.\nIttai Kidron: Okay, thanks.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Ittai. Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Simon Leopold with Raymond James. You may go ahead, sir.\nSimon Leopold: Thanks for taking the question. Hopefully, I'll make sense here, but I want to give this a shot. Your gross margin looked relatively resilient in the quarter and the outlook and your revenue was like we've seen the opposite from some of your peers. And I'm wondering if part of the issue is the usage of brokers in paying very high fees for parts in the -- I guess, secondary or tertiary markets, is that something you didn't do and that prevented you from reaching revenue, but allowed you to have a better gross margin? I'm just trying to understand some of your practices relative to your peers that allowed you have a good gross margin, but the lighter sales. Is that it will make sense?\nChuck Robbins: Yes. It absolutely does, Simon. Let me start and then I'll kick it to Scott to talk a little bit about it. So, first and foremost, we are incredibly active purchasers in the broker market. And you can imagine, with our buying power, they call us first. And so -- no, that has nothing to do with it. In fact, we've spent a lot of time with our supply chain team who had given us examples of where they've bought product in the broker market recently. So I don't think that's it. But Scott can explain what did happen there.\nScott Herren: Yes, it's a great question, Simon. What I'd add is, if you recall, we did two price increases this year. The first one enrolled in right about the end of the calendar year and the second one at the beginning of our second quarter. And we said at the time that we thought -- you continue to ask like what are those price increases, when they are going to show up in the top line? And we said we thought we would begin to see the benefit of those toward the end of the third quarter, which is the quarter we just closed and that's exactly what happened. So while the unit shipments in the quarter were off because of the issues that we've talked about with the supply chain with the component supply, the -- we were able to offset that with pretty strong pricing. In fact, the list -- we published this in our Q, so you'll see it there, but our pricing was up about 160 basis points in Q3. So while we do have a unit impact from the component supply, it was offset by some of the things that we're doing in the -- we are beginning to realize on the price front. We are actively pursuing every avenue. It's got to be a qualified vendor and so we're working to qualify different sources at the same time. We are actively pursuing that whether it's through a broker, obviously directly from the vendor, but through a broker, distributor, we're pursuing all those channels and that is creating a bit of a headwind to us.\nSimon Leopold: Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Michelle, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Sami Badri from Credit Suisse. You may go ahead.\nSami Badri: Hi, thank you. First one is a clarification on the product order growth number that was reported at 8%. Could you give us an idea on how much price increases contributed to the product order growth number? That's the first question. And then just a second question is, we're just trying to piece together and explain even after accounting for the Russia, Ukraine contribution, why enterprise would grow 0% versus some of your peers that are reporting far greater reports and trends in specifically enterprise? Could we just try to maybe triangulate a little bit more about what's going on there?\nChuck Robbins: Okay. First, I'll let Scott add on the price increase in a moment, but first of all, the price increase really did not have significant impact on our growth. We only passthrough pricing at the time that was offsetting our incremental cost. And to be honest, we've incurred more cost since then. So we were at a place right now where we have not even passed through all the costs that we have incurred. We're getting price increases all the time now. So that's the first answer. On the second one, the easiest thing for me to tell you is what I said earlier that the way our peers view and report and the industry views and reports enterprise would be the combination of our enterprise and commercial business which last quarter would have grown 9% and would have grown 12% without -- or it grew 9%, but would have been 12% without Russia. So if you think about the size of that those two businesses combined growing 9%, I'm pretty comfortable that the demand is still there. And if you look at our commercial business, which usually is the leading indicator of a shift of demand momentum, they grew 19% in the quarter. So I'm not concerned.\nScott Herren: Yes. And Sami to the first part of your question, the 160 basis point impact that we saw in Q3 from pricing is a revenue statement. Obviously to go from bookings to revenue, it first has to flow through the backlog and then get realized. So the impact on bookings while we haven't quantified, it would be a little bit higher than that 160 basis points.\nSami Badri: Got it. Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead, sir.\nRod Hall: Yes, hi, thanks for the question. I guess, I want to come back because I think the main investor question coming out of this will be these product orders, Chuck. And I know you're saying that combined that a -- I heard all the things that you said there. I think that if you look at the sequential movement on those, it's quite a bit below normal seasonality. Even if you give the 10% growth on a year over year basis on the product orders, you're still down mid-single digits sequentially and that's way below normal seasonality. But we know that we're coming off historic highs on these product orders. So I guess what I'm wondering is if you can give us any idea on trajectory on product orders as we head into next quarter? Because I could see a scenario where product orders declined to kind of 2019 July levels in which case you'd be down double digits, but you'd still be in good product order territory. If that makes any sense. So I'm hoping maybe you could just give us a little bit more color on what you think that trajectory looks like and how those orders are normalizing over time? And then maybe I have a follow-up. I mean that's kind of a long question. Thanks.\nChuck Robbins: I got you Rod and you're actually thinking about the right way. You think about exactly the way I'm thinking about it. So first thing I'll say is that I think any seasonality right now is out the window with the current situation and with what we've seen with the order demand. We were doing 18-month planning with certain customers. And if they placed 18 months' worth of orders last quarter and now they're going to pause and we may be doing it with three fewer customers this quarter. So I mean it's just -- it's a very difficult thing to get your head around. So there's two things that I look at. Number one, what is our quarterly growth rate vis-a-vis a year ago to see because I think about momentum of demand from one quarter to the next sort of -- you have to look at that delta, right. Because if you grow 30% on 1% and then you grew 30% on 15%, then that would be declining demand momentum. That's the way I think about the math, right. So that's one thing we watch for. But the second thing is I think to your point I've been talking to the team about it, when we start comparing against these 30% quarters, I think we have to go back two years and get a real assessment because those numbers we know had pull ahead in. We don't know how much as we've talked about, but I think you're right. We have to sort of doing analysis from two years back to really feel like what do we really seeing right now and that's -- it's going to be a difficult thing for us to navigate because the historical way we've looked at these metrics just won't apply right now. And I think once we cycle through a year, another four quarters of the stuff, maybe we get to normalized -- a normalized view. As I've said, we're going to go through a phase where our order demand growth will be lagging our revenue growth and then hopefully we'll get to a point where those two will get back into more of a predictive model and we just got to get there.\nRod Hall: Okay, that's great. And I guess, Chuck, on that subject, I know you talked to a lot of CIOs, CEOs, what are people thinking now? I mean it seems like everywhere you look there is bad news and it's hard to believe people are feeling like they want to spend a lot of money, but I'm curious -- yet the demand still seems pretty good, so I'm just curious what you're hearing from people, how the tone of conversations is going?\nChuck Robbins: I think COVID changed everything about how our customers think about technology. I think that pre-COVID a lot of customers when they went to slow spending, they would stop spending on technology. And I think COVID had them feel the impact of those decisions. And they're not -- they're going to be very prudent about stopping key projects that are giving them customer differentiation capabilities or modernization of their infrastructure or supporting hybrid work or making sure they're not falling behind their competitors. I mean, it's just a different day to day relative to what CEOs, the public sector leaders, how they think about technology and the importance of it. Even though they thought it, it was really important three years ago, their understanding of today is much different. And so I'm not saying they won't make those decisions. I just think there is a higher bar for them to make those decisions.\nRod Hall: Great, thank you very much.\nMarilyn Mora: Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Tal Liani from Bank of America. You may go ahead, sir.\nTal Liani: I have -- I still have difficulties to model next year because we still didn't even start comparing the high growth rates of orders. This is we're still comparing 10% to 10% of last year. Next quarter, you're getting to 30%. And you have multiple quarters of 30%. At that point of time, revenue growth should accelerate just because of supply chain starts -- supposed to get better somewhere or your actions, but we are seeing order growth decelerating instead of accelerating. Should we -- when we look at the next few quarters, could there be a combination of both order growth going down materially, maybe even to negative levels at the same time also revenue growth being negative. I mean, I'm trying to understand how to think about the next few quarters. Thanks.\nChuck Robbins: You want to take it, Scott?\nScott Herren: Yes, Tal, I think the way to think about it is back to one of the statistics that we gave you first time last quarter and then again this quarter. We've got backlog now greater than $15 billion in product. And within that, more than $2 billion of software sitting in backlog. You add that to the $30 billion plus of RPO we've got and we're sitting on about $45 billion of sales we've transacted that have not yet accreted to the revenue line. So I think it for as you think about the way you want to model out next year, you need to think about the rate and pace of revenue growth being dependent on supply versus being dependent on in quarter bookings growth. And that's certainly the way I think about it.\nTal Liani: And when you think about the order trends, I mean order is dollars, but not all the product has the same trends. There are some of the products that are very big in terms of contribution like service provider side, et cetera. I have to guess that the trends there are better than the trends in the enterprise, et cetera. So does it mean the order numbers that you provide, can you dig in a little bit deeper below just a single number for orders and tell us the areas where order growth is better and the areas where order growth is actually worse?\nScott Herren: Yes, I think some of that is available in the slides that we'll put up online. It may also be in the press release. We talked about enterprise. Enterprise orders were flat for the quarter, but then you have to normalize in the impact of the Russia and Belarus, the decision to stop operations in Russia and Belarus, that would take it up to 3% growth in orders. That's following a quarter where enterprise grew 37% and the quarter before that it grew 30%. So with these -- the way we define enterprise, as Chuck talked about, it's our biggest customers. And that business by definition is going to be a bit lumpy. But on a trailing 12 months, it's actually quite strong. We continue to see nice growth in SP, particularly in web scale. We gave you some of those stats during the call as well. Those are doing well. Public sector continues to hold up. Public sector demand has continued to be fine for us. And commercial, you remember we talked about this when we first went into the pandemic that we saw commercial tip down before the rest of the sales tip down. And then as things begin to recover in late fiscal '20, we saw commercial tip up. It tends to be a leading indicator for us. And commercial growth product, order growth was up 19% last quarter. So we're not seeing -- if that's the leading indicator and it certainly has been for us, we're not seeing any weakness in demand at this point.\nTal Liani: Got it. Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Tal. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Paul Silverstein with Cowen. You may go ahead, sir.\nPaul Silverstein: Guys, if I could ask for two clarifications. First of I think I heard you say the $300 million kind of what's showing high revenue impact in Q3. I didn't hear you say what's the expected revenue impact is in Q4. Can you share that list?\nChuck Robbins: Hi, Paul. Thanks. Yes, we had -- in Q3, it was very simple for us to articulate it because we know exactly what we were expecting and everything else. We don't have the ability in Q4 to understand when they're really going to open up and how much we're going to get, et cetera, which caused us to create the range we did. And just -- we're just being realistic about what we believe we'll be able to get out the door, but to actually peg it to power supplies, in particular, is pretty difficult. But I mean most of the issues that we see right now, the concerning area right now is really getting that open -- getting China opened up again, getting the stuff shipping and we need to see that. So Scott, you want to add something?\nScott Herren: Yes, what I'd add to that is we give the example of power supplies because that was a constraint in Q3 and part of the issue that we had in Q3 is that constraint came up very late in the quarter, right. When Shanghai went into lockdown, we didn't immediately see that hit. It hit more towards the second half of April which, of course, was within our quarter. It wasn't within the quarter of many of our peers. And there was just no time to recover from that, but I don't want you to oversimplify and I hope I'm not leading into that. It's not just power supplies. We've got issues in a number of different areas. I tried to give you a sense of scale because I know it's 41,000 unique components what we said is about 350 have potential supply concerns right now. We're working those every day and every day some of them get resolved and then every day a couple more will come on to that list. So it's not -- unfortunately, it would be convenient if it was just one or two things and we could say here's exactly what those are. It is a very dynamic situation. And what we're trying to do if you zoom up a level and say, we're not assuming it gets better or worse as we scroll through Q4 and that's what's built into the guide.\nPaul Silverstein: But Chuck and Scott the obvious question is to that statement of the $1 billion, $1 billion plus shortfall in guidance rolled to Street expectations, is that all the lack visibility you have, the concern -- the understandable concern we have with respect to supply? Is that all in the supply portion of the equation? Going back to all the many questions have been asked about your order book to slowdown in orders and the quality of demand, is any of that shortfall in your guidance to be a concern about demand or is that all on the supply side of the equation?\nScott Herren: Zero. There is no demand impact our Q4 guide.\nPaul Silverstein: It's a 100% supply.\nScott Herren: 100% supply.\nPaul Silverstein: One other quick clarification on this topic. If we look at the linearity of your order book. I know, normally we talk about linearity of revenue. But if you look at the linearity of your orders during the quarter, post the quarter, up to this call, what do we see?\nScott Herren: It was normal, very normal.\nPaul Silverstein: So you've seen no degradation at all?\nScott Herren: No.\nChuck Robbins: Q3 was right in line with normal pattern. And I think Paul, the thing to remember is, yes, we're a little skewed because we had three quarters of 30%. If we went back a year and a half and I said we're going to grow 10% product orders on top of a 10% quarter from a year ago, we would have been quite happy with it. We're just worried about it because it's fallen 330s when there was a lot of planned purchase built into. So we will tell you. Obviously next quarter we'll have an update, but right now, it doesn't feel like there's any significant shift.\nPaul Silverstein: And Chuck a cynic would say you didn't see anything last quarter relative to you're talking. I understand the last quarter about three straight quarters of 30 plus percent growth. You don't advertise, advise about any expected slowdown or looking at any slowdown and now the tune is changed. I'm just playing devil's advocate here obviously, but --\nChuck Robbins: Paul, that's fine. But we never have any commentary about future bookings expectations.\nPaul Silverstein: Okay. I'll pass it on. I appreciate it. Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Paul. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. David Vogt from UBS. You may go ahead, sir.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thanks everyone for taking the time to taking my question. I just had a follow-up on backlog and near term RPO. If I'm not mistaken, I think your near term RPO is flat sequentially at roughly $16.2 billion, $16.3 billion. And if I tack on sort of a $1 billion increase quarter-over-quarter in your backlog, given sort of the supply chain constraints that you've articulated and maybe what some of your peers are saying, I mean, I guess I'm trying to triangulate on what the revenue trajectory looks like as we go into next year? I mean you mentioned Chuck that there is seasonality out of the window, but within the realm of possibility that we could start the year, next year and the first half at sort of a run rate on where we are today as we exit this year. I mean is that a realistic probability given on how revenue kind of flows through? And then I have a quick clarification follow-up.\nChuck Robbins: Sure. On the RPO that we talked about, you got the number right, $16.2 billion of short-term RPO, which is up 9%. And so short term by definition means that accretes into the revenue stream in the next 12 months. That growing by 9% is a pretty good leading indicator of at least what that piece of -- how that piece of our business looks as we go into Q4 and then we'll give you an update on how short-term RPO growth looks at the end of Q4 and you can get a sense of it in the end of fiscal '23.\nDavid Vogt: Great. And then maybe just as a follow-up. When you think about where backlog peaks and where maybe purchase order commitments on year end peaks, obviously in our supply chains kind of for a lot of -- sort of the calculation of the window, but as you look at your order book and what you see from a demand perspective from your customers, how would you sort of handicap where we think we reach that sort of peak commitment from your perspective to make sure that you have the appropriate components and parts to meet the demand longer term? Right? We're talking about as order growth decelerates from 8% in this quarter and ultimately could decelerate a little bit further, are we a little bit closer to peak on both of those metrics than maybe we thought a quarter or two ago?\nScott Herren: Yes, there is kind of two angles to that David that I'll try to touch on. One is the, when does the backlog itself peak and while we don't forecast that, it would not surprise me to see it grow again in Q4. On the second piece in terms of purchase commitments you saw they were up pretty substantially again in Q3, I guess, back to the earlier question of as our supply chain team not being aggressive enough in pursuing parts, purchase commitments now set at a pretty high level and inventory sits at a pretty high level. And that's so that as we clear the supply constraints on a few critical components, we can actually quickly convert that into finished goods product and get it in the hands of our customers who want those products. So is the peak now, is the peak in Q4, Q1, really a lot depends on the fluidity of availability of these critical components that we're chasing down?\nDavid Vogt: Thanks, Scott.\nScott Herren: I hope that makes sense to you. We were sitting on both a record backlog and record inventory, which seems like it's in contrast with one another. But it's not, right. We're holding onto the parts that we've got and we just have to get the remainder to square the sets and get those built out the door.\nDavid Vogt: Yes. No, that makes sense. We're trying to understand sort of your cash flow conversion, so that's helpful. Thanks.\nMarilyn Mora: All right. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Pierre Ferragu, you may go ahead from New Street Research.\nBen Harwood: Hi, thanks for taking the question. This is Ben Harwood standing in for Pierre. We had a couple of questions. So firstly, you talked about most of your issues arising in April. So the full cost was around 4%, 5% below expectations. Does this mean productivity was around 10%, 15% below your expectations? And then secondly, what happens to this demand economy in the third and fourth quarter? Do you think it spills over into 2023 and then what would give you confidence on that? And then what kind of timeframe should we expect that lost demand to be met? Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: You want to take it, Scott?\nScott Herren: Yes. Ben on the first part of your question, I didn't exactly follow your math, but relative to expectations we talked about, yes, in the month of April, we talked about the -- obviously the decision we made to stop operations in Russia, Belarus, had a $200 million impact of the quarter. Most of that was -- it was two months of revenue that we had to forego and there were some receivables we had to write off within that. On the supply chain side, we would have made up the remainder of that delta to our expectations for the quarter. I hope that answers your question. I'm not quite sure I followed what you were trying to get at with that.\nBen Harwood: I was just saying that the amount that we said we missed by, if you look at what we would have expected in April from a linearity perspective, it was a certain percentage of it. So it's just a mathematical issue, probably correct, but we didn't check.\nScott Herren: Yes. I don't actually think about it in those terms.\nBen Harwood: I don't either.\nScott Herren: But yes, again if that didn't answer your question, Ben, we can follow-up afterwards.\nBen Harwood: Okay.\nMarilyn Mora: All right, thanks, Ben.\nBen Harwood: Okay. He asked a second one, too, about the backlog rolling over into '23.\nChuck Robbins: Yes, I mean with the backlog. So a couple of things. I think what you may be trying to get out on the backlog question is the durability of that backlog. And there is -- this is something that obviously we've been tracking very closely. What I'd say on order cancellations is they continue to run at a rate that is actually below where it was pre-pandemic. So we're not seeing any cancellations there. We continue to see very strong pipeline and pipeline build, which is something else that I think you would expect to see weaken if there was softening demand. As we look at kind of further out with what's sitting in the backlog, we've also put in place a policy change that says those orders are non-cancelable with all orders are non-cancelable within 45 days of the committed ship date. That just went into place in the beginning of February. So orders that we've received since then within 45 days of shipment are non-cancelable. And for our biggest customers, we've been working with them on a bespoke basis to put in place agreements where we will guarantee supply, but they guarantee that those orders will not be rescheduled or canceled. So feel good about the durability of the backlog we've got.\nBen Harwood: Okay.\nMarilyn Mora: Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: Tim Long with Barclays. You may go ahead, sir.\nTim Long: Thank you. Two if I could as well. First, Chuck, the gross margins we talked about was good. A lot of that was pricing. It seems like you guys are in a strong pricing position now. If you look out a few quarters if and when things normalize, do you think pricing pressure remains or do you think that's something that will be a give back to the industry or to the customers. So is that sustainable from a margin standpoint? And second, I was hoping you could dig into software more? I heard a lot of that kind of unique one-time factors in there, but still even ex those, probably not great growth when you look at the software opportunities ahead of Cisco. Could you just give us the things to watch over the next few quarters that could start to reaccelerate growth in that software line?\nChuck Robbins: Yes. So, Tim, on the first one -- thanks for the questions, by the way. On the first one, I think that as we see if we see reductions in our input costs over time, then we will take into consideration whether we pass those through to the customers. The reality is as we've taken on so many input costs increases that we haven't passed onto customers that will look at it holistically at the time where that stuff begins to occur is what I would tell you. I'm glad you asked on the software growth because I think it's something that we want to explain. So it's a little difficult to understand completely and we have a really interesting quarter because the extra week a year ago in the Russia situation and the supply chain situation. So let me try to take you through what's going on in software. If you start with the fact that we have well over $2 billion of software in backlog that is connected to a piece of hardware that we will not begin recognizing the revenue until the hardware ships. So -- and that's up $1 billion year-over-year. So there is a large component of software that we're not recognizing right now that we would in normal times. So it's the first piece. And then if you take into consideration the extra week from a year ago where we do ratable recognition of revenue on a daily basis, we had an extra week. And then you take the software that we wrote down -- software revenue that we wrote down as a result of ceasing operations in Russia. So those three -- the first one is hard to put a number on, but assume it's reasonable. The Russia and the extra quarter was a 5-point headwind to our software growth. So I know it's a little complicated, but I wanted to make sure you understood that. So I would expect this stuff to normalize back particularly without the Russia and the extra week impact. And then when supply chain starts to clear, then we'll start to see those normalized growth rates that we would expect, so hopefully that wasn't too complicated.\nTim Long: Yes. Just curious any other standalone software or 9000 upgrades? What are the kinds of things outside of the macro related that could really help?\nChuck Robbins: Yes. The renewal stuff in '23, it could be helpful. We are continuing to make progress on that across the portfolio. I mean, we've got subscriptions running on switching on routing, enterprise routing, on enterprise wireless. We've even built some subscriptions into our mass scale infrastructure group. We've got subscriptions now in our data center networking group. So they'll sort layering in over the next few years.\nTim Long: Okay, thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Okay. It looks like we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. Amit Daryanani from Evercore. You may go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Perfect. A lot of snuck in here out. I guess I would be the dead horse in China supply chain issues. And maybe to the answer from the perspective of the billion-dollar shortfall, I know it's supply chain, not just China, if you have in July. A, what's the conviction that there is no share loss happening? Because your peers might be one month after that sounded much better for your conviction that others were not able to get the power, analog product that you were not and they were able to get the demand. So A, could you just talk about conviction, you are not having share loss? And then B, China has had no COVID cases in Shanghai for a few days now. So assuming they open up in June, does that imply that you could be perhaps at the higher end of your guide and things get better in Q1? Or just what are you embedding from a Shanghai recovery in your fiscal Q4 guidance?\nChuck Robbins: Okay. So first of all I think market share is incredibly difficult thing to assess right now because of the backlog situation, supply chain situations and we have a complex portfolio. So are we losing share in somewhere? I suspect there is somewhere that we are losing share. But in our core markets, I actually feel really good about how we're performing and the demand that we've seen in whether it's WiFi or switching or particularly in SP routing and in the web scale space and other areas. So I don't think there is a widespread problem of share, but I'm sure there are pockets that we -- our teams are working on improving. So that's the first piece. Amit, on the China thing, let me -- what we've built into the guide is just a whole lot of uncertainty right now. Because we recognize that when they do open up, first of all, we don't know what that means. We don't know what open up means. Does it mean that they're going to slowly open grocery stores and salons and things of that nature and that the logistics side of it or do they open up the logistics all day one? What does it mean about the capacity of resources they have for the logistics side? But our concern is that every company there is going to be trying to ship out? In some cases, many of the factories have been approved to keep working and their workers have been working in dormitories. So they have components or ready to ship product that is sitting on the floor and it's all going to raise for the ports. It's all going to compete for the airports. And we know there's lower air traffic capacity right now for us to leverage. So we're concerned about how long it takes to clear that up, which is reflected in the guide. We also think that once it gets into their ports and it starts coming in the U.S., we have the risk of seeing what we saw in LA several months ago. So those are all just the unknowns about what does opening up look like and what's the timeframe for recovery that led us to the cautious guide that we put out there. And I would just remind you that it's not just Shanghai. I think as of the last article I read, there were like 45 cities that were in lockdown and it was over a quarter of the population of China. So it's broader. But that's how we're thinking about it and we just have to wait and see how it unwinds.\nAmit Daryanani: Fair enough. Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Thank you, Amit. Chuck, I'm going to turn it over to you for some closing remarks.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Marilyn. So first of all, I want to thank everybody for spending time with us and diving into this the complex situation that we face. It's clearly a dynamic and challenging environment. We clearly faced unanticipated events during Q3 with the COVID lockdowns and the war in Ukraine. We think the short-term challenges that we will manage through, our teams have been working really hard on these mitigation actions that we believe will begin to benefit us in the first half of our next fiscal year, which is good. We're successfully realizing price increases, which is good. And also in Q3, even though we had a miss on the top line, I just want to point out that it was a record EPS quarter for us as a company. And at the low point of our guidance for Q4, we will deliver record EPS for the full year. So while the topline is disappointing, we have navigated this complex year and actually will deliver solid EPS when we're done. The fundamentals are strong a lot, still in our favor. Demand, business transformation is working, the technology transitions and the number that we're participating in. We have great teams around the world and that leads me to have a high degree of confidence despite the short-term challenges that we face. So thank you all for spending time with us and we look forward to connecting with you next quarter.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Chuck. And I'll just wrap it up by saying Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call, which will reflect our fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal 2022 results will be on Wednesday, August 17, 2022, at 1:30 PM Pacific Time, 4:30 PM Eastern Time. So this concludes today's call. But if you have any further questions, feel free to reach out to the Investor Relations team. We thank you very much for joining us today.\nOperator: Thank you for participating on today's conference call. If you would like to listen to the call in its entirety, you may call 800-388-4923. For participants dialing from outside the U.S., please dial 203-369-3800. This concludes today's call. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "Chuck Robbins",
            "content": "Thanks, Marilyn, and good afternoon, everyone. When we spoke with you back in February, we entered Q3 in the second half of our fiscal year with optimism despite the supply and component challenges and other headwinds impacting us and many of our peers. Many of those factors that fueled that optimism remain unchanged today. We continue to see strong demand resulting in record backlog, our business transformation is progressing well and our differentiated innovation across our portfolio is helping our customers embrace and adopt the multiple technology transitions happening. However, there were two unanticipated events since our last earnings call, which impacted our Q3 revenue performance. The first is the war in Ukraine. This resulted in us ceasing operations in Russia and Belarus and had a corresponding revenue impact, which Scott will discuss. The second relates to COVID related lockdowns in China, which began in late March. These lockdowns resulted in an even more severe shortage of certain critical components. This in turn prevented us from shipping products to customers at the levels we originally anticipated heading into Q3. Our Q4 guidance incorporates a wider than usual range, taking into account the revenue impact of the war in Ukraine and the continuing uncertainty related to the China COVID lockdowns. Given this uncertainty, we're being practical about the current environment and erring on the side of caution in terms of our outlook, taking it one quarter at a time. We believe that our revenue performance in the upcoming quarters is less dependent on demand and more dependent on the supply availability in this increasingly complex environment. While certain aspects of the current situation are largely out of our control, our teams have been working on several mitigation actions to help alleviate many of the component issues that we've been facing. We believe that we will begin to see the benefits of these actions in the first half of next fiscal year. Now let me talk more specifically about our third quarter performance. As I just mentioned, many of the positives we've discussed over the past few quarters remain, resulting in continued solid demand for our solutions. Total product orders grew 8% year-over-year leading to yet another record backlog of well over $15 billion, up 10% sequentially and up 130% year-over-year. This momentum reaffirms the critical role we play in our customers' futures. Our business transformation also progressed nicely. In Q3, we saw ARR growth of 11%, ending the quarter at over $22 billion, and product ARR growth of 18%. We also exited the quarter with over $30 billion in remaining performance obligations or RPO. We also delivered non-GAAP EPS at the high end of our guidance range. This was driven by effective pricing actions and spending discipline, all of which allowed us to offset lower volumes and deliver both gross and operating margins above the high end of our guidance range and deliver on our bottom-line profitability target for the quarter. I want to reiterate what I said earlier. The fundamental drivers across our business are strong. While we are facing some short-term challenges, it does not change our long-term outlook, our alignment to our customers' most critical challenges or our belief in the tremendous opportunities in front of us. Last week, we hosted our Global Customer Advisory Board meeting where we met with close to 100 customers. And they consistently shared that technology is at the heart of their strategy and has become even more important to everything they do. This driving not just their strategies, but also their overall business transformation. The technology they're adopting from Cisco is driving their business agility, allowing them to move with greater speed and empowering them to deliver differentiated experiences for their customers. Now I'd like to touch on some highlights from the quarter. We continue to see strong demand in several areas of our business. Our web-scale business remains strong as we continue to help these customers build their capabilities to connect and serve their customers and end users at scale from the data center to the edge. This is leading to continued strength in orders, which grew over 50% and on a trailing four-quarter basis, we had over 100% growth. This marks our ninth consecutive quarter of solid demand as we are winning new franchises, expanding our design wins and taking share in web scale. I remain incredibly proud of the progress we've made in the momentum we have in this space. We are also extremely pleased with the traction of our 400 gig solutions, including the Cisco 8,000, which is the fastest growing SP routing platform in Cisco's history. In addition, our Silicon One portfolio, ZR and ZR plus optics and our Acacia portfolio of optical networking products also continue to perform well. From a product revenue perspective, our performance was led by solid demand across a majority of our portfolio, including switching, SP routing, wireless, security and SD WAN. Our performance in these areas reflecting ongoing investments that our customers are making to rapidly digitize their organizations to deliver differentiated experiences. Looking forward, the shift to hybrid cloud, 5G, 400 gig, IoT, hybrid work and the explosion of applications are driving the increased need for next generation networking, connectivity, security, and observability solutions. Cisco is well positioned to deliver for our customers with our end-to-end platforms and solutions. I'm also very proud of our pace of innovation. During the quarter, Cisco announced new innovations across our networking and cloud portfolios along with technologies to enhance experiences and hybrid work environments. We also introduced our new predictive networks to help organizations learn, predict and avoid network disruptions. We have even more innovation, which we'll announce at RSA and our own Cisco Live event in June. In addition to our deep passion for innovation, all of us at Cisco believe we have a unique opportunity to help make the world a better place through both the technology we build and the purpose we rally around to power an inclusive future for all. I believe this intersection of technology and purpose is why we were named the number one Best Company to Work For in the U.S. by Fortune and Great Place to Work for the second year in a row. In summary, while the quarter clearly did not play out as expected, demand remains solid and the fundamentals of our business are strong. We remain focused on executing against the strategy we laid out at our Investor Day. We will also continue to be resolute in our focus to transform our business for more predictability and agility while bringing to market a robust pipeline of innovation. We remain confident in our long-term growth and the opportunities that we have in front of us. I want to thank our teams around the world for all that they do, executing with dedication, focus and excellence in an incredibly dynamic environment. They continue to focus on our customers with unparalleled innovation, resiliency and determination. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Scott. Yes, Meta. Thank you. So on the demand issue, I'd point out a few things. Number one, without a 2-percentage point of orders that we de-booked relative to Russia and Belarus, we grew 10% against a year ago growth of 10%. So we feel good about that. Our customers are not signaling any real shift at this point. We're not hearing that from them. Again, we had our global customer advisory board just a couple of weeks ago where we had 100 of our biggest customers and they were all talking about projects in the strategic nature of everything they're trying to accomplish. The last thing I would point out is on the enterprise side, last quarter we grew 37%. Just to keep in mind the way we define enterprise is a finite list of named customers. So it tends to be more lumpy. If I look at how the industry defines enterprise, that would reflect a combination of our enterprise and our commercial business. So for comparisons to what we're hearing in the marketplace, I thought we would give you that combined number. If you combine enterprise and commercial together, we grew 9%, but without the Russia impact, we actually grew 12% and on a trailing 12 months basis it grew 28%. So we are still comfortable with the demand signals that we're seeing and our customers aren't telling us anything differently right now. Yes. Samik, it's a great question. So let me start with just the basic answer is there is no reflection of demand issue in our Q4 guide, that has nothing to do with the Q4 guide. Let me try to describe how we got to that. I think it's important for everybody to understand. When we look at our Q3 results, we had -- from a revenue perspective, we had $200 million impact from us ceasing operations in Russia and corresponding revenue write-downs that occurred. Those were one-time. We then had, if you recall, our quarter ends at the end of April. Most of what you've heard from others, they are quarters into the end of March. So we experienced an entire quarter of the China lockdowns. In Shanghai, it was from March 27 until today. Shenzhen shut down, but again it opened up a week later, so we're talking really about the Shanghai situation. So we had $200 million from Russia and then we had $300 million that was completely attributed to our inability to get power supplies out of China. That's the simplicity of what caused the problem. As an example, we had 11,000 PCB assemblies built, we couldn't get power supplies for because of the lockdown. That's a simple fact of what happened in Q3. When we look at Q4 and you think about the Shanghai lockdown and what we've heard because in Shanghai, there are lots of components that go into our power supplies. So we're not able to get those components. Shanghai now is saying they're going to open up June 1. We don't know exactly what that means and what that means to when that implies that we would start getting any supply out. And correspondingly we believe when they open up and when they do allow transportation logistics to start up, we believe there is going to be a high degree of congestion. We believe that there is going to be lots of competition for ports capacity, airport capacity. And we just believe that that combined with the inbound efforts, trying to get raw materials back into the country, et cetera, we just believe that it's going to be impossible for us to catch up on this issue in Q4, which is what led to the guidance in Q4. So even though these top line numbers don't look good, it's very simple explanation as to what occurred. So then the follow-on part of your question is, when do we think this gets better. Well, if we make the assumption that China does begin to open up and we do begin to get more natural flow of the power supplies. We also have had our teams over the last six to nine months have been working on a lot of mitigating actions, redesigning 100 products, over 100 products to give us component diversity, we believe that a combination of those starting in our Q1 and in the first half of our year will start to see the benefit of that. So, that's when we expect to see it improve to some extent. We need to get through the next 90 days, but I'm just being as transparent as I can about what we see and when we think some of that improvement will occur. Yes, Ittai, thank you. Both good questions. I think on the first one, I think that the biggest differentiation was April. I have spoken to peers who are feeling the same thing we are that we are reporting the full month of impact and it wasn't April issue for us. So now on a normalized basis for that question across the portfolio, all of us design products with different components in. So there is opportunity for us to have a unique issue with one component that we may have designed into a product or we may have an unique advantage because we designed a certain component into a product. And those are the areas where I talked about we're redesigning where we have unique problems or just problems in general, though others may have the same problems. So we think that the exposure in general was because of the month of April. Also we do massive volumes. And in general, you would think that's a huge advantage, but just to put it in perspective, we shipped more revenue in the last week of our quarter than many of our competitors that you're referencing shipped in their entire quarter. So it's just an issue that it shows up in a bigger number for us than it would. If they have the same problem, it might be a $20 million impact for us, it might be a $200 million -- $400 million impact. So that's the first one. The second one what I would say is that we are constantly evaluating our global supply chain. And so it's not about one country, it's about resilience. And the way we've designed supply chains over the last 15-20 years as an industry, I think we all realize we're evolving that now at the same time that we're triaging all of the current issues that we have. So our teams have a dual challenge. But we are constantly driving geographic resilience. The example I would give is that we -- before COVID we had regional redundancy built in, we did not have a plan for a country to shut down. And so it takes time to go out and create that geographic resilience, but our teams are working on all of those kinds of things right now, so they will continue to do that Ittai. Yes. It absolutely does, Simon. Let me start and then I'll kick it to Scott to talk a little bit about it. So, first and foremost, we are incredibly active purchasers in the broker market. And you can imagine, with our buying power, they call us first. And so -- no, that has nothing to do with it. In fact, we've spent a lot of time with our supply chain team who had given us examples of where they've bought product in the broker market recently. So I don't think that's it. But Scott can explain what did happen there. Okay. First, I'll let Scott add on the price increase in a moment, but first of all, the price increase really did not have significant impact on our growth. We only passthrough pricing at the time that was offsetting our incremental cost. And to be honest, we've incurred more cost since then. So we were at a place right now where we have not even passed through all the costs that we have incurred. We're getting price increases all the time now. So that's the first answer. On the second one, the easiest thing for me to tell you is what I said earlier that the way our peers view and report and the industry views and reports enterprise would be the combination of our enterprise and commercial business which last quarter would have grown 9% and would have grown 12% without -- or it grew 9%, but would have been 12% without Russia. So if you think about the size of that those two businesses combined growing 9%, I'm pretty comfortable that the demand is still there. And if you look at our commercial business, which usually is the leading indicator of a shift of demand momentum, they grew 19% in the quarter. So I'm not concerned. I got you Rod and you're actually thinking about the right way. You think about exactly the way I'm thinking about it. So first thing I'll say is that I think any seasonality right now is out the window with the current situation and with what we've seen with the order demand. We were doing 18-month planning with certain customers. And if they placed 18 months' worth of orders last quarter and now they're going to pause and we may be doing it with three fewer customers this quarter. So I mean it's just -- it's a very difficult thing to get your head around. So there's two things that I look at. Number one, what is our quarterly growth rate vis-a-vis a year ago to see because I think about momentum of demand from one quarter to the next sort of -- you have to look at that delta, right. Because if you grow 30% on 1% and then you grew 30% on 15%, then that would be declining demand momentum. That's the way I think about the math, right. So that's one thing we watch for. But the second thing is I think to your point I've been talking to the team about it, when we start comparing against these 30% quarters, I think we have to go back two years and get a real assessment because those numbers we know had pull ahead in. We don't know how much as we've talked about, but I think you're right. We have to sort of doing analysis from two years back to really feel like what do we really seeing right now and that's -- it's going to be a difficult thing for us to navigate because the historical way we've looked at these metrics just won't apply right now. And I think once we cycle through a year, another four quarters of the stuff, maybe we get to normalized -- a normalized view. As I've said, we're going to go through a phase where our order demand growth will be lagging our revenue growth and then hopefully we'll get to a point where those two will get back into more of a predictive model and we just got to get there. I think COVID changed everything about how our customers think about technology. I think that pre-COVID a lot of customers when they went to slow spending, they would stop spending on technology. And I think COVID had them feel the impact of those decisions. And they're not -- they're going to be very prudent about stopping key projects that are giving them customer differentiation capabilities or modernization of their infrastructure or supporting hybrid work or making sure they're not falling behind their competitors. I mean, it's just a different day to day relative to what CEOs, the public sector leaders, how they think about technology and the importance of it. Even though they thought it, it was really important three years ago, their understanding of today is much different. And so I'm not saying they won't make those decisions. I just think there is a higher bar for them to make those decisions. You want to take it, Scott? Hi, Paul. Thanks. Yes, we had -- in Q3, it was very simple for us to articulate it because we know exactly what we were expecting and everything else. We don't have the ability in Q4 to understand when they're really going to open up and how much we're going to get, et cetera, which caused us to create the range we did. And just -- we're just being realistic about what we believe we'll be able to get out the door, but to actually peg it to power supplies, in particular, is pretty difficult. But I mean most of the issues that we see right now, the concerning area right now is really getting that open -- getting China opened up again, getting the stuff shipping and we need to see that. So Scott, you want to add something? Q3 was right in line with normal pattern. And I think Paul, the thing to remember is, yes, we're a little skewed because we had three quarters of 30%. If we went back a year and a half and I said we're going to grow 10% product orders on top of a 10% quarter from a year ago, we would have been quite happy with it. We're just worried about it because it's fallen 330s when there was a lot of planned purchase built into. So we will tell you. Obviously next quarter we'll have an update, but right now, it doesn't feel like there's any significant shift. Paul, that's fine. But we never have any commentary about future bookings expectations. Sure. On the RPO that we talked about, you got the number right, $16.2 billion of short-term RPO, which is up 9%. And so short term by definition means that accretes into the revenue stream in the next 12 months. That growing by 9% is a pretty good leading indicator of at least what that piece of -- how that piece of our business looks as we go into Q4 and then we'll give you an update on how short-term RPO growth looks at the end of Q4 and you can get a sense of it in the end of fiscal '23. You want to take it, Scott? Yes, I mean with the backlog. So a couple of things. I think what you may be trying to get out on the backlog question is the durability of that backlog. And there is -- this is something that obviously we've been tracking very closely. What I'd say on order cancellations is they continue to run at a rate that is actually below where it was pre-pandemic. So we're not seeing any cancellations there. We continue to see very strong pipeline and pipeline build, which is something else that I think you would expect to see weaken if there was softening demand. As we look at kind of further out with what's sitting in the backlog, we've also put in place a policy change that says those orders are non-cancelable with all orders are non-cancelable within 45 days of the committed ship date. That just went into place in the beginning of February. So orders that we've received since then within 45 days of shipment are non-cancelable. And for our biggest customers, we've been working with them on a bespoke basis to put in place agreements where we will guarantee supply, but they guarantee that those orders will not be rescheduled or canceled. So feel good about the durability of the backlog we've got. Yes. So, Tim, on the first one -- thanks for the questions, by the way. On the first one, I think that as we see if we see reductions in our input costs over time, then we will take into consideration whether we pass those through to the customers. The reality is as we've taken on so many input costs increases that we haven't passed onto customers that will look at it holistically at the time where that stuff begins to occur is what I would tell you. I'm glad you asked on the software growth because I think it's something that we want to explain. So it's a little difficult to understand completely and we have a really interesting quarter because the extra week a year ago in the Russia situation and the supply chain situation. So let me try to take you through what's going on in software. If you start with the fact that we have well over $2 billion of software in backlog that is connected to a piece of hardware that we will not begin recognizing the revenue until the hardware ships. So -- and that's up $1 billion year-over-year. So there is a large component of software that we're not recognizing right now that we would in normal times. So it's the first piece. And then if you take into consideration the extra week from a year ago where we do ratable recognition of revenue on a daily basis, we had an extra week. And then you take the software that we wrote down -- software revenue that we wrote down as a result of ceasing operations in Russia. So those three -- the first one is hard to put a number on, but assume it's reasonable. The Russia and the extra quarter was a 5-point headwind to our software growth. So I know it's a little complicated, but I wanted to make sure you understood that. So I would expect this stuff to normalize back particularly without the Russia and the extra week impact. And then when supply chain starts to clear, then we'll start to see those normalized growth rates that we would expect, so hopefully that wasn't too complicated. Yes. The renewal stuff in '23, it could be helpful. We are continuing to make progress on that across the portfolio. I mean, we've got subscriptions running on switching on routing, enterprise routing, on enterprise wireless. We've even built some subscriptions into our mass scale infrastructure group. We've got subscriptions now in our data center networking group. So they'll sort layering in over the next few years. Okay. So first of all I think market share is incredibly difficult thing to assess right now because of the backlog situation, supply chain situations and we have a complex portfolio. So are we losing share in somewhere? I suspect there is somewhere that we are losing share. But in our core markets, I actually feel really good about how we're performing and the demand that we've seen in whether it's WiFi or switching or particularly in SP routing and in the web scale space and other areas. So I don't think there is a widespread problem of share, but I'm sure there are pockets that we -- our teams are working on improving. So that's the first piece. Amit, on the China thing, let me -- what we've built into the guide is just a whole lot of uncertainty right now. Because we recognize that when they do open up, first of all, we don't know what that means. We don't know what open up means. Does it mean that they're going to slowly open grocery stores and salons and things of that nature and that the logistics side of it or do they open up the logistics all day one? What does it mean about the capacity of resources they have for the logistics side? But our concern is that every company there is going to be trying to ship out? In some cases, many of the factories have been approved to keep working and their workers have been working in dormitories. So they have components or ready to ship product that is sitting on the floor and it's all going to raise for the ports. It's all going to compete for the airports. And we know there's lower air traffic capacity right now for us to leverage. So we're concerned about how long it takes to clear that up, which is reflected in the guide. We also think that once it gets into their ports and it starts coming in the U.S., we have the risk of seeing what we saw in LA several months ago. So those are all just the unknowns about what does opening up look like and what's the timeframe for recovery that led us to the cautious guide that we put out there. And I would just remind you that it's not just Shanghai. I think as of the last article I read, there were like 45 cities that were in lockdown and it was over a quarter of the population of China. So it's broader. But that's how we're thinking about it and we just have to wait and see how it unwinds. Thank you. Thanks, Marilyn. So first of all, I want to thank everybody for spending time with us and diving into this the complex situation that we face. It's clearly a dynamic and challenging environment. We clearly faced unanticipated events during Q3 with the COVID lockdowns and the war in Ukraine. We think the short-term challenges that we will manage through, our teams have been working really hard on these mitigation actions that we believe will begin to benefit us in the first half of our next fiscal year, which is good. We're successfully realizing price increases, which is good. And also in Q3, even though we had a miss on the top line, I just want to point out that it was a record EPS quarter for us as a company. And at the low point of our guidance for Q4, we will deliver record EPS for the full year. So while the topline is disappointing, we have navigated this complex year and actually will deliver solid EPS when we're done. The fundamentals are strong a lot, still in our favor. Demand, business transformation is working, the technology transitions and the number that we're participating in. We have great teams around the world and that leads me to have a high degree of confidence despite the short-term challenges that we face. So thank you all for spending time with us and we look forward to connecting with you next quarter."

            "content": "Thanks, Chuck. We saw solid growth in product orders, net income and earnings per share despite the challenges Chuck just outlined. Product order growth was driven by strength across most of our portfolio while disciplined spend and supply chain management drove our profitability. Total revenue was $12.8 billion, flat year-over-year. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 34.7%, up 110 basis points coming in above the high end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP net income was $3.6 billion, up 3% and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.87, up 5%, coming in at the high end of our guidance range. In March, we stopped business operations in both Russia and Belarus, which had a negative impact to revenue of approximately $200 million or two percentage points of growth. Historically, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine collectively have represented approximately 1% of our total revenue. The impact this quarter was a bit higher than our historical run rate due to additional charges to revenue we recorded for uncollectible receivables and other items. And as a reminder, Q3 of last year included an extra week, which was a benefit of total revenue in Q3 of '21 of approximately three full percentage points of growth. On a combined basis, the impact of the year-over-year total revenue growth rate for the extra week and the war in Ukraine was approximately five percentage points. Looking at our Q3 revenue in more detail, total product revenue was $9.4 billion, up 3%. Service revenue was $3.4 billion, down 8%, driven by the extra week in the prior year and the war in Ukraine, which combined, impacted our growth by approximately 8 percentage points. Within product revenue, Secure, Agile Networks was solid with revenues up 4%, switching grew driven by strength in data center switching with our Nexus 9000 products, campus switching growth was led by our Catalyst 9000 and Meraki switching offerings. Wireless had a double-digit increase driven by broad-based strength across our portfolio, including our WiFi-6 products and Meraki wireless offerings. We also had solid growth in Servers. Enterprise routing declined primarily driven by Edge and Access was slightly offset by strength in SD-WAN. Internet for the Future was up 6%, driven by strength in Acacia, optical, optics and core networking products including double-digit growth in the Cisco 8000. Collaboration was down 7%, driven by declines in our meetings, calling and contact center offerings, partially offset by the continued ramp of our communication platform-as-a-service. End-to-End Security grew 7% with broad strength across most of the portfolio. Our Zero Trust portfolio performed well with double-digit growth driven by strong performance in our Duo offering. Optimized Application Experiences was up 8%, driven by double-digit growth in both of our SaaS based offerings ThousandEyes and Intersight. We continue to make progress on our transformation metrics as we shift our business to more subscriptions and software. Total software revenue was $3.7 billion, a decrease of 3% with the product portion down 1%. Total software revenue growth would have been 5 points higher excluding the combined negative impact of the extra week in the prior year and the war in Ukraine. 83% of software revenue was subscription-based, which is up one percentage point year-on-year. Total subscription revenue was $5.5 billion, a decrease of 4%. Total subscription revenue would have been 7 points higher, excluding the combined negative impact of the extra week in the prior year and the war in Ukraine. Total subscription revenue represented 43% of Cisco's total revenue. Annualized recurring revenue or ARR was $22.4 billion, an increase of 11% with strong product ARR growth of 18%. And remaining performance obligations or RPO was $30.2 billion, up 7%. Product RPO increased 13%, service RPO increased 3%, and the total short term RPO grew 9% to $16.2 billion. We had solid product order growth in Q3 of 8% with strength across most of the business. Looking at our geographic segments, the Americas was up 9%, EMEA up 4%, and APJC up 11%. In our customer markets, commercial was up 19%, service provider was up 8%, public sector was up 4%, and enterprise was flat. From a non-GAAP perspective, total gross margin came in above the high end of our guidance range at 65.3%, down 70 basis points year-over-year. Product gross margin was 64.1%, down 80 basis points and service gross margin was 68.9%, up 20 basis points. The decrease in product gross margin was primarily driven by ongoing higher component costs related to supply constraints as well as higher freight and logistics costs, partially offset by strong positive pricing impact. We continue to manage through the supply constraints seen industrywide by us and our peers. To give a sense of scale of the shortages, we currently see constraints in Q4 on roughly 350 critical components, out of a total of 41,000 unique component part numbers. Our supply chain team is aggressively pursuing multiple options to close those shortages. Given our solid product orders, we once again saw a significant increase in our backlog levels for both hardware and software well beyond our normal historical levels. As Chuck said, our ending product backlog grew to well over $15 billion and software backlog grew to more than $2 billion, both up 10% sequentially. And just a reminder, backlog is not included as part of our $30.2 billion and remaining performance obligations. We ended Q3 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $20.1 billion. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $3.7 billion, down 6% year-over-year, primarily driven by advanced payments to secure future supply. These advanced payments had a negative 9 percentage point year-on-year impact on Q3 operating cash flow. In terms of capital allocation, we returned $1.8 billion to shareholders during the quarter, that was comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and approximately $250 million of share repurchases. Year-to-date, we have returned a total of approximately $10 billion in value to our shareholders via cash dividends and stock repurchases and more than $17 billion available under our Board stock repurchase authorization. To summarize, we're navigating the highly complex environment while continuing to make progress on our business model shift and making strategic investments in innovation to capitalize on our significant growth opportunities and expanding addressable markets. Now let me provide our financial guidance for Q4. In terms of supply, we expect the challenges we experienced in Q3 to continue into Q4. For next quarter, we expect revenue growth to be in the range of minus 1% to minus 5.5%. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 64% to 65%. Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 31.5% to 33.5% and non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.76 to $0.84. For the full year fiscal '22, guidance is as follows. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 2% to 3% year-on-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is expected to range from $3.29 to $3.37, up 2% to 5% year-on-year. In both our Q4 and full year guidance, we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A. Yes, it's a great question, Simon. What I'd add is, if you recall, we did two price increases this year. The first one enrolled in right about the end of the calendar year and the second one at the beginning of our second quarter. And we said at the time that we thought -- you continue to ask like what are those price increases, when they are going to show up in the top line? And we said we thought we would begin to see the benefit of those toward the end of the third quarter, which is the quarter we just closed and that's exactly what happened. So while the unit shipments in the quarter were off because of the issues that we've talked about with the supply chain with the component supply, the -- we were able to offset that with pretty strong pricing. In fact, the list -- we published this in our Q, so you'll see it there, but our pricing was up about 160 basis points in Q3. So while we do have a unit impact from the component supply, it was offset by some of the things that we're doing in the -- we are beginning to realize on the price front. We are actively pursuing every avenue. It's got to be a qualified vendor and so we're working to qualify different sources at the same time. We are actively pursuing that whether it's through a broker, obviously directly from the vendor, but through a broker, distributor, we're pursuing all those channels and that is creating a bit of a headwind to us. Yes. And Sami to the first part of your question, the 160 basis point impact that we saw in Q3 from pricing is a revenue statement. Obviously to go from bookings to revenue, it first has to flow through the backlog and then get realized. So the impact on bookings while we haven't quantified, it would be a little bit higher than that 160 basis points. Yes, Tal, I think the way to think about it is back to one of the statistics that we gave you first time last quarter and then again this quarter. We've got backlog now greater than $15 billion in product. And within that, more than $2 billion of software sitting in backlog. You add that to the $30 billion plus of RPO we've got and we're sitting on about $45 billion of sales we've transacted that have not yet accreted to the revenue line. So I think it for as you think about the way you want to model out next year, you need to think about the rate and pace of revenue growth being dependent on supply versus being dependent on in quarter bookings growth. And that's certainly the way I think about it. Yes, I think some of that is available in the slides that we'll put up online. It may also be in the press release. We talked about enterprise. Enterprise orders were flat for the quarter, but then you have to normalize in the impact of the Russia and Belarus, the decision to stop operations in Russia and Belarus, that would take it up to 3% growth in orders. That's following a quarter where enterprise grew 37% and the quarter before that it grew 30%. So with these -- the way we define enterprise, as Chuck talked about, it's our biggest customers. And that business by definition is going to be a bit lumpy. But on a trailing 12 months, it's actually quite strong. We continue to see nice growth in SP, particularly in web scale. We gave you some of those stats during the call as well. Those are doing well. Public sector continues to hold up. Public sector demand has continued to be fine for us. And commercial, you remember we talked about this when we first went into the pandemic that we saw commercial tip down before the rest of the sales tip down. And then as things begin to recover in late fiscal '20, we saw commercial tip up. It tends to be a leading indicator for us. And commercial growth product, order growth was up 19% last quarter. So we're not seeing -- if that's the leading indicator and it certainly has been for us, we're not seeing any weakness in demand at this point. Yes, what I'd add to that is we give the example of power supplies because that was a constraint in Q3 and part of the issue that we had in Q3 is that constraint came up very late in the quarter, right. When Shanghai went into lockdown, we didn't immediately see that hit. It hit more towards the second half of April which, of course, was within our quarter. It wasn't within the quarter of many of our peers. And there was just no time to recover from that, but I don't want you to oversimplify and I hope I'm not leading into that. It's not just power supplies. We've got issues in a number of different areas. I tried to give you a sense of scale because I know it's 41,000 unique components what we said is about 350 have potential supply concerns right now. We're working those every day and every day some of them get resolved and then every day a couple more will come on to that list. So it's not -- unfortunately, it would be convenient if it was just one or two things and we could say here's exactly what those are. It is a very dynamic situation. And what we're trying to do if you zoom up a level and say, we're not assuming it gets better or worse as we scroll through Q4 and that's what's built into the guide. Zero. There is no demand impact our Q4 guide. 100% supply. It was normal, very normal. No. Yes, there is kind of two angles to that David that I'll try to touch on. One is the, when does the backlog itself peak and while we don't forecast that, it would not surprise me to see it grow again in Q4. On the second piece in terms of purchase commitments you saw they were up pretty substantially again in Q3, I guess, back to the earlier question of as our supply chain team not being aggressive enough in pursuing parts, purchase commitments now set at a pretty high level and inventory sits at a pretty high level. And that's so that as we clear the supply constraints on a few critical components, we can actually quickly convert that into finished goods product and get it in the hands of our customers who want those products. So is the peak now, is the peak in Q4, Q1, really a lot depends on the fluidity of availability of these critical components that we're chasing down? I hope that makes sense to you. We were sitting on both a record backlog and record inventory, which seems like it's in contrast with one another. But it's not, right. We're holding onto the parts that we've got and we just have to get the remainder to square the sets and get those built out the door. Yes. Ben on the first part of your question, I didn't exactly follow your math, but relative to expectations we talked about, yes, in the month of April, we talked about the -- obviously the decision we made to stop operations in Russia, Belarus, had a $200 million impact of the quarter. Most of that was -- it was two months of revenue that we had to forego and there were some receivables we had to write off within that. On the supply chain side, we would have made up the remainder of that delta to our expectations for the quarter. I hope that answers your question. I'm not quite sure I followed what you were trying to get at with that. Yes. I don't actually think about it in those terms. But yes, again if that didn't answer your question, Ben, we can follow-up afterwards."

        "content": "Operator: Welcome to Cisco's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 Financial Results Conference Call. At the request of Cisco, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.\nMarilyn Mora: Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's second quarter fiscal 2022 quarterly earnings conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO; and Scott Herren, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the third quarter and full year of fiscal 2022. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties, including COVID-19, that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. I will now turn it over to Chuck.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Marilyn. I hope you all are remaining safe and healthy. After the solid results we delivered last year, 2022 is proving to be an even stronger year, fueled by exceptional demand for our solutions and the continued success of our transformation. In Q2, I'm thrilled to say that we delivered another great quarter with double-digit ARR growth and robust product orders, which fueled an all-time high backlog and a strong pipeline. These results underscore the increasing relevance and criticality of Cisco's innovation in the era of digital transformation and cloud and reinforces my confidence in our ability to deliver growth. We are focused on staying ahead of our customers' most pressing needs as they navigate a dynamic world. Our customers are moving faster than ever, driven by the move to hybrid work and hybrid cloud. This requires modernized infrastructure, new security architectures and accelerated digital transformation. The breadth of our innovative solutions and services at a global scale, combined with our increasing ability to deliver more flexible consumption offerings is driving even deeper partnerships with our customers across our entire portfolio. Now I'd like to spend a few minutes covering our results in more detail in what we are seeing in the market. We delivered solid top line growth combined with margins and earnings that exceeded the high ends of our guidance despite operating in a supply-constrained and inflationary environment. The robust demand we saw in Q1 continued into Q2, with product order growth of 33%. Our third consecutive quarter of order growth of 30% or higher with momentum once again across all geographic regions and customer markets. For example, in our enterprise business, we delivered 37% order growth, the highest in over 12 years as large customers prioritize investments to modernize their networks and enable new digital capabilities and resiliency. As more and more becomes digitized, we expect our momentum to continue. We believe the need for highly secure, seamless connectivity, hybrid cloud and hybrid work solutions, along with edge computing will drive growth for Cisco. The opportunity ahead of us is clear as demonstrated by our growing pipeline and record backlog, which more than doubled from a year ago and will convert into revenue in the coming quarters. In our web scale business, we delivered another incredible quarter. Our order growth was up more than 70% year-over-year, which is over 100% growth on a trailing four-quarter basis. We continue to see exceptional performance, driven by the rapid pace of adoption of our 400-gig solutions and our routed optical networking portfolio, which grew over 50%, fueled by the Cisco 8000 product line, Acacia and Silicon One. We're also seeing tremendous traction with ZR Optics as part of the routed optical network strategy. Our Optical Systems and Acacia businesses both saw significant double-digit growth, driven by our web scale customers. The innovations we've invested in over the last several years have positioned us well as the largest players in this space adopt next-generation technologies. Our customers are making strategic decisions on their future road map and recognize Cisco's unparalleled portfolio is critical to their strategies. We believe they are still in the early phases of their next-generation platform buying decisions and expect our momentum to continue. From a product revenue perspective, we delivered another strong and balanced quarter with 9% growth with broad-based demand across the majority of our product portfolio. This was led by increased customer spending to modernize their networks, securely connect their hybrid workforce and build out their 5G networks, all with a strong uptake of our subscription offerings. We continue to prioritize investments that will drive our long-term performance and capitalize on the mega trends in large growing markets, including cloud, full stack observability, 5G, 400-gig, WiFi 6 and security. Our expertise in these areas, along with the deep integration of hardware, software and silicon across our portfolio, differentiates us and sets us up to win. Our team continues to innovate at a speed and scale like never before. To help our customers build and deliver the best hybrid work experience, we recently introduced new breakthrough networking innovations, including Catalyst 9000 X switches built on Silicon One, the industry's first high-end WiFi 6E access points and an as-a-Service private 5G offering for the enterprise, enabling communication service providers to deliver cloud-based services to their customers. We are committed to also lead in a more sustainable way. An example of this is our Silicon One Catalyst 9000 X switches I just mentioned, which are approximately 40% more power efficient compared to prior versions. Building technologies in this way is key towards our goal to reduce our Scope 3 emissions to net-zero by 2040. I'm also proud of the progress of our business transformation to more software and subscription-based recurring revenue as we transition more of our business to the cloud. Annualized recurring revenue or ARR, of $21.9 billion was up 11%, with product ARR increasing by 20%. Product remaining performance obligations, or RPO, which is largely software revenue that is committed but not yet recognized, was up 16%. We remain one of the largest software companies in the world. In Q2, our software revenue grew by 6% to $3.8 billion. Total subscription revenue accelerated to $5.5 billion, up 7% year-over-year. It's important to note that both of these metrics continue to be negatively impacted by subscription software and service that is attached to hardware where the shipments are delayed due to the component situation. The strength in our software, RPO and ARR clearly demonstrate the value we are creating through our transformation and provides us a greater degree of visibility and predictability into our future growth. From a macro perspective, the component shortage continues to remain challenging. Our incredibly strong demand continues to outpace supply, expanding our backlog of products, software and services. Our supply chain team continues to take aggressive action through strong inventory positions, deepening supplier relationships, qualifying alternative components and increased use of expedited freight. There are still significant constraints with semiconductors, preventing us from completing manufacturing of some of our products, and that remains a headwind to revenue growth despite very strong demand. In addition, the constrained environment continues to drive up supply chain costs, which we have successfully passed through to help offset these increases. In summary, we continue to work through the impact of the pandemic and component shortages, and we've never felt better about the company, our position and our outlook for growth. Our Q2 results reflect healthy momentum, a clear vision and outstanding execution by our teams. Our innovation engine and pipeline have never been stronger, and we are rapidly transforming our business by accelerating our transition to more software and subscription offerings. I'm so proud of our teams and what they've accomplished during these very dynamic times. We are bringing industry-leading innovation to market and further enhancing our differentiated position across the portfolio by delivering flexible consumption models for our customers. I remain confident and optimistic about our future. Cisco is at the epicenter of massive shifts toward hybrid cloud, hybrid work and digital transformation which we believe creates momentum for our business and positions us well to capture the significant opportunities ahead. I'll now turn it over to Scott.\nScott Herren: Thanks, Chuck. Q2 was a strong quarter across the business. We executed well, delivering our third consecutive quarter of more than 30% product order growth, driven by strength across our portfolio, including continued robust demand for our products and services, along with disciplined spend and supply chain management. Total revenue increased by $760 million to $12.7 billion, up 6% year-over-year, in line with our guidance range for the quarter. We saw strength in a number of product areas and across all of our geographies. Our business performed well in this highly dynamic and supply-constrained environment, which, as Chuck said, continues to hinder our ability to convert the significant demand we have into revenue. Overall profitability in Q2 was strong with non-GAAP operating margin of 34.3%, non-GAAP net income of $3.5 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.84 with non-GAAP earnings per share coming in above the high end of our guidance range. Looking at our Q2 revenue in more detail. Total product revenue was $9.4 billion, up 9%. Service revenue was $3.4 billion, down 1%, driven by delays in hardware support contracts related to the supply constraints. Within product revenue, Secure, Agile Networks performed well, with revenues up 7%. Switching had solid growth, driven by a double-digit increase in data center switching, driven by our Nexus 9000 products. Campus switching had solid growth, led by our Catalyst 9000 and Meraki switching offerings. Wireless had very strong double-digit increase driven by our WiFi 6 products and our Meraki wireless offerings. We also saw double-digit growth in compute revenue, driven by servers. Enterprise routing declined, primarily driven by access, slightly offset by strength in SD-WAN. Hybrid work, which is where we report just our collaboration portfolio, was down 9%, driven by declines in our collaboration devices and meetings offerings, partially offset by the continued ramp of our communication Platform-as-a-Service. Beginning next quarter, the name of this category will change from hybrid work to collaboration. There will not be any changes to the components within this category. End-to-end security grew 7%, with broad strength across most of the portfolio. Our Zero Trust portfolio performed well with double-digit growth driven by strong performance in our dual offerings. Our subscription portfolio continued to perform well, driven by cloud security and Zero Trust. Internet for the future was up 42%, driven in large part by the strength of our web scale customers. We saw broad strength in the portfolio with growth in edge, driven by double-digit growth from our ASR 9000 offerings and core with strength in Cisco 8000 and Optical. We also saw continued strong contribution from Acacia, our optical networking offerings. Optimized application experiences was up 12%, driven by double-digit growth in both ThousandEyes and Intersight. SaaS revenue for AppDynamics grew mid-single digits with the continued shift to its cloud-delivered platform. We continue to make progress on our transformation metrics as we shift our business to more software and subscriptions. Software revenue was $3.8 billion, an increase of 6% with the product portion up 9%. 80% of software revenue was subscription-based, which is up four percentage points year-over-year. Total subscription revenue was $5.5 billion, an increase of 7%. Total subscription revenue represented 44% of Cisco's total revenue. Annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, was $21.9 billion, an increase of 11%, with strong product ARR growth of 20%. And remaining performance obligations or RPO was $30.5 billion, up 8%. Product RPO increased 16%, service RPO increased 3%, and the total short-term RPO grew 8% to $16.3 billion. As a reminder, the short-term portion will convert to revenue over the next 12 months. Relative to acquisitions, there was an approximate 200 basis point year-over-year positive impact on Q2 revenue growth and no material impact on our non-GAAP EPS, which is in line with our expectations. We continue to have exceptionally strong order momentum in Q2. Total product orders grew 33%, with strength across the business. Looking at our geographic segments. The Americas was up 36% and EMEA and APJC were both up 30%. Total emerging markets were up 39%, with the BRICS plus Mexico up 48%. In our customer markets, service provider was up 42%, enterprise was up 37%, commercial was up 34% and public sector was up 20%. As you can see, it was broad strength across our geographies and customer markets. From a non-GAAP perspective, total gross margin came at 65.5%, down 140 basis points year-over-year. Product gross margin was 64.3%, down 230 basis points and service gross margin was 68.8%, up 90 basis points. The decrease in product gross margin was primarily driven by ongoing higher component costs related to supply constraints as well as higher freight and logistics costs. As we\u2019ve been discussing for several quarters, we continue to manage through the supply constraints seen industry-wide by us and our peers due to component shortages, which have resulted in extended lead times and higher supply costs. The situation remains challenging. We continue to partner closely with our key suppliers, leveraging our volume purchasing and extended supply commitments as we address the supply challenges and cost impacts, which we expect will continue into the second half of our fiscal 2022. As I mentioned, the component supply constraints also slow the conversion of our strong demand into revenue. This has resulted in a substantial increase and continued build in our backlog levels well beyond our normal historical levels. Additionally, the ongoing supply constraints have not only impacted our ability to ship hardware but also impacts our delivery of software, such as subscriptions that customers order with the hardware. That undelivered software is also included in backlog until the hardware ships which is when we begin to recognize the revenue. Of course, this impacts our software revenue growth and other related metrics. To give you a sense of scale of our backlog, our Q2 ending product backlog was more than $14 billion, an increase of more than 150% year-on-year. Within that amount, software backlog almost doubled to more than $2 billion. Keeping in mind that backlog is not included as part of our $38.5 billion in remaining performance obligations. We ended Q2 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $21.1 billion. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $2.5 billion, down 17% year-over-year, primarily driven by advanced payments to secure future supply. These advanced payments had a negative 17% year-over-year impact on operating cash flow. Additionally, we made a tax payment of approximately $100 million this quarter, which have been deferred as a result of the CARES Act. This payment had an additional negative 4% year-over-year impact on our operating cash flow. In terms of capital allocation, we returned $6.4 billion to shareholders during the quarter was comprised of $4.8 billion of share repurchases and $1.5 billion for our quarterly cash dividend. Given the confidence we have in our business today and into the future, our Board has authorized an additional $15 billion for share repurchases, bringing the total to approximately $18 billion. We\u2019re also raising our dividend by $0.01 to $0.38 per quarter, which represents our 12th increase. Combination of our dividend increase, additional share repurchase authorization and higher share repurchases during the quarter demonstrates our commitment to returning excess capital to our shareholders and our confidence in the stability of our ongoing cash flows. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. We closed the acquisition of Replex in Q2 and Opsani in early Q3 to enhance our full stack observability offerings. These investments are consistent with our strategy of complementing our internal innovation in R&D with targeted M&A to allow us to further strengthen and differentiate our market position in our key growth areas. To summarize, we had another good quarter with robust product demand and solid execution in a complex supply-constrained environment. We continue to make progress on our business model shift and are making the investments in innovation to capitalize on our significant growth opportunities and expanding addressable markets. We\u2019re seeing progress as we drive the continued shift to more software and subscription revenue delivering growth and driving shareholder value. Now let me provide our financial guidance for Q3. As a reminder, the third quarter of last year included an extra week, which was a benefit to total revenue of approximately 3 points of growth. The total impact on our cost of sales and operating expenses was approximately $150 million, and this translated into a $0.04 benefit to earnings per share in our Q3 of last year. For next quarter, we expect revenue growth to be in the range of 3% to 5%. We anticipate non-GAAP gross margins to be in the range of 63.5% to 64.5%, reflecting the continuing increase in supply chain costs we\u2019re incurring as we protect shipments to our customers. Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 32.5% to 33.5%, non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.85 to $0.87. For the full year of fiscal 2022, we are tightening the range as follows: we expect revenue growth to be in the range of 5.5% to 6.5% year-on-year, non-GAAP earnings per share is increasing to $3.41 to $3.46, up 5.9% to 7.5% year-on-year. In both our Q3 and full year guidance, we\u2019re assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. I\u2019ll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Scott. Michelle, let\u2019s go ahead and queue up the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. You may go ahead.\nIttai Kidron: Thanks. Guys, nice to see the good results. I want to dig into the supply chain a little bit Chuck and Scott. Maybe you can talk about, just kind of quarter-over-quarter, have things gotten a little bit worse, a little bit better? And is there any timetable in mind where you think we could see a material improvement? And maybe on the back of that, Scott, when we see this improvement should we just expect like a period of I don\u2019t know, two, three quarters where you really have outsized growth as you fulfill this unusual backlog? I\u2019m just trying to understand the scenario here of how all of this gets unwounded?\nChuck Robbins: Yes. Ittai, thanks for the question. I\u2019ll start and then Scott can jump in. I would say during the quarter, supply chain didn\u2019t get materially worse and didn\u2019t really get materially better. It was pretty consistent. There were gives and takes throughout the quarter, but I think at a macro level, that\u2019s where I\u2019d characterize it. They were a little bit towards the end some Omicron effect with people being sick and not being able to show up in factories and some of the logistics issues that are well documented. But in general, that\u2019s what we saw. We don\u2019t have \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t say we have a great timeline for you as to when things begin to improve. All we know now is we expect this to be with us through the second half of our year. Scott, would you add?\nScott Herren: Yes. No, I think that\u2019s right. That\u2019s in sync with our expectations. And Ittai to your question on how does this unwind, it\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t believe it unwinds in a lumpy fashion. I think it\u2019ll unwind as supply and demand get more in balance. And I think that will just happen gradually over the course of the next few quarters. So I\u2019m not expecting a significant bump in any given quarter. I think the supply frees up with $14 billion of backlog, we\u2019ve got plenty of demand to go off and fulfill. It\u2019s really a question of when does that supply free up. And as it does free up, I think it will happen gradually over time.\nIttai Kidron: Got it. Maybe, Scott, just to clarify this last point, is there any way for you to know how much of this backlog is double ordering? I don\u2019t know what it means from a customer standpoint that you have all this backlog are customers really waiting for a long time to product? And what is the risk you have some kind of double order elements in these figures?\nChuck Robbins: Ittai, that\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been alert to and watching for since we began building the backlog after three consecutive quarters of demand growth in the 30% range and revenue growth only in the 6% to 8% range. We\u2019ve been building substantial backlog, and so we\u2019ve been looking to that. I think it\u2019s clear that customers are responding to our lead times, and our lead times have extended as the lead times for the components have extended. So there\u2019s I\u2019d say, some extension in there. But I think what we\u2019re seeing is real demand. I think it\u2019s a combination of pent-up demand from products that didn\u2019t get done during the pandemic. I think it\u2019s the leading edge of several of these trends that we\u2019ve talked about that we\u2019re investing into. And when we look at things like if there was double ordering, you probably wouldn\u2019t see that as much in the commercial and small customers, and we\u2019re still seeing strong growth in that segment. You probably also would see the pipeline build begin to slow down and we\u2019re not seeing that either. Our pipeline is quite robust at this point. So we\u2019re looking for proxies to try to understand that better. We\u2019re not seeing anything at this point that would indicate there\u2019s double ordering in there.\nIttai Kidron: Excellent. Thank you so much.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Ittai. Next question, please.\nOperator: Paul Silverstein from Cowen. You may go ahead sir.\nPaul Silverstein: Thanks, guys. I guess, is there anything wrong with the following logic with respect to your elevated costs? At some point, logistics freight costs are going to return to normal, if not, entirely back to where they were a year, year and half ago, largely. And as far as the stickier component and semiconductor costs, to the extent they don\u2019t revert, your price increases eventually over the next three to four quarters as you burn off backlog that they will offset, if not in full then in large measure those elevated costs. Before I ask the follow-up, is that \u2013 is there anything wrong with that logic?\nChuck Robbins: I think, Paul, there\u2019s nothing wrong with the logic. I think the expectations that I would give you are the same that I gave you last quarter. As I think about gross margin through the end of this fiscal year, I think it stays in the range we\u2019re in, in the 64% to 65% range through the end of the year. Beyond that, as you said, and I hope you\u2019re right that logistics costs begin to return to something that\u2019s more normal. Obviously, the price increases that we put in place, we\u2019ve talked about this previously. We\u2019re not seeing much benefit from that today. Because the price increase goes in, there\u2019s offsets between the time we started and it gets out to the field. The field then has to take those prices sell it to customers. Those orders have to come in into the backlog and then get fulfilled out of the backlog before we finally get the revenue credit for those price increases. And I think that we\u2019ll will begin to see benefit from those price increases toward the end of this quarter and more into Q4. But my expectation on gross margins at this point is that they stay in the range that we\u2019re in right now in the 64% to 65% range through the end of the year.\nPaul Silverstein: Got it. Chuck, on the revenue side, this is the best demand environment across enterprise, carrier and web scale I\u2019ve seen in 26 years covering the seven. And you\u2019d have to go back to the late \u201890s. And of course, that proved to be a bubble. We see your growth \u2013 the growth of your peers, Arista, Juniper, Extreme, F5 et cetera, how much of what\u2019s going on is pure market growth? How much of this has improved execution on the part of Cisco?\nChuck Robbins: That\u2019s a really good question. And I would say that it is definitely a combination of both. The markets are certainly robust as you called out with seeing some of our peers who are having solid results as well. But then when you look at \u2013 when I look at the order growth rates in certain segments of our business, certain technology areas, I can tell you we\u2019re gaining share. I mean web scale, obviously, we\u2019re executing incredibly well because we didn\u2019t exist there just a couple of years ago. And in some of our technology areas like WiFi, I mean, the growth rates on the order side, even campus switching to gross on the order side. I think that \u2013 I think there\u2019s a lot of really good execution. I think our portfolio is in great shape. And you have to remember, we\u2019re on the front end of these multiyear trends that are really in our favor, whether it\u2019s 5G, whether it\u2019s 400 gig, WiFi 6, hybrid cloud, hybrid work, edge compute. I mean these are all technology areas and transitions that are positive for us. So those are somewhat market-related, but I think our portfolio is well positioned for those transitions.\nPaul Silverstein: Appreciate it.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Chuck. Next question.\nOperator: Sami Badri from Credit Suisse. You may go ahead sir.\nSami Badri: Hi. Thank you very much. So I got two hard questions for you guys. I\u2019ll keep this like a one short, but here\u2019s the first one. So I want to congratulate you guys on the 30%-plus product order growth. And I think what a lot of us really want to know is what is the right normalized growth rate? Or when do you see the normalized growth rate finally starting to flow through your numbers? And we look at the 30% and think this is a thematic trend. But at some point, needs to come back down a little bit. When do you see the normalization of that product corridor growth to actually happen? So that's the first question. The second question is a $20 billion question. Are you guys buying Splunk? And if not, what have been the internal considerations for not doing the deal?\nChuck Robbins: So let me answer, I guess, both of them. So the \u2013 on the first one, I think that next quarter, Q3, the compares definitely get tougher from a year ago, particularly because we had an extra week of order as well. And then in Q4, obviously, that was the first quarter that we experienced a 30% plus quarter from last fiscal year. So certainly, those will be good quarters for us to sort of see a litmus test on your question. Until then, I'm not sure I have a direct answer for you, but certainly, the math will get tougher here in the next couple of quarters. On your second question, first of all, we don't comment on rumors and speculations or stories. What I will tell you is that we are constantly evaluating potential opportunities. Scott and I were talking. We think for every deal we do, we probably look at 10 to 15 companies. We base our decisions on, first and foremost, strategic fit; secondly, cultural fit and equally as important, the financial and the valuation fit. And we are always disciplined and we continue to focus on both inorganic and organic opportunities. But I will tell you that you should expect us to continue to be very, very disciplined as we go forward as well.\nSami Badri: Got it. Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Next question please.\nOperator: Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead.\nRod Hall: Great, thanks guys. I wanted to come back to gross margins for the quarter. You guys substantially beat the top end of your guidance range. And I wanted to see if you could just comment on what were the positive surprises within that gross margin line? And then my second question, maybe kind of a non-sequitur, but I was really surprised, Chuck, on the public sector orders. Those were really strong. And I wonder if you could maybe dig into that a little bit and comment on some of the dynamics there in the public sector? Thanks.\nScott Herren: I'll take the first one. On the gross margin, Rod, it really came down to product mix that we had the components for that we could build and ship out during Q2. As I said earlier, our expectations on gross margin for the year are unchanged. And we had favorable product mix in Q2 that drove us above as I'm sure you're aware, above the high end of our guidance range. I think it's a bit of a headwind for us as we look at gross margins in Q3, but it equals out for the year. And so our expectations for the full-year on gross margin are unchanged.\nRod Hall: Scott, can you comment on specifically what types of products mix in positively there? Just give us a little more color?\nScott Herren: It's always a mix. When you go across product lines and across customer size, both of those things have an effect. Rather than kind of go through and parse product by product, it's \u2013 we had a quarter where the supply we had just allowed us to ship higher-margin product. And again, given the visibility we have with $314 billion of backlog, we have pretty good visibility into what we need to build and a pretty good feel for what that's going to look like in the quarters ahead. So I feel confident that we're going to stay in this range through the end of the year.\nChuck Robbins: And on the public sector question, I think it's a good catch on your part, because a lot of people look at the 20% and see it as being below the other customer markets in and would look at that negatively. But the reality is, it's been the most consistent for the last couple of years. And we saw broad-based strength. And whether it was in our government business, which has been, I think, we've had \u2013 so I'm looking at some data here, six consecutive quarters of positive growth and three out of the last four strong double-digit growth, if you look at education, we've had five straight quarters or six straight quarters there as well and it's been particularly strong in the last five quarters. And so it was very broad-based across the public sector.\nRod Hall: Great. Okay, thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks Rod. Next question.\nOperator: Tim Long from Barclays. You may go ahead.\nTim Long: Thank you. Yes, I just wanted to ask on the software side, decent year-over-year growth in the quarter. I understand it's still being hampered a little bit. But maybe just talk a little bit, Chuck, about when you think we'll start to see that accelerate a little bit more than the overall revenues? Is it Cat 9K? Is it some other products moving to more software as a recovery in some of the other businesses? And then the follow-up is on the cloud business. You talked about the strong orders again. Could you just give us a little color kind of what's driving that? And then more than just product basis are you seeing competitive wins, new use cases, new customers? What's really driving that 70% year-over-year and 100% over the last four quarters? Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: I'm pulling out some data here. So Tim, on the first one, on the software front, I think you have a really good question. I think Scott called out in his section that our product software revenue growth was 9%. The thing \u2013 you got to get behind that to understand what's going on. And our old perpetual software, which we've been in transition from two subscriptions, perpetual was down 12% and subscription was up 17%. So the transition is actually happening the way we expect it. That's the reason you're seeing some of that, because the subscription stuff, obviously, is recognized over time, and you're taking a 12% hit on a onetime piece of software from the way we used to sell it. So you've got that dynamic that just has to continue to play out. You have the renewals that you mentioned starting to come through on some of the D&A stuff in earnest in 2023 and then 2024, 2025 beginning to ramp. And then you've got over $2 billion of software sitting in backlog that is not an RPO yet because it's connected to a piece of hardware that hasn't shipped. And we recognize a bit of that upfront and then the rest over time. So we've got all of those variables in play right now. All that being said, I think you should expect \u2013 when we get to a normalized world, I would expect that once we get this supply chain in the backlog, clearly in a normal world, I would expect you would see software growth, revenue growth growing faster. But right now, with our backlog so big, that may not happen for several quarters.\nScott Herren: Yes. That $2 billion of software, it's a little bit more than $2 billion sitting in our backlog right now. That's almost double where it was just a year ago, right? So there's always some that will sit in backlog, but it's almost double. And of course, most of that software is recognized ratably. So the ramp, once we can get it cleared out of the backlog and shipped, we're still going to have a ratable ramp on that. So longer term, if you remember what we said in September, we said the recurring revenue parts of our product business, we expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 15% to 17%. That's what we just put up, all right? The product subscription piece in our software business grew 17% in the quarter. So I think we're right on track in that space.\nChuck Robbins: I'm trying to find the breakdown of the different franchises in, let\u2019s give where was that? Do you remember?\nMarilyn Mora: Yes, let me get it for you.\nChuck Robbins: Okay. On the cloud side, I think I'd just \u2013 no, I don't have it in front of me. On the cloud side, here's what I would tell you is that, we are winning \u2013 continuing to win new use cases around with our integrated systems, the Silicon One systems as well as we have one use cases where they're simply buying our hardware, meaning a switch that they're running their operating system on. We have certain customers that are running multiple consumption models where one may be buying silicon and they also buy the hardware switch, one may be buying an integrated system and silicon. And so it's a variation of all of those, and we are winning new competitive use cases, and I don't think that's not what I'll look for. Okay. So it's a \u2013 sorry, I was just \u2013 Marilyn was trying to find it, but I was going to tell you, a number of customers and what \u2013 which \u2013 how many franchises we want in. I don't have that in front of me right now, and we'll try to get that. But in general, we are definitely winning new use cases.\nTim Long: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Next question please.\nOperator: David Vogt from UBS. You may go ahead.\nDavid Vogt: Great guys, thanks for taking my question. I just want to go back to capital allocation for a second. Over the last five years, you've been pretty consistent in deploying free cash flow to dividends, buybacks, although that materially correlated in the quarter and acquisitions. Can you kind of expand on your philosophy over the next several years with respect to potential uses going forward given the recent increase in the buyback today? And has your position around leverage and the use of leverage changed? And ultimately, what amount of cash flow would you be comfortable with on the balance sheet to run the business given the order strength that you're seeing, the working capital needs and supply chain uncertainty?\nScott Herren: There's a lot in there, David. What I'd start by saying is the buyback that you saw, the additional buyback that you saw in Q2 and the add to our outstanding authorization to take it up to just short of $18 billion and the $0.01 increase in dividend, those are all signs of the confidence we have in our business and the growth we see ahead. So 2018, we have returned, as you alluded to, we've returned $76 billion in capital to shareholders just as 2018. There's no change in our overall cap allocation policy to answer that question for you. It starts with, first and foremost, supporting the growth of the business. through both organic and inorganic means. Obviously, we'll support the dividend. We'll, at a minimum, offset the dilution of our equity plans and beyond that, return the excess to shareholders as you saw us just do. There's no change in our overall policy. In terms of working capital, we've got \u2013 I would wager to say the strongest balance sheet in the industry. Certainly amongst our peers, we've got the strongest balance sheet out there. I don't feel like we're constrained at all by the amount of cash we have to keep on the balance sheet to support operations.\nDavid Vogt: Maybe just as a quick follow-up to that, along the same lines. Obviously, you talked about culture, tech-fit and ultimately, making it work financially if there is an M&A opportunity on the horizon, I think historically, you haven't really used your balance sheet as aggressively using leverage to do a transaction. I mean, does that fit with how you're thinking about the business going forward? Is that a consideration? Or should we expect to be in sort of the same ranges from a leverage perspective, whether it's measured on gross or net debt perspective or cash perspective in your case?\nScott Herren: Yes, I don't actually think of it in those terms as it relates to M&A. It's more back to what Chuck said earlier, is it a strategic fit? Is a cultural fit? Does the valuation makes sense? Those are the kind of considerations that come into play as we're thinking about M&A versus what's the strength of the balance sheet. Again, I would stack our balance sheet up against anyone.\nDavid Vogt: Great, thanks Scott.\nChuck Robbins: I want to jump back in real quick and answer \u2013 give Tim the double click that I was looking for on the use cases. So we have five players who use \u2013 our customers who use Silicon One and Cisco 8000 systems. We have two that use Silicon One with the 8000 series routers with their own operating systems. We have two that use Silicon One embedded in their own white box hardware. And we have three that use at least two of the flexible consumption modes simultaneously. So that's the data that I was trying to get to you Tim.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks Chuck. Next question.\nOperator: Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.\nMeta Marshall: Great, thanks. Maybe just a question on passing through pricing to customers. Just what those conversations are like maybe by category of customer? And just whether you're seeing larger orders in the attempt to kind of offset some of those pricing increases? And then maybe a second question for you, Chuck. Just as you're starting to see customers move towards more architecture modernization versus just kind of catch-up spend. Maybe more specifically, by enterprises, are there \u2013 what are some of the strongest themes that you're seeing in terms of that modernization? Thanks.\nChuck Robbins: Yes. Thanks, Meta. So I think that clearly, we have customers who are definitely trying to buy ahead of price increases. And the conversations are, they've gone from, I'd say, being generally understanding to being a little more frustrated, primarily because of the length of time it's taken to get the product. And so they're running out of patience as we all are, but everybody generally understands. Because candidly, most of our customers are probably doing the same thing to their customers in whatever business they're in, in general, given the inflationary pressure that we see everywhere. So that\u2019s the first one. And the second one on the architectural transformations that we see out there, there\u2019s a massive one that is really being driven by hybrid work. So rearchitecting your entire network infrastructure to deal with distributed applications, distributed users, distributed data, a new security architecture to accommodate it. That\u2019s one. Obviously, within that is hybrid cloud, where you have applications running in multiple cloud providers as well as in private data centers. I mean, the demand we saw for our data center switching portfolio was extremely strong in addition to UCS, which tells me that customers are still investing in private data centers as well. So that creates traffic patterns that are not aligned with the architectures that our customers built over the last 15 years. So that\u2019s the first one. And then there are these transitions that I talked about earlier. You\u2019ve got customers upgrading to 400 gig. We\u2019re almost at 700 customers now who have 400-gig ports. We\u2019ve now taken orders for 737,000 ports. We had 200-plus thousand ports booked in the quarter, which is almost 1,500% growth. So we \u2013 400 gig is certainly taken off. The WiFi 6 transition has been pretty significant. And those are just some of the things we see. And then in the service provider space, you see 400 gig, you see 5G transition and you see them building out enterprise services based on 5G. So those are some of the major transitions that we see.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks.\nMarilyn Mora: Next question, please.\nOperator: James Suva from Citigroup. You may go ahead.\nJames Suva: Thank you. Scott, you had mentioned margins, and I think you\u2019d mentioned at this level through the rest of the year. I did want to \u2013 I just want to qualify, was that for the calendar year or fiscal year? And a little bit of color because my understanding is as you put through product price increases, customers who may have already booked things prior to those increases will still get the product, but you\u2019re still paying higher shipping costs and potentially component costs. So I wonder if in the second half of calendar year 2023, if actually margins could expand or maybe they just offset each other? Thank you.\nScott Herren: Yes. I think you\u2019re thinking about it the right way, Jim. It\u2019s not a \u2013 most \u2013 a lot of what we have in the backlog of our products that were ordered pre the price increase, certainly the latest round of price increases. Logistics costs are still with us. But as I said earlier, I think that if you remember, we\u2019ve had a couple of rounds of price increases, and I think we begin to see the benefit of that first one toward the end of Q3 and expect to see it again in Q4. With the level of visibility we have, both $16 billion of short-term RPO, $30 billion of total RPO and add to that $14 billion of backlog, we have better visibility than we\u2019ve ever had as I look ahead. So feel good that the gross margins will stay in that 64% to 65% range through the second half. And that is of the fiscal year is what I\u2019m talking about, the second half of our fiscal year.\nJames Suva: Thank you so much for the details and congratulations.\nChuck Robbins: Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Jim. Next question?\nOperator: Tal Liani from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nTal Liani: Hi, guys. I have questions on two of your segments. The first one is on security. Your trends are kind of not correlated with the industry trends. First, the previous two quarters, you slowed down materially, but now you\u2019re accelerating again, and there was acceleration over the last two quarters. Can you explain why you\u2019re seeing these trends? Why we see acceleration as much as why we saw deceleration before? And second is the service revenues. This is the fourth quarter of deceleration. We got to negative territories for growth now. Can you speak \u2013 can you also explain services? And how should we model it going forward?\nChuck Robbins: Yes, Tal, thanks for the question. I\u2019ll take security, and I\u2019ll let Scott talk about services because I know he did some work on that. On the security front, I would say that we have strength in several areas of that portfolio, particularly a lot of the SaaS elements that we have in the portfolio. We do have some supply chain issues that are continuing with the firewalls. But again, the SaaS and software components grew at a healthy rate. The teams are working on a next-generation strategy right now. And I feel confident that over the next 12 months to 18 months, you should continue to see improvement in that business, but we also need to get supply chain issues still with on the firewall front. Scott, do you want to talk about services?\nScott Herren: Yes, Tal, on the services piece, what you have to bear in mind is two things. Most of that\u2019s ratable. And most of that is the support services we sell attached to hardware. And so there\u2019s always a lag, right? When you build up a big ratable revenue base, it takes time to build it up. So it takes it a while to ramp up to speed, but it also takes time for it to come back down. And if you look at our product revenue rates go back 12, 18 months during the midst of the pandemic, of course, our product growth rates were quite low. And the echo effect of that is, we sold fewer services contracts, and we\u2019re selling less revenue. It takes time for that to show up in the revenue stream because so much of that is ratable and it builds up in deferred revenue and bleeds out over time. So what we\u2019re dealing with now is just the tail of the services that would have been attached to the hardware at a time when hardware sales, if you go back 12 to 18 months ago, we\u2019re fairly low. The flip side is, look at the growth of our RPO at $30.5 billion, growing 8%. Obviously, the ratable services fit inside there and the short term at $16.3 billion, growing 8% gives you a sense of what the path ahead looks that\u2019s both services and software, but it gives you a sense of what the path ahead looks like.\nTal Liani: Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Tal. Next question?\nOperator: Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Please go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Yes, thanks for taking my question. I guess the first one I have is really on the campus side \u2013 on the campus solutions side. And I\u2019m not under sense of how do you think that segment or product portfolio stacks up as we go through the rest of the year and we get back to some form of hybrid work. And also on campus, I think a lot of your peers is not every one of your peers has talked about picking up market share. You have the dominant position there. I\u2019d love to understand what you see in the marketplace and what your ability to defend share given everyone\u2019s talking about it?\nChuck Robbins: Yes. Amit, I could not understand the first part of your question. Would you like repeat that one?\nAmit Daryanani: Yes. Chuck, I was just trying to understand, on the campus side, how do you think that segment stacks up for the year as we go back into some form of hybrid work? And then competitively, a lot of your peers have talked about picking up share. So how do you see the market share dynamic play out?\nChuck Robbins: Got it. Okay. So what we believe we\u2019re seeing is this pure modernization that\u2019s occurring. We see densification of WiFi networks, in particular. So we\u2019re seeing more and more access points per workspace than what was pre-COVID to just ensure reliability, which then falls through to requiring a more robust switching infrastructure to support it. We believe customers are preparing for putting more and more video units into conference rooms, which will be hardwired, which drives more switch ports. We have more security cameras that are IP base that are going in. IoT is beginning to expand connecting building automation systems and all of those things just require an incredibly robust and resilient campus network. So we think that\u2019s what\u2019s going on. And on the second question, market share is a funny thing, and it\u2019s certainly \u2013 it\u2019s obviously based on revenue. And I can tell you that based on the growth rates from an orders perspective and how much of that is sitting in our backlog, I\u2019m not concerned. We \u2013 I cannot imagine that the market is growing faster than the order growth that we\u2019ve seen over the last three quarters. It\u2019s \u2013 just revenue.\nAmit Daryanani: Fair enough. And Chuck, if I could just ask you a quick one. What scenario would it take for Cisco to start being buyback about just offsetting dilution? And maybe the inverse midcaps  this is the question, how much cash is too much on your book that you may have to do more aggressive buybacks?\nScott Herren: Yes. Amit, I mean, you saw we went pretty aggressive into the buyback during Q2 at $4.8 billion in the quarter. That\u2019s obviously well beyond what\u2019s required just to offset dilution. And I think, historically, if you look back, you\u2019ll see we\u2019ve been pretty aggressive on share buybacks over the last several years with the dividend and share buybacks returning $76 billion since 2018. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a change in stance or a change in demeanor as we look at that. We\u2019re constantly evaluating where we are from a cash standpoint, what our needs are. I told you the priority of our capital allocation policy has not changed. Both the growth of the business organically and organically first. The dividend, anti-dilution and beyond that, we\u2019ll return cash to shareholders. So I think that\u2019s the way you need to think about it going forward. There\u2019s no real change in policy, but you saw us get pretty aggressive in the first half of Q2.\nAmit Daryanani: Perfect. Thank you and congrats in the quarter.\nChuck Robbins: Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Next question?\nOperator: Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Thanks for taking my questions. I had two quick ones. Chuck, you talked about the strength that you\u2019re seeing with web-scale customers within the service provider customer segment. Maybe if you can give us some details about what you\u2019re seeing from telcos and cable and though strand as well what visibility they are providing you at this point? And then from my follow-up, I just want to go back to orders again and your enterprise orders did at straight from 30% to I think 37% from first quarter to second. Is there a composition of all the orders that\u2019s driving that acceleration? Or are you seeing an underlying acceleration? Can you just kind of help us think through that? Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Yes, Samik. So on the service provider space, I\u2019d say just to give you a general sense, I gave you the web-scale numbers at over 70%. I\u2019d say \u2013 and the overall service provider segment was 42%. And cable is roughly flattish, give or take a point or two. And the telco space was incredibly strong, incredibly strong for us. So both the web-scale and the telco space were the key contributors to that 42%. And then on the second question, \u2013 what was the second question?\nMarilyn Mora: Enterprise growth.\nChuck Robbins: Enterprise growth. Thank you. Yes, when you look at it across \u2013 I mean, whether you look at it across the geographies or you look at across \u2013 generally across our product portfolio, or even across verticals, it was just super consistent. I mean it was \u2013 every customer seems to be moving right now. And so I don\u2019t think there\u2019s not one specific thing to call out. It was pretty broad-based.\nMarilyn Mora: And I think that was our last question for the call. And Chuck, do you want to close with some closing remarks?\nChuck Robbins: Yes, I do, Marilyn. Thank you. First of all, I\u2019m proud of what we were able to accomplish in Q2 despite the ongoing component demands or component dynamics, the product order growth, the revenue, the EPS, the ARR growth, the RPO growth, the balanced growth across the world. Really pleased with our continued success in web-scale and just happy that our customers are choosing our technology as they continue down this digital transformation path. I think it speaks to the relevance and criticality of what we\u2019re building and what our teams have built \u2013 and I want to just take a minute to thank all the Cisco employees because it\u2019s been an incredibly difficult couple of years. I think the team has showed a great deal of resiliency, delivered breakthrough innovation and really doing everything we can to take care of our customers. So \u2013 thanks for spending time with us today, and we\u2019ll talk to you next time.\nMarilyn Mora: Great. Thanks, Chuck. Cisco, the next quarterly earnings conference call, which will reflect our fiscal 2022 third quarter results will be on Wednesday, May 18, 2022 at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time, 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time. This now concludes today\u2019s call. If you have any further questions, feel free to reach out to the Cisco Investor Relations group.

            "content": "Thanks, Marilyn. I hope you all are remaining safe and healthy. After the solid results we delivered last year, 2022 is proving to be an even stronger year, fueled by exceptional demand for our solutions and the continued success of our transformation. In Q2, I'm thrilled to say that we delivered another great quarter with double-digit ARR growth and robust product orders, which fueled an all-time high backlog and a strong pipeline. These results underscore the increasing relevance and criticality of Cisco's innovation in the era of digital transformation and cloud and reinforces my confidence in our ability to deliver growth. We are focused on staying ahead of our customers' most pressing needs as they navigate a dynamic world. Our customers are moving faster than ever, driven by the move to hybrid work and hybrid cloud. This requires modernized infrastructure, new security architectures and accelerated digital transformation. The breadth of our innovative solutions and services at a global scale, combined with our increasing ability to deliver more flexible consumption offerings is driving even deeper partnerships with our customers across our entire portfolio. Now I'd like to spend a few minutes covering our results in more detail in what we are seeing in the market. We delivered solid top line growth combined with margins and earnings that exceeded the high ends of our guidance despite operating in a supply-constrained and inflationary environment. The robust demand we saw in Q1 continued into Q2, with product order growth of 33%. Our third consecutive quarter of order growth of 30% or higher with momentum once again across all geographic regions and customer markets. For example, in our enterprise business, we delivered 37% order growth, the highest in over 12 years as large customers prioritize investments to modernize their networks and enable new digital capabilities and resiliency. As more and more becomes digitized, we expect our momentum to continue. We believe the need for highly secure, seamless connectivity, hybrid cloud and hybrid work solutions, along with edge computing will drive growth for Cisco. The opportunity ahead of us is clear as demonstrated by our growing pipeline and record backlog, which more than doubled from a year ago and will convert into revenue in the coming quarters. In our web scale business, we delivered another incredible quarter. Our order growth was up more than 70% year-over-year, which is over 100% growth on a trailing four-quarter basis. We continue to see exceptional performance, driven by the rapid pace of adoption of our 400-gig solutions and our routed optical networking portfolio, which grew over 50%, fueled by the Cisco 8000 product line, Acacia and Silicon One. We're also seeing tremendous traction with ZR Optics as part of the routed optical network strategy. Our Optical Systems and Acacia businesses both saw significant double-digit growth, driven by our web scale customers. The innovations we've invested in over the last several years have positioned us well as the largest players in this space adopt next-generation technologies. Our customers are making strategic decisions on their future road map and recognize Cisco's unparalleled portfolio is critical to their strategies. We believe they are still in the early phases of their next-generation platform buying decisions and expect our momentum to continue. From a product revenue perspective, we delivered another strong and balanced quarter with 9% growth with broad-based demand across the majority of our product portfolio. This was led by increased customer spending to modernize their networks, securely connect their hybrid workforce and build out their 5G networks, all with a strong uptake of our subscription offerings. We continue to prioritize investments that will drive our long-term performance and capitalize on the mega trends in large growing markets, including cloud, full stack observability, 5G, 400-gig, WiFi 6 and security. Our expertise in these areas, along with the deep integration of hardware, software and silicon across our portfolio, differentiates us and sets us up to win. Our team continues to innovate at a speed and scale like never before. To help our customers build and deliver the best hybrid work experience, we recently introduced new breakthrough networking innovations, including Catalyst 9000 X switches built on Silicon One, the industry's first high-end WiFi 6E access points and an as-a-Service private 5G offering for the enterprise, enabling communication service providers to deliver cloud-based services to their customers. We are committed to also lead in a more sustainable way. An example of this is our Silicon One Catalyst 9000 X switches I just mentioned, which are approximately 40% more power efficient compared to prior versions. Building technologies in this way is key towards our goal to reduce our Scope 3 emissions to net-zero by 2040. I'm also proud of the progress of our business transformation to more software and subscription-based recurring revenue as we transition more of our business to the cloud. Annualized recurring revenue or ARR, of $21.9 billion was up 11%, with product ARR increasing by 20%. Product remaining performance obligations, or RPO, which is largely software revenue that is committed but not yet recognized, was up 16%. We remain one of the largest software companies in the world. In Q2, our software revenue grew by 6% to $3.8 billion. Total subscription revenue accelerated to $5.5 billion, up 7% year-over-year. It's important to note that both of these metrics continue to be negatively impacted by subscription software and service that is attached to hardware where the shipments are delayed due to the component situation. The strength in our software, RPO and ARR clearly demonstrate the value we are creating through our transformation and provides us a greater degree of visibility and predictability into our future growth. From a macro perspective, the component shortage continues to remain challenging. Our incredibly strong demand continues to outpace supply, expanding our backlog of products, software and services. Our supply chain team continues to take aggressive action through strong inventory positions, deepening supplier relationships, qualifying alternative components and increased use of expedited freight. There are still significant constraints with semiconductors, preventing us from completing manufacturing of some of our products, and that remains a headwind to revenue growth despite very strong demand. In addition, the constrained environment continues to drive up supply chain costs, which we have successfully passed through to help offset these increases. In summary, we continue to work through the impact of the pandemic and component shortages, and we've never felt better about the company, our position and our outlook for growth. Our Q2 results reflect healthy momentum, a clear vision and outstanding execution by our teams. Our innovation engine and pipeline have never been stronger, and we are rapidly transforming our business by accelerating our transition to more software and subscription offerings. I'm so proud of our teams and what they've accomplished during these very dynamic times. We are bringing industry-leading innovation to market and further enhancing our differentiated position across the portfolio by delivering flexible consumption models for our customers. I remain confident and optimistic about our future. Cisco is at the epicenter of massive shifts toward hybrid cloud, hybrid work and digital transformation which we believe creates momentum for our business and positions us well to capture the significant opportunities ahead. I'll now turn it over to Scott. Yes. Ittai, thanks for the question. I'll start and then Scott can jump in. I would say during the quarter, supply chain didn't get materially worse and didn't really get materially better. It was pretty consistent. There were gives and takes throughout the quarter, but I think at a macro level, that's where I'd characterize it. They were a little bit towards the end some Omicron effect with people being sick and not being able to show up in factories and some of the logistics issues that are well documented. But in general, that's what we saw. We don't have \u2013 I wouldn't say we have a great timeline for you as to when things begin to improve. All we know now is we expect this to be with us through the second half of our year. Scott, would you add? Ittai, that's something that we've been alert to and watching for since we began building the backlog after three consecutive quarters of demand growth in the 30% range and revenue growth only in the 6% to 8% range. We've been building substantial backlog, and so we've been looking to that. I think it's clear that customers are responding to our lead times, and our lead times have extended as the lead times for the components have extended. So there's I'd say, some extension in there. But I think what we're seeing is real demand. I think it's a combination of pent-up demand from products that didn't get done during the pandemic. I think it's the leading edge of several of these trends that we've talked about that we're investing into. And when we look at things like if there was double ordering, you probably wouldn't see that as much in the commercial and small customers, and we're still seeing strong growth in that segment. You probably also would see the pipeline build begin to slow down and we're not seeing that either. Our pipeline is quite robust at this point. So we're looking for proxies to try to understand that better. We're not seeing anything at this point that would indicate there's double ordering in there. I think, Paul, there's nothing wrong with the logic. I think the expectations that I would give you are the same that I gave you last quarter. As I think about gross margin through the end of this fiscal year, I think it stays in the range we're in, in the 64% to 65% range through the end of the year. Beyond that, as you said, and I hope you're right that logistics costs begin to return to something that's more normal. Obviously, the price increases that we put in place, we've talked about this previously. We're not seeing much benefit from that today. Because the price increase goes in, there's offsets between the time we started and it gets out to the field. The field then has to take those prices sell it to customers. Those orders have to come in into the backlog and then get fulfilled out of the backlog before we finally get the revenue credit for those price increases. And I think that we'll will begin to see benefit from those price increases toward the end of this quarter and more into Q4. But my expectation on gross margins at this point is that they stay in the range that we're in right now in the 64% to 65% range through the end of the year. That's a really good question. And I would say that it is definitely a combination of both. The markets are certainly robust as you called out with seeing some of our peers who are having solid results as well. But then when you look at \u2013 when I look at the order growth rates in certain segments of our business, certain technology areas, I can tell you we're gaining share. I mean web scale, obviously, we're executing incredibly well because we didn't exist there just a couple of years ago. And in some of our technology areas like WiFi, I mean, the growth rates on the order side, even campus switching to gross on the order side. I think that \u2013 I think there's a lot of really good execution. I think our portfolio is in great shape. And you have to remember, we're on the front end of these multiyear trends that are really in our favor, whether it's 5G, whether it's 400 gig, WiFi 6, hybrid cloud, hybrid work, edge compute. I mean these are all technology areas and transitions that are positive for us. So those are somewhat market-related, but I think our portfolio is well positioned for those transitions. So let me answer, I guess, both of them. So the \u2013 on the first one, I think that next quarter, Q3, the compares definitely get tougher from a year ago, particularly because we had an extra week of order as well. And then in Q4, obviously, that was the first quarter that we experienced a 30% plus quarter from last fiscal year. So certainly, those will be good quarters for us to sort of see a litmus test on your question. Until then, I'm not sure I have a direct answer for you, but certainly, the math will get tougher here in the next couple of quarters. On your second question, first of all, we don't comment on rumors and speculations or stories. What I will tell you is that we are constantly evaluating potential opportunities. Scott and I were talking. We think for every deal we do, we probably look at 10 to 15 companies. We base our decisions on, first and foremost, strategic fit; secondly, cultural fit and equally as important, the financial and the valuation fit. And we are always disciplined and we continue to focus on both inorganic and organic opportunities. But I will tell you that you should expect us to continue to be very, very disciplined as we go forward as well. And on the public sector question, I think it's a good catch on your part, because a lot of people look at the 20% and see it as being below the other customer markets in and would look at that negatively. But the reality is, it's been the most consistent for the last couple of years. And we saw broad-based strength. And whether it was in our government business, which has been, I think, we've had \u2013 so I'm looking at some data here, six consecutive quarters of positive growth and three out of the last four strong double-digit growth, if you look at education, we've had five straight quarters or six straight quarters there as well and it's been particularly strong in the last five quarters. And so it was very broad-based across the public sector. I'm pulling out some data here. So Tim, on the first one, on the software front, I think you have a really good question. I think Scott called out in his section that our product software revenue growth was 9%. The thing \u2013 you got to get behind that to understand what's going on. And our old perpetual software, which we've been in transition from two subscriptions, perpetual was down 12% and subscription was up 17%. So the transition is actually happening the way we expect it. That's the reason you're seeing some of that, because the subscription stuff, obviously, is recognized over time, and you're taking a 12% hit on a onetime piece of software from the way we used to sell it. So you've got that dynamic that just has to continue to play out. You have the renewals that you mentioned starting to come through on some of the D&A stuff in earnest in 2023 and then 2024, 2025 beginning to ramp. And then you've got over $2 billion of software sitting in backlog that is not an RPO yet because it's connected to a piece of hardware that hasn't shipped. And we recognize a bit of that upfront and then the rest over time. So we've got all of those variables in play right now. All that being said, I think you should expect \u2013 when we get to a normalized world, I would expect that once we get this supply chain in the backlog, clearly in a normal world, I would expect you would see software growth, revenue growth growing faster. But right now, with our backlog so big, that may not happen for several quarters. I'm trying to find the breakdown of the different franchises in, let's give where was that? Do you remember? Okay. On the cloud side, I think I'd just \u2013 no, I don't have it in front of me. On the cloud side, here's what I would tell you is that, we are winning \u2013 continuing to win new use cases around with our integrated systems, the Silicon One systems as well as we have one use cases where they're simply buying our hardware, meaning a switch that they're running their operating system on. We have certain customers that are running multiple consumption models where one may be buying silicon and they also buy the hardware switch, one may be buying an integrated system and silicon. And so it's a variation of all of those, and we are winning new competitive use cases, and I don't think that's not what I'll look for. Okay. So it's a \u2013 sorry, I was just \u2013 Marilyn was trying to find it, but I was going to tell you, a number of customers and what \u2013 which \u2013 how many franchises we want in. I don't have that in front of me right now, and we'll try to get that. But in general, we are definitely winning new use cases. I want to jump back in real quick and answer \u2013 give Tim the double click that I was looking for on the use cases. So we have five players who use \u2013 our customers who use Silicon One and Cisco 8000 systems. We have two that use Silicon One with the 8000 series routers with their own operating systems. We have two that use Silicon One embedded in their own white box hardware. And we have three that use at least two of the flexible consumption modes simultaneously. So that's the data that I was trying to get to you Tim. Yes. Thanks, Meta. So I think that clearly, we have customers who are definitely trying to buy ahead of price increases. And the conversations are, they've gone from, I'd say, being generally understanding to being a little more frustrated, primarily because of the length of time it's taken to get the product. And so they're running out of patience as we all are, but everybody generally understands. Because candidly, most of our customers are probably doing the same thing to their customers in whatever business they're in, in general, given the inflationary pressure that we see everywhere. So that's the first one. And the second one on the architectural transformations that we see out there, there's a massive one that is really being driven by hybrid work. So rearchitecting your entire network infrastructure to deal with distributed applications, distributed users, distributed data, a new security architecture to accommodate it. That's one. Obviously, within that is hybrid cloud, where you have applications running in multiple cloud providers as well as in private data centers. I mean, the demand we saw for our data center switching portfolio was extremely strong in addition to UCS, which tells me that customers are still investing in private data centers as well. So that creates traffic patterns that are not aligned with the architectures that our customers built over the last 15 years. So that's the first one. And then there are these transitions that I talked about earlier. You've got customers upgrading to 400 gig. We're almost at 700 customers now who have 400-gig ports. We've now taken orders for 737,000 ports. We had 200-plus thousand ports booked in the quarter, which is almost 1,500% growth. So we \u2013 400 gig is certainly taken off. The WiFi 6 transition has been pretty significant. And those are just some of the things we see. And then in the service provider space, you see 400 gig, you see 5G transition and you see them building out enterprise services based on 5G. So those are some of the major transitions that we see. Thank you. Yes, Tal, thanks for the question. I'll take security, and I'll let Scott talk about services because I know he did some work on that. On the security front, I would say that we have strength in several areas of that portfolio, particularly a lot of the SaaS elements that we have in the portfolio. We do have some supply chain issues that are continuing with the firewalls. But again, the SaaS and software components grew at a healthy rate. The teams are working on a next-generation strategy right now. And I feel confident that over the next 12 months to 18 months, you should continue to see improvement in that business, but we also need to get supply chain issues still with on the firewall front. Scott, do you want to talk about services? Yes. Amit, I could not understand the first part of your question. Would you like repeat that one? Got it. Okay. So what we believe we're seeing is this pure modernization that's occurring. We see densification of WiFi networks, in particular. So we're seeing more and more access points per workspace than what was pre-COVID to just ensure reliability, which then falls through to requiring a more robust switching infrastructure to support it. We believe customers are preparing for putting more and more video units into conference rooms, which will be hardwired, which drives more switch ports. We have more security cameras that are IP base that are going in. IoT is beginning to expand connecting building automation systems and all of those things just require an incredibly robust and resilient campus network. So we think that's what's going on. And on the second question, market share is a funny thing, and it's certainly \u2013 it's obviously based on revenue. And I can tell you that based on the growth rates from an orders perspective and how much of that is sitting in our backlog, I'm not concerned. We \u2013 I cannot imagine that the market is growing faster than the order growth that we've seen over the last three quarters. It's \u2013 just revenue. Thank you. Yes, Samik. So on the service provider space, I'd say just to give you a general sense, I gave you the web-scale numbers at over 70%. I'd say \u2013 and the overall service provider segment was 42%. And cable is roughly flattish, give or take a point or two. And the telco space was incredibly strong, incredibly strong for us. So both the web-scale and the telco space were the key contributors to that 42%. And then on the second question, \u2013 what was the second question? Enterprise growth. Thank you. Yes, when you look at it across \u2013 I mean, whether you look at it across the geographies or you look at across \u2013 generally across our product portfolio, or even across verticals, it was just super consistent. I mean it was \u2013 every customer seems to be moving right now. And so I don't think there's not one specific thing to call out. It was pretty broad-based. Yes, I do, Marilyn. Thank you. First of all, I'm proud of what we were able to accomplish in Q2 despite the ongoing component demands or component dynamics, the product order growth, the revenue, the EPS, the ARR growth, the RPO growth, the balanced growth across the world. Really pleased with our continued success in web-scale and just happy that our customers are choosing our technology as they continue down this digital transformation path. I think it speaks to the relevance and criticality of what we're building and what our teams have built \u2013 and I want to just take a minute to thank all the Cisco employees because it's been an incredibly difficult couple of years. I think the team has showed a great deal of resiliency, delivered breakthrough innovation and really doing everything we can to take care of our customers. So \u2013 thanks for spending time with us today, and we'll talk to you next time."

            "name": "Scott Herren",
            "content": "Thanks, Chuck. Q2 was a strong quarter across the business. We executed well, delivering our third consecutive quarter of more than 30% product order growth, driven by strength across our portfolio, including continued robust demand for our products and services, along with disciplined spend and supply chain management. Total revenue increased by $760 million to $12.7 billion, up 6% year-over-year, in line with our guidance range for the quarter. We saw strength in a number of product areas and across all of our geographies. Our business performed well in this highly dynamic and supply-constrained environment, which, as Chuck said, continues to hinder our ability to convert the significant demand we have into revenue. Overall profitability in Q2 was strong with non-GAAP operating margin of 34.3%, non-GAAP net income of $3.5 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.84 with non-GAAP earnings per share coming in above the high end of our guidance range. Looking at our Q2 revenue in more detail. Total product revenue was $9.4 billion, up 9%. Service revenue was $3.4 billion, down 1%, driven by delays in hardware support contracts related to the supply constraints. Within product revenue, Secure, Agile Networks performed well, with revenues up 7%. Switching had solid growth, driven by a double-digit increase in data center switching, driven by our Nexus 9000 products. Campus switching had solid growth, led by our Catalyst 9000 and Meraki switching offerings. Wireless had very strong double-digit increase driven by our WiFi 6 products and our Meraki wireless offerings. We also saw double-digit growth in compute revenue, driven by servers. Enterprise routing declined, primarily driven by access, slightly offset by strength in SD-WAN. Hybrid work, which is where we report just our collaboration portfolio, was down 9%, driven by declines in our collaboration devices and meetings offerings, partially offset by the continued ramp of our communication Platform-as-a-Service. Beginning next quarter, the name of this category will change from hybrid work to collaboration. There will not be any changes to the components within this category. End-to-end security grew 7%, with broad strength across most of the portfolio. Our Zero Trust portfolio performed well with double-digit growth driven by strong performance in our dual offerings. Our subscription portfolio continued to perform well, driven by cloud security and Zero Trust. Internet for the future was up 42%, driven in large part by the strength of our web scale customers. We saw broad strength in the portfolio with growth in edge, driven by double-digit growth from our ASR 9000 offerings and core with strength in Cisco 8000 and Optical. We also saw continued strong contribution from Acacia, our optical networking offerings. Optimized application experiences was up 12%, driven by double-digit growth in both ThousandEyes and Intersight. SaaS revenue for AppDynamics grew mid-single digits with the continued shift to its cloud-delivered platform. We continue to make progress on our transformation metrics as we shift our business to more software and subscriptions. Software revenue was $3.8 billion, an increase of 6% with the product portion up 9%. 80% of software revenue was subscription-based, which is up four percentage points year-over-year. Total subscription revenue was $5.5 billion, an increase of 7%. Total subscription revenue represented 44% of Cisco's total revenue. Annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, was $21.9 billion, an increase of 11%, with strong product ARR growth of 20%. And remaining performance obligations or RPO was $30.5 billion, up 8%. Product RPO increased 16%, service RPO increased 3%, and the total short-term RPO grew 8% to $16.3 billion. As a reminder, the short-term portion will convert to revenue over the next 12 months. Relative to acquisitions, there was an approximate 200 basis point year-over-year positive impact on Q2 revenue growth and no material impact on our non-GAAP EPS, which is in line with our expectations. We continue to have exceptionally strong order momentum in Q2. Total product orders grew 33%, with strength across the business. Looking at our geographic segments. The Americas was up 36% and EMEA and APJC were both up 30%. Total emerging markets were up 39%, with the BRICS plus Mexico up 48%. In our customer markets, service provider was up 42%, enterprise was up 37%, commercial was up 34% and public sector was up 20%. As you can see, it was broad strength across our geographies and customer markets. From a non-GAAP perspective, total gross margin came at 65.5%, down 140 basis points year-over-year. Product gross margin was 64.3%, down 230 basis points and service gross margin was 68.8%, up 90 basis points. The decrease in product gross margin was primarily driven by ongoing higher component costs related to supply constraints as well as higher freight and logistics costs. As we've been discussing for several quarters, we continue to manage through the supply constraints seen industry-wide by us and our peers due to component shortages, which have resulted in extended lead times and higher supply costs. The situation remains challenging. We continue to partner closely with our key suppliers, leveraging our volume purchasing and extended supply commitments as we address the supply challenges and cost impacts, which we expect will continue into the second half of our fiscal 2022. As I mentioned, the component supply constraints also slow the conversion of our strong demand into revenue. This has resulted in a substantial increase and continued build in our backlog levels well beyond our normal historical levels. Additionally, the ongoing supply constraints have not only impacted our ability to ship hardware but also impacts our delivery of software, such as subscriptions that customers order with the hardware. That undelivered software is also included in backlog until the hardware ships which is when we begin to recognize the revenue. Of course, this impacts our software revenue growth and other related metrics. To give you a sense of scale of our backlog, our Q2 ending product backlog was more than $14 billion, an increase of more than 150% year-on-year. Within that amount, software backlog almost doubled to more than $2 billion. Keeping in mind that backlog is not included as part of our $38.5 billion in remaining performance obligations. We ended Q2 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $21.1 billion. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $2.5 billion, down 17% year-over-year, primarily driven by advanced payments to secure future supply. These advanced payments had a negative 17% year-over-year impact on operating cash flow. Additionally, we made a tax payment of approximately $100 million this quarter, which have been deferred as a result of the CARES Act. This payment had an additional negative 4% year-over-year impact on our operating cash flow. In terms of capital allocation, we returned $6.4 billion to shareholders during the quarter was comprised of $4.8 billion of share repurchases and $1.5 billion for our quarterly cash dividend. Given the confidence we have in our business today and into the future, our Board has authorized an additional $15 billion for share repurchases, bringing the total to approximately $18 billion. We're also raising our dividend by $0.01 to $0.38 per quarter, which represents our 12th increase. Combination of our dividend increase, additional share repurchase authorization and higher share repurchases during the quarter demonstrates our commitment to returning excess capital to our shareholders and our confidence in the stability of our ongoing cash flows. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. We closed the acquisition of Replex in Q2 and Opsani in early Q3 to enhance our full stack observability offerings. These investments are consistent with our strategy of complementing our internal innovation in R&D with targeted M&A to allow us to further strengthen and differentiate our market position in our key growth areas. To summarize, we had another good quarter with robust product demand and solid execution in a complex supply-constrained environment. We continue to make progress on our business model shift and are making the investments in innovation to capitalize on our significant growth opportunities and expanding addressable markets. We're seeing progress as we drive the continued shift to more software and subscription revenue delivering growth and driving shareholder value. Now let me provide our financial guidance for Q3. As a reminder, the third quarter of last year included an extra week, which was a benefit to total revenue of approximately 3 points of growth. The total impact on our cost of sales and operating expenses was approximately $150 million, and this translated into a $0.04 benefit to earnings per share in our Q3 of last year. For next quarter, we expect revenue growth to be in the range of 3% to 5%. We anticipate non-GAAP gross margins to be in the range of 63.5% to 64.5%, reflecting the continuing increase in supply chain costs we're incurring as we protect shipments to our customers. Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 32.5% to 33.5%, non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.85 to $0.87. For the full year of fiscal 2022, we are tightening the range as follows: we expect revenue growth to be in the range of 5.5% to 6.5% year-on-year, non-GAAP earnings per share is increasing to $3.41 to $3.46, up 5.9% to 7.5% year-on-year. In both our Q3 and full year guidance, we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A. Yes. No, I think that's right. That's in sync with our expectations. And Ittai to your question on how does this unwind, it's \u2013 I don't believe it unwinds in a lumpy fashion. I think it'll unwind as supply and demand get more in balance. And I think that will just happen gradually over the course of the next few quarters. So I'm not expecting a significant bump in any given quarter. I think the supply frees up with $14 billion of backlog, we've got plenty of demand to go off and fulfill. It's really a question of when does that supply free up. And as it does free up, I think it will happen gradually over time. I'll take the first one. On the gross margin, Rod, it really came down to product mix that we had the components for that we could build and ship out during Q2. As I said earlier, our expectations on gross margin for the year are unchanged. And we had favorable product mix in Q2 that drove us above as I'm sure you're aware, above the high end of our guidance range. I think it's a bit of a headwind for us as we look at gross margins in Q3, but it equals out for the year. And so our expectations for the full-year on gross margin are unchanged. It's always a mix. When you go across product lines and across customer size, both of those things have an effect. Rather than kind of go through and parse product by product, it's \u2013 we had a quarter where the supply we had just allowed us to ship higher-margin product. And again, given the visibility we have with $314 billion of backlog, we have pretty good visibility into what we need to build and a pretty good feel for what that's going to look like in the quarters ahead. So I feel confident that we're going to stay in this range through the end of the year. Yes. That $2 billion of software, it's a little bit more than $2 billion sitting in our backlog right now. That's almost double where it was just a year ago, right? So there's always some that will sit in backlog, but it's almost double. And of course, most of that software is recognized ratably. So the ramp, once we can get it cleared out of the backlog and shipped, we're still going to have a ratable ramp on that. So longer term, if you remember what we said in September, we said the recurring revenue parts of our product business, we expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 15% to 17%. That's what we just put up, all right? The product subscription piece in our software business grew 17% in the quarter. So I think we're right on track in that space. There's a lot in there, David. What I'd start by saying is the buyback that you saw, the additional buyback that you saw in Q2 and the add to our outstanding authorization to take it up to just short of $18 billion and the $0.01 increase in dividend, those are all signs of the confidence we have in our business and the growth we see ahead. So 2018, we have returned, as you alluded to, we've returned $76 billion in capital to shareholders just as 2018. There's no change in our overall cap allocation policy to answer that question for you. It starts with, first and foremost, supporting the growth of the business. through both organic and inorganic means. Obviously, we'll support the dividend. We'll, at a minimum, offset the dilution of our equity plans and beyond that, return the excess to shareholders as you saw us just do. There's no change in our overall policy. In terms of working capital, we've got \u2013 I would wager to say the strongest balance sheet in the industry. Certainly amongst our peers, we've got the strongest balance sheet out there. I don't feel like we're constrained at all by the amount of cash we have to keep on the balance sheet to support operations. Yes, I don't actually think of it in those terms as it relates to M&A. It's more back to what Chuck said earlier, is it a strategic fit? Is a cultural fit? Does the valuation makes sense? Those are the kind of considerations that come into play as we're thinking about M&A versus what's the strength of the balance sheet. Again, I would stack our balance sheet up against anyone. Yes. I think you're thinking about it the right way, Jim. It's not a \u2013 most \u2013 a lot of what we have in the backlog of our products that were ordered pre the price increase, certainly the latest round of price increases. Logistics costs are still with us. But as I said earlier, I think that if you remember, we've had a couple of rounds of price increases, and I think we begin to see the benefit of that first one toward the end of Q3 and expect to see it again in Q4. With the level of visibility we have, both $16 billion of short-term RPO, $30 billion of total RPO and add to that $14 billion of backlog, we have better visibility than we've ever had as I look ahead. So feel good that the gross margins will stay in that 64% to 65% range through the second half. And that is of the fiscal year is what I'm talking about, the second half of our fiscal year. Yes, Tal, on the services piece, what you have to bear in mind is two things. Most of that's ratable. And most of that is the support services we sell attached to hardware. And so there's always a lag, right? When you build up a big ratable revenue base, it takes time to build it up. So it takes it a while to ramp up to speed, but it also takes time for it to come back down. And if you look at our product revenue rates go back 12, 18 months during the midst of the pandemic, of course, our product growth rates were quite low. And the echo effect of that is, we sold fewer services contracts, and we're selling less revenue. It takes time for that to show up in the revenue stream because so much of that is ratable and it builds up in deferred revenue and bleeds out over time. So what we're dealing with now is just the tail of the services that would have been attached to the hardware at a time when hardware sales, if you go back 12 to 18 months ago, we're fairly low. The flip side is, look at the growth of our RPO at $30.5 billion, growing 8%. Obviously, the ratable services fit inside there and the short term at $16.3 billion, growing 8% gives you a sense of what the path ahead looks that's both services and software, but it gives you a sense of what the path ahead looks like. Yes. Amit, I mean, you saw we went pretty aggressive into the buyback during Q2 at $4.8 billion in the quarter. That's obviously well beyond what's required just to offset dilution. And I think, historically, if you look back, you'll see we've been pretty aggressive on share buybacks over the last several years with the dividend and share buybacks returning $76 billion since 2018. So I don't think there's a change in stance or a change in demeanor as we look at that. We're constantly evaluating where we are from a cash standpoint, what our needs are. I told you the priority of our capital allocation policy has not changed. Both the growth of the business organically and organically first. The dividend, anti-dilution and beyond that, we'll return cash to shareholders. So I think that's the way you need to think about it going forward. There's no real change in policy, but you saw us get pretty aggressive in the first half of Q2."

If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now, I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.\nMarilyn Mora : Welcome everyone to Cisco's First Quarter Fiscal 2022 Quarterly Earnings conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO, and Scott Herren, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website.  As a reminder, effective in Q1, we began reporting our revenue in the following categories: secure agile networks, hybrid work, end-to-end security, Internet for the future, optimized application experiences, other products, and services. As discussed during our Investor Day, and in our October 20th press release, this change better aligns our product categories with our strategic priorities. This change only impacts how we report revenue by product category as our reportable segments will continue to be based on geographies, which consists of the Americas, EMEA, and APJC. We included quarterly reclassified revenue amounts for the last 3 fiscal years on our website. Click on the Financial Information section of the website to access these documents.  Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be done on a year-over-year basis. Matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the second quarter and full year of Fiscal 2022. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties, including COVID-19, that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC.  Specifically, the most recent report on Form 10-K, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. I will now turn it over to Chuck.\nChuck Robbins : Thanks, Marilyn. And good afternoon, everyone. We look forward to spending time with you today. First, I would like to thank those of you who joined us for our Investor Day in September, where we showcased the strong foundation, we've built for helping to generate long-term, profitable growth. We're striving to maximize value creation through our focus on higher concentrations of software and subscription-based revenue streams. This gives us, and you, greater visibility and predictability into our future growth. We also highlighted our unique portfolio of market-leading franchises, which are well-positioned to drive growth in highly attractive existing and expansion markets. Lastly, we showcased the depth of our leadership team and outline the next phase of our strategy.  Moving into fiscal year '22, we were also a great start with robust order growth of 33% and continued strong demand across our portfolio. Our teams are executing well, our ARR grew double-digits, and our momentum is accelerating, driven by digital transformation and cloud. Even with the ongoing supply constrained environment, we are solidly on track to deliver against our long-term financial targets by investing for growth while delivering breakthrough innovation. The past 18 to 24 months have no doubt accelerated the digital revolution we are all experiencing as technology is permanently changing nearly every aspect of our lives.  The technology we build is powering the modern secure infrastructure that sits at the heart of this revolution, and Cisco is well-positioned to capture the opportunities ahead. Our customers ONE Digital and cloud enabled solutions that allow them to move with greater speed, agility, and efficiency. We're already seeing the positive impact of our investments to drive accelerated innovation across high-growth areas, including hybrid cloud, web scale, cloud security, 5G, Wi - Fi 6, 400-gig, and full-stack observability. A key trend in front of us is enabling employees to work from anywhere. And this is much broader than meetings.  It's about the holistic capabilities to support a highly distributed workforce that require new infrastructure architectures, observability, and security. Many companies are in the process of defining their hybrid work strategy, which will be based on the technology we build across our networking, security, and collaboration portfolios. We're also leading the way with new innovation, including our recently expanded WebEx portfolio, purpose-built for inclusive experiences across hybrid work, workspaces, and events. Now I'd like to discuss our Q1 performance. Building on the momentum from last quarter, I'm proud to say we achieved another strong quarter in line with our expectations despite supply constraints, which I will discuss shortly. We delivered balanced revenue and non-GAAP EPS growth with healthy margins driven by a continued economic recovery, strong execution, and exceptional demand for our products.  We also generated a strong quarter of double-digit growth in ARR and RPO, reflecting the ongoing success of our transformation. We have continued to operate successfully in a very dynamic environment, staying nimble in order to navigate the evolving conditions related to the Delta variant, and global component shortages. Now let me discuss the performance of our customer market segments. Q1 marks the third consecutive quarter of accelerating order momentum with broad-based strength across our business. Every geographic region, and 3 of the 4 customer markets, grew product orders at 30% or higher.  We again experienced the strongest demand in over a decade as our customers increased their investments in digital transformation. In our enterprise and commercial businesses, we achieved our fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating order growth. We also saw a solid growth in public sector. Our service provider segment delivered its highest level of order growth in over 5 years with 66% growth as these customers address their growing bandwidth requirements. In our web scale business, our robust momentum continues. Our performance was once again a record with order growth of over 200%.  That's 120% growth on a trailing four quarter basis. We are very pleased with the early traction of our 400-gig Solutions, Cisco 8000 platform, Silicon One portfolio, and rapid growth in our Acacia portfolio of optical networking products. It's clear we are expanding our footprint as our cloud growth rate is outpacing our peers. We continue to invest in web skill innovations with differentiated customer value. Launching this quarter, the latest member of the Silicon One family, the 19.2 terabit P100 routing device. The 11th chip in the Silicon One family. In addition, Acacia marked a major milestone by unveiling the industry's first pluggable module, capable of delivering 1.2 terabit capacity on a single wavelength.  Our product revenue was up nearly $1 billion year-over-year, demonstrating the competitive advantages of our scale and reach, as well as our ongoing momentum. We saw a broad-based demand across the majority of our product portfolio. In addition, we continue to see steady progress in our business model transition. Our focus on subscriptions allows us to deliver innovation faster to our customers, while providing more predictability and visibility, leading to a more durable growth business over the long term. We delivered software revenue of $3.7 billion, with 80% sold as a subscription. Subscription revenue increased by 4% to nearly $5.5 billion, while ARR increased by 10% year-over-year to $21.6 billion. We saw strong product ARR growth of 21% and product RPO grew 18%, reflecting our rapid transformation to a software-led business model.  While our revenue growth was solid, it was impacted by the supply constraints which are affecting our technology peers, and nearly every other industry. Our product orders were extremely strong and balanced across our markets. But we are constrained in what we can build and ship to our customers. We have a world-class supply-chain team that works to deliver an incredibly high volume of products given our scale and reach. They continue to execute well in this highly fluid and complex environment. We have been taking multiple steps to mitigate the supply shortages and deliver products to our customers, including working closely with our key suppliers and contract manufacturers, paying significantly higher logistics costs to get the components where they are most needed, working on modifying our designs to utilize alternative suppliers where possible, and constantly optimizing our build and delivery plans.  We are doing this at a breadth and scale that is significantly greater than most in our industry. Of course, all of these steps, while necessary to maximize our production and delivery to customers, add to our cost structure. When combined with cost increases, we are seeing from many of our suppliers, these factors are putting pressure on our gross margins. While we've thoughtfully raised prices to offset this impact, the benefits are not immediate and will be recognized over the coming quarters. Our focus remains on our customers to ensure we provide them with the products they need as quickly as possible. Now, I would like to share the progress we're making on our ESG initiatives.  In September, we committed to being net 0 greenhouse gas emissions for Scope 1 and 2 by 2025 and net 0 for all emissions including Scope 3 by 2040. We believe we will do this by focusing on 4 areas: Building more efficient products, accelerating the use of renewable energy, embracing hybrid work, and investing in innovative carbon removal solutions. We believe we have a deep responsibility to use our industry leadership position and our innovation, to make the world a better place and look forward to continuing to do our part. In summary, I am very pleased with the start to our fiscal year. Our teams are executing on our strategy, while navigating a challenging operating environment and this is reflected in our Q1 results. Demand remains strong and with the momentum in our business transformation, we have set the stage for another year of accelerated growth in fiscal 2022.  Our performance is a testament to the power of our differentiated innovation, the strength of our end markets, and our team's commitment to excellence. As our customers accelerate their digital transformation and their adoption of hybrid cloud and hybrid work strategies, we believe we are uniquely positioned to capture the opportunities ahead. We will continue to strategically invest across our portfolio to drive growth and innovation, strengthen our competitive advantage, and position Cisco for success. And I continue to have great confidence in our future. I will now turn it over to Scott.\nScott Herren : Thanks, Chuck. We started the fiscal year with a strong Q1 performance. We executed well resulting in another quarter of more than 30% product order growth, driven by strength across our portfolio and demonstrating continued robust demand for our products and services. We also had strong results across revenue, net income, and earnings per-share. Total revenue increased to $12.9 billion, up 8% year-over-year coming in line with our guidance range for the quarter. We saw strength in a number of product areas and across all geographies. Our business continues to execute well in this highly dynamic environment, but ongoing component supply constraints are impacting our ability to convert historically high demand into revenue as quickly as we'd like. Non-GAAP operating margin was 33.3%, up 60 basis points.  Non-GAAP net income was $3.5 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.82, both up 8% year-over-year, with non-GAAP EPS coming in above the high-end of our guidance range. Looking at our Q1 revenue in more detail. Total product revenue was $9.5 billion, up 11%. Service revenue was $3.4 billion, up 1%. Secure agile networks performed very well with revenues up 10%. Switching had strong growth driven by a double-digit increase in campus switching, led by our Catalyst 9000 and Meraki switching offerings. The enterprise routing portfolio had high single-digit growth driven by Edge and SD-WAN. Wireless had very strong double-digit increase driven by our Wi-Fi 6 products and Meraki wireless offerings. We had growth in data center switching and compute revenue declined slightly.  Hybrid work was down 7% overall, driven by revenue decreases in our perpetual calling, meetings, and Contact Center offerings. These were partially offset by the ramp of communication platform-as-a-service and growth in our collaboration devices. Within hybrid work, our SasS revenue continues to show growth of high single-digits driven by Cloud Calling and Contact Center. End-to-End Security was up 4%, driven by growth in our cloud-based solutions, also offset by declines in our perpetual and hardware offerings. Our Zero Trust portfolio performed well with double-digit growth, as we had continued momentum in our Duo offerings. We also saw good growth in Unified Threat Management. Here again, our subscription portfolio performed well growing 15%, driven by our Cloud Security and Zero Trust platforms. Internet for the Future was up 46%, driven in large part by the strength of our webscale customers.  We saw broad strength in the portfolio with growth in Cloud, growth in Core, with strength in both Cisco 8000 and NCS 5500, and growth in Edge with the ASR 9000. We also saw benefits from our acquisition of Acacia. Optimized application experiences were up 18%, driven by both ThousandEyes which grew triple-digits, and Intersight which grew in the strong double-digits. SaaS revenue for AppDynamics grew double-digits as its revenue shifted to a greater proportion from its cloud-delivered platform. Our transformation metrics we covered at Investor Day were solid, as we continue to shift our business to more software and subscriptions. Software revenue was $3.7 billion, an increase of 1%, with the product portion, up 3%. 80% of software revenue was subscription-based, which is up 2 percentage points year-over-year.  Total subscription revenue was $5.5 billion, an increase of 4%, with the product portion increasing at 7%. Total subscription revenue represented 43% of Cisco's total revenue. ARR, or annualized recurring revenue, was $21.6 billion, an increase of 10% with strong product ARR growth of 21%. And remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was $30.1 billion, up 10%. Product RPO increased 18% and short-term RPO grew 9% to $15.9 billion. As you can see, we continue to make significant progress on the transformation to increased software and subscriptions. We continue to have exceptionally strong order momentum in Q1 with total product orders up 33%, as Chuck mentioned earlier, with strength across the business. Looking at our geographic segments. The Americas was up 31%, EMEA was up 36%, and APJC was up 39%. Total emerging markets were up 37%, with the BRICS plus Mexico, up 47%.  In our customer markets, service provider was up 66%, commercial was up 46%, Enterprise was up 30%, and public sector was up 10%. As you can see, it was broad strength across the business. From a non-GAAP perspective, total gross margins came in at 64.5%, down 130 basis points year-over-year. Product gross margin was 63.8%, down 150 basis points. And service gross margin was 66.5%, down 60 basis points. The decrease in product gross margin was primarily driven by higher costs from freight, expedite, and increased component costs related to the supply constraints. Pricing impact was relatively moderate and consistent with prior quarters, partially offset by positive product mix.  We continue to manage through the supply constraints seen industry-wide by us and our peers due to component shortages, which have resulted in extended lead times and higher costs for many of these components. We're partnering closely with our key suppliers, leveraging our volume purchasing and extended supply commitments as we address the supply challenges and cost impacts which we expect will continue into the second half of fiscal 2022. Our supply chain team continues to perform well at this very complex situation. We believe we're taking the right strategic actions with our suppliers and contract manufacturers to ensure we meet customer demand despite the potential risks associated with increasing our inventory and purchase commitments.  When we look at the impact of acquisitions on our Q1 results, there was an approximate 250 basis point positive impact on revenue and no material impact on our non-GAAP EPS, which is in line with our expectations. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $3.4 billion, down 16% year-over-year, driven by higher supplier-related payments and timing of other payments and collections. We ended Q1 with total cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $23.3 billion, down approximately $1.2 billion sequentially, primarily driven by $2 billion in scheduled repayments of our long-term debt. In terms of capital allocation, we returned $1.8 billion to shareholders during the quarter, it was comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and $256 million of share repurchases. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline.  During Q1, we closed the acquisition of EPSAGON and announced our intent to acquire Reflex. These investments are consistent with our strategy of complementing our internal innovation and R&D with targeted M&A to allow us to further strengthen and differentiate our market position in our key growth areas. To summarize, we had a strong Q1 in a complex, supply constrained environment. We executed well with strong top-line revenue and earnings per share as we delivered balanced, profitable growth. We continue to make great progress on our business model shift and are continuing to make the investments in innovation to capitalize on our significant growth opportunities.  We're seeing progress as we drive the continued shift to more software and subscription revenue, delivering growth and driving shareholder value. Now let me provide our financial guidance for Q2 which is as follows. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 4.5% to 6.5% year-on-year. We anticipate non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 63.5% to 64.5%, reflecting the continuing increase in supply chain costs we're incurring, as we protect shipments to our customers. Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range from 32.5% to 33.5%. And non-GAAP earnings per-share is expected to range from $0.80 to $0.82. There is no change to our full-year fiscal '22 guidance. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 5% to 7% year-on-year, non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $3.38, $3.45, also up five to 7% year-over-year. In both our Q2 and full-year guidance, we are assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A.\nMarilyn Mora : Thanks, Scott. Michelle, let's go ahead and queue up the Q&A.\nA - Michelle: Thank you. Sami Badri from Credit Suisse. You may go ahead.\nSami Badri: Hi, thank you very much for the question. First question I had was regarding your price increases that you talked about incorporating into your price sheets. Would you say that 100% of the product orders recognized in the quarter reflected the higher price increases that you guys incorporated or were there prior contracts in place that honored prior price sheets for some of your key customers? Could you give us maybe an idea on mix and maybe a straightforward answer on that side? And then just a second question is it looks like public sector up 10% year-on-year. I think some of your peers have reported some very strong end-market public sector trends, some of them coming from the U.S. federal government. Could you just give us an update on what's going on there? Were there things that did not get past the finish line or any holdups, or any kind of key things you're seeing that's met with some resistance on deploying more public sector or federal government activity?\nScott Herren : Sure. I'll start, Sammy, on the price increase question and then -- and I'll let Chuck on public sector. The price increase that we put in place really just became effective on the 1st of September. Most of what we shipped during the quarter, either came out of RPO, so prior sales that are sitting on the balance sheet and then accrued into our revenue. And we've talked about having $15.9 billion now of current RPO. So, none of that, of course, would have had the price increase built into it. And a lot of the hardware shipments came out of backlog during the quarter. And again, none of those would have include that price increase. I think even looking ahead, Sami, you got to think about that price increase having a bigger effect towards the second half of the year than it will have certainly during Q2. Think of that as more of a late Q3, Q4 by the time those price increases turn into orders, those orders work their way through the backlog, get built, and then delivered to customers.\nChuck Robbins : And then Sami, thanks for the question. On the public sector situation, we saw -- if you look at our public sector performance on a global basis over the last couple years, it's been very consistent. And I think we've doubled that business since 2017 or something so it's been -- that's the federal business perhaps; our U.S. public sector, but the -- what we saw was we saw a lot of strength in E-Rate. We saw strength in state, local, and education. We saw strength on a\nScott Herren : civilian side, and we had a few deals on the DoD side that pushed into Q2 from an order perspective, but it's still very strong and the teams are doing a really good job there. That's just a great business for us.\nSami Badri: Thank you very much.\nMichelle: Thanks, Sami. Next question, please.\nOperator: Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. You may go ahead.\nIttai Kidron: Thanks. Hey, guys. Chuck, I want to focus on the security business in fiscal '19, you grew 18%, that was down to 12% in '20, that was down to 7% to '21 and you are starting to year at 4% here and now. All at the same time, your large competitors like Palo Alto and the Fortinet, and even Check Point for that matter are seeing accelerating growth improving growth rates and growth rates in the tens, twenties and even thirties on a year-over-year basis. So maybe you can unpack this for me a little bit. I know you've been pleased with your security business, but it seems like it's kind of heading in the wrong direction growth-wise relative to what the peers are doing. Maybe you can go into a little bit depth into the transitions that are going within that portfolio. When do we see it turn around and perhaps Scott can comment on how much of that portfolio is perpetual in nature versus subscription in nature? Thank you.\nChuck Robbins : Ittai, it's a great question. So first of all, I will say that we have room to get better in security and teams are working hard on that. There's a lot of innovative work going on. And then you called out the primary issue that Scott referenced in his opening comments is the on - prem sort of perpetual stuff in decline and then the subscription-based businesses grew double-digits. Zero Trust, Unified Threat Management was good growth. And overall, the subscription portfolio grew 15%. So, it's really balancing that and there's a little impact in there, Ittai, from supply chain on our hardware-based network firewall business. So, I think it's a combination of, we've got some work do with which the teams are working on. And then the transition and a little bit of supply chain. But we would expect over the next 2 to 3 years for that business to continue to get better, and the teams are committed to make that happen.\nScott Herren : And Ittai, to the second part of your question, we haven't actually broken that out for you, but I think the as we talked at our Investor Day back in September, the growth areas of all of our markets security and hybrid work included are more in the subscription side. That's where we focused our attention. That's where we're focused a lot of our innovation. And as Chuck said, the subscription piece of security grew at 15% during the quarter. So, I think as the -- as that becomes a more and more prominent part of our overall security product portfolio, that's where you'll begin to see more acceleration in the growth rates.\nIttai Kidron: Maybe Scott can answer differently, is there a way to qualify to us where we are in this transition from perpetual to subscription, is that -- will that be a drag for a long time, or you think we're at the tail end of this transition?\nScott Herren : Yeah. Again, I'd rather not get into trying to give you guidance at that level, all the way out through time, Ittai (ph). I do think the areas that we focused on, and the areas that we're investing in, are the high-growth areas. And that's why you're seeing that double-digit growth. That mix will continue to change. It was obviously positive during Q1, it was positive in the prior quarter in Q4; it'll continue to change. And again, as that piece becomes a bigger part of the overall portfolio, that's where you'll see it flip to a faster growth.\nIttai Kidron: Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora : All right. Thanks for your time. Next question, please.\nOperator: Tim Long from Barclays, you may go ahead.\nTim Long: Thank you. Maybe just to, if I could kind of related, on the software side a little bit decal on the growth rate. Maybe if you can talk a little bit about more broadly, the software solutions and how we can start to see growth accelerate there, I guess as we get through this transition a little further. And secondly, more granular, Chuck, maybe you can talk a little bit about renewals for Cat 9K. I think we're starting to come up against a period where we are going to see more of those. Any early indications there, and what do you think retention rates will look like, and do you think there's any software up sell opportunities as the bulk of the early customer base starts renewing? Thank you.\nChuck Robbins : You want to take the first and I will take the second.\nScott Herren : Yeah, sounds good. On the software revenue growth, as you said, it did slow a bit during the quarter and that's really again, the same effect that we talked about in the opening commentary. We had that transformation from selling more perpetual license to selling more as a subscription, and that's an area that we've put a lot of time and effort focusing on. So, it's that mix underneath the covers that's driving it where you'll see the revenue that's not yet recognized but the success of that transformation, is in two of the stats that we also gave you in the opening commentary. Product RPO, products remaining performance obligations, up 18%, and product ARR growing 21%. So, a lot of the software sales that we had in the quarter, are actually sitting there in RPO at this point and they'll get recognized over the future. So that's just creating an overall headwind to the reported revenue growth rate.\nChuck Robbins : Just to add to that [Indiscernible], our perpetual software, as you would expect, is negative year-over-year. So that -- and then the ratable that gets recognized over 3, 4, 5 years is where we're shifting it too. On the renewals on the Cat 9K, what I would say is that it's still too early to tell, but I'll tell you that it's in line with our expectations and the last two quarters -- they're small numbers just to be clear. We're very early in this and the teams have been\nScott Herren : Improving it. I will tell you that we've added some innovative value around this with like, the ThousandEyes capability that's been put into it now. So, the teams are working on it. We have a reasonable degree of confidence. If you look at net retention rates are clearly off-the-charts positive. But I think it's going to be into the second half and into fiscal '23 when we really see enough volume to have conviction that we've got the numbers where we need them to be.\nTim Long: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question, please.\nMichelle: Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley, you may go ahead.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. Chuck, I wanted to ask a question just on your conversations with customers, and just as you guys on, and much of the industry tries to pass on price changes, just how that's impacting demand. Maybe particularly with service providers, who just have a little less budget flexibility. And then, maybe the second question, just currently, you guys are making a lot of efforts to reconfigure products or find alternative suppliers. Just how should we think of the timeline of some of those actions summing up and about to clear some of the backlog. Thanks.\nChuck Robbins : Let me -- on your first question. I think it varies by customer. Most customers are very understanding. They are super frustrated with the lead times. We have -- where we have situations that we need to deal with specific customer issues around budgets, etc., our teams handle that specifically with the customers, but in general, I think that they understand and many of our customers are doing the same thing to their customers. So, this is a whole inflationary trend that we see across the entire economy. I would say that -- quick comment on -- before I hand it to Scott -- on the second part, we did talk about -- the first half of last quarter, we did see some deterioration in our supply chain component availability. And then we saw it stabilize in the second half. So that was good. And we're planning on seeing some slight improvement in Q3 and Q4. We don't expect a lot of it -- we expected to remain stabilized in Q2, and then we think we'll see some slight improvement in the second half of our fiscal year. That's our current belief based on what we know today. Scott, you want to talk a little bit about the second part?\nScott Herren : Sure. And --\nChuck Robbins : When we begin --\nScott Herren : Yes, I think that's the $64,000 question. The complexity of answering that is, of course, it's not just one commodity that's constrained and you have to square the [Indiscernible] across all economies that are all constrained. And then you have to overlay on that the snarled logistics position that we find ourselves in. Really across all lanes, whether its ocean or air, or trucking. The layering on of both of those is what makes answering that question so complex. As Chuck said, we did see stabilization and some of the signs of stabilization that we saw during the quarter. We saw better visibility to components from some of our suppliers in terms of when they could deliver and the quantities. We saw fewer de -commits come in during the quarter, another sign of stabilization. And then memory costs are actually beginning, just beginning, but beginning to decline a bit, meaning that market's coming more into balance as well. So, we're seeing signs of stabilization, as we look ahead and look at Q2 guidance and what that means for the full year. Obviously, we're in a very strong position on RPO. That's going to accrete into the revenue stream in the second half of the year and we've got a backlog that provide s us great visibility into exactly what we need to build, so we can be a lot more targeted in what we need to go chase down to get that so feel confident in the position that we're in, both on the Q2 guide and the full-year guide, given what we see today.\nChuck Robbins : The bad news is we've had obviously challenges getting things shipped to our customers. The good news is, is that our backlog is at an all-time high for our Company. It's never been higher.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora : Next question, please.\nOperator: Simon Leopold from Raymond James. You may go ahead.\nSimon Leopold: Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to see if you could maybe quantify or even guess that, how much of the 33% order growth might reflect pull-in, basically customers placing orders ahead of your price increases. If there's any way you could adjust to that or normalize, and what do you expect in terms of the outlook for order trends? Do you forecast this, and I assume at some point, revenue growth and order growth should begin to converge somewhat?\nScott Herren : I wish I could do what you ask because I would like to know that myself. I will tell you this. We clearly know -- call it pull-ahead, call it ordering against the reality of our lead times, but we clearly know that customers are ordering further out than they would normally. The large carriers, the cloud providers, where we had 200% growth. These are customers were doing deep forecasting and planning with. So, we know that they're ordering 2, 3, 4 quarters out to make sure that they have the stuff in the pipeline and the right sequence for delivery. So, we get that visibility, but then you look at a segment like commercial that grew 46%, and you tend not to see a lot.  You will see a little bit, some of the commercial customers are looking out. But many of them are ordering when they feel the need, and so it's a really hard question to answer. On your second one, I think that the only way I can answer that is to say, it actually is part of the first answer too, what we're watching real closely is we're watching cancellations, which we have not seen any change in our historic cancellation rates. In fact, it's lower. We watch pipeline growth, and I can tell you that our pipeline growth is probably as strong as it's ever been even beyond the quarter we just finished. So, we see continued demand and I think that from that perspective, the way we think about it is our very large customers, largest enterprises, cloud players, large carriers, those we know we have visibility, there's an aspect of ordering ahead from other customers, but I think the vast majority below that probably aren't.\nSimon Leopold: Is it fair to imagine that you were also surprised by the improvement in order growth versus the prior quarter? Was this a surprise to you as well?\nChuck Robbins : Well, yes. And if you look at the compare from a year ago, the compare was actually tougher, so the momentum actually increased, if you look at it that way. But our teams have -- we talked about 6 years ago that we were going to do the work to try to get back into these franchises in the cloud players, and that's been a big -- that's a big, big success for us right now and that's certainly helpful. And then we've got all these other trends happening right now. You got 5G build-out, you've got Wi-Fi 6, you got every enterprise customer realizing that they're not going to get caught with the next crisis not having their technology modernized Our switching growth is at a rate that -- 2 years ago if I'd have told you we're going to be doing that or if you'd told me we were going to be doing that, we'd have both been crazy.  So, it's -- so I think your point of at some point in the future, you would expect order rate and revenue, would they have to get in line? I think over a time period, yes; not necessarily in one quarter versus the other because of the transition in the business model. Because if you look at the RPO that we're pulling off the Balance Sheet every quarter, I go back and look at what that would've been 6 years ago. It wouldn't have been anywhere remotely close to what we are, so we would've been in a much more dire situation relative to supply chain and revenue right now if we hadn't been making the transition that we've been making.\nScott Herren : Yeah. That $15.9 billion of just current RPO, meaning it's going to create into the revenue stream in the next 12 months gives us obviously, a fair amount of visibility there, Simon. The other thing I'd say to your point that I think is relevant on the strength of the order flow during the quarter is linearity was also good. It wasn't likely the quarter started off strong and got weaker as it went on. The linearity was good throughout the quarter, so we do enter the current quarter with some pretty good momentum on that front. It actually was the opposite, it strengthened.\nChuck Robbins : Yes.\nSimon Leopold: Thank you very much for those insights. Appreciate it.\nChuck Robbins : Thanks, Simon.\nMichelle: Thanks Simon, next question.\nOperator: Paul Silverstein with Cowen, you may go ahead.\nPaul Silverstein: Thanks. Various on the previous question, and second, Scott, if you already answered this, I do apologize, I don't think I heard the response. But in quantifying how much revenue would have been, and what margins would have been bought for the supply chain constraints, did you give that number? If not, can you give us that number -- those numbers?\nChuck Robbins : Well, we can't give you the number because it's impossible to calculate. But if you look at last quarter's product growth at 31, this quarter's product growth at 33, the RPO, they'll be pulled off the balance sheet [Indiscernible] meaningfully higher. There is -- it's the largest backlog we've had in the history of the Company. So, it's hard to say. But Scott, anything to add?\nScott Herren : Just, Paul, the constraint obviously is component supply right now with back-to-back quarters of 31% product order growth in the Q4 that we closed and then 33% in the quarter that we just closed, Q1. Clearly the -- what the headwind that we're seeing to faster revenue growth is just component supply. That backlog will turn into revenue. It will just turn into revenue over time. So, quantifying that is -- it's going to show up in the revenue stream.\nChuck Robbins : What I would say is that while short term this doesn't feel great, I think what we're seeing is the customers have decisions they're making right now, and they're choosing our technology across the board. They're choosing the innovation that our teams have built. And I think that's going to bode well, and that's a great indicator for us in the future. And I think the fact of the matter is, is with that RPO and the backlog that we have, that stuff's going to ship. So, there's going to be some short-term issues, but it's going to catch up.\nPaul Silverstein: And Chuck, the thought arises that you've got two different issues that are jamming revenue and margins are in our at least revenue, which is both a shift to software and RPO as well as the supply constraint -- supply chain constraints, which is making it difficult to decipher what should demand in terms of quantifying it. But I guess it's not really very insightful statement. Can I ask, you mentioned very strong backlog, and you tell us what the backlog growth was as well as what book-to-bill fall.\nChuck Robbins : I'm not sure book-to-bill matters anymore. That mattered years ago when we were a hardware Company, and everything was sort of net 30. We haven't looked at that in ages. I'm sure it's on a spreadsheet somewhere from years ago, but I would say the backlog is -- Scott, how would you want to characterize it? I'll leave that with you.\nScott Herren : Without saying the absolute number, Paul, I think look at the revenue growth rate -- the difference between the revenue growth rate in -- just in the last two quarters, in Q4 and in Q1 and you can get a sense of what's built up in that backlog.\nChuck Robbins : It is -- we have great visibility to what we need to build and ship out, and that's why you see us taking the steps we're taking in terms of adding inventory, making some of the longer-term purchase commitments that you see show up in our filings. It's really trying and doing everything we can to try to support our customers and get that product out the door as quickly as possible. But you can get a sense of the building backlog just by looking at the delta between what's been showing up in bookings and what we're able to push out the door in revenue.\nPaul Silverstein: Chuck, are there any product markets where you're concerned about share loss not keeping up with market growth?\nChuck Robbins : Yes. We worry about it every day, and so do our competitors. And so, it's everybody is trying to fulfill what customers need and I guess the silver lining is this is not necessarily unique to us, but it's certainly frustrating.\nMarilyn Mora : All right. Thanks, Paul.\nPaul Silverstein: Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora : Next question.\nOperator: Amit Daryanani from Evercore. You may go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks a lot, and thanks for taking my questions out. I think suppose one new your revenue guide for John Paul is obviously below the street was modeling. I'd love to get a sense on the guide that you gave, how does that stack up to what you thought John product could look like maybe 90 days ago. And to the extent you could talk about the decent ratio we're seeing from October to Jan on a year-over-year basis. Would that have occurred if you had no supply-chain issues?\nScott Herren : There's no question that that Q2 guide is impacted by the supply chain -- the component supply issues that are putting a headwind on what we can get pushed out the door. What I'd say is we -- our full-year guide that we gave you last quarter of 5% to 7% growth on the top line, and 5% to 7% growth on the bottom line, giving another quarter of very strong demand growth and the backlog plus the buildup of RPO we have, we have pretty good visibility to what needs to get done to hit that and are still -- given everything we know, we're still quite confident in being able to hit those for the full year. So, the shape of the year may look a little bit different because of the supply issues, but the full year still feels like it's where it was 90 days ago.\nAmit Daryanani: Got it. And if I just follow-up, you had a really nice wind with Facebook on Silicon One condition I think recently. Could you just talk about as you think about Silicon One offering, where is this resonating with customers? And Chuck, I'd love to understand, what are the 2 or 3 reasons beyond this is alternated to what Broadcom that customers the gravitating Silicon One for?\nChuck Robbins : I would say there's a couple of things. Number 1, the performance of the Silicon One architecture is pretty incredible. And in a world where sustainability is a massive issue for everyone, when you look at the performance to power consumption ratio, it leads the world and so when you look at the speed and the number of ports and the performance that we're able to deliver at the lower power consumption, it is super meaningful and so -- not only is it great technology, but it comes at a significantly lower power consumption, and I think those are couple of big reasons.\nAmit Daryanani: Perfect. Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora : Next question, please.\nOperator: Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead.\nRod Hall: Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. I wanted to come back to the service provider orders. We would calculate that's the best number you've done on absolute orders and service provider in 10 years. It's an insanely good number. And I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what's in there. I know that you believe that orders are coming forward 3 or 4 quarters. I think like you said, Chuck, 2 to 4, but what is driving that? Can you dig into the products inside of that? And can you maybe link it back to some of these very large CapEx programs we've seen some of the hyper - scalers and so on, and how all this fits together for you from a product point of view in a market point of view, and I've got a follow-up.\nChuck Robbins : Okay, Rod. Thank you. I think you're probably right on -- I don't know if it goes back 10 years. I have not looked at it, but it was significant, and I think it's a combination of what we talked about. For three years on this -- on these calls, we talked about when's 5G going to be real. And so, we see it real now. And so, you sell site routers that are backhaul. Routers are a big deal. Packet core is a big deal. You get into the cloud providers, and you have either standalone silicon, standalone software, or integrated systems and increasingly it's -- we're getting more integrated systems work which has been helpful. The Edge with the ASR 9K. The Cisco 8000 is being obviously super successful.  The NCS product line, optical, Acacia is doing very well. And so, all those technologies just line up. And I think that when you look at the -- I'd say I'd summarize it with 3 major trends, just us getting into the 400-gig build-out in the cloud. As the 5G build-out in the service provider space, and then a re-architecture that's happening in the service provider space to just basically flatten and simplify the whole routed optical network strategy that our teams have talked about. Those are the drivers. And you had a second question, Rod.\nRod Hall: Yeah. I wanted to come back to the backlog and maybe see if Scott, if you have aged out at all. Could you give us any idea? I know it's within the RPO, but could you give us any idea on aging on that just so we could try to reconcile. Obviously, the stock's down, reason it probably down is because the growth rate here just doesn't match the word of growth, and people are going to try to reconcile that. I thought, well, maybe you could give us some aging that would help us to make some progress on that. So, I'm just curious if you can help with that. Thanks.\nScott Herren : Rod, thanks for that question. This is something that our supply chain team is working day and night to try to resolve. We obviously can look at that and understand what's in the backlog quite well. What I'd say is what we're working through is really a prioritization mechanism on how we can get things shipped out that are going to make sense to our customers and get those out there as quickly as possible. So, there is some aging inside there, Rod. Rather than try to quantify that for you, what I'd say instead is it's something that we are -- our team is working night and day to try to resolve.\nRod Hall: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nScott Herren : By the way, if it's sitting in the backlog, obviously it's not an RPO yet. It's not an RPO, so it's incremental to RPO. Right.\nRod Hall: Yeah, I misspoke. Sorry about that.\nScott Herren : Yeah.\nRod Hall: Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora : All right. Thanks, Rod. Next question.\nOperator: Matthew Niknam from Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead\nMatthew Niknam : Hey guys. Thank you for taking the questions. Just two if I could. First on gross margins, I think the guide for next quarter implies you're going to be down about 50 bytes at the midpoint, despite some of the seasonal lift you've typically seen in Fiscal 2Q. So, I'm just wondering, is it entirely worsening supply chain constraints or are there other factors to consider? And then secondly, I guess more broadly, is a question on capital allocation. At the Analyst Day, you talked about using the buyback -- to continue to use it to offset dilution from stock options, but you're also sitting on $23 billion in cash. Wondering if there are any updates you can share in terms of strategy here and on a related point, what you're seeing on the M&A front in terms of larger scale, more transformational opportunities. Thanks.\nChuck Robbins : Okay. You snuck in 3 there, Matthew. But I'll start with the gross margin question. The guide that we gave for the quarter, at 63.5 to 64.5 is exactly the same guide that we gave you in Q1, and it's the exact same combination of effects. There are some competing factors inside there right on the -- within the gross margin. We've got price increases that will come online as the year goes on more toward the second half and really more toward the end of Q3 and into Q4, we'll start to see that will be a tailwind to gross margin. We've got the cost increases and within that it's not just component cost increases, which are a part of it. It's also logistics cost increases as we've talked about, and those have gone up across the board as well. So that's what's in the gross margin. It's strictly tied to the various elements of costs within our supply constraints that we're dealing with. On the cap allocation, which I think was your second question, our cap allocation policy is unchanged. It's exactly as we stated at Investor Day, which is, first and foremost, to support the growth of the business.  Beyond that, to obviously continue to protect the dividends through time, offset dilution of our equity plans, which is what you saw us do during the quarter we just closed, and then longer term, return excess cash in the most tax efficient way we can to our investors. So, we continually evaluate that. I will tell you it's an evaluation that is not just done once a quarter; it's an evaluation that we do continually on that front. The M&A question is one that probably doesn't pay to get too deep into.  M&A has been a part of our strategy as a Company. Over time, we talked about a couple of acquisitions in the opening commentary. EPSAGON, which closed during the quarter and Replex, which we announced during the quarter, is not yet closed. You should continue to see us doing some of those more of the build-by type acquisitions. I think it helps us accelerate innovation. Longer term it's a space that has been part of our strategy for some time.\nMatthew Niknam : That's great. Thanks, Scott.\nMarilyn Mora : Let's go ahead and move to the next one.\nOperator: Tal Liani from Bank of America. You may go ahead.\nTal Liani: Hi. Hopefully you can hear me. Chuck, I have a high-level question. If I analyze your growth, you grew $1 billion year-over-year. But when I look at the components, it all hardware. Switches and routers or Secure, Agile Networks is about 55% of it, and the rest of it is the optical stuff, the Internet for the future. And the question is twofold. Number one, strategically, what can you do to expedite the growth of your focus areas, meaning software recurring revenue, SASE anything that the other side of hardware. And the second question is, even if I look at the hardware side on these 2 areas, there was a major increase year-over-year in the growth rate. Meaning from -16 to +10, for example, in securing that John network, even higher on the optical side. So, what about sustainability, if that's the driver going forward, the hardware piece or the legacy pieces, how sustainable is the high growth we are seeing today versus a year-ago? Thanks.\nChuck Robbins : Thanks, Tal. First of all, I think, when you look at the RPO numbers that Scott talked about, that would indicate that there's a significant portion of our revenue that we recognize each quarter that is not hardware. If you look at the RPO that we're going to recognize over the next 4 quarters and it will increase as we go through the year; it's sitting at close to $16 billion right now and so I think -- and you look at the product RPO growth in the quarter was up 18%, so I think that's actually being successful. I just think the hardware part of the business had suffered the most a year ago. And so, I think it's just coming back strong, and we're -- but I actually think that we're actually making great progress on the software side, so I'm not concerned about it. I obviously would like for it to go faster, but I think it's -- if I look at what we're pulling off the balance sheet today and revenue versus what we were 6 years ago, it's seriously meaningful.\nTal Liani: And what about sustainability?\nChuck Robbins : You see 1/12 of it in a quarter --\nTal Liani: A fraction of it.\nChuck Robbins : -- a fraction of it in a given quarter.\nTal Liani: Yeah. Thanks. And what about sustainability of these areas that are growing now? How sustainable is the high growth that we're seeing now?\nScott Herren : We touched on -- I'll start, Chuck, and you can add color. We touched on that, Tal, at the -- at our Investor Day, where we talked about the long-term growth of the TAM. It's just on the markets we're playing in today, that that's where we're already selling or where we're investing in products. That's up to a $400 billion TAM by fiscal '25. And then within that, those markets are growing 5% to 7%, consistent with our own projected growth rates. Interestingly, when you peel that 5% to 7% back further and say, well, what's going to drive that? By far, if you recall, the fastest growth rate was in the subscription models, and that's what you see from us. You see product RPO growing 18%. You see product ARR growing 21%. You see us doing exactly what we said we were going to do, which is make that transformation to a more recurring revenue model. Those things are not necessarily immediately turning into reported revenues, which I think is the math you're trying to do. But you got to add to that, or you got to consider when you do that, the amount that we're building up in RPO and in ARR and I think that's what drives the growth longer term.\nChuck Robbins : And, Tal, we're also -- if you think about the franchise wins that we're having in the cloud webscale players, those are like recurring revenue models because you're in until the next transition, just like we were out before, so that's another reason that -- if you look at software as a percentage of total revenue, as we continue to make progress there, I think software is going to grow and we hope to be growing both sides of it to be candid.\nTal Liani: Got it. Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora : Thanks, Tal. Next question.\nOperator: Jim Suva from Citigroup. You may go ahead.\nJim Suva: Thank you. And I just have one question and that is, can you give us some more details around your prepared comment where you mentioned about your integration and Acacia is going on really well, what are some examples or proof points or milestones or items that you can maybe help us as outsiders understand about how Acacia is fitting in with Cisco. Thank you.\nChuck Robbins : It's a really good question, I think first of all, they are -- I think they are executing ahead of what we expected from a numbers perspective. So that's first and foremost. And then secondly, I think just the work the teams are doing to continue to deliver on the innovation, there's work going on between the silicon and optics teams today. We're winning new franchises. I just think, it's just been a great partnership since they've been onboard. Scott, anything to add.\nScott Herren : No. Other than just reiterating what you said in the opening commentary which is, and this is a pretty major milestone for the industry, first pluggable module capable of delivering 1.2 terabyte capacity on a single wavelength. That's a sign of not just executing on the financial performance, but also continuing to innovate at the rate and pace that we'd expect from them.\nMichelle: All right. Thanks, Jim. We have time for 1 last question.\nOperator: Thank you. Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. You may go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Chuck, I guess just wanted to follow up, you have base strong order trends across all the customer verticals. But you did mention the impact that you're monitoring the Delta variant and the uncertainty around it, and we've heard the same from some of the channel partners in terms of a risk to monitor, particularly for the commercial space. Are you seeing anything weaken on the margin there or is there a bit more uncertainty and risk created because of it? And then as a quick follow-up for Scott. Scott, I do realize the supply chain constraints that you're highlighting here, but you're reiterating the full-year revenue guide of 5 to 7. Does the high-end look a bit more unreachable at this point, just given the supply constraints are bidding into the second half, which probably was not expected when you give that guidance earlier. Thank you.\nChuck Robbins : Yes, Samik. My answer is pretty quick. We're not seeing any impact from it, but we're clearly monitoring it. We live in -- we are in such a dynamic world right now. And you see what's happening in some places in Europe, but we actually saw acceleration in the last 90 days.\nScott Herren : Yeah, you pointed out commercial, Samik, in the question. And 1 of the data points that Chuck talked about earlier is commercial group. Product orders and commercial group, 46% during the quarter. So, we had really strong growth there. I think to your second question, it's so hard. I talked earlier about the complexity of answering that question, but I'll just repeat what we said earlier in the year that if the supply chain -- the component supply\nChuck Robbins : constraints began to clear up earlier in the second half, we'll be toward the high end; if it's later in the second half, we'll be toward the low end. The real difficult question to answer is where in the second half do, we really see that starting to clear up. What we have seen is stabilization. It did deteriorate earlier in the first quarter. As the quarter went on, I mentioned earlier, we saw signs of stabilization and we also have great visibility coming from what's in RPO. It's going to creep into our revenue stream in the second half and knowing very clearly what's in the backlog, so we know exactly which components to go chase to build that out. So confident in the full year. The question of when this all clears up in the second half is really what's going to dictate whether we're more towards the high end or more towards the low end.\nSamik Chatterjee: Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora : All right. Thank you.\nChuck Robbins : Alright. Let me let me just wrap up by thanking all of you for spending time with us today and just saying, I'm really proud of what the teams have accomplished. It's incredibly complex environment. When you look at -- we delivered 8% revenue growth, 8% non-GAAP EPS, all three geographies, product bookings over 30%. ARR growing to $21.6 billion double-digits, RPO at $30.1 billion double-digits. I really am just pleased with what the teams have done. It was truly a great quarter in a very complicated time. Large backlog in our history, it will ship and combine that with our RPO when we feel good about where we're headed, we will continue to plan and work hard on navigating these component issues and our supply chain team continues to work night and day to do that. We feel good still about our annual guidance and I have a lot of confidence about where we are with our innovation and with the Company in general. So, thanks for spending time with us, and we'll talk to you next time.\nMarilyn Mora : Thanks. Chuck, Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call, which will reflect our Fiscal 2022 second-quarter results, will be on Wednesday, February 16th, 2022, at 1:30 PM Pacific Time, 4:30 PM Eastern Time. This concludes today's call. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact the Cisco Investor Relations group and we thank you very much for joining today.\nOperator: Thank you for participating on today's conference call.

            "name": "Chuck Robbins",
            "content": "Thanks, Marilyn. And good afternoon, everyone. We look forward to spending time with you today. First, I would like to thank those of you who joined us for our Investor Day in September, where we showcased the strong foundation, we've built for helping to generate long-term, profitable growth. We're striving to maximize value creation through our focus on higher concentrations of software and subscription-based revenue streams. This gives us, and you, greater visibility and predictability into our future growth. We also highlighted our unique portfolio of market-leading franchises, which are well-positioned to drive growth in highly attractive existing and expansion markets. Lastly, we showcased the depth of our leadership team and outline the next phase of our strategy.  Moving into fiscal year '22, we were also a great start with robust order growth of 33% and continued strong demand across our portfolio. Our teams are executing well, our ARR grew double-digits, and our momentum is accelerating, driven by digital transformation and cloud. Even with the ongoing supply constrained environment, we are solidly on track to deliver against our long-term financial targets by investing for growth while delivering breakthrough innovation. The past 18 to 24 months have no doubt accelerated the digital revolution we are all experiencing as technology is permanently changing nearly every aspect of our lives.  The technology we build is powering the modern secure infrastructure that sits at the heart of this revolution, and Cisco is well-positioned to capture the opportunities ahead. Our customers ONE Digital and cloud enabled solutions that allow them to move with greater speed, agility, and efficiency. We're already seeing the positive impact of our investments to drive accelerated innovation across high-growth areas, including hybrid cloud, web scale, cloud security, 5G, Wi - Fi 6, 400-gig, and full-stack observability. A key trend in front of us is enabling employees to work from anywhere. And this is much broader than meetings.  It's about the holistic capabilities to support a highly distributed workforce that require new infrastructure architectures, observability, and security. Many companies are in the process of defining their hybrid work strategy, which will be based on the technology we build across our networking, security, and collaboration portfolios. We're also leading the way with new innovation, including our recently expanded WebEx portfolio, purpose-built for inclusive experiences across hybrid work, workspaces, and events. Now I'd like to discuss our Q1 performance. Building on the momentum from last quarter, I'm proud to say we achieved another strong quarter in line with our expectations despite supply constraints, which I will discuss shortly. We delivered balanced revenue and non-GAAP EPS growth with healthy margins driven by a continued economic recovery, strong execution, and exceptional demand for our products.  We also generated a strong quarter of double-digit growth in ARR and RPO, reflecting the ongoing success of our transformation. We have continued to operate successfully in a very dynamic environment, staying nimble in order to navigate the evolving conditions related to the Delta variant, and global component shortages. Now let me discuss the performance of our customer market segments. Q1 marks the third consecutive quarter of accelerating order momentum with broad-based strength across our business. Every geographic region, and 3 of the 4 customer markets, grew product orders at 30% or higher.  We again experienced the strongest demand in over a decade as our customers increased their investments in digital transformation. In our enterprise and commercial businesses, we achieved our fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating order growth. We also saw a solid growth in public sector. Our service provider segment delivered its highest level of order growth in over 5 years with 66% growth as these customers address their growing bandwidth requirements. In our web scale business, our robust momentum continues. Our performance was once again a record with order growth of over 200%.  That's 120% growth on a trailing four quarter basis. We are very pleased with the early traction of our 400-gig Solutions, Cisco 8000 platform, Silicon One portfolio, and rapid growth in our Acacia portfolio of optical networking products. It's clear we are expanding our footprint as our cloud growth rate is outpacing our peers. We continue to invest in web skill innovations with differentiated customer value. Launching this quarter, the latest member of the Silicon One family, the 19.2 terabit P100 routing device. The 11th chip in the Silicon One family. In addition, Acacia marked a major milestone by unveiling the industry's first pluggable module, capable of delivering 1.2 terabit capacity on a single wavelength.  Our product revenue was up nearly $1 billion year-over-year, demonstrating the competitive advantages of our scale and reach, as well as our ongoing momentum. We saw a broad-based demand across the majority of our product portfolio. In addition, we continue to see steady progress in our business model transition. Our focus on subscriptions allows us to deliver innovation faster to our customers, while providing more predictability and visibility, leading to a more durable growth business over the long term. We delivered software revenue of $3.7 billion, with 80% sold as a subscription. Subscription revenue increased by 4% to nearly $5.5 billion, while ARR increased by 10% year-over-year to $21.6 billion. We saw strong product ARR growth of 21% and product RPO grew 18%, reflecting our rapid transformation to a software-led business model.  While our revenue growth was solid, it was impacted by the supply constraints which are affecting our technology peers, and nearly every other industry. Our product orders were extremely strong and balanced across our markets. But we are constrained in what we can build and ship to our customers. We have a world-class supply-chain team that works to deliver an incredibly high volume of products given our scale and reach. They continue to execute well in this highly fluid and complex environment. We have been taking multiple steps to mitigate the supply shortages and deliver products to our customers, including working closely with our key suppliers and contract manufacturers, paying significantly higher logistics costs to get the components where they are most needed, working on modifying our designs to utilize alternative suppliers where possible, and constantly optimizing our build and delivery plans.  We are doing this at a breadth and scale that is significantly greater than most in our industry. Of course, all of these steps, while necessary to maximize our production and delivery to customers, add to our cost structure. When combined with cost increases, we are seeing from many of our suppliers, these factors are putting pressure on our gross margins. While we've thoughtfully raised prices to offset this impact, the benefits are not immediate and will be recognized over the coming quarters. Our focus remains on our customers to ensure we provide them with the products they need as quickly as possible. Now, I would like to share the progress we're making on our ESG initiatives.  In September, we committed to being net 0 greenhouse gas emissions for Scope 1 and 2 by 2025 and net 0 for all emissions including Scope 3 by 2040. We believe we will do this by focusing on 4 areas: Building more efficient products, accelerating the use of renewable energy, embracing hybrid work, and investing in innovative carbon removal solutions. We believe we have a deep responsibility to use our industry leadership position and our innovation, to make the world a better place and look forward to continuing to do our part. In summary, I am very pleased with the start to our fiscal year. Our teams are executing on our strategy, while navigating a challenging operating environment and this is reflected in our Q1 results. Demand remains strong and with the momentum in our business transformation, we have set the stage for another year of accelerated growth in fiscal 2022.  Our performance is a testament to the power of our differentiated innovation, the strength of our end markets, and our team's commitment to excellence. As our customers accelerate their digital transformation and their adoption of hybrid cloud and hybrid work strategies, we believe we are uniquely positioned to capture the opportunities ahead. We will continue to strategically invest across our portfolio to drive growth and innovation, strengthen our competitive advantage, and position Cisco for success. And I continue to have great confidence in our future. I will now turn it over to Scott. And then Sami, thanks for the question. On the public sector situation, we saw -- if you look at our public sector performance on a global basis over the last couple years, it's been very consistent. And I think we've doubled that business since 2017 or something so it's been -- that's the federal business perhaps; our U.S. public sector, but the -- what we saw was we saw a lot of strength in E-Rate. We saw strength in state, local, and education. We saw strength on a Ittai, it's a great question. So first of all, I will say that we have room to get better in security and teams are working hard on that. There's a lot of innovative work going on. And then you called out the primary issue that Scott referenced in his opening comments is the on - prem sort of perpetual stuff in decline and then the subscription-based businesses grew double-digits. Zero Trust, Unified Threat Management was good growth. And overall, the subscription portfolio grew 15%. So, it's really balancing that and there's a little impact in there, Ittai, from supply chain on our hardware-based network firewall business. So, I think it's a combination of, we've got some work do with which the teams are working on. And then the transition and a little bit of supply chain. But we would expect over the next 2 to 3 years for that business to continue to get better, and the teams are committed to make that happen. You want to take the first and I will take the second. Just to add to that [Indiscernible], our perpetual software, as you would expect, is negative year-over-year. So that -- and then the ratable that gets recognized over 3, 4, 5 years is where we're shifting it too. On the renewals on the Cat 9K, what I would say is that it's still too early to tell, but I'll tell you that it's in line with our expectations and the last two quarters -- they're small numbers just to be clear. We're very early in this and the teams have been Let me -- on your first question. I think it varies by customer. Most customers are very understanding. They are super frustrated with the lead times. We have -- where we have situations that we need to deal with specific customer issues around budgets, etc., our teams handle that specifically with the customers, but in general, I think that they understand and many of our customers are doing the same thing to their customers. So, this is a whole inflationary trend that we see across the entire economy. I would say that -- quick comment on -- before I hand it to Scott -- on the second part, we did talk about -- the first half of last quarter, we did see some deterioration in our supply chain component availability. And then we saw it stabilize in the second half. So that was good. And we're planning on seeing some slight improvement in Q3 and Q4. We don't expect a lot of it -- we expected to remain stabilized in Q2, and then we think we'll see some slight improvement in the second half of our fiscal year. That's our current belief based on what we know today. Scott, you want to talk a little bit about the second part? When we begin -- The bad news is we've had obviously challenges getting things shipped to our customers. The good news is, is that our backlog is at an all-time high for our Company. It's never been higher. Well, yes. And if you look at the compare from a year ago, the compare was actually tougher, so the momentum actually increased, if you look at it that way. But our teams have -- we talked about 6 years ago that we were going to do the work to try to get back into these franchises in the cloud players, and that's been a big -- that's a big, big success for us right now and that's certainly helpful. And then we've got all these other trends happening right now. You got 5G build-out, you've got Wi-Fi 6, you got every enterprise customer realizing that they're not going to get caught with the next crisis not having their technology modernized Our switching growth is at a rate that -- 2 years ago if I'd have told you we're going to be doing that or if you'd told me we were going to be doing that, we'd have both been crazy.  So, it's -- so I think your point of at some point in the future, you would expect order rate and revenue, would they have to get in line? I think over a time period, yes; not necessarily in one quarter versus the other because of the transition in the business model. Because if you look at the RPO that we're pulling off the Balance Sheet every quarter, I go back and look at what that would've been 6 years ago. It wouldn't have been anywhere remotely close to what we are, so we would've been in a much more dire situation relative to supply chain and revenue right now if we hadn't been making the transition that we've been making. Yes. Thanks, Simon. Well, we can't give you the number because it's impossible to calculate. But if you look at last quarter's product growth at 31, this quarter's product growth at 33, the RPO, they'll be pulled off the balance sheet [Indiscernible] meaningfully higher. There is -- it's the largest backlog we've had in the history of the Company. So, it's hard to say. But Scott, anything to add? What I would say is that while short term this doesn't feel great, I think what we're seeing is the customers have decisions they're making right now, and they're choosing our technology across the board. They're choosing the innovation that our teams have built. And I think that's going to bode well, and that's a great indicator for us in the future. And I think the fact of the matter is, is with that RPO and the backlog that we have, that stuff's going to ship. So, there's going to be some short-term issues, but it's going to catch up. I'm not sure book-to-bill matters anymore. That mattered years ago when we were a hardware Company, and everything was sort of net 30. We haven't looked at that in ages. I'm sure it's on a spreadsheet somewhere from years ago, but I would say the backlog is -- Scott, how would you want to characterize it? I'll leave that with you. It is -- we have great visibility to what we need to build and ship out, and that's why you see us taking the steps we're taking in terms of adding inventory, making some of the longer-term purchase commitments that you see show up in our filings. It's really trying and doing everything we can to try to support our customers and get that product out the door as quickly as possible. But you can get a sense of the building backlog just by looking at the delta between what's been showing up in bookings and what we're able to push out the door in revenue. Yes. We worry about it every day, and so do our competitors. And so, it's everybody is trying to fulfill what customers need and I guess the silver lining is this is not necessarily unique to us, but it's certainly frustrating. I would say there's a couple of things. Number 1, the performance of the Silicon One architecture is pretty incredible. And in a world where sustainability is a massive issue for everyone, when you look at the performance to power consumption ratio, it leads the world and so when you look at the speed and the number of ports and the performance that we're able to deliver at the lower power consumption, it is super meaningful and so -- not only is it great technology, but it comes at a significantly lower power consumption, and I think those are couple of big reasons. Okay, Rod. Thank you. I think you're probably right on -- I don't know if it goes back 10 years. I have not looked at it, but it was significant, and I think it's a combination of what we talked about. For three years on this -- on these calls, we talked about when's 5G going to be real. And so, we see it real now. And so, you sell site routers that are backhaul. Routers are a big deal. Packet core is a big deal. You get into the cloud providers, and you have either standalone silicon, standalone software, or integrated systems and increasingly it's -- we're getting more integrated systems work which has been helpful. The Edge with the ASR 9K. The Cisco 8000 is being obviously super successful.  The NCS product line, optical, Acacia is doing very well. And so, all those technologies just line up. And I think that when you look at the -- I'd say I'd summarize it with 3 major trends, just us getting into the 400-gig build-out in the cloud. As the 5G build-out in the service provider space, and then a re-architecture that's happening in the service provider space to just basically flatten and simplify the whole routed optical network strategy that our teams have talked about. Those are the drivers. And you had a second question, Rod. Okay. You snuck in 3 there, Matthew. But I'll start with the gross margin question. The guide that we gave for the quarter, at 63.5 to 64.5 is exactly the same guide that we gave you in Q1, and it's the exact same combination of effects. There are some competing factors inside there right on the -- within the gross margin. We've got price increases that will come online as the year goes on more toward the second half and really more toward the end of Q3 and into Q4, we'll start to see that will be a tailwind to gross margin. We've got the cost increases and within that it's not just component cost increases, which are a part of it. It's also logistics cost increases as we've talked about, and those have gone up across the board as well. So that's what's in the gross margin. It's strictly tied to the various elements of costs within our supply constraints that we're dealing with. On the cap allocation, which I think was your second question, our cap allocation policy is unchanged. It's exactly as we stated at Investor Day, which is, first and foremost, to support the growth of the business.  Beyond that, to obviously continue to protect the dividends through time, offset dilution of our equity plans, which is what you saw us do during the quarter we just closed, and then longer term, return excess cash in the most tax efficient way we can to our investors. So, we continually evaluate that. I will tell you it's an evaluation that is not just done once a quarter; it's an evaluation that we do continually on that front. The M&A question is one that probably doesn't pay to get too deep into.  M&A has been a part of our strategy as a Company. Over time, we talked about a couple of acquisitions in the opening commentary. EPSAGON, which closed during the quarter and Replex, which we announced during the quarter, is not yet closed. You should continue to see us doing some of those more of the build-by type acquisitions. I think it helps us accelerate innovation. Longer term it's a space that has been part of our strategy for some time. Thanks, Tal. First of all, I think, when you look at the RPO numbers that Scott talked about, that would indicate that there's a significant portion of our revenue that we recognize each quarter that is not hardware. If you look at the RPO that we're going to recognize over the next 4 quarters and it will increase as we go through the year; it's sitting at close to $16 billion right now and so I think -- and you look at the product RPO growth in the quarter was up 18%, so I think that's actually being successful. I just think the hardware part of the business had suffered the most a year ago. And so, I think it's just coming back strong, and we're -- but I actually think that we're actually making great progress on the software side, so I'm not concerned about it. I obviously would like for it to go faster, but I think it's -- if I look at what we're pulling off the balance sheet today and revenue versus what we were 6 years ago, it's seriously meaningful. You see 1/12 of it in a quarter -- -- a fraction of it in a given quarter. And, Tal, we're also -- if you think about the franchise wins that we're having in the cloud webscale players, those are like recurring revenue models because you're in until the next transition, just like we were out before, so that's another reason that -- if you look at software as a percentage of total revenue, as we continue to make progress there, I think software is going to grow and we hope to be growing both sides of it to be candid. It's a really good question, I think first of all, they are -- I think they are executing ahead of what we expected from a numbers perspective. So that's first and foremost. And then secondly, I think just the work the teams are doing to continue to deliver on the innovation, there's work going on between the silicon and optics teams today. We're winning new franchises. I just think, it's just been a great partnership since they've been onboard. Scott, anything to add. Yes, Samik. My answer is pretty quick. We're not seeing any impact from it, but we're clearly monitoring it. We live in -- we are in such a dynamic world right now. And you see what's happening in some places in Europe, but we actually saw acceleration in the last 90 days. constraints began to clear up earlier in the second half, we'll be toward the high end; if it's later in the second half, we'll be toward the low end. The real difficult question to answer is where in the second half do, we really see that starting to clear up. What we have seen is stabilization. It did deteriorate earlier in the first quarter. As the quarter went on, I mentioned earlier, we saw signs of stabilization and we also have great visibility coming from what's in RPO. It's going to creep into our revenue stream in the second half and knowing very clearly what's in the backlog, so we know exactly which components to go chase to build that out. So confident in the full year. The question of when this all clears up in the second half is really what's going to dictate whether we're more towards the high end or more towards the low end. Alright. Let me let me just wrap up by thanking all of you for spending time with us today and just saying, I'm really proud of what the teams have accomplished. It's incredibly complex environment. When you look at -- we delivered 8% revenue growth, 8% non-GAAP EPS, all three geographies, product bookings over 30%. ARR growing to $21.6 billion double-digits, RPO at $30.1 billion double-digits. I really am just pleased with what the teams have done. It was truly a great quarter in a very complicated time. Large backlog in our history, it will ship and combine that with our RPO when we feel good about where we're headed, we will continue to plan and work hard on navigating these component issues and our supply chain team continues to work night and day to do that. We feel good still about our annual guidance and I have a lot of confidence about where we are with our innovation and with the Company in general. So, thanks for spending time with us, and we'll talk to you next time."

            "content": "Thanks, Chuck. We started the fiscal year with a strong Q1 performance. We executed well resulting in another quarter of more than 30% product order growth, driven by strength across our portfolio and demonstrating continued robust demand for our products and services. We also had strong results across revenue, net income, and earnings per-share. Total revenue increased to $12.9 billion, up 8% year-over-year coming in line with our guidance range for the quarter. We saw strength in a number of product areas and across all geographies. Our business continues to execute well in this highly dynamic environment, but ongoing component supply constraints are impacting our ability to convert historically high demand into revenue as quickly as we'd like. Non-GAAP operating margin was 33.3%, up 60 basis points.  Non-GAAP net income was $3.5 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.82, both up 8% year-over-year, with non-GAAP EPS coming in above the high-end of our guidance range. Looking at our Q1 revenue in more detail. Total product revenue was $9.5 billion, up 11%. Service revenue was $3.4 billion, up 1%. Secure agile networks performed very well with revenues up 10%. Switching had strong growth driven by a double-digit increase in campus switching, led by our Catalyst 9000 and Meraki switching offerings. The enterprise routing portfolio had high single-digit growth driven by Edge and SD-WAN. Wireless had very strong double-digit increase driven by our Wi-Fi 6 products and Meraki wireless offerings. We had growth in data center switching and compute revenue declined slightly.  Hybrid work was down 7% overall, driven by revenue decreases in our perpetual calling, meetings, and Contact Center offerings. These were partially offset by the ramp of communication platform-as-a-service and growth in our collaboration devices. Within hybrid work, our SasS revenue continues to show growth of high single-digits driven by Cloud Calling and Contact Center. End-to-End Security was up 4%, driven by growth in our cloud-based solutions, also offset by declines in our perpetual and hardware offerings. Our Zero Trust portfolio performed well with double-digit growth, as we had continued momentum in our Duo offerings. We also saw good growth in Unified Threat Management. Here again, our subscription portfolio performed well growing 15%, driven by our Cloud Security and Zero Trust platforms. Internet for the Future was up 46%, driven in large part by the strength of our webscale customers.  We saw broad strength in the portfolio with growth in Cloud, growth in Core, with strength in both Cisco 8000 and NCS 5500, and growth in Edge with the ASR 9000. We also saw benefits from our acquisition of Acacia. Optimized application experiences were up 18%, driven by both ThousandEyes which grew triple-digits, and Intersight which grew in the strong double-digits. SaaS revenue for AppDynamics grew double-digits as its revenue shifted to a greater proportion from its cloud-delivered platform. Our transformation metrics we covered at Investor Day were solid, as we continue to shift our business to more software and subscriptions. Software revenue was $3.7 billion, an increase of 1%, with the product portion, up 3%. 80% of software revenue was subscription-based, which is up 2 percentage points year-over-year.  Total subscription revenue was $5.5 billion, an increase of 4%, with the product portion increasing at 7%. Total subscription revenue represented 43% of Cisco's total revenue. ARR, or annualized recurring revenue, was $21.6 billion, an increase of 10% with strong product ARR growth of 21%. And remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was $30.1 billion, up 10%. Product RPO increased 18% and short-term RPO grew 9% to $15.9 billion. As you can see, we continue to make significant progress on the transformation to increased software and subscriptions. We continue to have exceptionally strong order momentum in Q1 with total product orders up 33%, as Chuck mentioned earlier, with strength across the business. Looking at our geographic segments. The Americas was up 31%, EMEA was up 36%, and APJC was up 39%. Total emerging markets were up 37%, with the BRICS plus Mexico, up 47%.  In our customer markets, service provider was up 66%, commercial was up 46%, Enterprise was up 30%, and public sector was up 10%. As you can see, it was broad strength across the business. From a non-GAAP perspective, total gross margins came in at 64.5%, down 130 basis points year-over-year. Product gross margin was 63.8%, down 150 basis points. And service gross margin was 66.5%, down 60 basis points. The decrease in product gross margin was primarily driven by higher costs from freight, expedite, and increased component costs related to the supply constraints. Pricing impact was relatively moderate and consistent with prior quarters, partially offset by positive product mix.  We continue to manage through the supply constraints seen industry-wide by us and our peers due to component shortages, which have resulted in extended lead times and higher costs for many of these components. We're partnering closely with our key suppliers, leveraging our volume purchasing and extended supply commitments as we address the supply challenges and cost impacts which we expect will continue into the second half of fiscal 2022. Our supply chain team continues to perform well at this very complex situation. We believe we're taking the right strategic actions with our suppliers and contract manufacturers to ensure we meet customer demand despite the potential risks associated with increasing our inventory and purchase commitments.  When we look at the impact of acquisitions on our Q1 results, there was an approximate 250 basis point positive impact on revenue and no material impact on our non-GAAP EPS, which is in line with our expectations. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $3.4 billion, down 16% year-over-year, driven by higher supplier-related payments and timing of other payments and collections. We ended Q1 with total cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $23.3 billion, down approximately $1.2 billion sequentially, primarily driven by $2 billion in scheduled repayments of our long-term debt. In terms of capital allocation, we returned $1.8 billion to shareholders during the quarter, it was comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and $256 million of share repurchases. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline.  During Q1, we closed the acquisition of EPSAGON and announced our intent to acquire Reflex. These investments are consistent with our strategy of complementing our internal innovation and R&D with targeted M&A to allow us to further strengthen and differentiate our market position in our key growth areas. To summarize, we had a strong Q1 in a complex, supply constrained environment. We executed well with strong top-line revenue and earnings per share as we delivered balanced, profitable growth. We continue to make great progress on our business model shift and are continuing to make the investments in innovation to capitalize on our significant growth opportunities.  We're seeing progress as we drive the continued shift to more software and subscription revenue, delivering growth and driving shareholder value. Now let me provide our financial guidance for Q2 which is as follows. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 4.5% to 6.5% year-on-year. We anticipate non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 63.5% to 64.5%, reflecting the continuing increase in supply chain costs we're incurring, as we protect shipments to our customers. Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range from 32.5% to 33.5%. And non-GAAP earnings per-share is expected to range from $0.80 to $0.82. There is no change to our full-year fiscal '22 guidance. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 5% to 7% year-on-year, non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $3.38, $3.45, also up five to 7% year-over-year. In both our Q2 and full-year guidance, we are assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A. Sure. I'll start, Sammy, on the price increase question and then -- and I'll let Chuck on public sector. The price increase that we put in place really just became effective on the 1st of September. Most of what we shipped during the quarter, either came out of RPO, so prior sales that are sitting on the balance sheet and then accrued into our revenue. And we've talked about having $15.9 billion now of current RPO. So, none of that, of course, would have had the price increase built into it. And a lot of the hardware shipments came out of backlog during the quarter. And again, none of those would have include that price increase. I think even looking ahead, Sami, you got to think about that price increase having a bigger effect towards the second half of the year than it will have certainly during Q2. Think of that as more of a late Q3, Q4 by the time those price increases turn into orders, those orders work their way through the backlog, get built, and then delivered to customers. civilian side, and we had a few deals on the DoD side that pushed into Q2 from an order perspective, but it's still very strong and the teams are doing a really good job there. That's just a great business for us. And Ittai, to the second part of your question, we haven't actually broken that out for you, but I think the as we talked at our Investor Day back in September, the growth areas of all of our markets security and hybrid work included are more in the subscription side. That's where we focused our attention. That's where we're focused a lot of our innovation. And as Chuck said, the subscription piece of security grew at 15% during the quarter. So, I think as the -- as that becomes a more and more prominent part of our overall security product portfolio, that's where you'll begin to see more acceleration in the growth rates. Yeah. Again, I'd rather not get into trying to give you guidance at that level, all the way out through time, Ittai (ph). I do think the areas that we focused on, and the areas that we're investing in, are the high-growth areas. And that's why you're seeing that double-digit growth. That mix will continue to change. It was obviously positive during Q1, it was positive in the prior quarter in Q4; it'll continue to change. And again, as that piece becomes a bigger part of the overall portfolio, that's where you'll see it flip to a faster growth. Yeah, sounds good. On the software revenue growth, as you said, it did slow a bit during the quarter and that's really again, the same effect that we talked about in the opening commentary. We had that transformation from selling more perpetual license to selling more as a subscription, and that's an area that we've put a lot of time and effort focusing on. So, it's that mix underneath the covers that's driving it where you'll see the revenue that's not yet recognized but the success of that transformation, is in two of the stats that we also gave you in the opening commentary. Product RPO, products remaining performance obligations, up 18%, and product ARR growing 21%. So, a lot of the software sales that we had in the quarter, are actually sitting there in RPO at this point and they'll get recognized over the future. So that's just creating an overall headwind to the reported revenue growth rate. Improving it. I will tell you that we've added some innovative value around this with like, the ThousandEyes capability that's been put into it now. So, the teams are working on it. We have a reasonable degree of confidence. If you look at net retention rates are clearly off-the-charts positive. But I think it's going to be into the second half and into fiscal '23 when we really see enough volume to have conviction that we've got the numbers where we need them to be. Sure. And -- Yes, I think that's the $64,000 question. The complexity of answering that is, of course, it's not just one commodity that's constrained and you have to square the [Indiscernible] across all economies that are all constrained. And then you have to overlay on that the snarled logistics position that we find ourselves in. Really across all lanes, whether its ocean or air, or trucking. The layering on of both of those is what makes answering that question so complex. As Chuck said, we did see stabilization and some of the signs of stabilization that we saw during the quarter. We saw better visibility to components from some of our suppliers in terms of when they could deliver and the quantities. We saw fewer de -commits come in during the quarter, another sign of stabilization. And then memory costs are actually beginning, just beginning, but beginning to decline a bit, meaning that market's coming more into balance as well. So, we're seeing signs of stabilization, as we look ahead and look at Q2 guidance and what that means for the full year. Obviously, we're in a very strong position on RPO. That's going to accrete into the revenue stream in the second half of the year and we've got a backlog that provide s us great visibility into exactly what we need to build, so we can be a lot more targeted in what we need to go chase down to get that so feel confident in the position that we're in, both on the Q2 guide and the full-year guide, given what we see today. I wish I could do what you ask because I would like to know that myself. I will tell you this. We clearly know -- call it pull-ahead, call it ordering against the reality of our lead times, but we clearly know that customers are ordering further out than they would normally. The large carriers, the cloud providers, where we had 200% growth. These are customers were doing deep forecasting and planning with. So, we know that they're ordering 2, 3, 4 quarters out to make sure that they have the stuff in the pipeline and the right sequence for delivery. So, we get that visibility, but then you look at a segment like commercial that grew 46%, and you tend not to see a lot.  You will see a little bit, some of the commercial customers are looking out. But many of them are ordering when they feel the need, and so it's a really hard question to answer. On your second one, I think that the only way I can answer that is to say, it actually is part of the first answer too, what we're watching real closely is we're watching cancellations, which we have not seen any change in our historic cancellation rates. In fact, it's lower. We watch pipeline growth, and I can tell you that our pipeline growth is probably as strong as it's ever been even beyond the quarter we just finished. So, we see continued demand and I think that from that perspective, the way we think about it is our very large customers, largest enterprises, cloud players, large carriers, those we know we have visibility, there's an aspect of ordering ahead from other customers, but I think the vast majority below that probably aren't. Yeah. That $15.9 billion of just current RPO, meaning it's going to create into the revenue stream in the next 12 months gives us obviously, a fair amount of visibility there, Simon. The other thing I'd say to your point that I think is relevant on the strength of the order flow during the quarter is linearity was also good. It wasn't likely the quarter started off strong and got weaker as it went on. The linearity was good throughout the quarter, so we do enter the current quarter with some pretty good momentum on that front. It actually was the opposite, it strengthened. Just, Paul, the constraint obviously is component supply right now with back-to-back quarters of 31% product order growth in the Q4 that we closed and then 33% in the quarter that we just closed, Q1. Clearly the -- what the headwind that we're seeing to faster revenue growth is just component supply. That backlog will turn into revenue. It will just turn into revenue over time. So, quantifying that is -- it's going to show up in the revenue stream. Without saying the absolute number, Paul, I think look at the revenue growth rate -- the difference between the revenue growth rate in -- just in the last two quarters, in Q4 and in Q1 and you can get a sense of what's built up in that backlog. There's no question that that Q2 guide is impacted by the supply chain -- the component supply issues that are putting a headwind on what we can get pushed out the door. What I'd say is we -- our full-year guide that we gave you last quarter of 5% to 7% growth on the top line, and 5% to 7% growth on the bottom line, giving another quarter of very strong demand growth and the backlog plus the buildup of RPO we have, we have pretty good visibility to what needs to get done to hit that and are still -- given everything we know, we're still quite confident in being able to hit those for the full year. So, the shape of the year may look a little bit different because of the supply issues, but the full year still feels like it's where it was 90 days ago. Rod, thanks for that question. This is something that our supply chain team is working day and night to try to resolve. We obviously can look at that and understand what's in the backlog quite well. What I'd say is what we're working through is really a prioritization mechanism on how we can get things shipped out that are going to make sense to our customers and get those out there as quickly as possible. So, there is some aging inside there, Rod. Rather than try to quantify that for you, what I'd say instead is it's something that we are -- our team is working night and day to try to resolve. By the way, if it's sitting in the backlog, obviously it's not an RPO yet. It's not an RPO, so it's incremental to RPO. Right. Yeah. We touched on -- I'll start, Chuck, and you can add color. We touched on that, Tal, at the -- at our Investor Day, where we talked about the long-term growth of the TAM. It's just on the markets we're playing in today, that that's where we're already selling or where we're investing in products. That's up to a $400 billion TAM by fiscal '25. And then within that, those markets are growing 5% to 7%, consistent with our own projected growth rates. Interestingly, when you peel that 5% to 7% back further and say, well, what's going to drive that? By far, if you recall, the fastest growth rate was in the subscription models, and that's what you see from us. You see product RPO growing 18%. You see product ARR growing 21%. You see us doing exactly what we said we were going to do, which is make that transformation to a more recurring revenue model. Those things are not necessarily immediately turning into reported revenues, which I think is the math you're trying to do. But you got to add to that, or you got to consider when you do that, the amount that we're building up in RPO and in ARR and I think that's what drives the growth longer term. No. Other than just reiterating what you said in the opening commentary which is, and this is a pretty major milestone for the industry, first pluggable module capable of delivering 1.2 terabyte capacity on a single wavelength. That's a sign of not just executing on the financial performance, but also continuing to innovate at the rate and pace that we'd expect from them. Yeah, you pointed out commercial, Samik, in the question. And 1 of the data points that Chuck talked about earlier is commercial group. Product orders and commercial group, 46% during the quarter. So, we had really strong growth there. I think to your second question, it's so hard. I talked earlier about the complexity of answering that question, but I'll just repeat what we said earlier in the year that if the supply chain -- the component supply"

If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now I would like to turn the call over to Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.\nMarilyn Mora: Welcome everyone to Cisco's fourth quarter fiscal 2023 quarterly earnings conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations and I am joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO; and Scott Herren, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheet, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and we will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be done on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the first quarter and full-year of fiscal 2024. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically, the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. With that, I will now turn it over to Chuck.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Marilyn, and good afternoon, everyone. Fiscal '23 was a milestone year for Cisco. We delivered on our operational and financial goals while accelerating our transformation. We achieved record revenue and earnings per share in both the fourth quarter and the full year. We also generated strong margins, record operating cash flow and strong shareholder value, returning 10.6 billion via share repurchases and increasing cash dividends. In FY '23, we delivered nearly 57 billion in revenue, up 11% year-over-year, the highest revenue growth rate in over a decade. Overall, customer demand also remained solid. In Q4, we achieved over 30% total sequential product order growth. The second highest in 20 years with double-digit increases across all customer markets. As we look to build on this strong performance going forward, we remain focused on the following. First, growing market share in all key areas of our business. Second, driving innovation and extending our leadership by investing in significant new opportunities for growth in AI, cloud and security. Third, delivering long-term sustainable value creation for our stakeholders and fourth, transforming our business model by growing recurring revenue. Consistent with what we said last quarter, we expect to build on our record results delivering modest revenue growth in fiscal year '24, with the bottom line growing faster than the top line demonstrating operating leverage. Our outlook reflects good visibility and predictability, driven by healthy backlog, ARR and RPO. We remain deeply committed to building shareholder value and increasing returns to our investors. We will do this through a long-term commitment to greater operating leverage while increasing our annual share repurchases and growing our dividend. Now, let me share additional detail on the quarter and key growth opportunities ahead for Cisco. First, one of our greatest competitive advantages is our pace of innovation. This quarter, we announced new solutions spanning generative AI, hybrid work, security, full stack observability and sustainability. In addition, we remain focused on delivering a more unified and simpler experience for our customers. As I've stated in the past, we knew that as our backlog cleared, we would see corresponding market share gains. With the release of the calendar Q1 results, we gained over three percentage points of market share year-over-year in our three largest networking markets. Campus switching, wireless LAN and SP routing. We expect further share gains in these areas as market share numbers are released for calendar Q2. Second, the acceleration of AI will fundamentally change our world and create new growth drivers for us. While AI has been an important element in our products for several years, this quarter we announced new market leading AI technologies across our collaboration and security portfolios designed to boost productivity, enhance policy management and simplify tasks. We also launched new AI scale infrastructure innovation to allow our customers to process AI workloads more efficiently. Cisco's ASIC design and scalable fabric for AI position us very well to build out the infrastructure that Hyperscalers and others need to build AI/ML clusters. This is a huge opportunity for Cisco and we are laser focused on leading and winning in this space. As a result of our innovation in this area, we expect Ethernet will lead in connecting AI workloads over the next five years. To accelerate this transition, Cisco became a founding member of the Ultra Ethernet Consortium, an industry wide effort to drive open large scale Ethernet based fabrics for high performance networking. In June, we launched our next generation Silicon One switching ASICs to support large scale GPU clusters for AI and ML workloads. We are seeing early success in Hyperscale Ethernet AI fabric deployments. To-date, we have taken orders for over $0.5 billion for AI Ethernet fabrics. We are also piloting 800 gig capabilities for AI training fabrics. Overall, Cisco is committed to helping our customers navigate this transition in a trusted and responsible way to deliver on the full promise of this technology and we are well positioned to win. Next, security remains a top priority. Our AI driven security cloud platform has comprehensive capabilities across the network endpoint and the cloud, helping to simplify security management while increasing efficacy. Our new technologies like XDR, multi-cloud defense and cloud secure access, a secure service edge solution are seeing rapid early adoption. For example, Goldman Sachs has been one of our early adopters of our multi-cloud defense solution. In addition, we are working with Apple to incorporate Cisco's secure access solution into iOS and macOS. These innovations, combined with our recent acquisitions, show how we are extending our security portfolio with deep telemetry AI and identity threat capabilities. Given our installed base of 300,000 Cisco security customers, we believe we have the opportunity to accelerate revenue growth in security over the next few quarters. To summarize, we had a phenomenal year. Our fiscal year '23 and Q4 results demonstrate the strength of our business today and are a solid foundation for future growth. I also want to be very clear on our commitment to increasing shareholder returns through capital return, innovation and strong execution. Last quarter, we committed to operating leverage in Q4 and fiscal year '24 and our guidance today reflects this. Today, I want to confirm that this will be our long-term strategy beyond fiscal year '24. We will also drive a high degree of consistency into our stock repurchase program and will maintain the quarterly levels in the range that we have over the past few quarters. Finally, I want to take a moment to thank our teams who all played an important role in delivering these record full year results and their deep commitment to our -- to the success of our customers and partners. With our focus on innovation and our commitment to operational excellence, I have tremendous confidence in our ability to capitalize on the many opportunities ahead. I'll now turn it over to Scott.\nScott Herren: Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter then cover the full fiscal year followed by our guidance. As Chuck said, we delivered another record quarter driven by focused execution, continued business transformation and the actions we took during the year to mitigate supply issues. We reported our strongest ever revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, earnings per share and operating cash flow in Q4. Total revenue was $15.2 billion, up 16% year-on-year at the high end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP net income was $4.7 billion, up 36%. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.14, up 37%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Looking at our Q4 revenue in more detail. Total product revenue was 11.7 billion, up 20%. Service revenue was 3.6 billion, up 4%. Within product revenue, Secure Agile Networks, our largest product category was very strong, up 33%. Switching revenue had double-digit growth with strength in both campus and data center switching driven by our Catalyst 9000 Nexus 9000 and Meraki offerings. Enterprise routing declined, driven primarily by Access, partially offset by strength in our Catalyst 8000 Series SD-WAN and IoT Routing. Wireless had double-digit growth driven by our Wi-Fi 6 products and Meraki wireless offerings. Internet for the Future was up 3%, driven by growth in our core routing products, including strong growth in our Cisco 8000 offering. We also saw double-digit growth in web scale. Collaboration was down 12%, driven by declines in collaboration devices and meetings partially offset by growth in cloud calling and cloud contact center. End-to-End security was flat with growth in our Zero Trust offerings offset by a decline in our network security offerings and optimized application experiences was up 15%, driven by growth across the portfolio, including double-digit growth in ThousandEyes and AppDynamics. We continue to make progress on the transformation of our business to more recurring revenue based offerings driven by higher levels of software and subscriptions. We saw solid performance in our ARR of 24.3 billion, which increased 5% with product ARR growth of 10%. Total software revenue accelerated to $4.6 billion, an increase of 17% with software subscription revenue up 20%. 85% of our software revenue was subscription based. Total subscription revenue was 6.6 billion, an increase of 13%. And RPO was 34.9 billion, up double-digits at 11%. Both product and service RPO had strong growth with product RPO up 12% and service RPO up 9%. Total short-term RPO grew to 17.9 billion. Total product orders were down 14% year-on-year, but grew sequentially by more than 30%. This was against a strong performance in the year ago quarter, where we delivered the second highest orders in absolute dollars in the history of the company. The aging of our backlog has continued to improve as the supply situation normalizes and as expected, increased customer deliveries reduced our year-end backlog to roughly double historical levels as we enter fiscal '24. Order cancellation rates remain below pre-pandemic levels, which reflects the true demand and criticality of our technologies to our customers. Total non-GAAP gross margin came in at 65.9%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range and up 260 basis points. Product gross margin was 65.5%, up 420 basis points. The increase was primarily driven by positive pricing and product mix, as we realized the benefits from the actions we took in the prior fiscal year. We also drove productivity improvements with lower freight and logistics component and other costs. Services gross margin was. 67.5%, down 150 basis points year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 35.4%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range and up 300 basis points. This improved leverage was driven by both our strong non-GAAP gross margin and ongoing cost management. Shifting to the balance sheet. We ended Q4 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of 26.1 billion. We had record operating cash flow for the quarter of 6 billion, up 62%, driven primarily by strong top line performance and the deferral of our Q4 federal tax payment. Consistent with our prior commentary, the IRS tax relief related to the California floods postponed our current year federal income tax payment until Q1 of our fiscal '24. Consequently, in Q1 of fiscal '24, our federal income tax related cash outflows will include an incremental 2.8 billion of payments for these prior quarters. This quarter, we returned 2.8 billion to shareholders comprised of 1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and 1.3 billion of share repurchases. Consistent with our capital allocation strategy that we outlined last quarter, we are committed to increasing shareholder returns through a greater operating leverage while increasing our annual share repurchases and growing our dividend. Turning to the full fiscal year, we delivered record results in revenue, net income earnings per share and operating cash flow. Revenue for the year was 57 billion up 11% and non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.89, up 16%, demonstrating again the operating leverage that we've been driving. In terms of our software metrics, total software revenue for the full year was up 12% at 17 billion, with the product portion up 14%. 84% of software revenue was subscription based, which is up two percentage points. Total subscription revenue was 24.6 billion, an increase of 10%. Total non-GAAP gross margin was 64.5%, down ten basis points. On the bottom line, non-GAAP net income was 16 billion, up 13%. We delivered record operating cash flow of 19.9 billion, up 50% compared to fiscal '22, driven primarily by strong results, linearity, collections and the federal tax deferral as noted previously. We returned 10.6 billion in value to our shareholders via cash dividends and stock repurchases. This is comprised of 6.3 billion in quarterly cash dividends and 4.3 billion of share repurchases. We increased our dividend for the 12th consecutive year in fiscal 2023, reinforcing our confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline during Q4. We closed the acquisitions of Lightspin Technologies, Smartlook and Armorblox. These investments are consistent with our strategy of complementing our internal innovation and R&D with targeted strategic M&A. To summarize, we had a very strong quarter and fiscal year with record results. We executed well delivering double-digit top line growth, profitability and cash flow. We continue to make progress on our business model shift to more recurring revenue while making strategic investments in innovation to capitalize on our significant growth opportunities. Turning now to our guidance. For fiscal Q1, our guidance is, we expect revenue to be in the range of 14.5 billion to 14.7 billion. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 65% to 66%. Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 34% to 35% and non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $1.02 to $1.04. For fiscal year '24, our guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of 57 billion to 58.2 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $4.01 to $4.08. In both our Q1 and full year guidance we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Scott. Michelle, let's go ahead and queue up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Tim Long with Barclays. You may go ahead. Tim?\nTim Long: Hi. Thank you. Yeah, Chuck, maybe we'll start with kind of the order backlog performance. Sounds a lot better than seasonal in Q4. Could you talk a little bit about what you attribute that to and then maybe looking into next year, doesn't look like you're baking a lot of that into either Q1 or the full year. So what's kind of the expectation for kind of the pull through of those orders into what you're going to see in revenues in fiscal '24? Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Tim. So I'll provide some color, and Scott, maybe you can talk about the conversion of the orders. Look, first of all, we're obviously dealing in a world that has a lot of dynamics right now, but our teams executed incredibly well. As I've said on prior calls, with our sales organization, when you see transitions in sort of customer buying, if it's getting worse, what we see is that our teams will forecast a quarter and then by the end of the quarter, they would have dropped and/or missed. And then when it's beginning to stabilize and get better, they tend to actually exceed the forecast. And so what we saw in Q4 was they had their opening forecast. They nailed month one, they nailed month two, and they exceeded month three by several hundred million dollars. So it was one of those quarters that they actually over-performed what they thought they would do at the beginning of the quarter, which is a positive sign. But again, it's one quarter. We also had the largest quarter in our history of enterprise software agreements from an orders perspective. So we had a lot of big customers making big commitments, which was a positive thing. If you think about what was going on around the world, I'd say service provider just continued to be weak. Enterprise improved, commercial improved. US enterprise was basically flat. So that was better than we had been experiencing for sure, which is a good sign. Public sector remains steady. And verticals, we saw strength in financial services, transportation and energy. And we saw some good strength in countries like India and Saudi around the world. So it's one quarter, but if you compare it to the prior few quarters where the teams had opening forecast that they generally missed by the time we got to the end of the quarter, this was one where I'd say that it was much more stable as we went through the quarter. Scott, do you want to talk about the order conversion?\nScott Herren: Yes. As we think about fiscal '24, we've got pretty good visibility driven by really the business model shift that we've talked about. So a couple of data points that I think you already have, Tim. One is current RPO of $17.9 billion. So total RPO approaching $35 billion, of which $17.9 billion is current, meaning it turns into revenue in the next 12 months. We ended the year as we expected with roughly double our normal backlog levels. But that excess backlog will work down in the first half of fiscal '24 with the majority of that being worked off in Q1, by the way. And we've got $24.3 billion of ARR that we get a chance to renew. Now obviously, some of that will already be captured in RPO, but there's opportunity that's not already captured in RPO as well. So we entered the year with round numbers, 40% of that top line pretty much already in hand between those three categories. So feel good about the way we've -- the way we see the year laying out.\nChuck Robbins: Yes. If I could make one more comment, Tim. On the sequentials, we said given that the year-over-years are just sort of difficult to -- they don't really provide a clear view on what's going on. We've been talking about sequentials a fair amount. And I did say in my opening comments that sequentials from Q3 to Q4 were in excess of 30%. To put that in perspective, it's typically 18% to 20%. And from a customer segment perspective, enterprise was well above that, public sector was well above it. Commercial was pretty close to it and service provider was the low one. However, it was still above historical trends on a sequential basis. So just to try to give you as much color as we can.\nTim Long: Thank you. Very helpful.\nMarilyn Mora: Michelle, let's go ahead and move to the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Amit Daryanani with Evercore. You may go ahead, sir.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks a lot for taking my question. Congrats on a nice set of numbers here. I guess, maybe two things I'd love to get your perspective on. Chuck, when you talk about consistency in capital allocation, can you just expand a bit more on what does that mean? Are you going to think about this as a percent of free cash flow that you're going to go for buybacks or some other metric? Can you just talk about what does that mean? And how do you intend to deploy the capital allocation would be helpful. And then perhaps somewhat maybe related to that, I guess, when we think about the fiscal '24 revenue guide that you folks are providing, 7% growth in Q1, I think, 1% for the full year. That sort of would imply back half will decline. So what are you assuming in the back half that gives you that kind of worry that would be helpful? Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Let me make some just a couple of comments, and I'm going to hand it to Scott and let him answer probably both of these. On the capital allocation and the leverage comments, what I would say is that we've spent a lot of time talking to our shareholders over the last few months. And it's clearly important to our shareholders that we commit to and we deliver on operating leverage in our P&L, and we've been doing it, but we haven't committed to it for long term. So that's what we're basically doing today is saying that we are going to continue to commit to do -- to provide operating leverage in the P&L as we look to the future. And then on the buybacks, we had also increased -- there are two things we wanted to do was increase the amount as well as drive more consistency and predictability for our shareholders. And so the rate, as I said, that we've been running at like the last three quarters is sort of the target that we would be at on a quarterly basis as we go forward. Scott, do you want to add to that and then talk about the revenue guide?\nScott Herren: Yes, will do. And Amit I think you were one of those voices that talked about cap allocation consistency.\nChuck Robbins: I think I remember that.\nScott Herren: At a higher level and also being consistent and what you've seen over the last three quarters is that share buyback has been very consistent at $1.25 billion -- right around $1.25 billion per quarter. We see that continuing into the future. That's $5 billion a year in share buybacks. The dividend right now runs round number $6.5 billion. So you add those two together, that's $11.5 billion of capital return to shareholders. It doesn't feel like it's in a bad place, but responding to the need to be both elevated and more consistent in share buybacks is what you're hearing. You've seen us do it already. The difference is we're verbalizing it in advance now, I guess. And on your revenue guide question, I think it's easy to get a little confused by the year-on-year growth rates when we've had the supply constraints that we've had over the last few years. I mean the reality is some of the revenue that we ended up posting this year, in fiscal '23, are orders that we took and customers wanted the product back in fiscal '22. We just couldn't get it out. We couldn't get it delivered because of the supply constraints. So the better way to think about this is what's been the compound annual growth rate from when we started building that backlog and the supply constraints set in, which was the end of our fiscal '21 through -- and I'll just pick the midpoint of our guide for fiscal '24. If you do the compound annual growth rate on revenue through that time, it's right around 5%, which is, as you know, in line with what we see as our opportunity longer term. So I think it's a little bit tough to track what's happening. We just rely on year-on-years because the year-on-years have just been so skewed by the supply chain. If you step back from it and look at endpoint to endpoint that growth rate feels pretty good.\nAmit Daryanani: No, that three-year CAGR is really helpful. Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Great. Thanks, Amit. Next question.\nOperator: Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. Fantastic kind of data points around the traction with the hyperscalers. When it comes to kind of the $0.5 billion of orders you noted or even kind of the 800-gig trials. Is that with Scheduled Fabric? Is that with Silicon One? Just kind of trying to get a sense of what piece of the portfolio that is. And then just on the Security portfolio, clearly, you're rolling out a new -- a lot of new products, changing some of the sales approaches. Just when do you think we could see an inflection in that business? Thanks.\nChuck Robbins: Yes, Meta, thank you. So on the Ethernet underneath the AI GPU networks, it is Silicon One for sure. And I think for the next 12 months or so, I think we'll be doing trials. I think we'll have some opportunities, but there'll still be a lot of InfiniBand. And that's why we joined as a founding member of this Ultra Ethernet coalition so that we can up guide the standards and really deliver Scheduled Fabric, to your point, in a very effective way. So we think into FY '25 and beyond, this thing will begin to shift to more of an Ethernet-based infrastructure. On the Security front, yes, we've had some early traction. I mentioned Goldman in the multi-cloud defense, which is a great sign of confidence in that solution. If you look at our XDR platform, which, candidly, we just went GA with it right at the end of the quarter. And we already took a seven-figure order from a retailer in Europe. So that was positive. We took one of our largest security orders ever. We took an eight-figure security order from a Fortune 10 company in Q4. So there's some early green shoots, and the teams are executing. The early feedback and early commentary from analysts and customers, et cetera, is positive, but we've got to actually deliver on it. And hopefully, in the second half of this year, we'll see some real positive impact and then '25 for sure.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Next question, please.\nOperator: Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead, sir.\nMichael Ng: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for the question. I just have two. First, it was encouraging to hear about the share gains on campus switching, SP routing and wireless as well as the expectation to continue to grow share. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the sales execution, the product road map there that gives you the most confidence in that continued share growth. And then second, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about your expectations as it relates to the trajectory of orders going forward. It sounds like if the backlog kind of gets back to normal levels in the first quarter, you should just grow along with revenue growth as we think about order growth beyond the first quarter, but just would love your thoughts there. Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Michael. On the share gains in the enterprise networking space, which is what you're asking about, we expect Q2 will be equal to or maybe slightly above the incremental gains that we see when those numbers come out based on some estimates that we have done internally. I would say the thing that is really helping beyond being great products, but we have done a couple of things. Number one, we have begun to deliver on monitoring and then subsequent management of our Catalyst, the traditional Catalyst portfolio with the Meraki dashboard. And that's a real advantage for customers. It allows them to run a hybrid of the two portfolios. It allows them to have visibility from one dashboard to both sets of portfolios. And so that's been really well received. It has been a key driver in significant improvement in our renewal rates on the software side. And while I'm talking about it, I thought I would share one milestone with you. I've been asked for a few years, when do we think the software renewals in the enterprise networking space would be meaningful. And FY'24 is the first year, I think, it will be meaningful. So just to give you a perspective on it. We have we expect this year to renew enterprise networking software at close to $1 billion. So the transition that we've been going through for all these years is going to hopefully begin to start to pay solid benefits for us going forward. But that's what's going on in that portfolio. Scott, you want to talk about orders?\nScott Herren: Trajectory of orders, yes. And, Michael, thanks for that question. What I'd say is, if you remember our commentary from the last call, we said there were kind of three things going on inside product orders. One was the lead times were normalizing, going from being fairly lengthy to going back to a normal level, which, of course, if the lead time yesterday was 30 weeks and today it's 10 weeks means you don't have to place another order for 20 weeks. Those are mostly normalized. They will finish being normalized certainly in the first half of fiscal '24. And so that effect will be dampened. The second is backlog. And as we were still sitting on excess backlog, and we still do, but we've obviously been working our way through that and delivering product to customers. As we get their backlog orders in their hands, they can complete that project and then place the order for the next project. And so that's also been a little bit of a headwind to bookings, and then it's whatever is happening in the macro would be the third factor. We think those first two will normalize in the first half of fiscal '24. Lead times will be normalized, certainly by the time we get to the end of the first half and much of the backlog -- the excess backlog will ship out during the first quarter of fiscal '24. So I think we'll have a clearer view, and I expect to see more normal ordering patterns. Of course, we don't guide orders, but I expect to see more normal ordering patterns in the second half of the year.\nMichael Ng: Okay. That's all very helpful. Thank you, Chuck. Thank you, Scott.\nChuck Robbins: Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Great. Thank you. Let's go ahead and take the next question.\nOperator: Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. You may go ahead.\nIttai Kidron: Thanks, guys. High energy, I like this. Chuck, maybe you could look at -- talk about the RPO. Very strong performance there, especially when you look at the same metric a year ago. Maybe you can unpack this a little bit in the context of a few metrics, meaning duration of contracts customers are willing to go into now, size of deals that are willing to move into now. I'm just trying to kind of get a little bit into the elements of this significant increase in RPO. Appreciate it.\nChuck Robbins: Yes. Thanks, Ittai. I'll give you a little color and then I'll let Scott comment again, too. A lot of this is -- we've made this transition to -- virtually our entire enterprise networking portfolio now is a subscription model. And so that contributes. And Scott can talk about the year-over-year contribution that we've seen. But I mean we have $35 billion in RPO. And I think it's an important thing because when you think about market share and some of the concerns that people have had, you have to remember that we put a reasonable amount of each order in our core networking portfolio on the enterprise side goes into RPO and doesn't get reported as revenue. It's ratable. So it's a headwind to market share. And the other thing that I would point out is that we had a record year at $50 billion -- almost $57 billion at a time where we were building RPO to $35 billion and we have the backlog that we have. So there, we've had a lot of solid customer demand. I'd say in Q4, we certainly saw a fair amount of the enterprise networking. As we ship those products, we saw that software come out of backlog as we've talked about and moved into RPO. We saw a lot of these enterprise agreements that we did with our customers in enterprise contributed to it as well. Those were reasonably large deals. And Scott, I'll let you comment anything -- any more you want to comment on?\nScott Herren: Yes. You specifically asked about duration. There's not much change in duration overall, Ittai. So that's not it. Q4 typically is a quarter where we have more large multiyear transactions. We talk about enterprise agreements and whole portfolio agreements. And so you typically will see a little bit of a bump in Q4 driven by that and then a little bit of a -- I'm sorry, an RPO in Q4. And then in Q1, the typically -- the typical pattern would see it come down just slightly as we work our way through those. I think the other thing to just bear in mind, we've got net RPO growth this year of $3.3 billion, of which product had a net growth of $1.7 billion. If you looked at our current RPO when we began the year, it was about $16.8 billion, which means all of that came out of RPO. And yet on top of that -- yes, short-term. On top of that, we added $1.7 billion. So we added quite a bit of current year sales into that RPO balance. Back to Chuck's point, that's revenue that many of our competitors recognize immediately as they ship it. For us, we have the advantage of recognizing it over time, which makes us more predictable, and it gives us greater visibility into where things are headed.\nIttai Kidron: Appreciate the color. Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Move to the next question.\nOperator: Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead sir.\nMatthew Niknam: Hey, thank you for taking the question. Two-parter, if I could. First, as we think about fiscal '24, so you're forecasting 1% top line growth and about 4% non-GAAP EPS growth with a fairly strong exit rate on gross margin. So is it fair to assume the lift from gross margins may get offset somewhat by some OpEx reinvestment? Just trying to think about the puts and takes there. And then broadly, at the Analyst Day a couple of years ago, I think, Scott, you laid out a 5% to 7% target for both top and bottom line. I'm just wondering if that's evolved at all in light of some of the greater emphasis on operating leverage that you're talking about today. Thanks.\nScott Herren: Yes. Matt, on your first question, I think gross margin settling, you saw our guide for Q1 of gross margins in the 65% to 66% range. And I think it settles in there for the full year. So you can do the math with what we've projected on the top line. That drops down to a mid-single-digit OpEx growth number, so in line with expectations certainly given the environment of merit increases. It doesn't provide a lot of incremental investment, but I think that's in sync with what you've seen us do over time. So the long-term model, look, that was opportunity-based. If you look backwards, what you've seen is we have delivered the bottom line growing faster than the top line. I think the only difference that you hear from us now is, as I said, we're articulating it in advance instead of once it's happened. That's really the way to think about that.\nMatthew Niknam: Great. Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: All right. Thanks, Matt. Michelle, let's take the next question.\nOperator: Jim Fish with Piper Sandler. You may go ahead.\nJames Fish: Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. Maybe just diving in on the go-to-market side. We're hearing you guys are looking to move more of the specialist sales teams out and more towards kind of a cross-sell more portfolio kind of motion. Are you doing a larger sales restructuring right now? And is there anything you can do to better package solutions across these multiple segments, especially on the growth segments that are kind of struggling here, as Meta kind of pointed out earlier, with even security. And lastly, on the capital return side. I know you guys get asked about the technology, but -- and you talked about potential being strategic and all of that. But how do you feel about the push versus pull of either further acquisitions in either of the key growth segments that you outlined, Chuck, versus possibly even spinning off some of those segments like some of the larger companies you're starting to see do? Thanks, guys.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Jim. That was a lot. Let me tell you a little bit of the history on the specialist model. I'll tell you what we're doing in the product portfolio, which allows us to clean up the specialist model a little bit and get them a little more focused. So historically, like -- let's use Security as an example. We've had these different products, and we've sold them all individually. And therefore you need to compete with those individual competitors. So you need subspecialists, you need specialists in every little area of security. And what we've been doing across the portfolio is moving to more of a platform approach. And so it makes it easier to sell. And in certain areas of our portfolio like collaboration and security, we've moved to a suite strategy. So we're now packaging up the Security portfolio in different suites, which allows for us to sort of optimize the security specialist or actually align them more effectively is probably the best way to say it. And so that's the work that's been going on. And I think as we continue to execute on this platform strategy, it certainly simplifies the selling cycle for some of these technologies and I think getting to the suites. We've seen it work in collab. This past quarter, we had very strong order growth in collaboration. We had positive order growth in Security as well. And so for collab to be showing positive order growth is really a byproduct of the suites and leading with calling as the lead part of the suite and then also a big focus on cloud contact center, which grew triple-digits last quarter from an orders perspective. So those are the things that we're trying to do. We're trying to get the portfolio put together in a way that makes it easier and requires fewer subspecialists in the field as we move forward. Scott?\nScott Herren: On the cap return question, Jim, I'd just reiterate what I said earlier. With the consistency of buybacks now running right around $1.25 billion per quarter, so $5 billion a year, the dividend consumes another $6.5 billion. That's $11.5 billion of cap return that we're committed to. And I do expect to continue to, as you've seen us do for the last 12 years, make increases in our dividend payment as you look ahead. So that's one lens on it. I would say on the M&A and spin-off part of that, we're constantly evaluating that. We're constantly evaluating what's available in the order marketplace. You saw we closed three, albeit small kind of tech tuck-in, but three acquisitions during the quarter. The team's very active. We're constantly looking at that space as well as the value in our own portfolio. And so there's nothing new to report there, but those are constant things that we look at.\nJames Fish: Helpful color guys. Thanks.\nMarilyn Mora: All right. Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. You may go ahead, sir.\nBen Reitzes: Hey, guys, thanks for the question. I wanted to double-click on an earlier question with regard to hyperscalers, the $500 million in AI orders you had a briefing in June. I was wondering, have things picked up in terms of activity there? It seems like maybe it has. And I wanted to see if there's further traction that you could articulate in Silicon One. Like what kind of activity are you seeing there? And how big a business can this be?\nChuck Robbins: Yes. Well, Ben, welcome and thank you for the question. We have definitely seen traction in the space. Lots of discussions, lots of architectural discussions, lots of input from those customers on what they'd like to see in the next generation of silicon as an example. And the teams are off building that we just delivered in June. As I said earlier, the next-generation ASIC that actually is built for this, but there's going to be more and more purpose-built silicon over the next couple of years. And the teams are working on that. And those customers are having a great deal of input in how that silicon gets designed. And in some cases, it's unique to each one. And so that's the beauty of us having such an advanced silicon capability. It allows us, if we need to, to actually build unique silicon by customer because these opportunities are so large. In the last call, we talked about the fact that this would probably be 3 to 4 times the opportunity size of the original cloud build-out. And unfortunately for us, as it's been well documented, we missed the original cloud build-out. But I can say with every bit of confidence right now that as we go through this AI transition to Ethernet, we are super well positioned. We have incredible silicon that they have been using in other parts of their portfolio. We won three more use cases last quarter. We now are installed in 21 use cases across the top six of these providers. And we expect that, that momentum will just continue over the next few years. I do think that in the short term, InfiniBand is probably going to still be the preferred in most cases, but they are trialing. And we will, much like we already have, we'll get some opportunities to run Ethernet underneath season. And as we deliver Scheduled Fabric, it will become even more prevalent.\nBen Reitzes: Okay. Thanks a lot, Chuck. It's good to be back .\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Ben\nScott Herren: Thanks, Ben.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Ben. We'll take the next question.\nOperator: Tal Liani with Bank of America. You may go ahead.\nTal Liani: Yes, hi. I have one kind of big-picture question and one more specific. Maybe I'll start with the specific question. If I look at the 400-gig Ethernet market share, cloud, if I take Arista and White Boxes, it's like over 90% of the market, Cisco doesn't have much of a 400-gig market share by the data. But you are talking about growing market share in 800 gig. Can you talk about the dynamics of 400? And then why was it this way in 400 and how it changes in 800 in your expectations? Second is about the big picture. And I need -- I want to understand kind of the numbers. Product revenues last year were $38 billion. Product revenues this year is $43 billion. So that's $5 billion increase. And the decline in backlog is about $5 billion. Your implied guidance for next year for product revenues is roughly flat plus. So without the support of backlog, how do you get to product revenues? What are the other parts that could go to product revenues and compensate for the fact that backlog is going to be normal by the end of next quarter or next 2 quarters, maybe? Thanks.\nChuck Robbins: Yes, Tal, thank you for that. And so on the 400 gig to 800 gig, I don't know that I've seen exact reports that you're talking about on the 400 gig. But our teams -- the volume of ports that we're shipping on 400 gig would imply that that's a -- I don't know, we've had a great deal of success and it's been growing quite significantly. So -- but we obviously had -- over the last few years, we've been rebuilding or actually building our presence in this space. So it wouldn't surprise me to see us as a low market share player, but we've certainly won our fair share. On the 800 gig, I think it's just a matter of we're engaged there. We're installed already. We've got trust with these customers. They've seen what we can do. And I think that we're just in the game at the right time as opposed to where we started. And so I think from now on, it just gives us an opportunity to be there from the beginning as opposed to trying to catch up.\nScott Herren: And Tal, to your question on the math you're trying to do on product revenue, I think some of this goes back to the answer that I gave Tim earlier. One of the things you have to consider is some of the product revenue we delivered this year was actually demand from the prior year, right? Demand from fiscal '22 that because of the supply constraints, we simply couldn't get out the door. Had that not been the case, you would have seen higher product revenue in fiscal '22 and slightly lower product revenue in fiscal '23. And you would have seen a steady increase then from '22 to '23 and '23 to '24. So the things that are driving that are the things that we've talked about, right? We continue to see good traction and market share gains in our enterprise networking products. We are invested early in the AI game and see a great opportunity there. We're getting early success, although it's -- you're not seeing a lot of it yet in the P&L, but we're seeing some pretty early success with our revamped security strategy and the great work that team has done. And so -- but instead of trying to do it the way you're doing it, the delivery has been lumpy, the demand has been less lumpy is probably the right way to think about it.\nTal Liani: Got it. Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: All right. Thanks, Tal. Next question.\nOperator: Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may go ahead.\nJoseph Cardoso: Hi, thanks. This is Joe Cardoso on for Samik. Just one question for me. You mentioned double-digit growth across all your customer verticals from an order perspective but also mentioned service provider continuing to be weak. I was just hoping you could touch on what you're seeing under the hood in service provider. And specifically, if I split it up between telco AI and non-AI cloud, how did those track compared to 90 days ago? And then just quickly, a quick clarification on the $0.5 billion in orders in AI. Any way you can parse it out, like how many customers is reflected in that order number? And then just quickly clarify if that's all hyperscale or if there's any Tier 2 cloud or enterprise customers in that mix. Thanks for the question.\nChuck Robbins: Yes. Thank you. So on the service provider side, the first question you asked -- let me write my notes down, hold on a second, so I don't have to ask you for the question again. On SP, I think -- I'd say Q4 for the telco side of it, the communications service provider was probably fairly consistent with what it was the quarter before. It's just relatively weak right now. We see a lot of these customers have -- are digesting a lot of the infrastructure that they bought over the next few months. We think that -- our team believes that orders will stabilize on the telco side of the business in the second half of our fiscal year. On the cloud side, we believe that they'll continue to invest. And they kind of invest in six-month cycles. And we think that in the middle of our fiscal year, we'll see growth in that investment for the first part of 2025. On the $500 million, it is definitely in the Tier 1 hyperscalers. So I'll just leave it at that. On the opportunity that we see, we still see -- we won three use cases last quarter. And I would say those were primarily non-AI. So there's still -- we're still winning new use cases in the core infrastructure. And -- but we're in trials in different discussions with most all of them relative to AI fabric.\nJoseph Cardoso: Thanks, Chuck. Appreciate the color\nChuck Robbins: Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: All right. Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: David Vogt with UBS. You may go ahead.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thanks guys for squeezing me. I'm not going to belabor the point on orders, but I wanted to ask a question about AI order specifically in terms of your ability to ship to customers and where you are in trials. The reason why I ask is we've heard from a lot of companies in the industry that there's some supply chain considerations that are maybe causing commercial deployments and revenue rec may be pushed out to 2025. So I just want to get a sense for that 500 orders that you referenced in your prepared remarks, how does that flow through? And then along with that, in the guidance Scott provided for fiscal '24, how much, if any, is AI-related this year? And if not why? And when -- going back to my first point, when do we start to see it in your P&L?\nChuck Robbins: Yes. We do not -- Scott and I are both looking at each other. We don't know of any supply chain issues we have around our AI. It's our standard Ethernet portfolio based on the Silicon One ASIC, and we're delivering it today. So I don't think there's any supply chain issue for us on that front.\nScott Herren: We might be at a bit of a better position than some because it is our own ASICs. It is ours.\nChuck Robbins: On the FY '24 contribution of AI, I don't have that information on top of my head.\nScott Herren: Yes. Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you there.\nChuck Robbins: Go ahead.\nScott Herren: Here's what I'd say, here's the right way to think about it, David. Those orders -- what we see is, within the broader hyperscaler world, which is where a lot of these AI sales are going, they're obviously in digest mode. I think you've heard that from us and all of our peers or what they bought. We do see toward the end of this calendar year, so towards the midyear of our fiscal year, we see them beginning to place orders again for delivery of product that will happen in the second half. So while I don't want to get into parsing the guide down to that level of granularity, I think what you should expect is it to be something that we'd begin to see show up in the P&L late in the second half.\nChuck Robbins: Yes. What I was going to add, David, is I think until we evolve some of the -- get some of the Scheduled Fabric technologies built out, they're certainly running -- they're running some of these on traditional Ethernet, which is what we're deploying today. But as we get Scheduled Fabric out and these customers get more comfortable moving from InfiniBand to Ethernet, I think that's when we'll start to see the real impact of AI. And maybe it's late '24, but I would suspect into '25 for sure.\nDavid Vogt: Got it. And maybe just a quick follow-up. So Scott, were there orders from AI last quarter in the product order commentary? Are these basically new orders in this most recent fiscal quarter? Is that maybe the right way to think about it?\nScott Herren: Yes. Don't think of the $500 million as all coming in, in the last quarter. Those are orders to date that we know are going into AI infrastructure. That's not a Q4-specific comment.\nChuck Robbins: And by the way, a portion of that for sure is deployed. It's in and running.\nScott Herren: Yes.\nDavid Vogt: Got it. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, guys.\nMarilyn Mora: All right. Thanks, David. We have time for one last question.\nOperator: Thank you. Simon Leopold with Raymond James & Associates. You may go ahead, sir\nSimon Leopold: Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about what your assumptions are for your campus-related business, and I'm including both switching and wireless LAN. I assume that's roughly -- almost $15 billion of trailing four-quarter sales, somewhere in that ballpark. And I've seen market research saying that business declines, some saying it's growing. And Chuck, you highlighted that $1 billion renewal. Just trying to get my head around how material that is. What's built into the full year forecast for campus? Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: I'll make two comments and, Scott, I'll let you add to it. First of all, as we said, we think that as you see the Q2 calendar year share numbers come out, you'll continue to see us gain share in that space. And so we would expect to continue doing that. The renewal number that I threw out was close to $1 billion. And Scott, I'll just let you comment on how you want to break down or if you want to?\nScott Herren: Yes. No, I don't think there's a whole lot else to add. We're encouraged by what we're seeing in campus. It's one of the things that that we've said all along is as the supply -- the backlog begins to be delivered, you'll start to see more and more of those customer decisions that went to us actually show up in the numerator of those market share equation. That's exactly what you're seeing. So I think the concern over the several quarters while we had supply constraints that maybe impacted us more than some of our peers. You should see those unwind as we can now deliver that backlog. The $1 billion of renewal that Chuck -- roughly $1 billion of renewal that Chuck talked about, that is a subset of our fiscal '24 guide.\nChuck Robbins: Yes.\nMarilyn Mora: All right. So we'll go ahead and turn it over to you, Chuck, for some closing remarks.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Marilyn. First of all, I want to thank our teams and just say how proud I am of the work that's gone into the last couple of years to actually deliver the record results that we did. We're incredibly proud of the share gains that we expected to gain and we are. I'm proud of the team and the new innovation that's being delivered in areas like AI and security and across the portfolio in observability and core networking and SP routing, all of these areas, the teams are doing an amazing job. And our portfolio is very relevant to the customer priorities that we see around the world. I've never seen such consistency around the priorities in virtually every customer around the world. And our portfolio lines up nicely against the key things that our customers are trying to achieve. I'm also very proud of the team and Scott and the rest of the finance organization for what they've done. And we're very happy to provide clarity on our commitment to our shareholders with the operating leverage and the buybacks and our dividend as we look to the future. So thanks for joining us today.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Chuck, I'll go ahead and wrap this up. Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call, which will reflect our fiscal year 2024 first quarter results, will be on Wednesday, November 15th, 2023 at 1:30 P.M. Pacific Time, 4:30 P.M. Eastern Time. This concludes today's call. And of course, if you have any further questions, feel free to reach out to Cisco's Investor Relations group. And we thank you very much for joining today's call.\nOperator: Thank you for participating on today's conference call.

            "name": "Chuck Robbins",
            "content": "Thanks, Marilyn, and good afternoon, everyone. Fiscal '23 was a milestone year for Cisco. We delivered on our operational and financial goals while accelerating our transformation. We achieved record revenue and earnings per share in both the fourth quarter and the full year. We also generated strong margins, record operating cash flow and strong shareholder value, returning 10.6 billion via share repurchases and increasing cash dividends. In FY '23, we delivered nearly 57 billion in revenue, up 11% year-over-year, the highest revenue growth rate in over a decade. Overall, customer demand also remained solid. In Q4, we achieved over 30% total sequential product order growth. The second highest in 20 years with double-digit increases across all customer markets. As we look to build on this strong performance going forward, we remain focused on the following. First, growing market share in all key areas of our business. Second, driving innovation and extending our leadership by investing in significant new opportunities for growth in AI, cloud and security. Third, delivering long-term sustainable value creation for our stakeholders and fourth, transforming our business model by growing recurring revenue. Consistent with what we said last quarter, we expect to build on our record results delivering modest revenue growth in fiscal year '24, with the bottom line growing faster than the top line demonstrating operating leverage. Our outlook reflects good visibility and predictability, driven by healthy backlog, ARR and RPO. We remain deeply committed to building shareholder value and increasing returns to our investors. We will do this through a long-term commitment to greater operating leverage while increasing our annual share repurchases and growing our dividend. Now, let me share additional detail on the quarter and key growth opportunities ahead for Cisco. First, one of our greatest competitive advantages is our pace of innovation. This quarter, we announced new solutions spanning generative AI, hybrid work, security, full stack observability and sustainability. In addition, we remain focused on delivering a more unified and simpler experience for our customers. As I've stated in the past, we knew that as our backlog cleared, we would see corresponding market share gains. With the release of the calendar Q1 results, we gained over three percentage points of market share year-over-year in our three largest networking markets. Campus switching, wireless LAN and SP routing. We expect further share gains in these areas as market share numbers are released for calendar Q2. Second, the acceleration of AI will fundamentally change our world and create new growth drivers for us. While AI has been an important element in our products for several years, this quarter we announced new market leading AI technologies across our collaboration and security portfolios designed to boost productivity, enhance policy management and simplify tasks. We also launched new AI scale infrastructure innovation to allow our customers to process AI workloads more efficiently. Cisco's ASIC design and scalable fabric for AI position us very well to build out the infrastructure that Hyperscalers and others need to build AI/ML clusters. This is a huge opportunity for Cisco and we are laser focused on leading and winning in this space. As a result of our innovation in this area, we expect Ethernet will lead in connecting AI workloads over the next five years. To accelerate this transition, Cisco became a founding member of the Ultra Ethernet Consortium, an industry wide effort to drive open large scale Ethernet based fabrics for high performance networking. In June, we launched our next generation Silicon One switching ASICs to support large scale GPU clusters for AI and ML workloads. We are seeing early success in Hyperscale Ethernet AI fabric deployments. To-date, we have taken orders for over $0.5 billion for AI Ethernet fabrics. We are also piloting 800 gig capabilities for AI training fabrics. Overall, Cisco is committed to helping our customers navigate this transition in a trusted and responsible way to deliver on the full promise of this technology and we are well positioned to win. Next, security remains a top priority. Our AI driven security cloud platform has comprehensive capabilities across the network endpoint and the cloud, helping to simplify security management while increasing efficacy. Our new technologies like XDR, multi-cloud defense and cloud secure access, a secure service edge solution are seeing rapid early adoption. For example, Goldman Sachs has been one of our early adopters of our multi-cloud defense solution. In addition, we are working with Apple to incorporate Cisco's secure access solution into iOS and macOS. These innovations, combined with our recent acquisitions, show how we are extending our security portfolio with deep telemetry AI and identity threat capabilities. Given our installed base of 300,000 Cisco security customers, we believe we have the opportunity to accelerate revenue growth in security over the next few quarters. To summarize, we had a phenomenal year. Our fiscal year '23 and Q4 results demonstrate the strength of our business today and are a solid foundation for future growth. I also want to be very clear on our commitment to increasing shareholder returns through capital return, innovation and strong execution. Last quarter, we committed to operating leverage in Q4 and fiscal year '24 and our guidance today reflects this. Today, I want to confirm that this will be our long-term strategy beyond fiscal year '24. We will also drive a high degree of consistency into our stock repurchase program and will maintain the quarterly levels in the range that we have over the past few quarters. Finally, I want to take a moment to thank our teams who all played an important role in delivering these record full year results and their deep commitment to our -- to the success of our customers and partners. With our focus on innovation and our commitment to operational excellence, I have tremendous confidence in our ability to capitalize on the many opportunities ahead. I'll now turn it over to Scott. Thanks, Tim. So I'll provide some color, and Scott, maybe you can talk about the conversion of the orders. Look, first of all, we're obviously dealing in a world that has a lot of dynamics right now, but our teams executed incredibly well. As I've said on prior calls, with our sales organization, when you see transitions in sort of customer buying, if it's getting worse, what we see is that our teams will forecast a quarter and then by the end of the quarter, they would have dropped and/or missed. And then when it's beginning to stabilize and get better, they tend to actually exceed the forecast. And so what we saw in Q4 was they had their opening forecast. They nailed month one, they nailed month two, and they exceeded month three by several hundred million dollars. So it was one of those quarters that they actually over-performed what they thought they would do at the beginning of the quarter, which is a positive sign. But again, it's one quarter. We also had the largest quarter in our history of enterprise software agreements from an orders perspective. So we had a lot of big customers making big commitments, which was a positive thing. If you think about what was going on around the world, I'd say service provider just continued to be weak. Enterprise improved, commercial improved. US enterprise was basically flat. So that was better than we had been experiencing for sure, which is a good sign. Public sector remains steady. And verticals, we saw strength in financial services, transportation and energy. And we saw some good strength in countries like India and Saudi around the world. So it's one quarter, but if you compare it to the prior few quarters where the teams had opening forecast that they generally missed by the time we got to the end of the quarter, this was one where I'd say that it was much more stable as we went through the quarter. Scott, do you want to talk about the order conversion? Yes. If I could make one more comment, Tim. On the sequentials, we said given that the year-over-years are just sort of difficult to -- they don't really provide a clear view on what's going on. We've been talking about sequentials a fair amount. And I did say in my opening comments that sequentials from Q3 to Q4 were in excess of 30%. To put that in perspective, it's typically 18% to 20%. And from a customer segment perspective, enterprise was well above that, public sector was well above it. Commercial was pretty close to it and service provider was the low one. However, it was still above historical trends on a sequential basis. So just to try to give you as much color as we can. Let me make some just a couple of comments, and I'm going to hand it to Scott and let him answer probably both of these. On the capital allocation and the leverage comments, what I would say is that we've spent a lot of time talking to our shareholders over the last few months. And it's clearly important to our shareholders that we commit to and we deliver on operating leverage in our P&L, and we've been doing it, but we haven't committed to it for long term. So that's what we're basically doing today is saying that we are going to continue to commit to do -- to provide operating leverage in the P&L as we look to the future. And then on the buybacks, we had also increased -- there are two things we wanted to do was increase the amount as well as drive more consistency and predictability for our shareholders. And so the rate, as I said, that we've been running at like the last three quarters is sort of the target that we would be at on a quarterly basis as we go forward. Scott, do you want to add to that and then talk about the revenue guide? I think I remember that. Yes, Meta, thank you. So on the Ethernet underneath the AI GPU networks, it is Silicon One for sure. And I think for the next 12 months or so, I think we'll be doing trials. I think we'll have some opportunities, but there'll still be a lot of InfiniBand. And that's why we joined as a founding member of this Ultra Ethernet coalition so that we can up guide the standards and really deliver Scheduled Fabric, to your point, in a very effective way. So we think into FY '25 and beyond, this thing will begin to shift to more of an Ethernet-based infrastructure. On the Security front, yes, we've had some early traction. I mentioned Goldman in the multi-cloud defense, which is a great sign of confidence in that solution. If you look at our XDR platform, which, candidly, we just went GA with it right at the end of the quarter. And we already took a seven-figure order from a retailer in Europe. So that was positive. We took one of our largest security orders ever. We took an eight-figure security order from a Fortune 10 company in Q4. So there's some early green shoots, and the teams are executing. The early feedback and early commentary from analysts and customers, et cetera, is positive, but we've got to actually deliver on it. And hopefully, in the second half of this year, we'll see some real positive impact and then '25 for sure. Thanks, Michael. On the share gains in the enterprise networking space, which is what you're asking about, we expect Q2 will be equal to or maybe slightly above the incremental gains that we see when those numbers come out based on some estimates that we have done internally. I would say the thing that is really helping beyond being great products, but we have done a couple of things. Number one, we have begun to deliver on monitoring and then subsequent management of our Catalyst, the traditional Catalyst portfolio with the Meraki dashboard. And that's a real advantage for customers. It allows them to run a hybrid of the two portfolios. It allows them to have visibility from one dashboard to both sets of portfolios. And so that's been really well received. It has been a key driver in significant improvement in our renewal rates on the software side. And while I'm talking about it, I thought I would share one milestone with you. I've been asked for a few years, when do we think the software renewals in the enterprise networking space would be meaningful. And FY'24 is the first year, I think, it will be meaningful. So just to give you a perspective on it. We have we expect this year to renew enterprise networking software at close to $1 billion. So the transition that we've been going through for all these years is going to hopefully begin to start to pay solid benefits for us going forward. But that's what's going on in that portfolio. Scott, you want to talk about orders? Thank you. Yes. Thanks, Ittai. I'll give you a little color and then I'll let Scott comment again, too. A lot of this is -- we've made this transition to -- virtually our entire enterprise networking portfolio now is a subscription model. And so that contributes. And Scott can talk about the year-over-year contribution that we've seen. But I mean we have $35 billion in RPO. And I think it's an important thing because when you think about market share and some of the concerns that people have had, you have to remember that we put a reasonable amount of each order in our core networking portfolio on the enterprise side goes into RPO and doesn't get reported as revenue. It's ratable. So it's a headwind to market share. And the other thing that I would point out is that we had a record year at $50 billion -- almost $57 billion at a time where we were building RPO to $35 billion and we have the backlog that we have. So there, we've had a lot of solid customer demand. I'd say in Q4, we certainly saw a fair amount of the enterprise networking. As we ship those products, we saw that software come out of backlog as we've talked about and moved into RPO. We saw a lot of these enterprise agreements that we did with our customers in enterprise contributed to it as well. Those were reasonably large deals. And Scott, I'll let you comment anything -- any more you want to comment on? Thanks, Jim. That was a lot. Let me tell you a little bit of the history on the specialist model. I'll tell you what we're doing in the product portfolio, which allows us to clean up the specialist model a little bit and get them a little more focused. So historically, like -- let's use Security as an example. We've had these different products, and we've sold them all individually. And therefore you need to compete with those individual competitors. So you need subspecialists, you need specialists in every little area of security. And what we've been doing across the portfolio is moving to more of a platform approach. And so it makes it easier to sell. And in certain areas of our portfolio like collaboration and security, we've moved to a suite strategy. So we're now packaging up the Security portfolio in different suites, which allows for us to sort of optimize the security specialist or actually align them more effectively is probably the best way to say it. And so that's the work that's been going on. And I think as we continue to execute on this platform strategy, it certainly simplifies the selling cycle for some of these technologies and I think getting to the suites. We've seen it work in collab. This past quarter, we had very strong order growth in collaboration. We had positive order growth in Security as well. And so for collab to be showing positive order growth is really a byproduct of the suites and leading with calling as the lead part of the suite and then also a big focus on cloud contact center, which grew triple-digits last quarter from an orders perspective. So those are the things that we're trying to do. We're trying to get the portfolio put together in a way that makes it easier and requires fewer subspecialists in the field as we move forward. Scott? Yes. Well, Ben, welcome and thank you for the question. We have definitely seen traction in the space. Lots of discussions, lots of architectural discussions, lots of input from those customers on what they'd like to see in the next generation of silicon as an example. And the teams are off building that we just delivered in June. As I said earlier, the next-generation ASIC that actually is built for this, but there's going to be more and more purpose-built silicon over the next couple of years. And the teams are working on that. And those customers are having a great deal of input in how that silicon gets designed. And in some cases, it's unique to each one. And so that's the beauty of us having such an advanced silicon capability. It allows us, if we need to, to actually build unique silicon by customer because these opportunities are so large. In the last call, we talked about the fact that this would probably be 3 to 4 times the opportunity size of the original cloud build-out. And unfortunately for us, as it's been well documented, we missed the original cloud build-out. But I can say with every bit of confidence right now that as we go through this AI transition to Ethernet, we are super well positioned. We have incredible silicon that they have been using in other parts of their portfolio. We won three more use cases last quarter. We now are installed in 21 use cases across the top six of these providers. And we expect that, that momentum will just continue over the next few years. I do think that in the short term, InfiniBand is probably going to still be the preferred in most cases, but they are trialing. And we will, much like we already have, we'll get some opportunities to run Ethernet underneath season. And as we deliver Scheduled Fabric, it will become even more prevalent. Thanks, Ben Yes, Tal, thank you for that. And so on the 400 gig to 800 gig, I don't know that I've seen exact reports that you're talking about on the 400 gig. But our teams -- the volume of ports that we're shipping on 400 gig would imply that that's a -- I don't know, we've had a great deal of success and it's been growing quite significantly. So -- but we obviously had -- over the last few years, we've been rebuilding or actually building our presence in this space. So it wouldn't surprise me to see us as a low market share player, but we've certainly won our fair share. On the 800 gig, I think it's just a matter of we're engaged there. We're installed already. We've got trust with these customers. They've seen what we can do. And I think that we're just in the game at the right time as opposed to where we started. And so I think from now on, it just gives us an opportunity to be there from the beginning as opposed to trying to catch up. Yes. Thank you. So on the service provider side, the first question you asked -- let me write my notes down, hold on a second, so I don't have to ask you for the question again. On SP, I think -- I'd say Q4 for the telco side of it, the communications service provider was probably fairly consistent with what it was the quarter before. It's just relatively weak right now. We see a lot of these customers have -- are digesting a lot of the infrastructure that they bought over the next few months. We think that -- our team believes that orders will stabilize on the telco side of the business in the second half of our fiscal year. On the cloud side, we believe that they'll continue to invest. And they kind of invest in six-month cycles. And we think that in the middle of our fiscal year, we'll see growth in that investment for the first part of 2025. On the $500 million, it is definitely in the Tier 1 hyperscalers. So I'll just leave it at that. On the opportunity that we see, we still see -- we won three use cases last quarter. And I would say those were primarily non-AI. So there's still -- we're still winning new use cases in the core infrastructure. And -- but we're in trials in different discussions with most all of them relative to AI fabric. Thank you. Yes. We do not -- Scott and I are both looking at each other. We don't know of any supply chain issues we have around our AI. It's our standard Ethernet portfolio based on the Silicon One ASIC, and we're delivering it today. So I don't think there's any supply chain issue for us on that front. On the FY '24 contribution of AI, I don't have that information on top of my head. Go ahead. Yes. What I was going to add, David, is I think until we evolve some of the -- get some of the Scheduled Fabric technologies built out, they're certainly running -- they're running some of these on traditional Ethernet, which is what we're deploying today. But as we get Scheduled Fabric out and these customers get more comfortable moving from InfiniBand to Ethernet, I think that's when we'll start to see the real impact of AI. And maybe it's late '24, but I would suspect into '25 for sure. And by the way, a portion of that for sure is deployed. It's in and running. I'll make two comments and, Scott, I'll let you add to it. First of all, as we said, we think that as you see the Q2 calendar year share numbers come out, you'll continue to see us gain share in that space. And so we would expect to continue doing that. The renewal number that I threw out was close to $1 billion. And Scott, I'll just let you comment on how you want to break down or if you want to? Yes. Thanks, Marilyn. First of all, I want to thank our teams and just say how proud I am of the work that's gone into the last couple of years to actually deliver the record results that we did. We're incredibly proud of the share gains that we expected to gain and we are. I'm proud of the team and the new innovation that's being delivered in areas like AI and security and across the portfolio in observability and core networking and SP routing, all of these areas, the teams are doing an amazing job. And our portfolio is very relevant to the customer priorities that we see around the world. I've never seen such consistency around the priorities in virtually every customer around the world. And our portfolio lines up nicely against the key things that our customers are trying to achieve. I'm also very proud of the team and Scott and the rest of the finance organization for what they've done. And we're very happy to provide clarity on our commitment to our shareholders with the operating leverage and the buybacks and our dividend as we look to the future. So thanks for joining us today."

            "content": "Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter then cover the full fiscal year followed by our guidance. As Chuck said, we delivered another record quarter driven by focused execution, continued business transformation and the actions we took during the year to mitigate supply issues. We reported our strongest ever revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, earnings per share and operating cash flow in Q4. Total revenue was $15.2 billion, up 16% year-on-year at the high end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP net income was $4.7 billion, up 36%. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.14, up 37%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Looking at our Q4 revenue in more detail. Total product revenue was 11.7 billion, up 20%. Service revenue was 3.6 billion, up 4%. Within product revenue, Secure Agile Networks, our largest product category was very strong, up 33%. Switching revenue had double-digit growth with strength in both campus and data center switching driven by our Catalyst 9000 Nexus 9000 and Meraki offerings. Enterprise routing declined, driven primarily by Access, partially offset by strength in our Catalyst 8000 Series SD-WAN and IoT Routing. Wireless had double-digit growth driven by our Wi-Fi 6 products and Meraki wireless offerings. Internet for the Future was up 3%, driven by growth in our core routing products, including strong growth in our Cisco 8000 offering. We also saw double-digit growth in web scale. Collaboration was down 12%, driven by declines in collaboration devices and meetings partially offset by growth in cloud calling and cloud contact center. End-to-End security was flat with growth in our Zero Trust offerings offset by a decline in our network security offerings and optimized application experiences was up 15%, driven by growth across the portfolio, including double-digit growth in ThousandEyes and AppDynamics. We continue to make progress on the transformation of our business to more recurring revenue based offerings driven by higher levels of software and subscriptions. We saw solid performance in our ARR of 24.3 billion, which increased 5% with product ARR growth of 10%. Total software revenue accelerated to $4.6 billion, an increase of 17% with software subscription revenue up 20%. 85% of our software revenue was subscription based. Total subscription revenue was 6.6 billion, an increase of 13%. And RPO was 34.9 billion, up double-digits at 11%. Both product and service RPO had strong growth with product RPO up 12% and service RPO up 9%. Total short-term RPO grew to 17.9 billion. Total product orders were down 14% year-on-year, but grew sequentially by more than 30%. This was against a strong performance in the year ago quarter, where we delivered the second highest orders in absolute dollars in the history of the company. The aging of our backlog has continued to improve as the supply situation normalizes and as expected, increased customer deliveries reduced our year-end backlog to roughly double historical levels as we enter fiscal '24. Order cancellation rates remain below pre-pandemic levels, which reflects the true demand and criticality of our technologies to our customers. Total non-GAAP gross margin came in at 65.9%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range and up 260 basis points. Product gross margin was 65.5%, up 420 basis points. The increase was primarily driven by positive pricing and product mix, as we realized the benefits from the actions we took in the prior fiscal year. We also drove productivity improvements with lower freight and logistics component and other costs. Services gross margin was. 67.5%, down 150 basis points year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 35.4%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range and up 300 basis points. This improved leverage was driven by both our strong non-GAAP gross margin and ongoing cost management. Shifting to the balance sheet. We ended Q4 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of 26.1 billion. We had record operating cash flow for the quarter of 6 billion, up 62%, driven primarily by strong top line performance and the deferral of our Q4 federal tax payment. Consistent with our prior commentary, the IRS tax relief related to the California floods postponed our current year federal income tax payment until Q1 of our fiscal '24. Consequently, in Q1 of fiscal '24, our federal income tax related cash outflows will include an incremental 2.8 billion of payments for these prior quarters. This quarter, we returned 2.8 billion to shareholders comprised of 1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and 1.3 billion of share repurchases. Consistent with our capital allocation strategy that we outlined last quarter, we are committed to increasing shareholder returns through a greater operating leverage while increasing our annual share repurchases and growing our dividend. Turning to the full fiscal year, we delivered record results in revenue, net income earnings per share and operating cash flow. Revenue for the year was 57 billion up 11% and non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.89, up 16%, demonstrating again the operating leverage that we've been driving. In terms of our software metrics, total software revenue for the full year was up 12% at 17 billion, with the product portion up 14%. 84% of software revenue was subscription based, which is up two percentage points. Total subscription revenue was 24.6 billion, an increase of 10%. Total non-GAAP gross margin was 64.5%, down ten basis points. On the bottom line, non-GAAP net income was 16 billion, up 13%. We delivered record operating cash flow of 19.9 billion, up 50% compared to fiscal '22, driven primarily by strong results, linearity, collections and the federal tax deferral as noted previously. We returned 10.6 billion in value to our shareholders via cash dividends and stock repurchases. This is comprised of 6.3 billion in quarterly cash dividends and 4.3 billion of share repurchases. We increased our dividend for the 12th consecutive year in fiscal 2023, reinforcing our confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline during Q4. We closed the acquisitions of Lightspin Technologies, Smartlook and Armorblox. These investments are consistent with our strategy of complementing our internal innovation and R&D with targeted strategic M&A. To summarize, we had a very strong quarter and fiscal year with record results. We executed well delivering double-digit top line growth, profitability and cash flow. We continue to make progress on our business model shift to more recurring revenue while making strategic investments in innovation to capitalize on our significant growth opportunities. Turning now to our guidance. For fiscal Q1, our guidance is, we expect revenue to be in the range of 14.5 billion to 14.7 billion. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 65% to 66%. Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 34% to 35% and non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $1.02 to $1.04. For fiscal year '24, our guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of 57 billion to 58.2 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $4.01 to $4.08. In both our Q1 and full year guidance we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A. Yes. As we think about fiscal '24, we've got pretty good visibility driven by really the business model shift that we've talked about. So a couple of data points that I think you already have, Tim. One is current RPO of $17.9 billion. So total RPO approaching $35 billion, of which $17.9 billion is current, meaning it turns into revenue in the next 12 months. We ended the year as we expected with roughly double our normal backlog levels. But that excess backlog will work down in the first half of fiscal '24 with the majority of that being worked off in Q1, by the way. And we've got $24.3 billion of ARR that we get a chance to renew. Now obviously, some of that will already be captured in RPO, but there's opportunity that's not already captured in RPO as well. So we entered the year with round numbers, 40% of that top line pretty much already in hand between those three categories. So feel good about the way we've -- the way we see the year laying out. Yes, will do. And Amit I think you were one of those voices that talked about cap allocation consistency. At a higher level and also being consistent and what you've seen over the last three quarters is that share buyback has been very consistent at $1.25 billion -- right around $1.25 billion per quarter. We see that continuing into the future. That's $5 billion a year in share buybacks. The dividend right now runs round number $6.5 billion. So you add those two together, that's $11.5 billion of capital return to shareholders. It doesn't feel like it's in a bad place, but responding to the need to be both elevated and more consistent in share buybacks is what you're hearing. You've seen us do it already. The difference is we're verbalizing it in advance now, I guess. And on your revenue guide question, I think it's easy to get a little confused by the year-on-year growth rates when we've had the supply constraints that we've had over the last few years. I mean the reality is some of the revenue that we ended up posting this year, in fiscal '23, are orders that we took and customers wanted the product back in fiscal '22. We just couldn't get it out. We couldn't get it delivered because of the supply constraints. So the better way to think about this is what's been the compound annual growth rate from when we started building that backlog and the supply constraints set in, which was the end of our fiscal '21 through -- and I'll just pick the midpoint of our guide for fiscal '24. If you do the compound annual growth rate on revenue through that time, it's right around 5%, which is, as you know, in line with what we see as our opportunity longer term. So I think it's a little bit tough to track what's happening. We just rely on year-on-years because the year-on-years have just been so skewed by the supply chain. If you step back from it and look at endpoint to endpoint that growth rate feels pretty good. Trajectory of orders, yes. And, Michael, thanks for that question. What I'd say is, if you remember our commentary from the last call, we said there were kind of three things going on inside product orders. One was the lead times were normalizing, going from being fairly lengthy to going back to a normal level, which, of course, if the lead time yesterday was 30 weeks and today it's 10 weeks means you don't have to place another order for 20 weeks. Those are mostly normalized. They will finish being normalized certainly in the first half of fiscal '24. And so that effect will be dampened. The second is backlog. And as we were still sitting on excess backlog, and we still do, but we've obviously been working our way through that and delivering product to customers. As we get their backlog orders in their hands, they can complete that project and then place the order for the next project. And so that's also been a little bit of a headwind to bookings, and then it's whatever is happening in the macro would be the third factor. We think those first two will normalize in the first half of fiscal '24. Lead times will be normalized, certainly by the time we get to the end of the first half and much of the backlog -- the excess backlog will ship out during the first quarter of fiscal '24. So I think we'll have a clearer view, and I expect to see more normal ordering patterns. Of course, we don't guide orders, but I expect to see more normal ordering patterns in the second half of the year. Yes. You specifically asked about duration. There's not much change in duration overall, Ittai. So that's not it. Q4 typically is a quarter where we have more large multiyear transactions. We talk about enterprise agreements and whole portfolio agreements. And so you typically will see a little bit of a bump in Q4 driven by that and then a little bit of a -- I'm sorry, an RPO in Q4. And then in Q1, the typically -- the typical pattern would see it come down just slightly as we work our way through those. I think the other thing to just bear in mind, we've got net RPO growth this year of $3.3 billion, of which product had a net growth of $1.7 billion. If you looked at our current RPO when we began the year, it was about $16.8 billion, which means all of that came out of RPO. And yet on top of that -- yes, short-term. On top of that, we added $1.7 billion. So we added quite a bit of current year sales into that RPO balance. Back to Chuck's point, that's revenue that many of our competitors recognize immediately as they ship it. For us, we have the advantage of recognizing it over time, which makes us more predictable, and it gives us greater visibility into where things are headed. Yes. Matt, on your first question, I think gross margin settling, you saw our guide for Q1 of gross margins in the 65% to 66% range. And I think it settles in there for the full year. So you can do the math with what we've projected on the top line. That drops down to a mid-single-digit OpEx growth number, so in line with expectations certainly given the environment of merit increases. It doesn't provide a lot of incremental investment, but I think that's in sync with what you've seen us do over time. So the long-term model, look, that was opportunity-based. If you look backwards, what you've seen is we have delivered the bottom line growing faster than the top line. I think the only difference that you hear from us now is, as I said, we're articulating it in advance instead of once it's happened. That's really the way to think about that. On the cap return question, Jim, I'd just reiterate what I said earlier. With the consistency of buybacks now running right around $1.25 billion per quarter, so $5 billion a year, the dividend consumes another $6.5 billion. That's $11.5 billion of cap return that we're committed to. And I do expect to continue to, as you've seen us do for the last 12 years, make increases in our dividend payment as you look ahead. So that's one lens on it. I would say on the M&A and spin-off part of that, we're constantly evaluating that. We're constantly evaluating what's available in the order marketplace. You saw we closed three, albeit small kind of tech tuck-in, but three acquisitions during the quarter. The team's very active. We're constantly looking at that space as well as the value in our own portfolio. And so there's nothing new to report there, but those are constant things that we look at. Thanks, Ben. And Tal, to your question on the math you're trying to do on product revenue, I think some of this goes back to the answer that I gave Tim earlier. One of the things you have to consider is some of the product revenue we delivered this year was actually demand from the prior year, right? Demand from fiscal '22 that because of the supply constraints, we simply couldn't get out the door. Had that not been the case, you would have seen higher product revenue in fiscal '22 and slightly lower product revenue in fiscal '23. And you would have seen a steady increase then from '22 to '23 and '23 to '24. So the things that are driving that are the things that we've talked about, right? We continue to see good traction and market share gains in our enterprise networking products. We are invested early in the AI game and see a great opportunity there. We're getting early success, although it's -- you're not seeing a lot of it yet in the P&L, but we're seeing some pretty early success with our revamped security strategy and the great work that team has done. And so -- but instead of trying to do it the way you're doing it, the delivery has been lumpy, the demand has been less lumpy is probably the right way to think about it. We might be at a bit of a better position than some because it is our own ASICs. It is ours. Yes. Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you there. Here's what I'd say, here's the right way to think about it, David. Those orders -- what we see is, within the broader hyperscaler world, which is where a lot of these AI sales are going, they're obviously in digest mode. I think you've heard that from us and all of our peers or what they bought. We do see toward the end of this calendar year, so towards the midyear of our fiscal year, we see them beginning to place orders again for delivery of product that will happen in the second half. So while I don't want to get into parsing the guide down to that level of granularity, I think what you should expect is it to be something that we'd begin to see show up in the P&L late in the second half. Yes. Don't think of the $500 million as all coming in, in the last quarter. Those are orders to date that we know are going into AI infrastructure. That's not a Q4-specific comment. Yes. Yes. No, I don't think there's a whole lot else to add. We're encouraged by what we're seeing in campus. It's one of the things that that we've said all along is as the supply -- the backlog begins to be delivered, you'll start to see more and more of those customer decisions that went to us actually show up in the numerator of those market share equation. That's exactly what you're seeing. So I think the concern over the several quarters while we had supply constraints that maybe impacted us more than some of our peers. You should see those unwind as we can now deliver that backlog. The $1 billion of renewal that Chuck -- roughly $1 billion of renewal that Chuck talked about, that is a subset of our fiscal '24 guide."

If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.\nMarilyn Mora: Welcome everyone to Cisco's third quarter fiscal 2023 quarterly earnings conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations and I am joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO; and Scott Herren, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheet, cash flow statements and other financial information can be found in the Financial Information section of the Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and we will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the fourth quarter and full-year of fiscal 2023. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically, the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. With that, I will now turn it over to Chuck.\nChuck Robbins: Thank you, Marilyn, and hope you all are doing well. This was another strong quarter for us, and I am proud of what our teams have achieved. In Q3, we delivered our strongest ever revenue, non-GAAP income, non-GAAP EPS and operating cash flow. We also continued to successfully execute on our strategy, driving solid growth in ARR to nearly $24 billion and posting double-digit growth in subscription and software revenues. Based on our strong Q3 performance, we are once again raising our fiscal 2023 outlook for revenue and earnings per share, which Scott will cover shortly. As we look ahead to fiscal year 2024, we expect to see modest revenue growth, even with the tough compare of double-digit growth in fiscal year 2023. Now, before I go through our Q3 performance, I'd like to discuss three key areas that will help drive our long-term growth. First, we are pleased with continued success in our movement towards more subscriptions and recurring revenue. In Q3, we delivered 18% growth in software revenues. We also have $32 billion in remaining performance obligations, and we expect to see this momentum accelerate. Second, security continues to be an enormous opportunity for us. As you've heard me say, we've revamped our strategy, put a world-class team in place, and made this a top priority for the company. Over the coming quarters, you will see new innovations in this space, building on our strong Cisco Security Cloud strategy, including at Cisco Live next month. Based on the rapid progress we are making, we are optimistic about our opportunity in this fast-growing market. And third, generative AI and cloud. At Cisco, we already use predictive AI extensively across our portfolio. In addition, our core networking technology is already powering some of the leading AI models run by hyperscalers around the world. We have also moved rapidly to leverage generative AI capabilities in our own products, which you will hear more about in the next few weeks and beyond starting at Cisco Live. Now, let me discuss our quarterly performance. As I mentioned, in Q3, we delivered our highest ever quarterly revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share exceeding the high-end of our guidance range. We saw healthy margins and record non-GAAP net income, which reflect our strong operating discipline. All of this contributed to record operating cash flow in Q3. As we expected, the actions we took to mitigate supply constraints have continued to pay off. Price realization as a result of the actions we put in place last year helped offset inflationary pressures. Our disciplined cost management enabled us to continue to expand gross margins, as well as prioritize our strategic investments to drive long-term growth. As it relates to customer demand, it is being shaped by a few factors that we believe are impacting the entire industry. First, our increase in product shipments is often leading customers and partners to absorb these shipments prior to placing new orders; second, the significant reduction in product lead times reduces the need for extensive advanced ordering by our customers; and third, macroeconomic conditions. With this said, in our discussions with customers such as the ones we had at our most recent global Customer Advisory Board event earlier this month, they continue to invest in key technologies that are core to their overall strategies. As we previously shared, given the unprecedented demand for our technology during the pandemic, we believe sequential order rates are far more informative than year-over-year rates. Just like the prior two quarters, our sequentials in Q3 were in general alignment with historical ranges coming in 1 point below the historical range. In addition, our order cancellation rates also remain well below historical levels, indicating the strength of our backlog and portfolio. In terms of our backlog, we continue to expect that we will end the fiscal year with roughly double our normal product backlog. Now, let me share a bit more detail about some of our newest innovations. Regarding our webscale customers. They are currently consuming and implementing their prior significant technology investments. There remains a huge growth opportunity across all these customers enabled by our portfolio of hardware, software, silicon, and systems. We already see early design wins in AI infrastructure and continue to see other wins and competitive displacements leading to continued share gain in this space. In our networking business, we remain focused on building solutions that drive a higher return on investment and sustainability. In March, we introduced 800-gig capability to our Cisco 8000 platform with the industry's first 28.8 Terabit Line Card powered by Cisco's Silicon One ASICs and Pluggable Optics. This new platform can deliver up to 68% power savings and 83% space savings compared to 400-gig solutions, helping to reduce operational costs and carbon emissions as well as enabling the densification of networks to support use cases such as AI/ML and IoT. This continues to drive positive customer feedback and we are excited about this opportunity. To complement our own innovations, in Q3, we closed the acquisition of Valtix, which is aligned to our security cloud vision for providing protection across multi-cloud environments with a seamless experience. We also announced our intent to acquire two companies that further extend our capabilities in cloud, security and full-stack observability. Before I close, I also want to share once again how incredibly proud I am that for the third year in a row, we were ranked number one in the U.S. on Fortune magazine\u2019s 100 Best Companies to Work For and in 14 other countries around the world, we were also ranked as the number one Great Place to Work, reflecting Cisco's position as a premier destination for top talent worldwide. To summarize, our ability to navigate uncertainty was demonstrated by our record results. Our performance remains solid and reflects the strength of our strategy and the benefits from the investments we've made over the last several years. Our operational discipline and excellence in execution are driving record earnings, cash flow, and shareholder value. As we look towards Q4 and fiscal year 2024, I'd like to share a few observations. As I mentioned earlier, as of now, we see modest revenue growth in fiscal year 2024 on top of our strong performance in fiscal year 2023. You can also expect us to grow earnings per share at a higher rate than revenue in Q4 fiscal year 2023 and full-year fiscal year 2024 reflecting improving gross margins and strong expense management. Lastly, we expect to continue our stock buybacks at the higher levels you've seen over the last two quarters. I'd like to thank our teams for their focus and execution and our customers and partners for the trust they placed in us. As cloud, AI and security continue to scale, Cisco's long-established leadership in networking, and the breadth of our portfolio, give me the confidence in our ability to capture the many opportunities ahead. I'll now turn it over to Scott.\nScott Herren: Thanks, Chuck. We delivered a record quarter that exceeded both our top and bottom line expectations driven by focused execution, continued business transformation, and the actions we've taken over the last several quarters to mitigate supply issues. We reported our strongest ever revenue, non-GAAP income, non-GAAP earnings per share and operating cash flow for the quarter. Total revenue was $14.6 billion, up 14% year-on-year. Non-GAAP net income was $4.1 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share was a $1, up 15%. Looking at our Q3 revenue in more detail. Total product revenue was $11.1 billion, up 17%, and service revenue was $3.5 billion, up 3%. Within product revenue, Secure Agile Networks, our largest business was very strong, up 29%. Switching revenue had strong double-digit growth with strength in both campus and data center switching driven by our Catalyst 9000, Meraki and Nexus 9000 offerings. Enterprise routing growth was driven primarily by strength in our Catalyst 8000 Series routers, SD-WAN and IoT routing and wireless also had very strong double-digit growth with strength driven by our Wi-Fi 6 products and Meraki wireless offerings. Internet for the future was up 5% driven by growth in our core routing products, including very strong growth in our Cisco 8000 offering. We also saw double-digit growth in webscale. Collaboration was down 13%, driven by declines in collaboration devices and meetings, offset slightly by growth in calling and contact center. End-to-End security was up 2% driven by our unified threat management and zero trust offerings. An optimized application experiences was up 12%, driven by growth across the portfolio, including double-digit growth in ThousandEyes. We continue to make progress on our transformation metrics as we shift our business to more recurring revenue-based offerings, driven by higher levels of software and subscriptions. We saw solid performance of our ARR of $23.8 billion, which increased 6% with product ARR growth of 10%. Total software revenue was $4.3 billion, an increase of 18% with software subscription revenue up 17%. 82% of software revenues were subscription-based. We continue to have an elevated level of software orders in our product backlog. Total subscription revenue was $6.1 billion, an increase of 11%. RPO was $32.1 billion, up 6% with product RPO increasing 9% and service RPO increasing 4% and total short-term RPO grew to $16.9 billion. Total product orders were down 23%, driven by the three factors Chuck pointed out earlier. The aging of our backlog has improved significantly and we continue to have very low cancellation rates, reflecting the quality of our past orders and critical nature of our product portfolio. Total non-GAAP gross margin came in at 65.2% exceeding the high-end of our guidance range and down 10 basis points year-over-year. Product gross margin was 64.5%, up 240 basis points sequentially and up 40 basis points year-over-year. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by positive pricing and favorable product mix. This is partially offset by higher component and other costs. Services gross margin was 67.3%, down 160 basis points year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin was at the high-end of our guidance range at 33.9%, down 80 basis points year-over-year and up 140 basis points sequentially. Backlog for both our hardware and software products continues to significantly exceed historical levels. Due to an improving supply situation and our focused execution, we were able to accelerate shipments of our aged backlog to meet customer needs, which resulted in a decline in backlog level sequentially and year-over-year. We continue to expect to exit the year with roughly double our normal product backlog. And just a reminder, backlog is not included as part of our $32 billion in remaining performance obligations. Combined our significant product backlog and RPO continued to provide great visibility to our topline as we approach fiscal year 2024. Shifting to the balance sheet. We ended Q3 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $23.3 billion. We had record operating cash flow for the quarter of $5.2 billion, up 43% year-over-year, driven primarily by strong collections and the deferral of our Q3 federal tax payment due to the IRS tax relief related to the California floods earlier this year. The federal tax payment deferral had a positive impact of approximately 20 points of growth year-over-year on Q3 operating cash flow. This recent IRS relief postponed our remaining current year federal income tax payment deadlines until Q1 of our fiscal 2024. In line with our disciplined capital allocation strategy and commitment to return capital, we returned $2.9 billion to shareholders during the quarter, which was comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and $1.3 billion of share repurchases. We ended the quarter with $12.2 billion in remaining stock purchase authorization. Year-to-date, we've returned a total of $7.7 billion via cash dividends and share purchases. This reinforces our confidence and the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows. We continue to invest organically and inorganically on our innovation pipeline. During Q3, we announced and closed the acquisition of Valtix, which further strengthens our security portfolio. This investment is consistent with our strategy of complementing our internal innovation and R&D with targeted strategic M&A. To summarize, we had a strong quarter delivering record topline growth, non-GAAP profitability and cash flow. We continue to make progress on our business model shift to more recurring revenue while making strategic investments and innovation to capitalize on our significant growth opportunities. Turning now to our guidance. For fiscal Q4, our guidance is: we expect revenue growth to be in the range of 14% to 16%. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 64.5% to 65.5%, and our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 34% to 35%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from a $1.05 to $1.07. As Chuck mentioned, we are yet again raising our fiscal year guidance for fiscal 2023, which is as follows. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 10% to 10.5% year-on-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $3.80 to $3.82. In both our Q4 and full-year guidance, we are assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. Our guidance ranges reflect significant visibility driven by healthy backlog, ARR, RPO, and improving availability of supply. As Chuck mentioned earlier, as of now, we see modest revenue growth in fiscal 2024 on top of our strong performance in fiscal 2023. You can also expect us to deliver earnings per share at a higher growth rate than revenue in Q4 and in fiscal 2024, reflecting improving gross margins and strong expense management. And lastly, we expect to continue our stock buybacks at the higher level you've seen over the last two quarters. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn, so we can move into the Q&A.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Scott. Michelle, let's go ahead and tee up the queue for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may go ahead, sir.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess maybe if I can start with a clarification on the orders. I think, Chuck, I heard you say orders were sequentially 1 point below seasonality. But if you can clarify whether on a quarter-over-quarter basis, they were up or down, and I'm not sure if you gave a year-over-year. But maybe more broadly, as you think about your guide for next year as well, what are you assuming for orders in that? And I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Samik. As I said in the opening comments, there are three factors really that are affecting demand, first of all. As we ship more of our backlog, our customers are digesting what they've ordered. Secondly, as our lead times come down, which our lead times have come down 40% over the last two quarters on a weighted basis, so it really eliminates the need for customers to order significantly in advance as they had been and then obviously, the macro conditions. When I talk about sequentials, as I've said, the year-over-years are just so hard to figure out that we've said the real thing we're looking for relative to whether we're seeing a momentum shift in the business is, are the sequentials in line. And as I've said the last couple of quarters and this quarter as well, the sequentials were operating at or slightly below the low-end of our historical ranges. So I wouldn't say it's robust, but it's still within the range or slightly below. And as we look at Q4, we actually expect our sequentials to be in line with what we've seen historically. So our view based on what we see today is that we can still deliver positive growth in fiscal year 2024, even on top of the good growth year we had this year. I'll make one other point. If you go back to September 2021 when we had our analyst conference, we actually laid out long-term top line growth of 5% to 7%, long-term EPS growth of 5% to 7%. If you move to the end of fiscal 2024 based on what we see today, we will be in that range from a CAGR perspective on a revenue perspective, and we'll be above that range from an EPS perspective during that same time period.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay. Got it. And for my follow-up, I think I wanted to sort of touch on that expense control that you talked about and EPS growing faster than revenue. Is that sort of a change of thinking from the Analyst Day in terms of \u2013 I think at the Analyst Day, you were talking about sort of limited operating leverage and growing earnings more in line with revenue. It seems to be that outside of the gross margin, you're thinking about being a bit more disciplined and pulling back on expenses, but maybe confirm if that's sort of how you \u2013 if you are integrating that right. Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Yes. Samik, if you look at the last two years, we've actually grown EPS faster than revenue. And as we look to Q4 and then beyond, it's pretty clear that with the gross margin expansion and with our expense management that we are implementing, we can still fund the investment areas that we need to fund as well as actually deliver higher EPS growth rates than revenue, which is what a lot of our investors have been asking for. And so we believe that's quite feasible for us to do now. Scott, do you have any comments on that?\nScott Herren: No. I think you touched on the key points. We will continue to invest in growth. But we also \u2013 as you've seen in the last two years, you've seen us do this, grow the bottom line faster than the top line in fiscal 2022 and at the midpoint of our guide for fiscal 2023. And as we look ahead, it's a time to be prudent, and so we see that happening again in fiscal 2024.\nSamik Chatterjee: Yes. Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Simon Leopold with Raymond James. You may go ahead, sir.\nSimon Leopold: Thanks for taking the question. At the beginning of May, Cisco announced a Capital Business Acceleration Program as a part of Cisco Capital. This is a topic we haven't talked about much on recent calls. I'd just like a little bit better understanding as to what's the strategy, thought process and rationale for implementing that program? Thank you.\nScott Herren: Yes. Simon, thanks for the question. That's something that you've seen us do in the past. It's more a reflection of interest rates jumping up to 5%. Our customers needing to get their hands on technology to continue to advance their own strategies and us just putting our balance sheet to work a bit. It's not more complicated than that.\nSimon Leopold: And no real effect on your financial model, I assume then?\nScott Herren: No. Not in terms of profitability or in terms of the long-term impact that's going to have.\nSimon Leopold: Great. Thank you very much.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Simon. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. David Vogt with UBS. You may go ahead, sir.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thanks, guys, for taking my question. Maybe just more qualitative and maybe as a follow-up to Simon's question. Can you kind of give a little bit more color on what you saw, let's say, in March into April and what you're seeing today from a macro perspective? Because it certainly sounds like from our conversations with partners and other industry folks that March was a bit softer than people had anticipated, and it didn't improve in April. Just love to get your perspective there. And then I'll give you my follow-up real quick. So if I kind of take your comment about the three-year plan, it certainly would imply kind of revenue growth next year in kind of the 2%, 3% range and EPS in the 5% range. Is that kind of what you're trying to communicate from a back-of-the-envelope perspective next year given the macro headwinds? Thanks.\nChuck Robbins: I'm sorry, David, could you repeat that second part, the numbers you had there? I didn't catch them.\nDavid Vogt: Yes. If I just kind of take the back of the envelope math on your 5% to 7% three-year target, that would imply revenue growth next year in the 2% to 3% range and EPS maybe 5% to 6% range. Is that kind of what you're trying to message here? Just so we have a sense for how you're thinking about the macro. Thanks.\nChuck Robbins: All right, David. Thanks for the questions. So let me talk about the linearity that we saw in the quarter. It actually was very favorable from our perspective on the orders. While we clearly see that we're operating at the low-end of historical ranges on a sequential basis, we did not see it deteriorate from the beginning of the quarter to the end. In fact, it was \u2013 our linearity was slightly better than it normally is. And April was actually sort of in line with what we've seen, maybe even a titch better than the first two months. So we did not see that particular outcome. And again, what we're looking for is a change in underlying momentum. I'm not suggesting there's strong momentum. I'm just saying we're looking for a change. And the best way to do that is to really understand, do the sequentials continue to play out the way they're supposed to? And as of now, we see they are playing out very consistently and sort of the low-end of the range or slightly below. And then, Scott, do you want to take the FY 2024 number?\nScott Herren: Yes, sure. Just on the math you're trying to do, David, I think you're in the right ballpark. What I'd say, obviously, I don't want to get into being too precise on fiscal 2024 yet since it's only our Q3 call. But bear in mind, that's growth on fiscal 2024 on top of at the midpoint of our guide for fiscal 2023, 10.2% growth in fiscal 2023. The last time we had double-digit revenue growth for a full-year was back in 2012 in the bounce back of the \u2013 from the global financial crisis. So it's a very strong year this year, and we see a modest level of growth on top of that.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Helpful guys. Thanks a lot.\nChuck Robbins: Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Great. Thanks, David. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. George Notter with Jefferies. You may go ahead, sir.\nGeorge Notter: Hi, guys. Thanks very much. I guess I wanted to ask about the growth expectation for this year. I'm curious about your view. How much of that growth comes from price? How much comes from backlog consumption? What are the bigger factors driving that growth this year? Thanks.\nScott Herren: Yes. I guess where I'd start is the biggest factor driving the growth for this year is the huge amount of demand we've had from our customers that's been sitting in backlog as we've worked our way through some of the supply issues. If you ask what's driving the growth, it's that, it's end-user demand. When you start to peel back to the mechanics of how that got put together, a lot of it is our ability to \u2013 based on a lot of hard work actually from both the engineering team and the supply chain team to free up some of the component supply issues that we've had that's allowed us to work through some of the backlog. We're not finished. There's still supply constraints. We think we end the year. Just like we said last quarter, we end the year with still with roughly double what our normal backlog would be, but we've made great strides on that front. Price has been a positive for us. As we said earlier, there's a \u2013 as we work our way through the backlog, more of the orders that we received prior to those price actions that we took last year have been delivered now. And so we are seeing \u2013 you'll see this when we publish our Q, about one point of benefit from price.\nGeorge Notter: Okay. Thank you very much.\nMarilyn Mora: Let's go ahead and move to the next question, Michelle.\nOperator: Thank you. Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. I was wondering if you could just kind of speak to the trends you're seeing within enterprise commercial service provider. You noted kind of seeing some digestion on the webscale, but just wanted to kind of get a sense if there's any different trends that you're seeing within those customer types. And then maybe just as a follow-up question. Obviously, your customers have been going through cloud optimization efforts and kind of looking towards long-term architectures. Is there any changes kind of you distinguish from customers just on the outcomes or ways in which Cisco can kind of better help customers on that journey? Thanks.\nChuck Robbins: Yes. Thanks, Meta. So the trends by segment, I think if you think about the three factors that I described, one is customers needing to digest the shipments that we're shipping out. And secondly, as our lead times come down significantly, they don't need to order as far in advance. And if you think about who the customers are that have the most visibility and have done most of the advanced ordering, it's going to be large enterprises and service providers and webscale providers. And so from a segment perspective, I think the predominant issue we're seeing in the service provider space, which, by the way, contributed to 41% of the overall year-over-year decline, came from the SP space, which is less than 20% of our total revenue. So it had an outsized impact on our overall year-over-year decline. I would say in the enterprise, there's large enterprises that are dealing with the same issues and are facing \u2013 and are doing the same thing. They're digesting the equipment, and they're not needing to order as far ahead. We're also seeing the same things that you've heard from others. We're seeing elongated sales cycles. We're seeing more signatures required. But in general, we're getting the signatures, but they are taking a little longer. And then as it relates to the technology trends and what our customers are focused on, the good news for us is that if you think about every customer on the planet is basically has five key priorities that we actually align to. One is they're re-architecting for this multi-cloud world. They're trying to figure out hybrid work. They're rebuilding their entire application strategy and re-architecting their applications. They're rebuilding their cyber footprint because of all this distributed nature of what they're doing now, and they're focused on sustainability. And our technology plays across all of those very important areas, and we're working very hard with all of our customers in all of those spaces. And then the final one, I think, that's on everybody's mind is artificial intelligence or generative AI. And I would say in the webscale space, over the next five years, the market opportunity \u2013 well, the entire market opportunity for AI infrastructure is estimated to be at $8.5 billion by 2027, growing at about 40% CAGR from where it was. As I said in my opening comments, we're already installed as a networking infrastructure for some of these early AI models that the webscalers are running. If you think about where we were at the beginning of the webscale build-out a decade ago, I said many times on these calls that we were not prepared, and we got left out. And I would say this time for this AI infrastructure from a networking perspective, I believe we are better positioned than anybody else, and our teams have done a great job getting us into this position, and we see that as a massive opportunity.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks so much.\nMarilyn Mora: Great. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. You may go ahead, sir.\nSami Badri: All right. Thank you. My question is on any kind of dynamics with the hyperscalers or cloud providers that led to any kind of product pushouts or delays of shipments or any kind of receipts that took longer the delivery. Anything that was shifted? Do you guys see any kind of shifting of deliveries or request to ship deliveries in the quarter?\nChuck Robbins: No, we did not see any of that. In fact, we've been fulfilling all the request. There are certain projects that our teams have been working on that they have delayed, but those are around new orders, not around what's in the backlog. I think a lot of that is because there's so much focus now on building out the AI infrastructure for each of them, and so that's really what we see happening, and it's an area that we've had lots of design wins. We continue to get design wins, and it's an area where we believe that we'll continue to gain market share.\nSami Badri: Got it. Thank you. And then one follow-up on gross margins. You talked about the modest growth in 2024, and you also talked about EPS outpacing that. But maybe we could get an idea on gross margin trajectory. Should \u2013 is there something we should be thinking as far as a glide path or an expansion range?\nScott Herren: Yes, Sami, you see the midpoint of the guide we gave on gross margin for Q4. We've seen significant progress on gross margin through the year. I mean the product gross margin grew 240 basis points sequentially. That said, I think we're about to the point where we're lapping some of the benefits of the price increases. So there may be a little more room in gross margin sequentially. But if you look at the average for the year next year, of course, if you remember the first quarter of this year, we had a pretty significant impact in gross margin. So the average for the full-year will definitely go up, right, as we say, if we keep it this same glide path through fiscal 2024.\nSami Badri: Got it. Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: All right. Thanks, Sami. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead, sir.\nMatthew Niknam: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the questions. First, just a follow-up on the fiscal 2024. The modest growth, what sort of macro assumptions are you embedding into that preliminary outlook? And then just secondly, if I could just double click on security. If you can maybe talk about what's driving some of the softness or decelerating growth. I believe it was about 2% growth this past quarter and what you're anticipating in terms of maybe additional backlog release and whether that can maybe help some of those trends looking forward? Thanks.\nChuck Robbins: You want to take the first?\nScott Herren: Yes. If we start on fiscal 2024. I think there's a few things, Matt, to keep in mind before we start talking about macro. We're rolling into the year with a backlog that's roughly double what would be normal. And that's really just a function of kind of the continuing supply constraints that are definitely improving, and that's why you see some of the strength that we've shown in this quarter and in our guide for next quarter, but they're not done. I do see those normalizing sometime midyear. By the second half of the year, we should be through most of the backlog. The second is the absorption factor. We think that with the lead times normalizing and working through the backlog, the absorption factor also probably gets itself work through to next year by around midyear of next year. So \u2013 but when you roll into the year with $32 billion of RPO, which is where we are today, $17 billion of that being current with almost $24 billion of ARR, which drives a huge renewal opportunity for us next year and with backlog, it takes a lot of pressure off of what needs to happen from a macro standpoint.\nChuck Robbins: And then I'd say on the security front, I think I've been \u2013 we've talked about this on several calls, and we've hired new leadership team. The team is doing a phenomenal job. We had a big announcement recently at RSA where we launched an XDR platform that actually is one of the first that actually ingests data from our competitors and our partners across the industry. And at Cisco Live in a couple of weeks, we're going to make the next wave of announcements around some new innovation. And so I think we've acknowledged that we needed to get this \u2013 these new technologies out, and I think that they're coming out with unique differentiation to Cisco. And I think that's over the next \u2013 when you look out sort of the second half of next fiscal year, I think you'll see security really be accelerating into a growth driver for us.\nMatthew Niknam: Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: All right. Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Michael Ng, you may go ahead from Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Ng: Hey, good afternoon. Thank you very much for the question. I just have two. First, could you just talk a little bit about how you're thinking about inventory levels on the balance sheet going forward? And if you have any information you could share with us around purchase commitments as well? And then I have a quick follow-up.\nScott Herren: Sure, Michael. If you look at \u2013 you really have to look at the sum of those two collectively because purchase commitments are there, they're firm commitments that we've made to take on inventory. So the line between what's in purchase commitments and what's actually on our balance sheet is pretty great. When you add those two together and look back over the last three quarters, we've worked down about $3 billion worth of the combination of inventory on hand and the purchase commitment. So I think the team has done a really nice job balancing, ensuring we have supply to continue to work our way through the backlog, and at the same time, minimizing the risk that we have too much inventory.\nMichael Ng: Great. Excellent. Thanks for that. And then second, it was encouraging to hear about the expectation to return to a normal seasonality in sequential orders starting next quarter. I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit more texture around those expectations. Is the absorption of early product shipments that may have impacted the sequentials this quarter going to be largely done by next? Is it just the easier comps? Any thoughts there would be helpful? Thank you very much.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Michael. Well, when I said that Q4, we see normal sequentials from Q3, that just means they're in the range of the historical ranges that we've seen from high to low. So it's not like an anomaly. It's not going to be significantly higher or significantly lower based on what we see today. We think that the digestion issue and the lead time stuff, we're estimating right now that most of that stuff gets washed out by the middle of next fiscal year. So we think to really get back to where you see normalized sort of ordering patterns and normalized backlog, we think that's probably going to be the second half of fiscal 2024.\nMichael Ng: Thank you very much for the thoughts.\nMarilyn Mora: All right. Thanks, Michael. I believe we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. Amit Daryanani from Evercore. You may go ahead, sir.\nAmit Daryanani: Perfect. I\u2019m glad I sneaked in here. I guess I have two as well. Maybe first on the hyperscale side. Chuck, you talked about seeing gains on the AI infrastructure side. Can you sort of touch on where are you seeing these wins? Is it sort of data center switching or Silicon One or something else? And then are these sort of net new applications getting deployed are these displacements? Just any color there would be helpful.\nChuck Robbins: Yes. So on a specific hyperscaler situation, we've been winning and displacing or becoming a second vendor in existing architectures for the last couple of years. And then we're winning new franchises around. These AI networks, in many cases, are brand new, and we're actually winning some of them as well. And so as you think about AI, I think it's important to understand the underlying technology. And just quickly, today, what's largely used is something called InfiniBand. And we see that our \u2013 the webscalers are \u2013 they have a desire to move to Ethernet and then further to this new technology that we actually have out called Scheduled Fabric. And we support both Ethernet and Scheduled Fabric, and we think we're leading in this space. And it actually increases the \u2013 I'd say, makes these networks run more effectively and more efficiently. And so those are some of the reasons we're winning. But it's just \u2013 it's a very big opportunity over the next five, six, seven years.\nAmit Daryanani: Got it. And then if I could just maybe go back to this order discussion. I think everyone seems to be surprised on orders being down 22% despite the compares getting easier, and I get your sequential commentary fairly well. But perhaps you can just talk about \u2013 you compared that you get really easy for the next few quarters. So do you feel like the down 22% is the trough and the declines may still be there but they sort of ease up until you get to the back half? Or how do you think about the order trajectory over the next few quarters and maybe the magnitude of it?\nChuck Robbins: Yes, it's interesting. Back four, five, six quarters ago, I said we see this huge bookings and revenues running at a much lower level. And I said there will be an inflection point, where revenue will run much higher than bookings. But it's \u2013 so it's playing out exactly as we expected. Now there is the added dynamic of sort of the macro uncertainty that people are certainly concerned about. What we're looking for is to see, again, if there is a significant shift in momentum from one quarter to the next, which is one of the sequential thing we watch. We watched it for 20 years, and it really helps us see what's going on. And I think we're just going to have to \u2013 what we're telling you right now is based on what we see today. And when we look out at FY2024 and the commentary we made about showing positive growth on a high growth year that we're having this year, it's based on, as Scott said, on backlog, on RPO, and it's based on the visibility that our sales teams have right now and what their expectations are for orders over the next 12 months.\nScott Herren: Yes. Just to add a little bit of that, Amit, a little bit more to that. When you add up between what will be current RPO that will turn into revenue during fiscal 2024, plus the backlog normalizing, which will be a tailwind, plus the renewal opportunity of what's not in RPO today, but sitting in ARR today, round number is somewhere between 40% and 50% of that revenue for next year is contained in those three lines, right? It's either orders that are in-house and sitting in RPO or sitting in backlog or renewal opportunities that we have a chance to go out and renew this year. So when I said it takes a lot of pressure off of macro, it's a strong position to be in, rolling into next year with that much of it either already in-house or sitting as renewal opportunities for us.\nChuck Robbins: That's a really good data point, Scott. And I think if you go back eight or 10 years ago, in any given quarter, we would have to take orders for as much as 75% of our revenue in the quarter. And that's certainly not the case today, so that actually helps us as we try to model these \u2013 model out FY2024.\nAmit Daryanani: Perfect. Super helpful. Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: All right. Great. And Chuck, I'll turn it over to you.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Marilyn. In closing, I want to thank everybody for spending time with us today, first of all. I'm super proud of our results. I think our teams are executing very well. I'm proud of the record results that we had this quarter. I'm also really proud that we're seeing what we also said, which is the market share gains come through that we had talked about. We've been asked on several calls about market share. And in the reports that we expect to be coming out very soon, we have meaningful share gains that, I think, you'll see in campus switching, SD branch routing, wireless LAN, SP routing, some of our absolute biggest markets, which reflect the relevance of our technology to our customers right now. I'm really proud that looking at FY2024. We still see growth on a strong double-digit growth year and also growing earnings per share faster than we are revenue. And our teams are committed to delivering on our commitments, and we look forward to spending time with you 90 days from now. So thanks for being with us.\nMarilyn Mora: All right. Thanks, Chuck. And to close this out, Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call, which will reflect our fiscal year 2023 fourth quarter and fiscal 2023 results will be on Wednesday, August 16, 2023 at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time, 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time. This concludes today's call. If you have any further questions, feel free to reach out to the Cisco Investor Relations department, and we thank you very much for joining the call.\nOperator: And thank you for participating on today's conference call.

            "name": "Chuck Robbins",
            "content": "Thank you, Marilyn, and hope you all are doing well. This was another strong quarter for us, and I am proud of what our teams have achieved. In Q3, we delivered our strongest ever revenue, non-GAAP income, non-GAAP EPS and operating cash flow. We also continued to successfully execute on our strategy, driving solid growth in ARR to nearly $24 billion and posting double-digit growth in subscription and software revenues. Based on our strong Q3 performance, we are once again raising our fiscal 2023 outlook for revenue and earnings per share, which Scott will cover shortly. As we look ahead to fiscal year 2024, we expect to see modest revenue growth, even with the tough compare of double-digit growth in fiscal year 2023. Now, before I go through our Q3 performance, I'd like to discuss three key areas that will help drive our long-term growth. First, we are pleased with continued success in our movement towards more subscriptions and recurring revenue. In Q3, we delivered 18% growth in software revenues. We also have $32 billion in remaining performance obligations, and we expect to see this momentum accelerate. Second, security continues to be an enormous opportunity for us. As you've heard me say, we've revamped our strategy, put a world-class team in place, and made this a top priority for the company. Over the coming quarters, you will see new innovations in this space, building on our strong Cisco Security Cloud strategy, including at Cisco Live next month. Based on the rapid progress we are making, we are optimistic about our opportunity in this fast-growing market. And third, generative AI and cloud. At Cisco, we already use predictive AI extensively across our portfolio. In addition, our core networking technology is already powering some of the leading AI models run by hyperscalers around the world. We have also moved rapidly to leverage generative AI capabilities in our own products, which you will hear more about in the next few weeks and beyond starting at Cisco Live. Now, let me discuss our quarterly performance. As I mentioned, in Q3, we delivered our highest ever quarterly revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share exceeding the high-end of our guidance range. We saw healthy margins and record non-GAAP net income, which reflect our strong operating discipline. All of this contributed to record operating cash flow in Q3. As we expected, the actions we took to mitigate supply constraints have continued to pay off. Price realization as a result of the actions we put in place last year helped offset inflationary pressures. Our disciplined cost management enabled us to continue to expand gross margins, as well as prioritize our strategic investments to drive long-term growth. As it relates to customer demand, it is being shaped by a few factors that we believe are impacting the entire industry. First, our increase in product shipments is often leading customers and partners to absorb these shipments prior to placing new orders; second, the significant reduction in product lead times reduces the need for extensive advanced ordering by our customers; and third, macroeconomic conditions. With this said, in our discussions with customers such as the ones we had at our most recent global Customer Advisory Board event earlier this month, they continue to invest in key technologies that are core to their overall strategies. As we previously shared, given the unprecedented demand for our technology during the pandemic, we believe sequential order rates are far more informative than year-over-year rates. Just like the prior two quarters, our sequentials in Q3 were in general alignment with historical ranges coming in 1 point below the historical range. In addition, our order cancellation rates also remain well below historical levels, indicating the strength of our backlog and portfolio. In terms of our backlog, we continue to expect that we will end the fiscal year with roughly double our normal product backlog. Now, let me share a bit more detail about some of our newest innovations. Regarding our webscale customers. They are currently consuming and implementing their prior significant technology investments. There remains a huge growth opportunity across all these customers enabled by our portfolio of hardware, software, silicon, and systems. We already see early design wins in AI infrastructure and continue to see other wins and competitive displacements leading to continued share gain in this space. In our networking business, we remain focused on building solutions that drive a higher return on investment and sustainability. In March, we introduced 800-gig capability to our Cisco 8000 platform with the industry's first 28.8 Terabit Line Card powered by Cisco's Silicon One ASICs and Pluggable Optics. This new platform can deliver up to 68% power savings and 83% space savings compared to 400-gig solutions, helping to reduce operational costs and carbon emissions as well as enabling the densification of networks to support use cases such as AI/ML and IoT. This continues to drive positive customer feedback and we are excited about this opportunity. To complement our own innovations, in Q3, we closed the acquisition of Valtix, which is aligned to our security cloud vision for providing protection across multi-cloud environments with a seamless experience. We also announced our intent to acquire two companies that further extend our capabilities in cloud, security and full-stack observability. Before I close, I also want to share once again how incredibly proud I am that for the third year in a row, we were ranked number one in the U.S. on Fortune magazine's 100 Best Companies to Work For and in 14 other countries around the world, we were also ranked as the number one Great Place to Work, reflecting Cisco's position as a premier destination for top talent worldwide. To summarize, our ability to navigate uncertainty was demonstrated by our record results. Our performance remains solid and reflects the strength of our strategy and the benefits from the investments we've made over the last several years. Our operational discipline and excellence in execution are driving record earnings, cash flow, and shareholder value. As we look towards Q4 and fiscal year 2024, I'd like to share a few observations. As I mentioned earlier, as of now, we see modest revenue growth in fiscal year 2024 on top of our strong performance in fiscal year 2023. You can also expect us to grow earnings per share at a higher rate than revenue in Q4 fiscal year 2023 and full-year fiscal year 2024 reflecting improving gross margins and strong expense management. Lastly, we expect to continue our stock buybacks at the higher levels you've seen over the last two quarters. I'd like to thank our teams for their focus and execution and our customers and partners for the trust they placed in us. As cloud, AI and security continue to scale, Cisco's long-established leadership in networking, and the breadth of our portfolio, give me the confidence in our ability to capture the many opportunities ahead. I'll now turn it over to Scott. Thanks, Samik. As I said in the opening comments, there are three factors really that are affecting demand, first of all. As we ship more of our backlog, our customers are digesting what they've ordered. Secondly, as our lead times come down, which our lead times have come down 40% over the last two quarters on a weighted basis, so it really eliminates the need for customers to order significantly in advance as they had been and then obviously, the macro conditions. When I talk about sequentials, as I've said, the year-over-years are just so hard to figure out that we've said the real thing we're looking for relative to whether we're seeing a momentum shift in the business is, are the sequentials in line. And as I've said the last couple of quarters and this quarter as well, the sequentials were operating at or slightly below the low-end of our historical ranges. So I wouldn't say it's robust, but it's still within the range or slightly below. And as we look at Q4, we actually expect our sequentials to be in line with what we've seen historically. So our view based on what we see today is that we can still deliver positive growth in fiscal year 2024, even on top of the good growth year we had this year. I'll make one other point. If you go back to September 2021 when we had our analyst conference, we actually laid out long-term top line growth of 5% to 7%, long-term EPS growth of 5% to 7%. If you move to the end of fiscal 2024 based on what we see today, we will be in that range from a CAGR perspective on a revenue perspective, and we'll be above that range from an EPS perspective during that same time period. Yes. Samik, if you look at the last two years, we've actually grown EPS faster than revenue. And as we look to Q4 and then beyond, it's pretty clear that with the gross margin expansion and with our expense management that we are implementing, we can still fund the investment areas that we need to fund as well as actually deliver higher EPS growth rates than revenue, which is what a lot of our investors have been asking for. And so we believe that's quite feasible for us to do now. Scott, do you have any comments on that? Thanks. I'm sorry, David, could you repeat that second part, the numbers you had there? I didn't catch them. All right, David. Thanks for the questions. So let me talk about the linearity that we saw in the quarter. It actually was very favorable from our perspective on the orders. While we clearly see that we're operating at the low-end of historical ranges on a sequential basis, we did not see it deteriorate from the beginning of the quarter to the end. In fact, it was \u2013 our linearity was slightly better than it normally is. And April was actually sort of in line with what we've seen, maybe even a titch better than the first two months. So we did not see that particular outcome. And again, what we're looking for is a change in underlying momentum. I'm not suggesting there's strong momentum. I'm just saying we're looking for a change. And the best way to do that is to really understand, do the sequentials continue to play out the way they're supposed to? And as of now, we see they are playing out very consistently and sort of the low-end of the range or slightly below. And then, Scott, do you want to take the FY 2024 number? Thank you. Yes. Thanks, Meta. So the trends by segment, I think if you think about the three factors that I described, one is customers needing to digest the shipments that we're shipping out. And secondly, as our lead times come down significantly, they don't need to order as far in advance. And if you think about who the customers are that have the most visibility and have done most of the advanced ordering, it's going to be large enterprises and service providers and webscale providers. And so from a segment perspective, I think the predominant issue we're seeing in the service provider space, which, by the way, contributed to 41% of the overall year-over-year decline, came from the SP space, which is less than 20% of our total revenue. So it had an outsized impact on our overall year-over-year decline. I would say in the enterprise, there's large enterprises that are dealing with the same issues and are facing \u2013 and are doing the same thing. They're digesting the equipment, and they're not needing to order as far ahead. We're also seeing the same things that you've heard from others. We're seeing elongated sales cycles. We're seeing more signatures required. But in general, we're getting the signatures, but they are taking a little longer. And then as it relates to the technology trends and what our customers are focused on, the good news for us is that if you think about every customer on the planet is basically has five key priorities that we actually align to. One is they're re-architecting for this multi-cloud world. They're trying to figure out hybrid work. They're rebuilding their entire application strategy and re-architecting their applications. They're rebuilding their cyber footprint because of all this distributed nature of what they're doing now, and they're focused on sustainability. And our technology plays across all of those very important areas, and we're working very hard with all of our customers in all of those spaces. And then the final one, I think, that's on everybody's mind is artificial intelligence or generative AI. And I would say in the webscale space, over the next five years, the market opportunity \u2013 well, the entire market opportunity for AI infrastructure is estimated to be at $8.5 billion by 2027, growing at about 40% CAGR from where it was. As I said in my opening comments, we're already installed as a networking infrastructure for some of these early AI models that the webscalers are running. If you think about where we were at the beginning of the webscale build-out a decade ago, I said many times on these calls that we were not prepared, and we got left out. And I would say this time for this AI infrastructure from a networking perspective, I believe we are better positioned than anybody else, and our teams have done a great job getting us into this position, and we see that as a massive opportunity. No, we did not see any of that. In fact, we've been fulfilling all the request. There are certain projects that our teams have been working on that they have delayed, but those are around new orders, not around what's in the backlog. I think a lot of that is because there's so much focus now on building out the AI infrastructure for each of them, and so that's really what we see happening, and it's an area that we've had lots of design wins. We continue to get design wins, and it's an area where we believe that we'll continue to gain market share. You want to take the first? And then I'd say on the security front, I think I've been \u2013 we've talked about this on several calls, and we've hired new leadership team. The team is doing a phenomenal job. We had a big announcement recently at RSA where we launched an XDR platform that actually is one of the first that actually ingests data from our competitors and our partners across the industry. And at Cisco Live in a couple of weeks, we're going to make the next wave of announcements around some new innovation. And so I think we've acknowledged that we needed to get this \u2013 these new technologies out, and I think that they're coming out with unique differentiation to Cisco. And I think that's over the next \u2013 when you look out sort of the second half of next fiscal year, I think you'll see security really be accelerating into a growth driver for us. Thanks, Michael. Well, when I said that Q4, we see normal sequentials from Q3, that just means they're in the range of the historical ranges that we've seen from high to low. So it's not like an anomaly. It's not going to be significantly higher or significantly lower based on what we see today. We think that the digestion issue and the lead time stuff, we're estimating right now that most of that stuff gets washed out by the middle of next fiscal year. So we think to really get back to where you see normalized sort of ordering patterns and normalized backlog, we think that's probably going to be the second half of fiscal 2024. Yes. So on a specific hyperscaler situation, we've been winning and displacing or becoming a second vendor in existing architectures for the last couple of years. And then we're winning new franchises around. These AI networks, in many cases, are brand new, and we're actually winning some of them as well. And so as you think about AI, I think it's important to understand the underlying technology. And just quickly, today, what's largely used is something called InfiniBand. And we see that our \u2013 the webscalers are \u2013 they have a desire to move to Ethernet and then further to this new technology that we actually have out called Scheduled Fabric. And we support both Ethernet and Scheduled Fabric, and we think we're leading in this space. And it actually increases the \u2013 I'd say, makes these networks run more effectively and more efficiently. And so those are some of the reasons we're winning. But it's just \u2013 it's a very big opportunity over the next five, six, seven years. Yes, it's interesting. Back four, five, six quarters ago, I said we see this huge bookings and revenues running at a much lower level. And I said there will be an inflection point, where revenue will run much higher than bookings. But it's \u2013 so it's playing out exactly as we expected. Now there is the added dynamic of sort of the macro uncertainty that people are certainly concerned about. What we're looking for is to see, again, if there is a significant shift in momentum from one quarter to the next, which is one of the sequential thing we watch. We watched it for 20 years, and it really helps us see what's going on. And I think we're just going to have to \u2013 what we're telling you right now is based on what we see today. And when we look out at FY2024 and the commentary we made about showing positive growth on a high growth year that we're having this year, it's based on, as Scott said, on backlog, on RPO, and it's based on the visibility that our sales teams have right now and what their expectations are for orders over the next 12 months. That's a really good data point, Scott. And I think if you go back eight or 10 years ago, in any given quarter, we would have to take orders for as much as 75% of our revenue in the quarter. And that's certainly not the case today, so that actually helps us as we try to model these \u2013 model out FY2024. Thank you. Thanks, Marilyn. In closing, I want to thank everybody for spending time with us today, first of all. I'm super proud of our results. I think our teams are executing very well. I'm proud of the record results that we had this quarter. I'm also really proud that we're seeing what we also said, which is the market share gains come through that we had talked about. We've been asked on several calls about market share. And in the reports that we expect to be coming out very soon, we have meaningful share gains that, I think, you'll see in campus switching, SD branch routing, wireless LAN, SP routing, some of our absolute biggest markets, which reflect the relevance of our technology to our customers right now. I'm really proud that looking at FY2024. We still see growth on a strong double-digit growth year and also growing earnings per share faster than we are revenue. And our teams are committed to delivering on our commitments, and we look forward to spending time with you 90 days from now. So thanks for being with us."

            "content": "Thanks, Chuck. We delivered a record quarter that exceeded both our top and bottom line expectations driven by focused execution, continued business transformation, and the actions we've taken over the last several quarters to mitigate supply issues. We reported our strongest ever revenue, non-GAAP income, non-GAAP earnings per share and operating cash flow for the quarter. Total revenue was $14.6 billion, up 14% year-on-year. Non-GAAP net income was $4.1 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share was a $1, up 15%. Looking at our Q3 revenue in more detail. Total product revenue was $11.1 billion, up 17%, and service revenue was $3.5 billion, up 3%. Within product revenue, Secure Agile Networks, our largest business was very strong, up 29%. Switching revenue had strong double-digit growth with strength in both campus and data center switching driven by our Catalyst 9000, Meraki and Nexus 9000 offerings. Enterprise routing growth was driven primarily by strength in our Catalyst 8000 Series routers, SD-WAN and IoT routing and wireless also had very strong double-digit growth with strength driven by our Wi-Fi 6 products and Meraki wireless offerings. Internet for the future was up 5% driven by growth in our core routing products, including very strong growth in our Cisco 8000 offering. We also saw double-digit growth in webscale. Collaboration was down 13%, driven by declines in collaboration devices and meetings, offset slightly by growth in calling and contact center. End-to-End security was up 2% driven by our unified threat management and zero trust offerings. An optimized application experiences was up 12%, driven by growth across the portfolio, including double-digit growth in ThousandEyes. We continue to make progress on our transformation metrics as we shift our business to more recurring revenue-based offerings, driven by higher levels of software and subscriptions. We saw solid performance of our ARR of $23.8 billion, which increased 6% with product ARR growth of 10%. Total software revenue was $4.3 billion, an increase of 18% with software subscription revenue up 17%. 82% of software revenues were subscription-based. We continue to have an elevated level of software orders in our product backlog. Total subscription revenue was $6.1 billion, an increase of 11%. RPO was $32.1 billion, up 6% with product RPO increasing 9% and service RPO increasing 4% and total short-term RPO grew to $16.9 billion. Total product orders were down 23%, driven by the three factors Chuck pointed out earlier. The aging of our backlog has improved significantly and we continue to have very low cancellation rates, reflecting the quality of our past orders and critical nature of our product portfolio. Total non-GAAP gross margin came in at 65.2% exceeding the high-end of our guidance range and down 10 basis points year-over-year. Product gross margin was 64.5%, up 240 basis points sequentially and up 40 basis points year-over-year. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by positive pricing and favorable product mix. This is partially offset by higher component and other costs. Services gross margin was 67.3%, down 160 basis points year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin was at the high-end of our guidance range at 33.9%, down 80 basis points year-over-year and up 140 basis points sequentially. Backlog for both our hardware and software products continues to significantly exceed historical levels. Due to an improving supply situation and our focused execution, we were able to accelerate shipments of our aged backlog to meet customer needs, which resulted in a decline in backlog level sequentially and year-over-year. We continue to expect to exit the year with roughly double our normal product backlog. And just a reminder, backlog is not included as part of our $32 billion in remaining performance obligations. Combined our significant product backlog and RPO continued to provide great visibility to our topline as we approach fiscal year 2024. Shifting to the balance sheet. We ended Q3 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $23.3 billion. We had record operating cash flow for the quarter of $5.2 billion, up 43% year-over-year, driven primarily by strong collections and the deferral of our Q3 federal tax payment due to the IRS tax relief related to the California floods earlier this year. The federal tax payment deferral had a positive impact of approximately 20 points of growth year-over-year on Q3 operating cash flow. This recent IRS relief postponed our remaining current year federal income tax payment deadlines until Q1 of our fiscal 2024. In line with our disciplined capital allocation strategy and commitment to return capital, we returned $2.9 billion to shareholders during the quarter, which was comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and $1.3 billion of share repurchases. We ended the quarter with $12.2 billion in remaining stock purchase authorization. Year-to-date, we've returned a total of $7.7 billion via cash dividends and share purchases. This reinforces our confidence and the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows. We continue to invest organically and inorganically on our innovation pipeline. During Q3, we announced and closed the acquisition of Valtix, which further strengthens our security portfolio. This investment is consistent with our strategy of complementing our internal innovation and R&D with targeted strategic M&A. To summarize, we had a strong quarter delivering record topline growth, non-GAAP profitability and cash flow. We continue to make progress on our business model shift to more recurring revenue while making strategic investments and innovation to capitalize on our significant growth opportunities. Turning now to our guidance. For fiscal Q4, our guidance is: we expect revenue growth to be in the range of 14% to 16%. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 64.5% to 65.5%, and our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 34% to 35%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from a $1.05 to $1.07. As Chuck mentioned, we are yet again raising our fiscal year guidance for fiscal 2023, which is as follows. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 10% to 10.5% year-on-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $3.80 to $3.82. In both our Q4 and full-year guidance, we are assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. Our guidance ranges reflect significant visibility driven by healthy backlog, ARR, RPO, and improving availability of supply. As Chuck mentioned earlier, as of now, we see modest revenue growth in fiscal 2024 on top of our strong performance in fiscal 2023. You can also expect us to deliver earnings per share at a higher growth rate than revenue in Q4 and in fiscal 2024, reflecting improving gross margins and strong expense management. And lastly, we expect to continue our stock buybacks at the higher level you've seen over the last two quarters. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn, so we can move into the Q&A. No. I think you touched on the key points. We will continue to invest in growth. But we also \u2013 as you've seen in the last two years, you've seen us do this, grow the bottom line faster than the top line in fiscal 2022 and at the midpoint of our guide for fiscal 2023. And as we look ahead, it's a time to be prudent, and so we see that happening again in fiscal 2024. Yes. Simon, thanks for the question. That's something that you've seen us do in the past. It's more a reflection of interest rates jumping up to 5%. Our customers needing to get their hands on technology to continue to advance their own strategies and us just putting our balance sheet to work a bit. It's not more complicated than that. No. Not in terms of profitability or in terms of the long-term impact that's going to have. Yes, sure. Just on the math you're trying to do, David, I think you're in the right ballpark. What I'd say, obviously, I don't want to get into being too precise on fiscal 2024 yet since it's only our Q3 call. But bear in mind, that's growth on fiscal 2024 on top of at the midpoint of our guide for fiscal 2023, 10.2% growth in fiscal 2023. The last time we had double-digit revenue growth for a full-year was back in 2012 in the bounce back of the \u2013 from the global financial crisis. So it's a very strong year this year, and we see a modest level of growth on top of that. Yes. I guess where I'd start is the biggest factor driving the growth for this year is the huge amount of demand we've had from our customers that's been sitting in backlog as we've worked our way through some of the supply issues. If you ask what's driving the growth, it's that, it's end-user demand. When you start to peel back to the mechanics of how that got put together, a lot of it is our ability to \u2013 based on a lot of hard work actually from both the engineering team and the supply chain team to free up some of the component supply issues that we've had that's allowed us to work through some of the backlog. We're not finished. There's still supply constraints. We think we end the year. Just like we said last quarter, we end the year with still with roughly double what our normal backlog would be, but we've made great strides on that front. Price has been a positive for us. As we said earlier, there's a \u2013 as we work our way through the backlog, more of the orders that we received prior to those price actions that we took last year have been delivered now. And so we are seeing \u2013 you'll see this when we publish our Q, about one point of benefit from price. Yes, Sami, you see the midpoint of the guide we gave on gross margin for Q4. We've seen significant progress on gross margin through the year. I mean the product gross margin grew 240 basis points sequentially. That said, I think we're about to the point where we're lapping some of the benefits of the price increases. So there may be a little more room in gross margin sequentially. But if you look at the average for the year next year, of course, if you remember the first quarter of this year, we had a pretty significant impact in gross margin. So the average for the full-year will definitely go up, right, as we say, if we keep it this same glide path through fiscal 2024. Yes. If we start on fiscal 2024. I think there's a few things, Matt, to keep in mind before we start talking about macro. We're rolling into the year with a backlog that's roughly double what would be normal. And that's really just a function of kind of the continuing supply constraints that are definitely improving, and that's why you see some of the strength that we've shown in this quarter and in our guide for next quarter, but they're not done. I do see those normalizing sometime midyear. By the second half of the year, we should be through most of the backlog. The second is the absorption factor. We think that with the lead times normalizing and working through the backlog, the absorption factor also probably gets itself work through to next year by around midyear of next year. So \u2013 but when you roll into the year with $32 billion of RPO, which is where we are today, $17 billion of that being current with almost $24 billion of ARR, which drives a huge renewal opportunity for us next year and with backlog, it takes a lot of pressure off of what needs to happen from a macro standpoint. Sure, Michael. If you look at \u2013 you really have to look at the sum of those two collectively because purchase commitments are there, they're firm commitments that we've made to take on inventory. So the line between what's in purchase commitments and what's actually on our balance sheet is pretty great. When you add those two together and look back over the last three quarters, we've worked down about $3 billion worth of the combination of inventory on hand and the purchase commitment. So I think the team has done a really nice job balancing, ensuring we have supply to continue to work our way through the backlog, and at the same time, minimizing the risk that we have too much inventory. Yes. Just to add a little bit of that, Amit, a little bit more to that. When you add up between what will be current RPO that will turn into revenue during fiscal 2024, plus the backlog normalizing, which will be a tailwind, plus the renewal opportunity of what's not in RPO today, but sitting in ARR today, round number is somewhere between 40% and 50% of that revenue for next year is contained in those three lines, right? It's either orders that are in-house and sitting in RPO or sitting in backlog or renewal opportunities that we have a chance to go out and renew this year. So when I said it takes a lot of pressure off of macro, it's a strong position to be in, rolling into next year with that much of it either already in-house or sitting as renewal opportunities for us."

If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma\u2019am, you may begin.\nMarilyn Mora: Welcome everyone to Cisco\u2019s second quarter fiscal 2023 quarterly earnings conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations and I am joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO; and Scott Herren, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and we will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be done on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the third quarter and full year of fiscal 2023. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically, the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. I will now turn it over to Chuck.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Marilyn. I hope everyone is doing well. With the tremendous results we delivered in the first half of the year, fiscal \u201823 is shaping up to be very strong, fueled by demand for our cloud-driven networking portfolio, our continued business transformation success and an improving supply situation, thanks in large part to our team\u2019s aggressive actions. Before I dive into additional details on the quarter, I wanted to take a moment to say how incredibly proud I am of the team here at Cisco. While the environment we are operating in remains dynamic, Cisco is better positioned today than at any time since I became CEO almost 8 years ago. We have reshaped and transformed the company and our portfolio while remaining highly disciplined both financially and operationally. This gives me great confidence that we will continue to succeed in the long-term. Now I will touch on the quarter in more detail. Our Q2 financial results were strong as we again exceeded the high-end of our guidance ranges. We delivered our second highest quarterly revenue of $13.6 billion, up 7% and record non-GAAP EPS at $0.88. We also delivered solid ARR growth, sequential non-GAAP margin expansion and record non-GAAP net income. In terms of our business model shift, we continue to make great progress with 10% growth in software revenue and with software subscription revenue up 15%. Recurring revenue also now represents 44% of our total revenue. In addition, we have built up nearly $32 billion in remaining performance obligations and our backlog remains robust. Even as we drew down backlog by 6% sequentially, our total backlog still grew year-over-year. These metrics, along with our increasing visibility, led us to raise our full year outlook, which Scott will address in a moment. This quarter, we also achieved record operating cash flow, enabling today\u2019s dividend increase and the buyback of over $1 billion. We continue to deliver on our commitment to drive returns to our shareholders. Let me also provide an update on the supply situation. While components for a few product areas remain highly constrained, we did see an overall improvement. Combined with the aggressive actions our supply chain and engineering teams took to redesign hundreds of our products, we increased product deliveries and saw significant reductions in customer lead times. As our product deliveries increased, channel inventories also declined as our partners were able to complete customer projects. Like I shared last quarter, as supply constraints ease and lead times shorten, we expect orders would normalize from previously elevated levels as customers return to more typical buying patterns. As a result, sequential quarterly order growth is a better indicator than year-over-year growth. And in Q2, despite improving lead times, our quarter-over-quarter order growth was again in line with our historical ranges across most of our geographies and customer markets. With that, let me touch on what we are seeing with customer demand. In our customer markets, we experienced normal double-digit sequential growth in both our enterprise and commercial markets, while public sector performed better than we have seen historically. Within our service provider business, our order rate was below recent sequentials as some customers are absorbing the improved delivery of our products into their production environments. We saw another consecutive quarter of rapid adoption of our 400-gig Cisco 8000 and Silicon One platforms. This reflects the ongoing investments our customers are making in our innovative solutions and AI optimized infrastructure. Within web-scale, while we saw overall slowing due to normalizing product lead times, two of our largest customers grew their orders with us over 40% in the first half of fiscal \u201823. We continue to take share in this space. And over the past few years, we have grown web-scale cloud infrastructure from effectively zero into a multibillion dollar run-rate business. I am incredibly pleased about the overall progress we\u2019ve made as we are continuing to win more and more use cases within their infrastructure. We are also still at the beginning of what we believe to be a massive growth opportunity going forward. While we continue to closely monitor the global macroeconomic conditions, the overall demand environment remains steady and on par with Q1 and our pipeline and win rates remains stable. Looking at the broader landscape, digital transformation and hybrid cloud remain top areas of spend, which is fueling growth across our portfolio. Many customers have told me that while their spend levels maybe slowing in some areas technology remains essential as it is vital to their overall business resilience, competitive differentiation and success. In fact, Gartner and IDC\u2019s most recent surveys make it clear that technology budgets are growing as they forecast IT spend to increase in the mid to high single-digits in 2023. We are also seeing many customers moving ahead with their hybrid work, AI and ML investments while building the modern infrastructure they need to deliver on their objectives. IoT has also been accelerating. We saw record revenue growth in Q2 as customers look to connect their industrial systems in order to optimize power consumption, automation and efficiency. Lastly, cybersecurity and full stack observability remains strategic priorities where we continue to invest and innovate. From a product revenue perspective, we saw strong double-digit growth for Catalyst 9000, enterprise routing, Wireless, Meraki, DUO and ThousandEyes, reflecting the ongoing investments our customers are making to modernize their infrastructure to rapidly digitize and secure their organizations. We are increasing our investments in our cloud management platforms that deliver the simplicity our customers need. You will see us continue to bring AI and ML into those platforms to further simplify how networks are managed. For example, in Q2, we announced several new innovations across our cloud managed networking and security portfolios that offer greater visibility with AI-driven insights, enable secure connectivity, and give our customers the ability to simplify their IT operations. Last week, we introduced a preview our cloud-native full stack observability platform, the first network visibility solution to support open telemetry. This platform brings together our ThousandEyes and AppDynamics capabilities for unmatched data correlation and insights from the user to the application to the network. To simplify network security and policy management, our unified SASE solution, Cisco+ Secure Connect, now supports integration into Cisco SD-WAN fabrics using Viptela technology, as well as our existing Meraki SD-WAN fabric. We also introduced new flexible, more powerful and energy-efficient servers, which not only help lower cost, but also help our customers meet their sustainability goals, an increasingly critical area for most of our customers. To close, I am proud of what we achieved this quarter. We delivered a strong financial performance, innovated across our portfolio and continue to make great progress on our business transformation. In addition, the increased visibility we have from almost $32 billion in RPO, a healthy backlog and pipeline and improving supply give us the confidence to raise our full year outlook. We expect those same factors to continue into fiscal year \u201824, giving us conviction in our ability to deliver on our commitments. The modern, resilient and secure networks we are building serve as the backbone of our customers\u2019 technology strategy. Cisco is well-positioned to benefit from multiyear investment cycles with our market-leading hardware as well as our innovative software and services. Together, these allow our customers to digitize rapidly, secure their environments and achieve their sustainability goals, all while delivering differentiated experiences. Now, I will turn it over to Scott.\nScott Herren: Thanks, Chuck. We delivered another strong quarter and exceeded both our top and bottom line expectations driven by our focused execution, continued success of our business transformation and improved availability of supply as the actions our supply chain team have taken over the last several quarters are bearing fruit. Total revenue was $13.6 billion, up 7%. Non-GAAP net income was a record $3.6 billion, and non-GAAP earnings per share, also a record, was $0.88. Looking at our Q2 revenue in more detail, total product revenue was $10.2 billion, up 9%. Service revenue was $3.4 billion, up 2%. Within product revenue, secure Agile Networks performed very well, up 14%. Switching revenue grew in the double-digits with strength in campus switching driven by our Catalyst 9000 and Meraki offerings. While data center switching declined slightly, we saw strong growth in our Nexus 9000 offerings. Enterprise routing had double-digit growth driven primarily by strength in our Catalyst 8000 Series routers, SD-WAN and IoT routing. Wireless had very strong double-digit growth with strength across the entire portfolio. Internet for the Future was down 1%, driven by declines in optical and Edge. We saw growth in our Cisco 8000 offering and double-digit growth in web-scale. Collaboration was down 10%, driven by declines in meetings and collaboration devices, slightly offset by growth in contact center. End-to-end security was up 7% driven by our unified threat management and zero trust offerings. Optimized application experiences, was up 11%, driven by double-digit growth in our SaaS-based offering ThousandEyes. We made solid progress on our transformation metrics as we shift our business to more recurring revenue-based offerings, driven by higher levels of software and subscriptions. We saw strong performance in our ARR of $23.3 billion, which increased 6% with product ARR growth of 11%. Total software revenue was $4.2 billion, an increase of 10%, with software subscription revenue up 15%. 84% of the software revenue was subscription-based, which is up 4 percentage points, year-over-year. We continue to have $2 billion of software orders in our product backlog. Total subscription revenue was $6 billion, an increase of 9%. Total subscription revenue represented 44% of total revenue. And RPO was $31.8 billion, up 4%. Product RPO increased 7% and service RPO increased 2%, and total short-term RPO grew to $16.9 billion. While total product orders were down 22%, they compared against 34% growth in Q2 fiscal \u201822, which is one of the largest quarters for product orders in our history. We saw year-over-year declines across our geographies and customer markets. Sequentially, total product order growth was in line with our historical growth rates. Within our customer markets, we experienced double-digit sequential growth in both enterprise and commercial and public sector was better than we have seen historically. We continue to have very low order cancellation rates, which remain below pre-pandemic levels. Total non-GAAP gross margin came in at the high end of our guidance range at 63.9%, down 160 basis points and up 90 basis points sequentially. Product gross margin was 62.1% down 220 basis points year-over-year and up 110 basis points sequentially. Service gross margin was 69.1%, up 30 basis points. In our product gross margin, the year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by higher component and other costs. This was partially offset by our strong product mix and positive pricing as the benefits of the actions we took in the prior fiscal year flowed through as we shift our backlog. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at the high-end of our guidance range at 32.5%, down 180 basis year-over-year and up 70 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by the higher component and other costs that I just mentioned. Backlog for both our hardware and software products continue to far exceed historical levels. As we navigated a complex supply environment, we were able to drawdown total backlog by 6% sequentially, although it still grew year-over-year. Just a reminder, backlog is not included as part of our $31.8 billion in remaining performance obligations. Combined, our significant product backlog and RPO continued to provide great visibility to our top line. Shifting to the balance sheet, we ended Q2 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $22.1 billion. We had record operating cash flow for the quarter of $4.7 billion, up 93% year-over-year driven by strong collections and we deferred our Q2 federal tax payments due to the IRS tax relief related to the California floods. We expect to pay these federal taxes by the end of the fiscal year. We returned $2.8 billion to shareholders during the quarter, which was comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and $1.3 billion of share repurchases. We also ended the quarter with $13.4 billion in remaining stock repurchase authorization. Today, we announced that we are raising our quarterly dividend by $0.01 to $0.39 per share, which represents our 13th consecutive increase. This reinforces our commitment to returning a minimum of 50% of free cash flow to our shareholders annually and confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows. To summarize, we had a great quarter, delivering better-than-expected top and bottom line performance. We continue to make progress on our business model shift to more recurring revenue while making strategic investments in innovation to capitalize on our significant growth opportunities. Turning now to our guidance, our guidance ranges reflect our strong pipeline and significant visibility driven by healthy backlog, ARR, RPO and improving availability of supply as we continue to benefit from the actions our supply chain team have taken over the last several quarters. We expect those same factors will continue into fiscal 2024 giving us greater visibility and confidence in our longer term goals. For fiscal Q3, our guidance is: we expect revenue growth to be in the range of 11% to 13%; we anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 63.5% to 64.5%; our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 33% to 34%; and our non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.96 to $0.98. There is also a significant change to our full year fiscal \u201823 revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance driven by these same factors. For fiscal year \u201823, we are raising our expectations for revenue growth to be in the range of 9% to 10.5% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $3.73 to $3.78. In both our Q3 and full year guidance, we are assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. I will now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Scott. I am going to turn it over to Chuck just for a few comments before we start the Q&A.\nChuck Robbins: Yes. Before we get into Q&A, I just wanted to send our condolences to those impacted by the earthquake in Turkey and Syria. It\u2019s been absolutely devastating to watch as the death toll has climbed and we are working closely with our teams in the region to give them support and help on the ground as much as we can. We just want to let them know that we are all thinking about them and we are here to help.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Chuck. Michelle, let\u2019s go ahead and open up the queue for questions and answers.\nOperator: Thank you, Marilyn. Ittai Kidron, you may go ahead, with Oppenheimer & Company.\nIttai Kidron: Thanks guys and nice quarter, nice guide. I guess the big question is when you think about the outlook that you have for continued supply chain improvement, how long would the order backlog normalization process is going to take in your view? And maybe you can quantify in the quarter itself or perhaps on the guidance \u2013 when you look at the guidance, how much of that is coming from your ability to fulfill more versus the true underlying demand? I am just trying to gauge for how long you can kind of keep this going at above normal growth rates for yourself?\nChuck Robbins: Yes, Ittai, thanks for the question. And shockingly enough, that was the first question I expected. So let me just summarize sort of what we are seeing and then I can give you more detail. But number one, let\u2019s start with the fact that our demand is stable and that\u2019s first. Based on the sequentials that we saw, demand remained stable. And in fact, if you look out at our Q3 forecast, which we normally wouldn\u2019t give you, the current forecast in Q3 is also in line with historical ranges of sequentials. So that\u2019s the first piece. The second thing is, as Scott said, while we \u2013 backlog came down 6% sequentially. It was up year-over-year, and we expect that we will end the fiscal year even with the guidance we gave you today with a backlog that\u2019s roughly double what we would normally end the year with. The other thing to take into consideration is the business transformation with 44% of our revenue now recurring really helps a great deal. And we have $23 billion of ARR, which we can actually renew in the next 12 months. So if you go back 8 or 9 years ago, we might have had to take orders for 75% of our revenue in any given quarter. And now we have 44% of our revenue coming from the balance sheet and recurring revenue. So all that said, we actually believe that we will still be able to deliver. We\u2019re confident that we will deliver positive growth in fiscal \u201824, obviously, with pretty significant comps based on the guidance that we gave today.\nIttai Kidron: Okay. I guess when I think normal, given your historical ranges before the pandemic, I always think about 4 to 6 is kind of the range plus/minus that you run at. Is it fair to say that from here on anything above is kind of order \u2013 eating into backlog? And while your backlog is double, that can still mean that you can run above normal ranges for at least a couple of years, it sounds like, unless something unusual happens. Am I misinterpreting your comments?\nChuck Robbins: Scott, do you want to take that?\nScott Herren: No, not at all, Ittai. But what I would say is it\u2019s obviously too early for us to guide fiscal \u201824. What we wanted to give you confidence is we have better visibility than we\u2019ve ever had in the past, both from the backlog and the $17 billion \u2013 almost $17 billion of RPO that\u2019s current, that\u2019s going to turn into revenue in the next 12 months in the ARR. But \u2013 and we\u2019re going to roll in backlog that\u2019s roughly double what it normally would be at the end of the year. So we have good confidence in where we\u2019re headed in fiscal \u201824. I think it\u2019s a bit too early given where we are in the year just at the end of our second quarter for us to be a little more precise on that.\nIttai Kidron: Okay. Appreciate. Good luck. Thanks.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks.\nMarilyn Mora: Thank you, Ittai. Next question, please.\nOperator: Amit Daryanani from Evercore, you may go ahead, sir.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks. Congrats on a really good quarter for mine as well. I guess maybe if I think about the secure agile networking segment growing at 14%, that\u2019s really notable. And I don\u2019t think the industry is growing nearly close to that pace. So I\u2019d love to understand, I mean, do you think you\u2019re starting to see some share gains come back to with Cisco, especially the supply chain start to improve? Is that a tailwind that you see and perhaps that continues for the rest of the year? Maybe you could just talk about that and also maybe talk about how campus did within that segment? That would be helpful.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Amit. Let me take the share question because I think I\u2019ve said on several calls that, obviously, market share is reflective of revenue and with our backlog that as we began to ship certain products that we would be a gainer of market share, and we certainly expect that when these numbers are digested and the new reports come out for Q4, that you\u2019ll see that to be the case. One example is, during last quarter, our wireless revenue was up 57% year-over-year. And I suspect that, that\u2019s going to be a share gainer. And the other thing to keep in mind is that market share is inexact. I would tell you that when we ship products into the web scale infrastructure space, as an example, it goes into our routing reports and many of our competitors put it in data center switching. So it\u2019s very difficult in some cases to get complete apples-to-apples, but I do believe that as we continue to ship our backlog that we will be gaining share. Do you want to talk a little bit about the campus switching?\nScott Herren: Yes. Sorry, I missed that part of the question.\nChuck Robbins: Amit, can you repeat your question about the campus switching, the second part?\nAmit Daryanani: Yes. No I was just wondering, like within this context of 14% growth that you saw in that segment, how is campus performing for you very specifically? And how is the supply chain kind of alleviated over that view?\nScott Herren: Yes. Campus is doing well for us. And the supply chain \u2013 while I don\u2019t want to leave the perception that supply chain just got better. Our supply chain team and our product engineering teams have worked pretty relentlessly over the last several quarters with product redesign, with qualifying alternative components, with working with our suppliers to get to their subcomponents to make sure we could free this up so that the increase in supply that\u2019s leading to some of the share gains that we\u2019re talking about is the result of a lot of hard work by a lot of people inside the company. And I think, frankly, it puts us in a better position than many of our peers in the industry right now from a supply chain standpoint. But \u2013 the longer answer. The short answer is, yes, we\u2019re doing quite well in that space. And as we continue to deliver what we\u2019ve just laid out as our guidance for the second half of this year, I think you\u2019ll continue to see share gain grow for us.\nAmit Daryanani: Got it. That\u2019s really helpful. And I can just ask you really quick on your back half guidance is obviously fairly impressive. But in April quarter, you\u2019re sort of implying gross margins will be down 130 basis points year-over-year, I think, for the April quarter. Can you just talk about how much of a downtick you think is cyclical, things like the supply chain and logistics and so on versus structural? And what do you think normalized gross margin could look like for the company if supply chain is truly normalized? Thank you.\nScott Herren: Yes. The midpoint of the guide for the April quarter is about a 10 basis point improvement from the quarter we just announced. So we do see gross margins improving, and it\u2019s largely driven by \u2013 it\u2019s less driven by cost. We\u2019re seeing some reduction in costs around logistics, in particular, but component costs are kind of staying where they are in most cases. It\u2019s more driven by the fact that as we ship the backlog more and more of what we ship, reflects the price increases that we put in place last year. So I think you\u2019ll see gross margins potentially continue to expand from where they are, maybe as much as 50 basis points in Q4.\nAmit Daryanani: Perfect. Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Great. Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Paul Silverstein with Cowen, you may go ahead, sir.\nPaul Silverstein: Thanks. Chuck and Scott, I appreciate that you all addressed in your prepared remarks the visibility demand trend issue. But \u2013 so my apologies, but I\u2019d ask you to revisit, especially in your enterprise business, including government and U.S. federal, I\u2019m sure you and your team are aware of what your competitors have served. I know, Chuck, you just addressed the market share issue. But can you give a bit more color in terms of validity of the demand trends and the visibility that\u2019s translating into.\nChuck Robbins: Well, as I said, the \u2013 our enterprise and commercial business, which is reflective of how most of our peers represent enterprise, that was up double digits sequentially, which is in line with our historical. And public sector actually performed better than \u2013 it was above our historical ranges during the quarter. So the other thing I would point out is that our quarter itself from a linearity perspective was quite normal, and we actually had a \u2013 we\u2019re unique in that we had the January month in our Q2. And one of the questions that we had was what\u2019s going to happen to budget as we enter into calendar \u201823. And we clearly \u2013 we actually finished stronger than we started the quarter. So those are just a few data points for you. And I think if you look at what our customers are focused on right now, I mean think about some of their top products. They have got a complete rearchitecture of their applications to be cloud native running in both public and/or private clouds. They are having to rearchitect their infrastructure to actually deal with the changing traffic patterns that multi-cloud brings to them. They are dealing with hybrid work and how do I transform our IT infrastructure for that. They are dealing with cybersecurity threats on a massive scale, and they are also all focused on sustainability, which is leading to our IoT business growing significantly as we connect industrial systems for our customers. So if you think about those big five trends, we\u2019re actually in the middle of those with all of our customers. So we feel good about where we are. And the last thing I\u2019ll say is that I was in Tokyo and Singapore last week and at the same time, A lot of our \u2013 my leadership team were in Amsterdam for Cisco Live Europe, and no one is talking about cutting technology spending right now. Everybody seems very committed to it. I think the underlying power of technology as it relates to all of our organization strategy is just too strong right now.\nPaul Silverstein: Right. And Scott, back on the margin question. I appreciate you got to walk before you run, but you\u2019re now 3 percentage points roughly below peak on both gross and operating in terms of the initial recovery, any thoughts for how much of the 3 percentage points? Can you visually get back to 67 gross? Can you get back to 35 operating and it\u2019s just a function of time or because of the price increases with respect to semis or other things, that\u2019s just a bridge too far?\nScott Herren: Yes. I mean as you talk long-term, there is a number of tailwinds that will come into gross margin, so not necessarily talking about our guide for fiscal \u201823, but longer term, there are several things that are going to be a tailwind there. One is continuing to work our way through the backlog and reflect the price increases. I think we will continue to see leverage and logistics costs, both from a reduction in the freight cost per kilo but also in the mix of how we shift between what has supply airfreight and what will go in the ocean. So I think we will see some leverage there as well. I don\u2019t see a lot of our component providers outside of commodity areas like memory lining up to reduce cost to us, right? So I think it will be the combination of mix that will be beneficial to us and some cost leverage in the non-component areas that will drive that north.\nPaul Silverstein: So you think you can get back to 67, 35?\nScott Herren: Yes. So are you asking me for a 5-year forecast on gross margin, Paul, is that where you\u2019re going?\nPaul Silverstein: Yes, long-term. Long-term, can you get back to that model?\nScott Herren: Long-term, there is definitely leverage to push it back to where it\u2019s been historically, for sure, and if not beyond.\nPaul Silverstein: Thanks, Scott.\nScott Herren: Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Paul. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley, you may go ahead.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. I\u2019m assuming as you\u2019re having conversations with customers, they are looking for more flexible subscription methods and part of your subscription transition has kind of been evolving kind of the ELA model or kind of the subscription model you guys have had. And I just wanted to get a sense of where you think you are on some of the kind of subscriptionization of some of your products and whether you are seeing a big impact to that right now and then just maybe just some commentary about how you see the M&A environment currently? Thanks.\nChuck Robbins: Meta, thank you. So we are probably, I\u2019d say, still in the early innings of transitioning the traditional portfolio to subscription models. The team is working hard on that right now. And we will just continue to keep you updated. But I think we\u2019re several quarters away from really having anything to speak about relative to the size of that business, but we\u2019re working hard on being able to deliver that. And the key is to give customers flexibility. That\u2019s what \u2013 over the last 7 years or so, we have disaggregated hardware and software and silicon. We virtualized software to run on x86 appliances. So we want to give our customers whatever kinds of flexibility that they would like. So that\u2019s the first part. On the M&A side, I would say our strategy, as you would expect, has not changed. I think the market dynamics have changed, and I think that the longer valuations remain somewhat muted from their peaks. I think some of the companies are probably coming to more of a real position on what \u2013 how long these valuations may exist and were prior valuations even realistic in the first place. So we continue to stay aware of what\u2019s going on. We continue to scan the marketplace, but our strategy remains the same.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Meta. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Simon Leopold with Raymond James, you may go ahead, sir.\nSimon Leopold: Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if we could talk a little bit about the trends you\u2019re seeing in data centers. In the prepared remarks, I think you mentioned Campus was good, but data center was weak. And I guess maybe I\u2019m looking for not just the switching part of it, but your UCS business. And what are the broader trends? How much of that is reflective of hyperscale slowing versus the broader market, just trying to unpack that a bit? Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Yes, I\u2019ll make a couple of comments, and Scott, I don\u2019t know if you want to give any detail. But I would say that our customers are increasingly balanced around how they are thinking about private cloud versus public cloud. And so we\u2019ve seen continued focus on revitalizing the private data center infrastructure. And I\u2019ll let Scott speak to \u2013 I\u2019m not sure on the infrastructure side or UCS, if you want to share that. But the other thing I would point out, Simon, as I said in my comments earlier about market share, everything that we sell in the infrastructure within web scale flows into our routing market share numbers and our routing business. So it doesn\u2019t actually boost our data center switching the way we report it. So it\u2019s a little bit of an apples-and-oranges issue. I just want to make sure you understood that.\nScott Herren: No, that\u2019s a really good point. And on UCS, if that\u2019s the root of your question, Simon, we are seeing nice growth in UCS as well. And at least based on our calculations, we feel like we\u2019re gaining share there as well.\nSimon Leopold: Thanks. And then just maybe a quick follow-up, I was a little bit surprised that the metric of hardware attached software in backlog is $2 billion, same as it was in the prior quarter. I would have guessed it would have come down with the basically improvement of shipping the hard \u2013 associated hardware. So maybe I don\u2019t understand that value or you could talk a little bit to why that $2 billion didn\u2019t come down with the extra shipments of the related hardware? Thanks.\nScott Herren: It\u2019s a great question, Simon. And we actually did see \u2013 if you noticed, our overall software revenue grew 10% this quarter, so back to double-digit growth. And some of that growth is on the back of shipping some of the backlog out, both the hardware and the software that\u2019s had in backlog. So we are seeing the benefit of shipping that out. At the same time, as Chuck said earlier, demand remains steady. And so our overall backlog, while it came down only about 6% sequentially, there is still a significant amount of software stock in that backlog, some of it attached to hardware.\nSimon Leopold: And software as a total percent of revenue or product revenue, that metric, where is that now?\nScott Herren: Yes. Just for software, it\u2019s in the 30% range. Overall, we\u2019re in the 44% range.\nSimon Leopold: Thank you very much.\nMarilyn Mora: Alright. Thanks, Simon. Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Sami Badri from Credit Suisse, you may go ahead, sir.\nSami Badri: Hi, thank you. I had one quick one and a follow-up. The first one is on just the data center switching redesign. You guys made several mentions regarding supply and the team kind of working hard to get redesign through. But does that actually mean the data center switching portfolio is now completed with redesign and that part really did drive the better revenue guidance for the year? So that\u2019s my first question. The other one is we\u2019ve seen several companies report elongated lead times for sales cycles and extra signatures and all these other elements. And I appreciate, Chuck, you did hit on the fact that you aren\u2019t seeing any kind of tech spend get cut. But are you seeing some kind of resistance or slowdown as far as sales cycles impacting the speed at which you guys have historically done business. And I take into account also I appreciate your comment regarding linearity. But I just wanted to kind of ask this question to get it through.\nChuck Robbins: Let me take the second one first, and then Scott, you can talk about the data center switching redesign. We absolutely are seeing some elongated sales cycles. What our teams have told me is that, in many cases, there are extra signatures required. We just seem to, in general, be getting them. It just takes a little bit longer. So \u2013 but look, it\u2019s a complex world right now. But if you look back at historical sort of what we would consider a bit of a crisis or a complex world environment, I\u2019ve experienced demand falling off a cliff, and we obviously haven\u2019t seen that in the current situation. Scott, do you want to talk about the redesign?\nScott Herren: Just to finish up on that pipeline looks strong, close rates still look good. So we\u2019re not seeing a huge difference there. There is, in some cases, a slight elongation. On the redesign, that\u2019s absolutely contributed to the growth that we\u2019re seeing, particularly in secure agile networks, less so from \u2013 in terms of releasing the next successor product, more being able to design around problematic components that we couldn\u2019t get supply of. And as we work those redesigns to build the product around components, we can get our hands on, that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about when we talk about the redesign. And so there is no question, that\u2019s driven some of the growth that you saw in the quarter we just announced. We will continue to drive the significant growth that we\u2019ve put out for the second half. And to be clear, we will continue to see growth into fiscal \u201824. All the trends we have talked about that are driving the uptick that you see in our guidance in the second half of this year, those trends continue into fiscal \u201824, and we continue to expect nice growth there. I just think it\u2019s a little too early to start to quantify that and give you a guide.\nSami Badri: Got it. Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. George Notter from Jefferies, you may go ahead sir.\nGeorge Notter: Hi guys. Thanks very much. I guess I wanted to ask about your impressions of backlog and product orders relative to three months ago. And I think I have this correct. About three months ago, you guys were talking about if product orders were down 10% for the year, then your product backlog at fiscal year-end would be 2x to 3x higher than the normal kind of $4 billion or $5 billion range. And Chuck, I think you were quick to say that it didn\u2019t feel like a 10% order decline was in the cards for you. So, it feels now like you are going to burn more backlog than you were thinking previously and orders will be a bit worse than previous, am I perceiving that correctly? And what are your thoughts there? Thanks.\nScott Herren: Yes. George, I will take that, Chuck, and then you can jump in. I don\u2019t think it is burning down backlog. We clearly are \u2013 the good news is we are able to ship more of the backlog. That\u2019s good news for our customers. They are waiting for these components. They have got projects that they are holding up that they need to get done. It\u2019s good news for our channel in a sense that the channel is sitting on, in some case, partial shipments. They need that last box, so they can go out and implement that and relieve some of the pressure on their own working capital. So, it\u2019s not \u2013 I am responding to the burning down backlog. This is good news, our ability to ship the backlog, and that\u2019s what you see reflected there in the guide down \u2013 or sorry, in the guide up that we have in the second half of the year. We have \u2013 what you see now is a significantly higher revenue projection for the second half of the year than we had before. And some of that clearly is our ability to ship backlog because of the great job our team has done to free up supply.\nChuck Robbins: And I would say on the demand side, if I go back 90 days, I would say, in general, I think there was more risk, at least there felt like there was more risk. And when I talk to my customers, there is more uncertainty. And even when you hear \u2013 listen to the news and we talk \u2013 I talk to my colleagues, we were in Davos, it feels like the longer we go without seeing some major shift, then the better our customers are feeling. So obviously, we are not immune to anything, and we will have to continue to monitor it. But after traveling in Asia last week, our team being in Europe, I actually saw customers in New York while I was here this week, and customers are moving forward.\nGeorge Notter: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks George. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. David Vogt with UBS, you may go ahead.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thank you, guys and I apologize if you covered it. My line cut out a little bit more. Scott, I am just trying to clarify the order versus the backlog comment. I think if I am not mistaken, your run rate backlog had been sort of roughly $5 billion as you exited fiscal year. So, are you suggesting to us that the backlog comes down by about $3.5 billion over the next several quarters? And if that\u2019s the case, if I just kind of back that out of your guidance, would that imply sort of that the business is effectively flat year-over-year ex the backlog drawdown as we exit \u201823 into \u201824? And then I have a quick follow-up.\nScott Herren: Yes. So, let me try and walk through some of the moving parts there, David. It\u2019s a great question. What we said previously is we thought we would end the year with somewhere between 2x and 3x normal backlog. And normal backlog, as we said last quarter, is between $4 billion and $5 billion at the end of the year. What we now see is that it\u2019s still going to be roughly double what that same range. So, there is definitely our ability to ship some out of the backlog, which is again, great news for our customers and our partners. The one piece that\u2019s missing in your equation is, as we ship the backlog, remember, we said there is more than $2 billion of software in there. A lot of that software is ratable. So, as soon as we ship it, it doesn\u2019t all drop into the revenue stream. It ends up dropping into deferred revenue and being recognized over time. So, there is a \u2013 you have to consider not just the reduction in backlog, what\u2019s the uptick in the revenue guide, but also how much of this is going to contribute to growth in deferred revenue. That may be the piece that you are missing.\nDavid Vogt: Got it. And then maybe just as a quick follow-up, so as we enter, let\u2019s say, the next fiscal year, I mean given your excellent work on supply chain, and the team has done a phenomenal job, would that imply \u2013 I mean basically, we could be back at normalized backlog within a quarter, maybe two quarters at the worst-case scenario if trends hold consistent where we are today. Is that a reasonable expectation?\nScott Herren: Rather than try to say it\u2019s a quarter or it\u2019s two quarters, I do expect it to normalize in fiscal \u201824.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thanks guys.\nMarilyn Mora: Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Tal Liani with Bank of America, you may go ahead sir.\nTal Liani: Great. He stole my thunder with the previous question. That was exactly my question. So, I want to \u2013 I want to understand something just a clarification on what you just answered. So, at the minimum, the decline in the backlog was $600 million at the minimum because end of year is going to be $8 million to $10 million. Take 6% of that and the backlog is now higher, so that means that the minimum year backlog declined $600 million. And that means that product growth, we should take out some of the $600 million because some of it goes into deferred revenue. Am I correct with what you just answered?\nScott Herren: Yes. Well, you are close. Let me run through it again, Tal, and if it\u2019s still not clear, we can catch in the follow-up. The 6% was the decline in backlog from Q1 to Q2, right. So, we were able to work off about 6% of the backlog that we came into the quarter with. What we have said is, at the time that we gave you that Q2 guide in the full year, the previous full year guide, we expected to end the year with somewhere between 2x and 3x our normal backlog. We are not saying it\u2019s going to be roughly double the normal backlog. Some of that, obviously, will ship out and will be a part of the significant guide up that we have given you in the second half revenue. Some of it, instead of turning into immediate revenue, will go into deferred revenue and be recognized ratably over time.\nChuck Robbins: And show up in RPO.\nScott Herren: I hope that\u2019s \u2013 yes, it will show up in deferred revenue and RPO. I hope that\u2019s clear, Tal, if not, we can follow-up.\nTal Liani: Yes. Very clear. So, my question \u2013 I want to go back to the basics and understand, last quarter, we were all concerned about environment slowing down. We don\u2019t hear you saying environment continues to slow down. We didn\u2019t hear Arista saying it. We didn\u2019t hear you saying that service providers were weak. Can you take us through the big customer account and tell us what is the situation of spending with your enterprise customers, commercial customers, service provider customers? Did the environment further deteriorate from the previous quarter, or did it stabilize? And does it make you think that at least the trends so far, the year would continue to be normal on a sequential basis, or do you expect some more deterioration going forward?\nChuck Robbins: Yes, Tal. So, we \u2013 on the enterprise and commercial space, we saw a double-digit sequential growth, which is in line with what we have seen historically. And as I have said, public sector was actually higher than historical ranges and Federal was \u2013 U.S. Federal was extremely strong during the quarter from a demand perspective. On the service provider side, I think you are seeing many of our competitors and peers, some of them anyway, don\u2019t give order data. And so I think for us, those customers are the ones who did the most planning for long-term ordering. So, as lead times begin to come down, we would expect them to change their ordering patterns and they have already got 6 months to 12 months\u2019 worth of consumption lined up in the backlog. So, we will see that normalize over the next few quarters. I will say in the web scale space, there are roughly 35 use cases or franchises within the largest players, and we have actually been designed into 18 of those at this point. And we are very confident that we will continue to get designed in. I got a note today that we had just got noticed about a new design win today. And so we are still very optimistic long-term, we just think it\u2019s a short-term normalization for our service provider space.\nTal Liani: Got it. Layoffs and the economic slowdown, my question was whether these factors you see an impact on your business on orders or they stabilized from previous quarter?\nChuck Robbins: Well, you mean layoffs in \u2013 like in our customers?\nTal Liani: Yes, across the industry?\nChuck Robbins: Yes. Well, if you think about what occurred, there was a lot of companies that had a massive surge in employment, and we didn\u2019t. But I think the thing that we are seeing right now is that we have seen the sequential growth be in line and some \u2013 like it was towards the lower end. So, it\u2019s not performing at the highest end, but I think that it\u2019s in range. And if you \u2013 and I also shared that in Q3, our current forecast is also in line sequentially with historical ranges, which we normally don\u2019t give. We just wanted you guys to have that visibility. So look, it\u2019s certainly an uncertain time, and I am not \u2013 I don\u2019t want to paint a picture that we are immune. And I don\u2019t want to paint a picture that every customer is spending everywhere on everything. But we have been able to maintain and continue to see our customers moving forward with projects. And the one thing that was really encouraging for me was to see January as strong as it was, given our \u2013 the uncertainty around \u201823 budgets.\nTal Liani: Got it. Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks Tal. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Tim Long with Barclays, you may go ahead sir.\nTim Long: Thank you. Just hoping I can get two in here. One, could you talk a little bit about, obviously, the enterprise campus is still very strong. But I think traditionally, that\u2019s kind of a GDP-ish type of business that has been running above that. And it sounds like your confidence for next year is pretty strong as well. So maybe, Chuck, any insights like what\u2019s kind of different there? Are we starting to decouple from like macro GDP for that campus networking fees? Any thoughts there would be great. And then second, obviously, a lot of excitement out there about AI, ChatGPT, all that stuff. Just curious what you think for your data center and cloud businesses, what kind of impact if there is kind of more of an arms race with big customers around AI, what that would mean for switching and routing business for you guys? Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks Tim. So first one, on enterprise campus, I do think that the pandemic was a great educator for our customers about the need to maintain modernized infrastructure because moving into the pandemic, I think it became quite obvious to many of our customers that they had not been updating, and they had \u2013 they were sweating assets a little longer. So, that\u2019s one thing that\u2019s shifted. The second is we are really seeing \u2013 these trends of multi-cloud, the trend of hybrid work and the overall re-architecture of their networks. If you really think about what \u2013 how we built networks for 20 years, we built it on a premise that we have branches and we have a private data center, and all the traffic flows are very understood. Now, I have to upgrade my entire infrastructure to deal with this brand-new world that I live in, supporting hybrid work, supporting hybrid cloud, etcetera. So, I think that\u2019s been driving a lot of this as well as safety in the office, IoT, creating new experiences to get our employees back to work, etcetera. So, that\u2019s what I think has been driving a lot of the enterprise campus stuff. As it relates to your second question around the AI play, I think that look, these AI networks that are being built, whether it\u2019s in web scale or whether we have some of our largest enterprise customers that are building AI networks and training AI algorithms, these are \u2013 like in the web scale space, they are like bigger than the core infrastructure networks that they are running, which was astonishing to me when I learned that. And the network performance required is 3x to 4x what they have historically needed. And so this is a massive opportunity for us and we are in active discussions with lots of customers around it. And so we do think that this shift is going to create a good opportunity for us in the future.\nTim Long: Okay. Thank you very much.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks Tim. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan, you may go ahead sir.\nSamik Chatterjee: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the strong guide. Maybe if I could just quickly hit on two of the product areas mostly security, what sort of benefits are you seeing given your broad portfolio there in terms of customers looking to maybe some level of \u2013 consolidation just given your position as a more broader security portfolio supplier. And what sort of benefit does supply eases, maybe on the firewall side, should we expect revenue growth? And a similar question on Internet for the Future segment seems like a bit more supply constrained than other segments. But what sort of are you \u2013 what are you seeing on the supply side there? Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Okay. I will take security and you can take the supply side. So, I think that \u2013 look, all of our customers definitely want to consolidate their security infrastructure. They have got 40, 50 different vendors, and trying to correlate these threats is very difficult and it\u2019s just \u2013 you can\u2019t add enough people. So, our teams right now are heads down working on some new capabilities that we are going to be bringing out over the next 12 months to 18 months, and some of that is focused on exactly that, how do we consolidate and how do we create the ability to correlate threats in real time much more effectively. And so we think that you are probably going to start seeing the benefit of that three quarters or four quarters out. So, the team has got work to do. We have hired a significant amount of outside talent. We have invested heavily in this space. So, while we may see \u2013 we may not see the growth that you want to see in the near-term, but you will see this begin to accelerate in FY \u201824. And I think that we will \u2013 we are playing a long game here and really believe that there is a lot of consolidation that we can drive over the next few years. Scott?\nScott Herren: Yes. Internet for the Future, Samik, it is one of the spaces. We have worked so hard and done so much across our entire product portfolio. So, we have made great progress in many cases. I would say Internet for the Future is one of the spaces where we are still \u2013 we have improved lead times there, but we are still not back to more normal lead times in that space. What I would also say though, is we have already picked up orders just in the last several weeks from some of our peers that are also selling into that same space who couldn\u2019t meet demand. And those orders came to us instead. So, while \u2013 it\u2019s a space we continue to work on. And while we are seeing improvement, it\u2019s not where we want it to be, I feel like we are performing pretty well on the supply side and Internet for the Future.\nSamik Chatterjee: Thank you.\nMarilyn Mora: Alright. That wraps up our Q&A. I am going to turn it over to Chuck for some closing remarks.\nChuck Robbins: Well, first off, I just want to thank everybody for spending time with us today and also really thank our teams. They delivered on very strong results. I want to thank the supply chain and our engineering teams for quarter-after-quarter-after-quarter of hard work and redesigns, over 100 product redesigns, aggressive actions to get us to the position we are in today, the entire company for the progress we have made on our business transformation. And I will just leave you with our feeling that our demand has remained stable. The business transformation is contributing significantly, our backlog, all of those give us the visibility and confidence in the future. I think the relevance of our portfolio, given the most pressing needs of our customers, is as high as it\u2019s been in a very long time, and I am super proud of what our teams have accomplished. So, look forward to talking to you in the future and thanks for joining us today.\nMarilyn Mora: Thanks Chuck. Cisco\u2019s next quarterly earnings conference call, which will reflect our fiscal 2023 third quarter results, will be on Wednesday, May 17, 2023 at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time, 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.

            "name": "Chuck Robbins",
            "content": "Thanks, Marilyn. I hope everyone is doing well. With the tremendous results we delivered in the first half of the year, fiscal \u201823 is shaping up to be very strong, fueled by demand for our cloud-driven networking portfolio, our continued business transformation success and an improving supply situation, thanks in large part to our team's aggressive actions. Before I dive into additional details on the quarter, I wanted to take a moment to say how incredibly proud I am of the team here at Cisco. While the environment we are operating in remains dynamic, Cisco is better positioned today than at any time since I became CEO almost 8 years ago. We have reshaped and transformed the company and our portfolio while remaining highly disciplined both financially and operationally. This gives me great confidence that we will continue to succeed in the long-term. Now I will touch on the quarter in more detail. Our Q2 financial results were strong as we again exceeded the high-end of our guidance ranges. We delivered our second highest quarterly revenue of $13.6 billion, up 7% and record non-GAAP EPS at $0.88. We also delivered solid ARR growth, sequential non-GAAP margin expansion and record non-GAAP net income. In terms of our business model shift, we continue to make great progress with 10% growth in software revenue and with software subscription revenue up 15%. Recurring revenue also now represents 44% of our total revenue. In addition, we have built up nearly $32 billion in remaining performance obligations and our backlog remains robust. Even as we drew down backlog by 6% sequentially, our total backlog still grew year-over-year. These metrics, along with our increasing visibility, led us to raise our full year outlook, which Scott will address in a moment. This quarter, we also achieved record operating cash flow, enabling today's dividend increase and the buyback of over $1 billion. We continue to deliver on our commitment to drive returns to our shareholders. Let me also provide an update on the supply situation. While components for a few product areas remain highly constrained, we did see an overall improvement. Combined with the aggressive actions our supply chain and engineering teams took to redesign hundreds of our products, we increased product deliveries and saw significant reductions in customer lead times. As our product deliveries increased, channel inventories also declined as our partners were able to complete customer projects. Like I shared last quarter, as supply constraints ease and lead times shorten, we expect orders would normalize from previously elevated levels as customers return to more typical buying patterns. As a result, sequential quarterly order growth is a better indicator than year-over-year growth. And in Q2, despite improving lead times, our quarter-over-quarter order growth was again in line with our historical ranges across most of our geographies and customer markets. With that, let me touch on what we are seeing with customer demand. In our customer markets, we experienced normal double-digit sequential growth in both our enterprise and commercial markets, while public sector performed better than we have seen historically. Within our service provider business, our order rate was below recent sequentials as some customers are absorbing the improved delivery of our products into their production environments. We saw another consecutive quarter of rapid adoption of our 400-gig Cisco 8000 and Silicon One platforms. This reflects the ongoing investments our customers are making in our innovative solutions and AI optimized infrastructure. Within web-scale, while we saw overall slowing due to normalizing product lead times, two of our largest customers grew their orders with us over 40% in the first half of fiscal \u201823. We continue to take share in this space. And over the past few years, we have grown web-scale cloud infrastructure from effectively zero into a multibillion dollar run-rate business. I am incredibly pleased about the overall progress we've made as we are continuing to win more and more use cases within their infrastructure. We are also still at the beginning of what we believe to be a massive growth opportunity going forward. While we continue to closely monitor the global macroeconomic conditions, the overall demand environment remains steady and on par with Q1 and our pipeline and win rates remains stable. Looking at the broader landscape, digital transformation and hybrid cloud remain top areas of spend, which is fueling growth across our portfolio. Many customers have told me that while their spend levels maybe slowing in some areas technology remains essential as it is vital to their overall business resilience, competitive differentiation and success. In fact, Gartner and IDC's most recent surveys make it clear that technology budgets are growing as they forecast IT spend to increase in the mid to high single-digits in 2023. We are also seeing many customers moving ahead with their hybrid work, AI and ML investments while building the modern infrastructure they need to deliver on their objectives. IoT has also been accelerating. We saw record revenue growth in Q2 as customers look to connect their industrial systems in order to optimize power consumption, automation and efficiency. Lastly, cybersecurity and full stack observability remains strategic priorities where we continue to invest and innovate. From a product revenue perspective, we saw strong double-digit growth for Catalyst 9000, enterprise routing, Wireless, Meraki, DUO and ThousandEyes, reflecting the ongoing investments our customers are making to modernize their infrastructure to rapidly digitize and secure their organizations. We are increasing our investments in our cloud management platforms that deliver the simplicity our customers need. You will see us continue to bring AI and ML into those platforms to further simplify how networks are managed. For example, in Q2, we announced several new innovations across our cloud managed networking and security portfolios that offer greater visibility with AI-driven insights, enable secure connectivity, and give our customers the ability to simplify their IT operations. Last week, we introduced a preview our cloud-native full stack observability platform, the first network visibility solution to support open telemetry. This platform brings together our ThousandEyes and AppDynamics capabilities for unmatched data correlation and insights from the user to the application to the network. To simplify network security and policy management, our unified SASE solution, Cisco+ Secure Connect, now supports integration into Cisco SD-WAN fabrics using Viptela technology, as well as our existing Meraki SD-WAN fabric. We also introduced new flexible, more powerful and energy-efficient servers, which not only help lower cost, but also help our customers meet their sustainability goals, an increasingly critical area for most of our customers. To close, I am proud of what we achieved this quarter. We delivered a strong financial performance, innovated across our portfolio and continue to make great progress on our business transformation. In addition, the increased visibility we have from almost $32 billion in RPO, a healthy backlog and pipeline and improving supply give us the confidence to raise our full year outlook. We expect those same factors to continue into fiscal year \u201824, giving us conviction in our ability to deliver on our commitments. The modern, resilient and secure networks we are building serve as the backbone of our customers' technology strategy. Cisco is well-positioned to benefit from multiyear investment cycles with our market-leading hardware as well as our innovative software and services. Together, these allow our customers to digitize rapidly, secure their environments and achieve their sustainability goals, all while delivering differentiated experiences. Now, I will turn it over to Scott. Yes. Before we get into Q&A, I just wanted to send our condolences to those impacted by the earthquake in Turkey and Syria. It's been absolutely devastating to watch as the death toll has climbed and we are working closely with our teams in the region to give them support and help on the ground as much as we can. We just want to let them know that we are all thinking about them and we are here to help. Yes, Ittai, thanks for the question. And shockingly enough, that was the first question I expected. So let me just summarize sort of what we are seeing and then I can give you more detail. But number one, let's start with the fact that our demand is stable and that's first. Based on the sequentials that we saw, demand remained stable. And in fact, if you look out at our Q3 forecast, which we normally wouldn't give you, the current forecast in Q3 is also in line with historical ranges of sequentials. So that's the first piece. The second thing is, as Scott said, while we \u2013 backlog came down 6% sequentially. It was up year-over-year, and we expect that we will end the fiscal year even with the guidance we gave you today with a backlog that's roughly double what we would normally end the year with. The other thing to take into consideration is the business transformation with 44% of our revenue now recurring really helps a great deal. And we have $23 billion of ARR, which we can actually renew in the next 12 months. So if you go back 8 or 9 years ago, we might have had to take orders for 75% of our revenue in any given quarter. And now we have 44% of our revenue coming from the balance sheet and recurring revenue. So all that said, we actually believe that we will still be able to deliver. We're confident that we will deliver positive growth in fiscal \u201824, obviously, with pretty significant comps based on the guidance that we gave today. Scott, do you want to take that? Thanks. Thanks, Amit. Let me take the share question because I think I've said on several calls that, obviously, market share is reflective of revenue and with our backlog that as we began to ship certain products that we would be a gainer of market share, and we certainly expect that when these numbers are digested and the new reports come out for Q4, that you'll see that to be the case. One example is, during last quarter, our wireless revenue was up 57% year-over-year. And I suspect that, that's going to be a share gainer. And the other thing to keep in mind is that market share is inexact. I would tell you that when we ship products into the web scale infrastructure space, as an example, it goes into our routing reports and many of our competitors put it in data center switching. So it's very difficult in some cases to get complete apples-to-apples, but I do believe that as we continue to ship our backlog that we will be gaining share. Do you want to talk a little bit about the campus switching? Amit, can you repeat your question about the campus switching, the second part? Well, as I said, the \u2013 our enterprise and commercial business, which is reflective of how most of our peers represent enterprise, that was up double digits sequentially, which is in line with our historical. And public sector actually performed better than \u2013 it was above our historical ranges during the quarter. So the other thing I would point out is that our quarter itself from a linearity perspective was quite normal, and we actually had a \u2013 we're unique in that we had the January month in our Q2. And one of the questions that we had was what's going to happen to budget as we enter into calendar \u201823. And we clearly \u2013 we actually finished stronger than we started the quarter. So those are just a few data points for you. And I think if you look at what our customers are focused on right now, I mean think about some of their top products. They have got a complete rearchitecture of their applications to be cloud native running in both public and/or private clouds. They are having to rearchitect their infrastructure to actually deal with the changing traffic patterns that multi-cloud brings to them. They are dealing with hybrid work and how do I transform our IT infrastructure for that. They are dealing with cybersecurity threats on a massive scale, and they are also all focused on sustainability, which is leading to our IoT business growing significantly as we connect industrial systems for our customers. So if you think about those big five trends, we're actually in the middle of those with all of our customers. So we feel good about where we are. And the last thing I'll say is that I was in Tokyo and Singapore last week and at the same time, A lot of our \u2013 my leadership team were in Amsterdam for Cisco Live Europe, and no one is talking about cutting technology spending right now. Everybody seems very committed to it. I think the underlying power of technology as it relates to all of our organization strategy is just too strong right now. Meta, thank you. So we are probably, I'd say, still in the early innings of transitioning the traditional portfolio to subscription models. The team is working hard on that right now. And we will just continue to keep you updated. But I think we're several quarters away from really having anything to speak about relative to the size of that business, but we're working hard on being able to deliver that. And the key is to give customers flexibility. That's what \u2013 over the last 7 years or so, we have disaggregated hardware and software and silicon. We virtualized software to run on x86 appliances. So we want to give our customers whatever kinds of flexibility that they would like. So that's the first part. On the M&A side, I would say our strategy, as you would expect, has not changed. I think the market dynamics have changed, and I think that the longer valuations remain somewhat muted from their peaks. I think some of the companies are probably coming to more of a real position on what \u2013 how long these valuations may exist and were prior valuations even realistic in the first place. So we continue to stay aware of what's going on. We continue to scan the marketplace, but our strategy remains the same. Yes, I'll make a couple of comments, and Scott, I don't know if you want to give any detail. But I would say that our customers are increasingly balanced around how they are thinking about private cloud versus public cloud. And so we've seen continued focus on revitalizing the private data center infrastructure. And I'll let Scott speak to \u2013 I'm not sure on the infrastructure side or UCS, if you want to share that. But the other thing I would point out, Simon, as I said in my comments earlier about market share, everything that we sell in the infrastructure within web scale flows into our routing market share numbers and our routing business. So it doesn't actually boost our data center switching the way we report it. So it's a little bit of an apples-and-oranges issue. I just want to make sure you understood that. Let me take the second one first, and then Scott, you can talk about the data center switching redesign. We absolutely are seeing some elongated sales cycles. What our teams have told me is that, in many cases, there are extra signatures required. We just seem to, in general, be getting them. It just takes a little bit longer. So \u2013 but look, it's a complex world right now. But if you look back at historical sort of what we would consider a bit of a crisis or a complex world environment, I've experienced demand falling off a cliff, and we obviously haven't seen that in the current situation. Scott, do you want to talk about the redesign? And I would say on the demand side, if I go back 90 days, I would say, in general, I think there was more risk, at least there felt like there was more risk. And when I talk to my customers, there is more uncertainty. And even when you hear \u2013 listen to the news and we talk \u2013 I talk to my colleagues, we were in Davos, it feels like the longer we go without seeing some major shift, then the better our customers are feeling. So obviously, we are not immune to anything, and we will have to continue to monitor it. But after traveling in Asia last week, our team being in Europe, I actually saw customers in New York while I was here this week, and customers are moving forward. And show up in RPO. Yes, Tal. So, we \u2013 on the enterprise and commercial space, we saw a double-digit sequential growth, which is in line with what we have seen historically. And as I have said, public sector was actually higher than historical ranges and Federal was \u2013 U.S. Federal was extremely strong during the quarter from a demand perspective. On the service provider side, I think you are seeing many of our competitors and peers, some of them anyway, don't give order data. And so I think for us, those customers are the ones who did the most planning for long-term ordering. So, as lead times begin to come down, we would expect them to change their ordering patterns and they have already got 6 months to 12 months' worth of consumption lined up in the backlog. So, we will see that normalize over the next few quarters. I will say in the web scale space, there are roughly 35 use cases or franchises within the largest players, and we have actually been designed into 18 of those at this point. And we are very confident that we will continue to get designed in. I got a note today that we had just got noticed about a new design win today. And so we are still very optimistic long-term, we just think it's a short-term normalization for our service provider space. Well, you mean layoffs in \u2013 like in our customers? Yes. Well, if you think about what occurred, there was a lot of companies that had a massive surge in employment, and we didn't. But I think the thing that we are seeing right now is that we have seen the sequential growth be in line and some \u2013 like it was towards the lower end. So, it's not performing at the highest end, but I think that it's in range. And if you \u2013 and I also shared that in Q3, our current forecast is also in line sequentially with historical ranges, which we normally don't give. We just wanted you guys to have that visibility. So look, it's certainly an uncertain time, and I am not \u2013 I don't want to paint a picture that we are immune. And I don't want to paint a picture that every customer is spending everywhere on everything. But we have been able to maintain and continue to see our customers moving forward with projects. And the one thing that was really encouraging for me was to see January as strong as it was, given our \u2013 the uncertainty around \u201823 budgets. Thanks Tim. So first one, on enterprise campus, I do think that the pandemic was a great educator for our customers about the need to maintain modernized infrastructure because moving into the pandemic, I think it became quite obvious to many of our customers that they had not been updating, and they had \u2013 they were sweating assets a little longer.

So, I think that's been driving a lot of this as well as safety in the office, IoT, creating new experiences to get our employees back to work, etcetera. So, that's what I think has been driving a lot of the enterprise campus stuff. As it relates to your second question around the AI play, I think that look, these AI networks that are being built, whether it's in web scale or whether we have some of our largest enterprise customers that are building AI networks and training AI algorithms, these are \u2013 like in the web scale space, they are like bigger than the core infrastructure networks that they are running, which was astonishing to me when I learned that. And the network performance required is 3x to 4x what they have historically needed. And so this is a massive opportunity for us and we are in active discussions with lots of customers around it. And so we do think that this shift is going to create a good opportunity for us in the future. Okay. I will take security and you can take the supply side. So, I think that \u2013 look, all of our customers definitely want to consolidate their security infrastructure. They have got 40, 50 different vendors, and trying to correlate these threats is very difficult and it's just \u2013 you can't add enough people.

And I think that we will \u2013 we are playing a long game here and really believe that there is a lot of consolidation that we can drive over the next few years. Scott? Well, first off, I just want to thank everybody for spending time with us today and also really thank our teams. They delivered on very strong results. I want to thank the supply chain and our engineering teams for quarter-after-quarter-after-quarter of hard work and redesigns, over 100 product redesigns, aggressive actions to get us to the position we are in today, the entire company for the progress we have made on our business transformation. And I will just leave you with our feeling that our demand has remained stable. The business transformation is contributing significantly, our backlog, all of those give us the visibility and confidence in the future.

            "content": "Thanks, Chuck. We delivered another strong quarter and exceeded both our top and bottom line expectations driven by our focused execution, continued success of our business transformation and improved availability of supply as the actions our supply chain team have taken over the last several quarters are bearing fruit. Total revenue was $13.6 billion, up 7%. Non-GAAP net income was a record $3.6 billion, and non-GAAP earnings per share, also a record, was $0.88. Looking at our Q2 revenue in more detail, total product revenue was $10.2 billion, up 9%. Service revenue was $3.4 billion, up 2%. Within product revenue, secure Agile Networks performed very well, up 14%. Switching revenue grew in the double-digits with strength in campus switching driven by our Catalyst 9000 and Meraki offerings. While data center switching declined slightly, we saw strong growth in our Nexus 9000 offerings. Enterprise routing had double-digit growth driven primarily by strength in our Catalyst 8000 Series routers, SD-WAN and IoT routing. Wireless had very strong double-digit growth with strength across the entire portfolio. Internet for the Future was down 1%, driven by declines in optical and Edge. We saw growth in our Cisco 8000 offering and double-digit growth in web-scale. Collaboration was down 10%, driven by declines in meetings and collaboration devices, slightly offset by growth in contact center. End-to-end security was up 7% driven by our unified threat management and zero trust offerings. Optimized application experiences, was up 11%, driven by double-digit growth in our SaaS-based offering ThousandEyes. We made solid progress on our transformation metrics as we shift our business to more recurring revenue-based offerings, driven by higher levels of software and subscriptions. We saw strong performance in our ARR of $23.3 billion, which increased 6% with product ARR growth of 11%. Total software revenue was $4.2 billion, an increase of 10%, with software subscription revenue up 15%. 84% of the software revenue was subscription-based, which is up 4 percentage points, year-over-year. We continue to have $2 billion of software orders in our product backlog. Total subscription revenue was $6 billion, an increase of 9%. Total subscription revenue represented 44% of total revenue. And RPO was $31.8 billion, up 4%. Product RPO increased 7% and service RPO increased 2%, and total short-term RPO grew to $16.9 billion. While total product orders were down 22%, they compared against 34% growth in Q2 fiscal \u201822, which is one of the largest quarters for product orders in our history. We saw year-over-year declines across our geographies and customer markets. Sequentially, total product order growth was in line with our historical growth rates. Within our customer markets, we experienced double-digit sequential growth in both enterprise and commercial and public sector was better than we have seen historically. We continue to have very low order cancellation rates, which remain below pre-pandemic levels. Total non-GAAP gross margin came in at the high end of our guidance range at 63.9%, down 160 basis points and up 90 basis points sequentially. Product gross margin was 62.1% down 220 basis points year-over-year and up 110 basis points sequentially. Service gross margin was 69.1%, up 30 basis points. In our product gross margin, the year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by higher component and other costs. This was partially offset by our strong product mix and positive pricing as the benefits of the actions we took in the prior fiscal year flowed through as we shift our backlog. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at the high-end of our guidance range at 32.5%, down 180 basis year-over-year and up 70 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by the higher component and other costs that I just mentioned. Backlog for both our hardware and software products continue to far exceed historical levels. As we navigated a complex supply environment, we were able to drawdown total backlog by 6% sequentially, although it still grew year-over-year. Just a reminder, backlog is not included as part of our $31.8 billion in remaining performance obligations. Combined, our significant product backlog and RPO continued to provide great visibility to our top line. Shifting to the balance sheet, we ended Q2 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $22.1 billion. We had record operating cash flow for the quarter of $4.7 billion, up 93% year-over-year driven by strong collections and we deferred our Q2 federal tax payments due to the IRS tax relief related to the California floods. We expect to pay these federal taxes by the end of the fiscal year. We returned $2.8 billion to shareholders during the quarter, which was comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and $1.3 billion of share repurchases. We also ended the quarter with $13.4 billion in remaining stock repurchase authorization. Today, we announced that we are raising our quarterly dividend by $0.01 to $0.39 per share, which represents our 13th consecutive increase. This reinforces our commitment to returning a minimum of 50% of free cash flow to our shareholders annually and confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows. To summarize, we had a great quarter, delivering better-than-expected top and bottom line performance. We continue to make progress on our business model shift to more recurring revenue while making strategic investments in innovation to capitalize on our significant growth opportunities. Turning now to our guidance, our guidance ranges reflect our strong pipeline and significant visibility driven by healthy backlog, ARR, RPO and improving availability of supply as we continue to benefit from the actions our supply chain team have taken over the last several quarters. We expect those same factors will continue into fiscal 2024 giving us greater visibility and confidence in our longer term goals. For fiscal Q3, our guidance is: we expect revenue growth to be in the range of 11% to 13%; we anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 63.5% to 64.5%; our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 33% to 34%; and our non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.96 to $0.98. There is also a significant change to our full year fiscal \u201823 revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance driven by these same factors. For fiscal year \u201823, we are raising our expectations for revenue growth to be in the range of 9% to 10.5% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $3.73 to $3.78. In both our Q3 and full year guidance, we are assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. I will now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A. No, not at all, Ittai. But what I would say is it's obviously too early for us to guide fiscal \u201824. What we wanted to give you confidence is we have better visibility than we've ever had in the past, both from the backlog and the $17 billion \u2013 almost $17 billion of RPO that's current, that's going to turn into revenue in the next 12 months in the ARR. But \u2013 and we're going to roll in backlog that's roughly double what it normally would be at the end of the year. So we have good confidence in where we're headed in fiscal \u201824. I think it's a bit too early given where we are in the year just at the end of our second quarter for us to be a little more precise on that. Yes. Sorry, I missed that part of the question. Yes. Campus is doing well for us. And the supply chain \u2013 while I don't want to leave the perception that supply chain just got better. Our supply chain team and our product engineering teams have worked pretty relentlessly over the last several quarters with product redesign, with qualifying alternative components, with working with our suppliers to get to their subcomponents to make sure we could free this up so that the increase in supply that's leading to some of the share gains that we're talking about is the result of a lot of hard work by a lot of people inside the company. And I think, frankly, it puts us in a better position than many of our peers in the industry right now from a supply chain standpoint. But \u2013 the longer answer. The short answer is, yes, we're doing quite well in that space. And as we continue to deliver what we've just laid out as our guidance for the second half of this year, I think you'll continue to see share gain grow for us. Yes. The midpoint of the guide for the April quarter is about a 10 basis point improvement from the quarter we just announced. So we do see gross margins improving, and it's largely driven by \u2013 it's less driven by cost. We're seeing some reduction in costs around logistics, in particular, but component costs are kind of staying where they are in most cases. It's more driven by the fact that as we ship the backlog more and more of what we ship, reflects the price increases that we put in place last year. So I think you'll see gross margins potentially continue to expand from where they are, maybe as much as 50 basis points in Q4. Yes. I mean as you talk long-term, there is a number of tailwinds that will come into gross margin, so not necessarily talking about our guide for fiscal \u201823, but longer term, there are several things that are going to be a tailwind there. One is continuing to work our way through the backlog and reflect the price increases. I think we will continue to see leverage and logistics costs, both from a reduction in the freight cost per kilo but also in the mix of how we shift between what has supply airfreight and what will go in the ocean. So I think we will see some leverage there as well. I don't see a lot of our component providers outside of commodity areas like memory lining up to reduce cost to us, right? So I think it will be the combination of mix that will be beneficial to us and some cost leverage in the non-component areas that will drive that north. Yes. So are you asking me for a 5-year forecast on gross margin, Paul, is that where you're going? Long-term, there is definitely leverage to push it back to where it's been historically, for sure, and if not beyond. Thank you. No, that's a really good point. And on UCS, if that's the root of your question, Simon, we are seeing nice growth in UCS as well. And at least based on our calculations, we feel like we're gaining share there as well. It's a great question, Simon. And we actually did see \u2013 if you noticed, our overall software revenue grew 10% this quarter, so back to double-digit growth. And some of that growth is on the back of shipping some of the backlog out, both the hardware and the software that's had in backlog. So we are seeing the benefit of shipping that out. At the same time, as Chuck said earlier, demand remains steady. And so our overall backlog, while it came down only about 6% sequentially, there is still a significant amount of software stock in that backlog, some of it attached to hardware. Yes. Just for software, it's in the 30% range. Overall, we're in the 44% range. Just to finish up on that pipeline looks strong, close rates still look good. So we're not seeing a huge difference there. There is, in some cases, a slight elongation. On the redesign, that's absolutely contributed to the growth that we're seeing, particularly in secure agile networks, less so from \u2013 in terms of releasing the next successor product, more being able to design around problematic components that we couldn't get supply of. And as we work those redesigns to build the product around components, we can get our hands on, that's what we're talking about when we talk about the redesign. And so there is no question, that's driven some of the growth that you saw in the quarter we just announced. We will continue to drive the significant growth that we've put out for the second half. And to be clear, we will continue to see growth into fiscal \u201824. All the trends we have talked about that are driving the uptick that you see in our guidance in the second half of this year, those trends continue into fiscal \u201824, and we continue to expect nice growth there. I just think it's a little too early to start to quantify that and give you a guide. Yes. George, I will take that, Chuck, and then you can jump in. I don't think it is burning down backlog. We clearly are \u2013 the good news is we are able to ship more of the backlog. That's good news for our customers. They are waiting for these components. They have got projects that they are holding up that they need to get done. It's good news for our channel in a sense that the channel is sitting on, in some case, partial shipments. They need that last box, so they can go out and implement that and relieve some of the pressure on their own working capital. So, it's not \u2013 I am responding to the burning down backlog. This is good news, our ability to ship the backlog, and that's what you see reflected there in the guide down \u2013 or sorry, in the guide up that we have in the second half of the year. We have \u2013 what you see now is a significantly higher revenue projection for the second half of the year than we had before. And some of that clearly is our ability to ship backlog because of the great job our team has done to free up supply. Yes. So, let me try and walk through some of the moving parts there, David. It's a great question. What we said previously is we thought we would end the year with somewhere between 2x and 3x normal backlog. And normal backlog, as we said last quarter, is between $4 billion and $5 billion at the end of the year. What we now see is that it's still going to be roughly double what that same range. So, there is definitely our ability to ship some out of the backlog, which is again, great news for our customers and our partners. The one piece that's missing in your equation is, as we ship the backlog, remember, we said there is more than $2 billion of software in there. A lot of that software is ratable. So, as soon as we ship it, it doesn't all drop into the revenue stream. It ends up dropping into deferred revenue and being recognized over time. So, there is a \u2013 you have to consider not just the reduction in backlog, what's the uptick in the revenue guide, but also how much of this is going to contribute to growth in deferred revenue. That may be the piece that you are missing. Rather than try to say it's a quarter or it's two quarters, I do expect it to normalize in fiscal \u201824. Yes. Well, you are close. Let me run through it again, Tal, and if it's still not clear, we can catch in the follow-up. The 6% was the decline in backlog from Q1 to Q2, right. So, we were able to work off about 6% of the backlog that we came into the quarter with. What we have said is, at the time that we gave you that Q2 guide in the full year, the previous full year guide, we expected to end the year with somewhere between 2x and 3x our normal backlog. We are not saying it's going to be roughly double the normal backlog. Some of that, obviously, will ship out and will be a part of the significant guide up that we have given you in the second half revenue. Some of it, instead of turning into immediate revenue, will go into deferred revenue and be recognized ratably over time. I hope that's \u2013 yes, it will show up in deferred revenue and RPO. I hope that's clear, Tal, if not, we can follow-up. Yes. Internet for the Future, Samik, it is one of the spaces. We have worked so hard and done so much across our entire product portfolio. So, we have made great progress in many cases. I would say Internet for the Future is one of the spaces where we are still \u2013 we have improved lead times there, but we are still not back to more normal lead times in that space. What I would also say though, is we have already picked up orders just in the last several weeks from some of our peers that are also selling into that same space who couldn't meet demand. And those orders came to us instead. So, while \u2013 it's a space we continue to work on. And while we are seeing improvement, it's not where we want it to be, I feel like we are performing pretty well on the supply side and Internet for the Future."

        "content": "Operator: Welcome to Cisco's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Financial Results Conference Call. At the request of Cisco, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin. \nMarilyn Mora: Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO; and Scott Herren, our CFO. \n By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. As is customary in Q1, we have made certain reclassifications to prior period amounts to conform to the current period's presentation. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. \n Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis.\n The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the second quarter and full year of fiscal 2023. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Form 10-K, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.\n With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. With that, I'll now turn it over to Chuck. \nCharles Robbins: Thank you, Marilyn, and thank you all for joining us today. We are off to a good start in fiscal 2023, delivering strong results, exceeding the top end of our guidance range for both revenue and non-GAAP EPS. We delivered the largest quarterly revenue in our history, driven by excellent execution and the actions our team took to remediate our supply challenges. Given these results, along with the strength of our orders, our visibility, and easing supply constraints, we are raising our full year outlook, which Scott will cover later.\n While we are proactively managing through an evolving and complex market environment, we remain intensely focused on executing on our strategy, including our transition to more software and subscription-based recurring revenue. We achieved software revenue growth of 5% year-over-year, and software subscription revenue grew 11%. The easing of supply constraints and our ability to deliver hardware is now releasing software subscriptions that were sitting in backlog connecting to unshipped hardware.\n Our success is also reflected in our ARR, which exceeded $23 billion, increasing 7%, with product ARR growing 12%. We also ended the quarter with RPO of nearly $31 billion, up 3% year-over-year with product RPO up 5%. Over $16 billion of the RPO will be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months with a backlog that remains elevated at near-record levels. \n These metrics give us increased visibility and predictability and provide additional confidence in our ability to perform through the current market cycle. It also underscores our unique position, helping customers become more agile and resilient as they continue to navigate a complex set of challenges.\n As I've done in the past, I'd like to provide an update on supply chain before discussing our Q1 results. Like you've heard from others in the industry, we are encouraged by what we are seeing with modest improvement in certain component availability as shortages continue to ease from last quarter. The redesign of many of our products has also helped bring supply stability and more resiliency. \n Over the last few quarters, you've heard me talk about the actions we've taken to navigate supply constraints. These actions are paying off and are contributing to our results. We now have greater visibility in the ramp of our customer product deliveries, which in turn gives us greater confidence in our fiscal 2023 outlook.\n Now moving to performance highlights in the quarter. We delivered revenues of $13.6 billion, up 6%, and non-GAAP EPS came in at $0.86, our second highest quarterly non-GAAP EPS in the history of the company. We also generated $4 billion in operating cash flow and returned over $2 billion to our shareholders. \n These metrics show we remain committed to operating discipline and our balanced capital allocation priorities. We are continuing to invest in our long-term growth opportunities while also returning capital to shareholders.\n In terms of our product orders in the quarter, it's important to note that the year-over-year comparison is against an unusually strong period of 34% growth in Q1 of fiscal year '22. From a geographic perspective, we saw some emerging cautiousness in Europe. This is driven by a dramatic increase in energy costs and market volatility, which is leading customers to assess their overall spend. However, this also presents an opportunity for us as our technologies like, IoT, Silicon One and power over ethernet drive a significant reduction in power consumption.\n To provide a normalized perspective, our Q4 to Q1 sequential growth was just slightly below the normal range over the last 6 years. It's also important to note that this was the second highest Q1 orders in the history of the company. \n We have strong product revenue momentum in key parts of our business, including Secure Agile Networks, Security and Optimized Application Experiences. We also saw record performance from a number of products, including the Catalyst 9000 family, Cisco 8000, Wireless, Meraki, ThousandEyes and Duo. \n Networking is becoming increasingly critical to every organization, led by digital transformation, hybrid cloud, AI and ML workloads. This is driving demand for our technologies. As we've discussed, there are also tailwinds to our business, such as hybrid work, 400 gig and beyond, 5G, WiFi 6, security and full stack observability. We believe these broader technology transitions will require every customer to rearchitect their network infrastructure and, in turn, fuel long-term growth across our portfolio.\n As I speak with customers, they tell me that, while they're closely watching the economy, they remain focused on making the right investments across their business to increase their agility and drive greater innovation and productivity. \n In our web-scale business, demand remains solid, driven by their growing investments with Cisco to build out AI fabric and massively scalable cloud networks. Once again, we saw strong momentum with our Silicon One-based Cisco 8000 routers. We are experiencing robust demand for our 400 gig products and now have nearly 1,200 customers. On a trailing 12-month basis, web-scale orders were up double digits or greater for the eighth consecutive quarter. \n Network capacity and demand continues to increase, driven by 5G, IoT, pervasive video and other technology trends I've mentioned earlier. With our commitment to powering next-generation networks while also driving sustainability, we launched new 800 gig switching platforms built on our Silicon One G100 chip to help meet customers' demand for more programmability, bandwidth and energy efficiency.\n Let me now touch on our innovation, as I'm incredibly proud of how our teams have come together to deliver market-leading solutions for our customers. Security and hybrid work are now more critical than ever. We continue to extend our capabilities to enable customers to work more securely anywhere while reducing cost and complexity. In security, we introduced new data loss prevention, firewall and Zero Trust capabilities across our portfolio. And in collaboration, we announced more than 40 new innovations to power hybrid work and deliver exceptional customer experiences.\n We're also committed to giving our customers more choice. An example of this is our partnership with Microsoft to bring Microsoft teams to Cisco meeting room devices. By doing this, we are driving interoperability and demonstrating our openness to meet our customers' need and provide greater flexibility.\n To wrap up, we delivered another strong quarter of revenue and non-GAAP earnings growth. The strength of orders, increased visibility and easing supply situation provides us with enhanced visibility and predictability, which underpins the confidence we have in our business and our increased outlook for the year. \n Our performance this quarter is a testament to our innovation and execution to support our customers during these complex times. Additionally, it reinforces Cisco's strength, durability and discipline in how we manage the business while investing to capture the multiyear growth opportunities ahead. \n Our portfolio is in great shape, and our business model is resilient with 43% of our revenue now recurring, which is very important as we navigate the current macro environment. The hard work and dedicated commitment of our leadership team and employees over the last few years to transform our business model is reflected in the performance we delivered this quarter. Combined with the strength of our balance sheet and our position in the market, we have an excellent foundation for delivering long-term results.\n I will now turn it over to Scott. \nRichard Herren: Thanks, Chuck. We started the fiscal year with a strong Q1, reflecting solid execution and disciplined management. We had record total revenue of $13.6 billion, exceeding the high end of our guidance range, driven by product shipment levels above our expectations and continued improvements in component supply.\n Non-GAAP operating margin was 31.8%, down 150 basis points, in line with our guidance range, primarily driven by higher component costs as well as logistics costs related to supply constraints. Non-GAAP net income was $3.5 billion, up 2%, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.86, up 5%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range.\n Looking at our Q1 revenue in more detail. Total product revenue was $10.2 billion, up 8%, and service revenue was flat at $3.4 billion. Within product revenue, Secure Agile Networks performed well, up 12%. Switching revenue grew with double-digit growth in campus switching, driven by growth in our Catalyst 9000 and Meraki offerings. While data center switching modestly declined, we saw solid growth in our Nexus 9000 offering. Enterprise routing declined primarily from the product transition to our Catalyst 8000 series routers along with constrained supply. Wireless had very strong double-digit growth driven primarily by our WiFi 6 products and Meraki wireless offering.\n Internet for the Future was down 5%, driven by declines in Cable, Optical and Edge. We saw growth in our Cisco 8000 offering and strong double-digit growth in web scale. Collaboration was down 2%, driven by a decline in meetings, partially offset by growth in calling. End-to-end security was up 9%, driven by unified threat management and Zero Trust offerings. Our Zero Trust portfolio continues to perform well, driven by strong performance in our Duo offering. Optimized application experiences was up 7%, driven by double-digit growth in our SaaS-based offering, ThousandEyes.\n We continue to make progress on our transformation metrics as we shift our business to more software and subscriptions. We saw strong performance in our ARR of $23.2 billion, which increased 7% with product ARR growth of 12%. \n Total software revenue was $3.9 billion, an increase of 5%, with software subscription revenue up 11%. 85% of the software revenue was subscription based, which is up 5 percentage points year-over-year. We continue to have over $2 billion of software orders in our product backlog.\n Total subscription revenue was $5.9 billion, an increase of 6%. Total subscription revenue represented 43% of Cisco's total revenue. And RPO was up -- was $30.9 billion, up 3%. Product RPO increased 5%, and service RPO increased 1%. Total short-term RPO grew to $16.4 billion.\n In terms of orders in Q1, we had the second highest Q1 orders in our history. Although product orders were down 14% for the quarter, it's important to keep in mind that they compare against 34% growth from a year ago. We continue to have low cancellation rates, which remain below prepandemic levels. \n Looking at our geographic segments year-on-year. The Americas was down 10%. EMEA was down 23% and APJC down 10%. In our customer markets, service provider was down 23%, commercial was down 14%, Enterprise was down 13% and public sector was down 7%. \n Total non-GAAP gross margin came in within our guidance range at 63%, down 150 basis points year-over-year. Product gross margin was 61%, down 280 basis points, and service gross margin was 68.8%, up 230 basis points. In our product gross margin, the decrease was primarily driven by both component costs as well as higher freight and logistics costs related to supply constraint. This was partially offset by strong positive pricing impact as a result of the actions we took in the prior year as well as some benefit from product mix.\n Backlog levels for both our hardware and software continue to far exceed historical levels. As we navigated a complex supply environment, we were able to increase our shipments this quarter, resulting in about a 10% decrease in total backlog sequentially, which remains at the second highest level we've seen. Just a reminder, backlog is not included as part of our $30.9 billion in remaining performance obligations. Combined, our significant backlog and RPO continued to provide great visibility for our top line. \n Shifting to the balance sheet. We ended Q1 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $19.8 billion. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $4 billion, up 16% year-over-year.\n In capital allocation, we returned $2.1 billion to shareholders during the quarter that was comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and approximately $500 million of share repurchases. All of this is in line with our long-term objective of returning a minimum of 50% of free cash flow annually to our shareholders. We also ended the quarter with $14.7 billion in stock repurchase authorization.\n To summarize, we executed well in Q1 in a highly complex environment, delivering better-than-expected top line growth and non-GAAP profitability. We continue to make progress on our business model shift to more recurring revenue while making strategic investments in innovation to capitalize on our significant growth opportunities. \n Consistent with that objective, we announced some restructuring actions focused on prioritizing our investments across our highest growth opportunities and rightsizing our real estate footprint to help maximize long-term value for our shareholders.\n Turning to our financial guidance for Q2. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 4.5% to 6.5%. We anticipate non-GAAP gross margins to be in the range of 63% to 64%. Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 31.5% to 32.5%. And non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.84 to $0.86.\n For fiscal year '23, our guidance is, we are raising our expectations for revenue growth to be in the range of 4.5% to 6.5% year-on-year. This is up from the prior range of 4% to 6% growth. Non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is expected to range from $3.51 to $3.58, also up 4.5% to 6.5% year-on-year. In both our Q2 and full year guidance, we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. \n Our Q2 guidance reflects the increased visibility we have from our significant backlog and the RPO we have built up with our business model transformation as well as the easing of supply constraints. The full year guidance rolls forward our Q1 overperformance with a prudent view of the remainder of the year.\n I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A. \nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Scott. Michelle, let's go ahead and queue up the Q&A. \nOperator: Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. \nMeta Marshall: Congrats on the quarter. Chuck, I was just wondering if you could dive a little bit into -- more into kind of the commentary that you gave about Europe and just also kind of what you're seeing in terms of level of activity or level of approvals needed within the U.S., that would be helpful. \nCharles Robbins: Thanks, Meta. Yes, we saw -- Europe is obviously being impacted by the energy costs. And I think that's just forcing companies to take a look at their P&L as you would have to and where they spend their dollars. And we continue to see it not be quite as cold there. We had conversations with some of our team members this week, which is a positive sign. \n But the other thing that I called out that I think is an important one is that customers are trying to solve this energy cost issue in a very aggressive way. And we have several technology areas that can help them do that, including our Silicon One technology, which powers their networks at much lower power consumption. You've got IoT where we can connect these energy systems and make them more efficient as well as Power-Over-Ethernet, which actually just reduces the power footprint for our customers. So it does also create some opportunity.\n I'd say if I go to Asia real quick, you've got -- Asia was actually pretty resilient. They're clearly aware of the economic situation that's going on, but we had 5 regions last quarter that were positive after big positives a year ago, including India, which grew significantly after significant growth the prior year. So that was a good sign. So Asia's pretty resilient, it feels like right now.\n And then in the Americas, I'd say it's a little mixed. We have some customers who are powering forward and other customers who are taking a little cautious outlook. We think by December, we'll have better visibility to the 2023 budgets, which will be helpful. And to your question about more signatures, we have seen -- our customers have implemented greater signature requirements. But by and large, the deals that we have going are getting signed. They're just taking a little bit longer than we'd expect. \nOperator: Tal Liani from Bank of America. \nTal Liani: Great quarter, and I see that the numbers are going up, but the question is how much of it is backlog flush and how much of it is the environment? Meaning, I look at your product growth -- product orders. It's down 14%. Last quarter, it's down 6%. And the question is how is the environment itself? Is the environment weakening from an orders bookings, backlog? Is the environment weakening and what we're seeing is acceleration because of supply constraints that are easing? Or is the environment holding up? And maybe you can refer to some kind of -- some of your big product categories to see how the trends are. \nCharles Robbins: Yes. Thanks, Tal. So this is a question we expected, so I'm going to give you a little more detail than I probably normally would. First off, the 2 quarters we just finished and the next quarter, we have massive year-over-year comparisons from prior year. So as we discussed last time, we think it's more important to look at sequential growth as an indicator. And as I said, we were slightly below our historic quarter-to-quarter range, roughly 1%. So it wasn't significant, not completely out of line, certainly a little lighter than we would expect normally but not significant. \n Enterprise and commercial on a global basis were both within the normal sequential range. Public sector was slightly out of range, and service provider's just lumpy. So the sequential reflection on service provider is not really valid. So demand was not -- it didn't fall off a cliff by any stretch. In fact, U.S. enterprise, after a upper 20s growth in the prior year, they actually posted low single-digit positive growth again. So that was a positive sign. Our order linearity within the quarter was in line. And remember, it was our second largest Q1 orders ever. So only -- the only quarter that was bigger was the quarter a year ago. So that's positive.\n Now what you're trying to get at, and I think everybody is trying to get at is, is this year being driven by backlog? And then as we go beyond that, everything falls apart. So let me give you some data points on this. Even if our orders are down 10% this year, which is not our forecast, we will still -- we project today that we will end the fiscal year with 2 to 3x our historic year-end normal backlog. That normal backlog is typically $4 billion to $5 billion. So I'm giving you actual numbers here. And then when you couple that with 43% of our revenue now coming from recurring, which is reflected in our RPO, that's what gives us a high degree of confidence and a high degree of visibility in the near term. So hopefully, that helps you as I answer your question, Tal. \nOperator: David Vogt from UBS. \nDavid Vogt: Chuck, maybe just as a point of clarification, you talked about the sequential decline. It was a little bit worse than seasonal. But you took down backlog by about 10%, looks like quarter-over-quarter. Can you just kind of help square those numbers because that sounds -- if I just say that you did about 13.1% last year in the fourth quarter, you'd be a little bit below [Technical Difficulty]. \nMarilyn Mora: David, I think we may have lost you. \nDavid Vogt: Can you guys hear me? \nMarilyn Mora: Now we can. \nDavid Vogt: Just can you help square the backlog versus the sequential commentary? If I look at your quarter-over-quarter backlog commentary, that was slightly below seasonal, but it sounds like you took down backlog by about 10%. So it seems like there's about $600 million or $700 million of revenue that we're [indiscernible] to kind of triangulate on. So if you can kind of talk just walk through that, that would be helpful. \nRichard Herren: Sure. Yes. The backlog came down about 10%, leaving us with an ending backlog at the end of Q1 that was the second highest in our history and higher than what we had seen at the end of Q3. So we took a spike up a little more than 10% in Q4 and came back down in Q1. What Chuck was talking about on the sequentials is really about the overall product bookings that came in versus where we're standing in backlog. So the flow-through of orders come in, drop in the backlog, that backlog then converts into revenue. The way you got to think about it is less about does the change in backlog convert to revenue growth and more of does the change in backlog convert to build. \nCharles Robbins: And remember, bookings contribute to both backlog and RPO. \nDavid Vogt: Got it. And maybe just one final thing on profitability. When software comes out of backlog, I would imagine that would have been a tailwind for gross margins in the quarter. Can you kind of quantify what that might have been in the quarter, given obviously, there's some supply chain pressure and logistics pressures on margin? \nRichard Herren: Yes, you said it right. Longer term, the software component continuing to grow and us being able to ship that out of backlog will be a tailwind to margins. Right now, what we're shipping out of backlog is still a lot of aged product. We made great progress, by the way, on our aged backlog during the quarter, but a lot of what we're shipping out still is orders that were received prior to the price increases. \n So you see 2 things happening at once. You see the higher cost and the revenue is tied to pre-price-increase sales at the same -- which obviously is a headwind to margins. At the same time, we see more software being shipped out, which is a tailwind. The net is it continues to be a pretty significant headwind. 61% product gross margin in the quarter, in line with what we had seen in Q4.\n The good news is we made good progress on shipping out a lot of that aged backlog. There's still a little bit more to get out in Q2. And so I expect by the end of the year, margins to expand from where they are now, product margins to expand 50 to 75 basis points. \nOperator: Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. \nIttai Kidron: Nice results. Chuck, I want to go back to your answer to Tal's question. It's very clear that with orders down and your ability to fulfill now much more enhanced that the backlog over the next few quarters will just continue to decline. So help us get our hands around what would be a level of decline that would make you worry versus a level of decline that you'd think as a normal pace in going back to historical normal levels. What would be the line in the sand would you say where you would say, more than this, we probably have an issue, but if it's around X, then it's perfectly normal and reasonable that, that will happen over the next 12, 18 months? \nCharles Robbins: Yes, Ittai. We've actually modeled out various bookings scenarios for the year, and it would have to be significantly worse than what I told you for it to be concerning. Scott, do you have any other comments? \nRichard Herren: No. I think what you're trying to get at is when do we get back to more seasonal patterns, right? Obviously, seasonality went out the window, both going into the pandemic and then coming out of it with those 3 consecutive quarters of north of 30% growth. We are beginning to see signs of normal seasonality returning. It's going to be a little complex to see, though, because, as supply constraints loosen up, we'll be able to reduce lead times. We've already done that for a handful of product lines. And as we do that, of course, that will have an effect on just the current period bookings. So it's going to be a little bit difficult for you to spot those trends over the next few quarters as lead times normalize. \nOperator: Tim Long from Barclays. \nTimothy Long: Two quick ones, if I could. Maybe, Chuck, on the cloud vertical, could you talk a little bit -- still talking double-digit orders there, could you kind of just parse out the deceleration in terms of maybe just normalization of extra quarters of ordering verse potential for -- there's been a lot of talk of normalization of spend by the cloud players next year, if you could kind of parse those 2 out. \n And then on the software side, just curious if you can update us. It sounds like a lot of hardware converted, which helped. Could you talk a little bit about kind of 9K renewals and maybe any of the other standalone software offerings that you think could also help that growth number the next few quarters? \nCharles Robbins: Yes. Two good questions, Tim. So on the cloud vertical, I think you're calling out the right thing that the normalization of the orders is going to probably occur over the next few quarters. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised to see our trailing fourth quarter rates over the next couple quarters, maybe even dip negative because of such -- so much ordering ahead that we've seen. But we continue to see real strong demand in general from them. We've done a great deal of long-term planning with them. We have some number of orders that aren't even in book -- they don't even show up in bookings yet because they're out past our bookings lead time window. So that's positive. So we continue to see success there. We continue to win franchises, and we feel good about where we are there.\n On the software side, what I would say is that the 9K renewals are improving. They're still not material right now. I think next year, we'll see that occur. What we did announce is the -- this past year is that we are going to manage all of the Catalyst portfolio under the Meraki dashboard, the Meraki platform, and that will be delivered to our customers who have the DNA license and the premium license. So we think that, in itself, we've already launched the monitoring capability there and the management. We think we'll even include -- we'll even improve our renewals beyond that. But as we said, we had a record quarter for Cat 9K. So we're real happy with how it's performing. Scott? \nRichard Herren: Yes. What I'd add to that, Tim, is if you're looking at software growth, bear in mind, the software subscription growth, the subscription subset of our total software grew 11%. And it's now 85% of the total. Obviously, with the total only growing 5%, there was a continued decline in perpetual as part of the software license. It's now -- or software revenue. It's now 15% of our total. So I think we're getting to a point where the subscription base is getting significantly larger than what's in perpetual, and that headwind on perpetual will be less of an impact on us going forward. \nOperator: Paul Silverstein with Cowen and Company. \nPaul Silverstein: I appreciate you taking the question. At the risk of asking something you can't or will not respond to, Scott. I was hoping to ask go back to the margin question, two related questions. One, well, just for clarification, the 50 to 75 basis point product margin improvement, I assume that's off of the current quarter. Is that the reference point? \nRichard Herren: Yes, 50 to 75 off the current quarter, that's right, by the time we get to Q4. \nPaul Silverstein: Right. And now for the subsequent question, longer term, and I recognize there's a lot of moving pieces, and it's a tough environment to predict. But longer term, can you get back to or even exceed, be almost 67% growth and 34% operating margin from early '21? Those were -- your gross margin was a 15-year high. Your operating margin, you would have to go back to '97, I think, the last time you put up that type of number. Obviously, you're far off those numbers as has everybody else from what they were doing 1.5 years ago, prepandemic. But where do you think you could get back to long term?\n And related to that, what are your expectations, your plans for growing OpEx? I assume you want to drive some degree of leverage in definitive gross margin. Any thoughts you can share? The OpEx growth this quarter, I think, was 4% or 5%. It strikes me as a little bit high. But any thoughts in terms of what your thoughts are going forward? \nRichard Herren: Sure. Let me take the gross margin piece of that first. There's a couple of moving parts, as you know, Paul, inside the gross margins. One is the backlog, some of which is still sitting at pre-price-increase levels. We'll get that shipped out as we work our way through that part of the backlog. Obviously, that'll be a tailwind. The increasing component of software built into our revenues will be a tailwind. Will it get back to 65%? I think there's -- for that to happen, we'll have to see either further cost reductions on the input side between freight and logistics, which we are beginning to see. While they're up year-on-year, sequentially, we're beginning to see some signs of easing in freight and logistic costs as well, but we'll have to see that. And we'll have to see a further reduction in component cost and/or a price increase. So I think it's -- without giving you a quantified number, I think there's a number of moving parts inside there. More tailwinds as we look ahead than there are headwinds on that.\n On the OpEx side, the part of what you see in this quarter, of course, is that the normalization of our bonus plans, last year, bonus plan obviously didn't pay out so well, as we go into this year, and you normalize that, that's part of the OpEx growth. We did have a slightly bigger than normal annual merit increase cycle. That's driving some of the OpEx growth as well. I think our focus longer term is -- which you've heard me say, it's balanced profitable growth, right? If you look at our guide for the year, 4.5% to 6.5% growth in the top line, 4.5% to 6.5% on the bottom line. Long term, we talked about 5% to 7% top line, 5% to 7% bottom line. I think that's really the way you need to think about it. \nOperator: George Notter with Jefferies. \nGeorge Notter: I wanted to ask about the impact of foreign exchange. Obviously, U.S. dollar at 20-year highs. Maybe you can talk about how you're broaching that conversation with customers internationally. Are you seeing any diminishment of demand? What's the picture? \nRichard Herren: Yes, I'll start with the numbers on that, George. And I'm sure you know this. We sell about 90% of our revenue denominated in USD. So there's not a big translation impact to us for the strength of the dollar. It's not insignificant, but it gets offset by the benefit we get on the OpEx line. So FX to us from a translation standpoint really hasn't had a material impact.\n As we look at the -- now you're selling in USD with an elevated exchange rate to the dollar, there's no question that is having a bit of an impact. Certainly, one of the things contributing to what Chuck talked about earlier that we're seeing in Europe, not only are they battling high inflation in their own markets, but that increased cost in local currency to transact has been a bit of a headwind. But we've dealt with this. We've sold in USD through the entire history of the company. Not expecting it to be something that has a lasting impact on us. \nOperator: Amit Daryanani from Evercore. \nAmit Daryanani: I guess, maybe the first one, I was hoping you could touch on the service provider market. I think you said orders were down 23%. That seems a bit more severe than the rest of the portfolio. What's happening there in any newly service provider versus web scale would be helpful. \nCharles Robbins: I couldn't understand the question. \nMarilyn Mora: Can you repeat the question? \nAmit Daryanani: Yes, sorry. So I was hoping you could talk a bit about the service provider order decline of 23%, seemed a bit more severe than the rest of the business. And then anything over there between web scale and kind of the traditional service providers would be helpful. \nCharles Robbins: Yes. Amit, thank you for that. And I think the reality around that one is simply if you go back a year ago, that segment grew 65%. I think that's the fundamental issue. I don't think there's anything else going on. \nAmit Daryanani: Got it. And I guess maybe if I could just ask you just about the full year guide. I mean, you folks have guided it, right? And you just did 6% growth against a very difficult compare, and I guess the way to your guide, but you aren't really assuming much of an acceleration for the rest of the year despite compares are getting easier. So I guess, Chuck, is that just being conservative, or are you seeing signs in your backlog or your orders that give you a pause on that business. If you could show how easily the compares here, I would imagine the growth rate accelerate a bit for the year. \nCharles Robbins: No, there's nothing that's giving us pause in that. I mean, we guided up the full year in revenue from what had been a guide of 4% to 6% growth to 4.5% to 6.5%. That effectively rolls forward the outperformance that we had in Q1 into the full year. There's no change in the way we're looking at the second half of the year either plus or minus. But it's a prudent view of what we expect in the next 3 quarters. \nOperator: Simon Leopold with Raymond James. \nSimon Leopold: I wanted to see if there was some way you could characterize your own lead time. So if you had customers placing orders today from Meraki products or campus switches or data center gear, what are the lead times for getting the product for your customers? And how does that compare to the prior quarter and prior year? \nCharles Robbins: Yes, I'll make some comments, and then, Scott, if you want to add some color, feel free. The range on the products is very wide right now. We still have a couple product areas that we have component issues that we're doing some work, and I think we've got probably one more quarter before we start improving those. We've got other products like we have certain firewalls that are down to 3-week lead times. We have some of the products we've redesigned that I've talked about before. It went from 40 weeks to 12 weeks and will continue to improve. I think we made improvements in roughly half of the portfolio. Half of the product families improved during the last quarter, and we would expect to continue that progress as we move forward. \nSimon Leopold: And just as a quick follow-up. As you're showing improvement, do you see that affecting your ability to maintain or take market share where perhaps you were more vulnerable when the lead times were more extended? \nCharles Robbins: Yes. I think the whole market share discussion is reflected in our backlog. I mean, that's the issue. And as we ship it, you will see us -- I think, you'll see us over the next 12 months gain market share as we have an outsized backlog that we'll be delivering. So I would expect that to have a positive impact. \nOperator: James Fish with Piper Sandler. \nJames Fish: On the restructuring plan, I know these things are never easy, but -- and we had picked up that the collaboration side was seeing some layoffs, but what product areas are being most hit? How should we think about the reduction of headcount here overall? What's the strategy to change the direction of some of these growth businesses around that have been kind of struggling to growth? And by that, I really mean the collaboration side. And how much are you guys factoring this kind of impact into the top line here on guide? \nCharles Robbins: Yes. So we're actually speaking to our employees tomorrow about this. So I'd be reluctant to go into a lot of detail here until we're able to talk to them. I would say that what we're doing is rightsizing certain businesses. We're really focused on resources moving into like in the enterprise networking space, accelerating our platform strategy. We'll be making significant investments in security and beefing up our team there and the capacity to continue to innovate there. Those are important areas.\n And so if you would understand, I'd prefer to wait and talk to our employees tomorrow about it. But you can just assume that we're going to -- we're not actually -- there's nothing that's a lower priority, but we are rightsizing certain businesses. And since you asked about collab, I'll tell you a little bit about what -- we see incredible strength right now in our Calling business, our Cloud Calling business. We see great strength in our Cloud Contact Center business. And the compares on the meeting side are going to start to make that -- give us the ability for that to be a much more favorable component. So we're -- I actually am optimistic over the next 12 months about our collaboration portfolio. The team has done an amazing job. I truly believe that they built the best platform in the business.\n And when you look at our devices and the interoperability that the team has been driving with the Microsoft interoperability, that is a huge, huge thing when you -- from a customer perspective for us to give them that flexibility. So I think they've done a good job, and I feel pretty good about that business as we go forward. We just need to rightsize some of the OpEx. \nRichard Herren: And James, to be clear, don't think of this as an headcount action that is motivated by cost savings. This really is a rebalancing. As we look across the board, there are areas that we would like to invest in more. Chuck just talked about them. Security, our move to platforms and more cloud-delivered products. But we're also going to maintain our financial discipline as we do that. And so this is about just rebalancing across the board. In a perfect world, you'd have 100% skill match, and you can take the people in the areas or the skills in certain areas and just move them to where we need to invest. And unfortunately, that's -- it's not a perfect world. \nCharles Robbins: But we do have a -- if you look at the number of jobs that we have opened in the areas that we're trying to invest, it is just slightly lower than the number of people that we believe will be impacted. We're going to be working really hard to help match our employees to those roles to the extent there's a skill match. So we're going to work really hard at that. \nJames Fish: If I could just follow up quickly on that. I appreciate the color there, guys, and understand the sensitivity you guys want to have. In terms of that $600 million hit, though Scott, should we expect that to actually be the net savings as a result? Or is that going to -- the net saving's actually going to be lower because you're kind of repositioning some folks? \nRichard Herren: Yes. It's really not motivated by cost savings. So the net -- by the time we get to the end of the year, our expectation is we have about the same headcount that we had at the beginning of the year. But there's 2 pieces to this. One is what we've been speaking about just now about the headcount impact. There's a second piece of this that's really about rightsizing our real estate portfolio. And we've got a long tail of small offices distributed around the world that are significantly underutilized and, in fact, unused in some cases.\n So the second piece of that charge, there will be 2 elements to it. One that's people related. The second piece will be about rightsizing our real estate portfolio. That will generate some savings, not much in fiscal '23. But longer term, that will generate some savings. \nOperator: Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. \nSamik Chatterjee: Congrats on the strong print. I guess, I just had one. I think if I can go back to the -- Chuck, your comments about seeing hesitation from EMEA customers, a bit more given the macro backdrop there? And you spoke about the opportunities that you see at the same time. Maybe if we can ask you when you start seeing the hesitation from the customers there? How are you seeing them prioritize across your portfolio? Like when it comes to data center versus campus versus security as they're reevaluating their spend or hesitating investments, like how are they prioritizing within your portfolio, and we see areas are getting impacted by that? \nCharles Robbins: Yes, Samik, it's a good question. And I would say -- the first thing I would say is that Gartner recently came out with a survey of executives in our customer base, and they've -- almost half of them said that their technology investments will be the last thing they cut. So that's just a backdrop for, I think, how important customers view their technology investments these days.\n When we look at where customers are investing, many of them are investing to -- they're moving forward with their hybrid work investments, right, and creating the infrastructure that they need to deal with this new world. We see customers continuing. We saw a recent survey that talked about customers who are balancing their private cloud and public cloud workloads. And so the whole rearchitecture of the infrastructure to deal with these new traffic patterns is another area. I mentioned in Europe with the power, with the energy costs, there's a lot of focus.\n IoT has just been accelerating over the last 2 to 3 years, and we saw another -- I think we had a record bookings quarter in Q1, I believe. It was really strong, where customers are really looking to connect these systems to actually optimize their power consumption and their efficiency. And again, we see a lot of customers who are moving -- who are doing greenfield real estate projects that are really focused on reducing -- going to low-voltage architectures, which leads them to Power-over-Ethernet, which leads them to rebuilding their infrastructure.\n And then you've got cybersecurity, and you've got full stack observability. We continue to see 5G build-outs there. There are just lots of -- there's a lot of positive tailwinds, notwithstanding the short-term dynamic environment that we're in. \nOperator: Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. \nAhmed Sami Badri: Chuck, I wanted to go back to a comment you made regarding market share and some of that sitting in the backlog. Now if we assumed that there was nothing in the backlog and all the numbers that you generated were publicly reported through your financial statements, would that show that Cisco actually maintained or increased or even lost market share? \nCharles Robbins: You mean if all our backlog was actually shipped and reported? \nAhmed Sami Badri: Correct. \nCharles Robbins: Yes. I think that will be true. I mean, look, we operate in lots of different markets. So is it true 100% of the markets? That would be difficult for me to say. But I believe that as we ship out the -- particularly our Secure Agile networks, our enterprise and networking products, that's certainly going to help. As we catch up on our data center infrastructure, I think that's going to help.\n There's also just reporting dynamics that occur. Some of our competitors report certain routing products into data center switching, and we've reported into routing, which makes it difficult to ascertain. So it's an imperfect science on top of that. But I do believe that as we -- as our backlog unwinds and gets back to normal levels over the next 18, 24 months, then I think that you'll see -- I think you will see that dynamic. \nAhmed Sami Badri: Got it. Just to be clear, that is Cisco gain share? I don't know, just to make sure I heard you correctly. \nCharles Robbins: I think that's right. In certain key areas. I mean, not perhaps across everyone. I'd have to go do the analysis. But in some of the key ones that I know all of you are worried about, the answer is yes. \nRichard Herren: In the bigger markets. \nCharles Robbins: In the bigger markets. \nAhmed Sami Badri: Got it. And then one question just for Scott. So Scott, maybe you could tell us where in fiscal 1Q of '23 did shipments begin to start accelerating just because we want to kind of understand the trend here going from now through fiscal 4Q and putting into that product gross margin comment into perspective. What I'm really trying to understand is, as shipments start to accelerate, how much will software attach to those shipments just so I can understand the glide path here, what happens in some of the other segments outside of just secure network, agile networks, et cetera, right? I'm just trying to get this kind of like this pull dynamic that may occur from the other segments related to shipments going out the door. \nRichard Herren: Got it. Yes, we -- so we talked about the overall backlog reduction at about 10% from Q4 to where we ended Q1. That -- a subset of that, of course, is software. That same percent held pretty much true in software. Software continues to be well over $2 billion of our overall product backlog. But it's about -- it's actually about the same reduction sequentially as we saw in overall backlog so right around the 10% rate.\n I think as you look ahead and try to model out the 50 to 75 bps of improvement that I talked about, I think it's going to be probably a little bit heavier in the second half of the year than it will be in the second quarter. You saw the guide for the second quarter. \nMarilyn Mora: I'll turn it over to Chuck for some closing remarks. \nCharles Robbins: Thanks, Marilyn, and thank you all for joining us today. I just want to reiterate it, we feel like we had a very strong quarter, largest quarterly revenue in history. As I said earlier, the orders, the visibility, the easing of supply chain gives us the confidence to raise the year, obviously. We're very focused. We're managing the business for growth. We are going to go through this process of reinvesting into strategic areas. And the people impact is difficult. And I just want our employees who are listening in today to know that this afternoon and tomorrow, we'll be communicating about how we're going to go about this. It's always a difficult decision, but we have a lot of opportunity.\n I'm very optimistic about the future. I'm proud of the teams and what they've accomplished and really excited about the visibility and the confidence that we have in the near term. So thanks for joining us, and we look forward to next time. \nMarilyn Mora: Thanks, Chuck. Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call, which will reflect our fiscal year 2023 second quarter results will be on Wednesday, February 15, 2023, at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time, 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.\n This concludes today's call.

            "content": "Thanks, Chuck. We started the fiscal year with a strong Q1, reflecting solid execution and disciplined management. We had record total revenue of $13.6 billion, exceeding the high end of our guidance range, driven by product shipment levels above our expectations and continued improvements in component supply.\n Non-GAAP operating margin was 31.8%, down 150 basis points, in line with our guidance range, primarily driven by higher component costs as well as logistics costs related to supply constraints. Non-GAAP net income was $3.5 billion, up 2%, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.86, up 5%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range.\n Looking at our Q1 revenue in more detail. Total product revenue was $10.2 billion, up 8%, and service revenue was flat at $3.4 billion. Within product revenue, Secure Agile Networks performed well, up 12%. Switching revenue grew with double-digit growth in campus switching, driven by growth in our Catalyst 9000 and Meraki offerings. While data center switching modestly declined, we saw solid growth in our Nexus 9000 offering. Enterprise routing declined primarily from the product transition to our Catalyst 8000 series routers along with constrained supply. Wireless had very strong double-digit growth driven primarily by our WiFi 6 products and Meraki wireless offering.\n Internet for the Future was down 5%, driven by declines in Cable, Optical and Edge. We saw growth in our Cisco 8000 offering and strong double-digit growth in web scale. Collaboration was down 2%, driven by a decline in meetings, partially offset by growth in calling. End-to-end security was up 9%, driven by unified threat management and Zero Trust offerings. Our Zero Trust portfolio continues to perform well, driven by strong performance in our Duo offering. Optimized application experiences was up 7%, driven by double-digit growth in our SaaS-based offering, ThousandEyes.\n We continue to make progress on our transformation metrics as we shift our business to more software and subscriptions. We saw strong performance in our ARR of $23.2 billion, which increased 7% with product ARR growth of 12%. \n Total software revenue was $3.9 billion, an increase of 5%, with software subscription revenue up 11%. 85% of the software revenue was subscription based, which is up 5 percentage points year-over-year. We continue to have over $2 billion of software orders in our product backlog.\n Total subscription revenue was $5.9 billion, an increase of 6%. Total subscription revenue represented 43% of Cisco's total revenue. And RPO was up -- was $30.9 billion, up 3%. Product RPO increased 5%, and service RPO increased 1%. Total short-term RPO grew to $16.4 billion.\n In terms of orders in Q1, we had the second highest Q1 orders in our history. Although product orders were down 14% for the quarter, it's important to keep in mind that they compare against 34% growth from a year ago. We continue to have low cancellation rates, which remain below prepandemic levels. \n Looking at our geographic segments year-on-year. The Americas was down 10%. EMEA was down 23% and APJC down 10%. In our customer markets, service provider was down 23%, commercial was down 14%, Enterprise was down 13% and public sector was down 7%. \n Total non-GAAP gross margin came in within our guidance range at 63%, down 150 basis points year-over-year. Product gross margin was 61%, down 280 basis points, and service gross margin was 68.8%, up 230 basis points. In our product gross margin, the decrease was primarily driven by both component costs as well as higher freight and logistics costs related to supply constraint. This was partially offset by strong positive pricing impact as a result of the actions we took in the prior year as well as some benefit from product mix.\n Backlog levels for both our hardware and software continue to far exceed historical levels. As we navigated a complex supply environment, we were able to increase our shipments this quarter, resulting in about a 10% decrease in total backlog sequentially, which remains at the second highest level we've seen. Just a reminder, backlog is not included as part of our $30.9 billion in remaining performance obligations. Combined, our significant backlog and RPO continued to provide great visibility for our top line. \n Shifting to the balance sheet. We ended Q1 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $19.8 billion. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $4 billion, up 16% year-over-year.\n In capital allocation, we returned $2.1 billion to shareholders during the quarter that was comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and approximately $500 million of share repurchases. All of this is in line with our long-term objective of returning a minimum of 50% of free cash flow annually to our shareholders. We also ended the quarter with $14.7 billion in stock repurchase authorization.\n To summarize, we executed well in Q1 in a highly complex environment, delivering better-than-expected top line growth and non-GAAP profitability. We continue to make progress on our business model shift to more recurring revenue while making strategic investments in innovation to capitalize on our significant growth opportunities. \n Consistent with that objective, we announced some restructuring actions focused on prioritizing our investments across our highest growth opportunities and rightsizing our real estate footprint to help maximize long-term value for our shareholders.\n Turning to our financial guidance for Q2. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 4.5% to 6.5%. We anticipate non-GAAP gross margins to be in the range of 63% to 64%. Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 31.5% to 32.5%. And non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.84 to $0.86.\n For fiscal year '23, our guidance is, we are raising our expectations for revenue growth to be in the range of 4.5% to 6.5% year-on-year. This is up from the prior range of 4% to 6% growth. Non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is expected to range from $3.51 to $3.58, also up 4.5% to 6.5% year-on-year. In both our Q2 and full year guidance, we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. \n Our Q2 guidance reflects the increased visibility we have from our significant backlog and the RPO we have built up with our business model transformation as well as the easing of supply constraints. The full year guidance rolls forward our Q1 overperformance with a prudent view of the remainder of the year.\n I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A. Sure. Yes. The backlog came down about 10%, leaving us with an ending backlog at the end of Q1 that was the second highest in our history and higher than what we had seen at the end of Q3. So we took a spike up a little more than 10% in Q4 and came back down in Q1. What Chuck was talking about on the sequentials is really about the overall product bookings that came in versus where we're standing in backlog. So the flow-through of orders come in, drop in the backlog, that backlog then converts into revenue. The way you got to think about it is less about does the change in backlog convert to revenue growth and more of does the change in backlog convert to build. Yes, you said it right. Longer term, the software component continuing to grow and us being able to ship that out of backlog will be a tailwind to margins. Right now, what we're shipping out of backlog is still a lot of aged product. We made great progress, by the way, on our aged backlog during the quarter, but a lot of what we're shipping out still is orders that were received prior to the price increases. \n So you see 2 things happening at once. You see the higher cost and the revenue is tied to pre-price-increase sales at the same -- which obviously is a headwind to margins. At the same time, we see more software being shipped out, which is a tailwind. The net is it continues to be a pretty significant headwind. 61% product gross margin in the quarter, in line with what we had seen in Q4.\n The good news is we made good progress on shipping out a lot of that aged backlog. There's still a little bit more to get out in Q2. And so I expect by the end of the year, margins to expand from where they are now, product margins to expand 50 to 75 basis points. No. I think what you're trying to get at is when do we get back to more seasonal patterns, right? Obviously, seasonality went out the window, both going into the pandemic and then coming out of it with those 3 consecutive quarters of north of 30% growth. We are beginning to see signs of normal seasonality returning. It's going to be a little complex to see, though, because, as supply constraints loosen up, we'll be able to reduce lead times. We've already done that for a handful of product lines. And as we do that, of course, that will have an effect on just the current period bookings. So it's going to be a little bit difficult for you to spot those trends over the next few quarters as lead times normalize. Yes. What I'd add to that, Tim, is if you're looking at software growth, bear in mind, the software subscription growth, the subscription subset of our total software grew 11%. And it's now 85% of the total. Obviously, with the total only growing 5%, there was a continued decline in perpetual as part of the software license. It's now -- or software revenue. It's now 15% of our total. So I think we're getting to a point where the subscription base is getting significantly larger than what's in perpetual, and that headwind on perpetual will be less of an impact on us going forward. Yes, 50 to 75 off the current quarter, that's right, by the time we get to Q4. Sure. Let me take the gross margin piece of that first. There's a couple of moving parts, as you know, Paul, inside the gross margins. One is the backlog, some of which is still sitting at pre-price-increase levels. We'll get that shipped out as we work our way through that part of the backlog. Obviously, that'll be a tailwind. The increasing component of software built into our revenues will be a tailwind. Will it get back to 65%? I think there's -- for that to happen, we'll have to see either further cost reductions on the input side between freight and logistics, which we are beginning to see. While they're up year-on-year, sequentially, we're beginning to see some signs of easing in freight and logistic costs as well, but we'll have to see that. And we'll have to see a further reduction in component cost and/or a price increase. So I think it's -- without giving you a quantified number, I think there's a number of moving parts inside there. More tailwinds as we look ahead than there are headwinds on that.\n On the OpEx side, the part of what you see in this quarter, of course, is that the normalization of our bonus plans, last year, bonus plan obviously didn't pay out so well, as we go into this year, and you normalize that, that's part of the OpEx growth. We did have a slightly bigger than normal annual merit increase cycle. That's driving some of the OpEx growth as well. I think our focus longer term is -- which you've heard me say, it's balanced profitable growth, right? If you look at our guide for the year, 4.5% to 6.5% growth in the top line, 4.5% to 6.5% on the bottom line. Long term, we talked about 5% to 7% top line, 5% to 7% bottom line. I think that's really the way you need to think about it. Yes, I'll start with the numbers on that, George. And I'm sure you know this. We sell about 90% of our revenue denominated in USD. So there's not a big translation impact to us for the strength of the dollar. It's not insignificant, but it gets offset by the benefit we get on the OpEx line. So FX to us from a translation standpoint really hasn't had a material impact.\n As we look at the -- now you're selling in USD with an elevated exchange rate to the dollar, there's no question that is having a bit of an impact. Certainly, one of the things contributing to what Chuck talked about earlier that we're seeing in Europe, not only are they battling high inflation in their own markets, but that increased cost in local currency to transact has been a bit of a headwind. But we've dealt with this. We've sold in USD through the entire history of the company. Not expecting it to be something that has a lasting impact on us. And James, to be clear, don't think of this as an headcount action that is motivated by cost savings. This really is a rebalancing. As we look across the board, there are areas that we would like to invest in more. Chuck just talked about them. Security, our move to platforms and more cloud-delivered products. But we're also going to maintain our financial discipline as we do that. And so this is about just rebalancing across the board. In a perfect world, you'd have 100% skill match, and you can take the people in the areas or the skills in certain areas and just move them to where we need to invest. And unfortunately, that's -- it's not a perfect world. Yes. It's really not motivated by cost savings. So the net -- by the time we get to the end of the year, our expectation is we have about the same headcount that we had at the beginning of the year. But there's 2 pieces to this. One is what we've been speaking about just now about the headcount impact. There's a second piece of this that's really about rightsizing our real estate portfolio. And we've got a long tail of small offices distributed around the world that are significantly underutilized and, in fact, unused in some cases.\n So the second piece of that charge, there will be 2 elements to it. One that's people related. The second piece will be about rightsizing our real estate portfolio. That will generate some savings, not much in fiscal '23. But longer term, that will generate some savings. In the bigger markets. Got it. Yes, we -- so we talked about the overall backlog reduction at about 10% from Q4 to where we ended Q1. That -- a subset of that, of course, is software. That same percent held pretty much true in software. Software continues to be well over $2 billion of our overall product backlog. But it's about -- it's actually about the same reduction sequentially as we saw in overall backlog so right around the 10% rate.\n I think as you look ahead and try to model out the 50 to 75 bps of improvement that I talked about, I think it's going to be probably a little bit heavier in the second half of the year than it will be in the second quarter. You saw the guide for the second quarter."

            "content": "Thank you, Marilyn, and thank you all for joining us today. We are off to a good start in fiscal 2023, delivering strong results, exceeding the top end of our guidance range for both revenue and non-GAAP EPS. We delivered the largest quarterly revenue in our history, driven by excellent execution and the actions our team took to remediate our supply challenges. Given these results, along with the strength of our orders, our visibility, and easing supply constraints, we are raising our full year outlook, which Scott will cover later.\n While we are proactively managing through an evolving and complex market environment, we remain intensely focused on executing on our strategy, including our transition to more software and subscription-based recurring revenue. We achieved software revenue growth of 5% year-over-year, and software subscription revenue grew 11%. The easing of supply constraints and our ability to deliver hardware is now releasing software subscriptions that were sitting in backlog connecting to unshipped hardware.\n Our success is also reflected in our ARR, which exceeded $23 billion, increasing 7%, with product ARR growing 12%. We also ended the quarter with RPO of nearly $31 billion, up 3% year-over-year with product RPO up 5%. Over $16 billion of the RPO will be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months with a backlog that remains elevated at near-record levels. \n These metrics give us increased visibility and predictability and provide additional confidence in our ability to perform through the current market cycle. It also underscores our unique position, helping customers become more agile and resilient as they continue to navigate a complex set of challenges.\n As I've done in the past, I'd like to provide an update on supply chain before discussing our Q1 results. Like you've heard from others in the industry, we are encouraged by what we are seeing with modest improvement in certain component availability as shortages continue to ease from last quarter. The redesign of many of our products has also helped bring supply stability and more resiliency. \n Over the last few quarters, you've heard me talk about the actions we've taken to navigate supply constraints. These actions are paying off and are contributing to our results. We now have greater visibility in the ramp of our customer product deliveries, which in turn gives us greater confidence in our fiscal 2023 outlook.\n Now moving to performance highlights in the quarter. We delivered revenues of $13.6 billion, up 6%, and non-GAAP EPS came in at $0.86, our second highest quarterly non-GAAP EPS in the history of the company. We also generated $4 billion in operating cash flow and returned over $2 billion to our shareholders. \n These metrics show we remain committed to operating discipline and our balanced capital allocation priorities. We are continuing to invest in our long-term growth opportunities while also returning capital to shareholders.\n In terms of our product orders in the quarter, it's important to note that the year-over-year comparison is against an unusually strong period of 34% growth in Q1 of fiscal year '22. From a geographic perspective, we saw some emerging cautiousness in Europe. This is driven by a dramatic increase in energy costs and market volatility, which is leading customers to assess their overall spend. However, this also presents an opportunity for us as our technologies like, IoT, Silicon One and power over ethernet drive a significant reduction in power consumption.\n To provide a normalized perspective, our Q4 to Q1 sequential growth was just slightly below the normal range over the last 6 years. It's also important to note that this was the second highest Q1 orders in the history of the company. \n We have strong product revenue momentum in key parts of our business, including Secure Agile Networks, Security and Optimized Application Experiences. We also saw record performance from a number of products, including the Catalyst 9000 family, Cisco 8000, Wireless, Meraki, ThousandEyes and Duo. \n Networking is becoming increasingly critical to every organization, led by digital transformation, hybrid cloud, AI and ML workloads. This is driving demand for our technologies. As we've discussed, there are also tailwinds to our business, such as hybrid work, 400 gig and beyond, 5G, WiFi 6, security and full stack observability. We believe these broader technology transitions will require every customer to rearchitect their network infrastructure and, in turn, fuel long-term growth across our portfolio.\n As I speak with customers, they tell me that, while they're closely watching the economy, they remain focused on making the right investments across their business to increase their agility and drive greater innovation and productivity. \n In our web-scale business, demand remains solid, driven by their growing investments with Cisco to build out AI fabric and massively scalable cloud networks. Once again, we saw strong momentum with our Silicon One-based Cisco 8000 routers. We are experiencing robust demand for our 400 gig products and now have nearly 1,200 customers. On a trailing 12-month basis, web-scale orders were up double digits or greater for the eighth consecutive quarter. \n Network capacity and demand continues to increase, driven by 5G, IoT, pervasive video and other technology trends I've mentioned earlier. With our commitment to powering next-generation networks while also driving sustainability, we launched new 800 gig switching platforms built on our Silicon One G100 chip to help meet customers' demand for more programmability, bandwidth and energy efficiency.\n Let me now touch on our innovation, as I'm incredibly proud of how our teams have come together to deliver market-leading solutions for our customers. Security and hybrid work are now more critical than ever. We continue to extend our capabilities to enable customers to work more securely anywhere while reducing cost and complexity. In security, we introduced new data loss prevention, firewall and Zero Trust capabilities across our portfolio. And in collaboration, we announced more than 40 new innovations to power hybrid work and deliver exceptional customer experiences.\n We're also committed to giving our customers more choice. An example of this is our partnership with Microsoft to bring Microsoft teams to Cisco meeting room devices. By doing this, we are driving interoperability and demonstrating our openness to meet our customers' need and provide greater flexibility.\n To wrap up, we delivered another strong quarter of revenue and non-GAAP earnings growth. The strength of orders, increased visibility and easing supply situation provides us with enhanced visibility and predictability, which underpins the confidence we have in our business and our increased outlook for the year. \n Our performance this quarter is a testament to our innovation and execution to support our customers during these complex times. Additionally, it reinforces Cisco's strength, durability and discipline in how we manage the business while investing to capture the multiyear growth opportunities ahead. \n Our portfolio is in great shape, and our business model is resilient with 43% of our revenue now recurring, which is very important as we navigate the current macro environment. The hard work and dedicated commitment of our leadership team and employees over the last few years to transform our business model is reflected in the performance we delivered this quarter. Combined with the strength of our balance sheet and our position in the market, we have an excellent foundation for delivering long-term results.\n I will now turn it over to Scott. Thanks, Meta. Yes, we saw -- Europe is obviously being impacted by the energy costs. And I think that's just forcing companies to take a look at their P&L as you would have to and where they spend their dollars. And we continue to see it not be quite as cold there. We had conversations with some of our team members this week, which is a positive sign. \n But the other thing that I called out that I think is an important one is that customers are trying to solve this energy cost issue in a very aggressive way. And we have several technology areas that can help them do that, including our Silicon One technology, which powers their networks at much lower power consumption. You've got IoT where we can connect these energy systems and make them more efficient as well as Power-Over-Ethernet, which actually just reduces the power footprint for our customers. So it does also create some opportunity.\n I'd say if I go to Asia real quick, you've got -- Asia was actually pretty resilient. They're clearly aware of the economic situation that's going on, but we had 5 regions last quarter that were positive after big positives a year ago, including India, which grew significantly after significant growth the prior year. So that was a good sign. So Asia's pretty resilient, it feels like right now.\n And then in the Americas, I'd say it's a little mixed. We have some customers who are powering forward and other customers who are taking a little cautious outlook. We think by December, we'll have better visibility to the 2023 budgets, which will be helpful. And to your question about more signatures, we have seen -- our customers have implemented greater signature requirements. But by and large, the deals that we have going are getting signed. They're just taking a little bit longer than we'd expect. Yes. Thanks, Tal. So this is a question we expected, so I'm going to give you a little more detail than I probably normally would. First off, the 2 quarters we just finished and the next quarter, we have massive year-over-year comparisons from prior year. So as we discussed last time, we think it's more important to look at sequential growth as an indicator. And as I said, we were slightly below our historic quarter-to-quarter range, roughly 1%. So it wasn't significant, not completely out of line, certainly a little lighter than we would expect normally but not significant. \n Enterprise and commercial on a global basis were both within the normal sequential range. Public sector was slightly out of range, and service provider's just lumpy. So the sequential reflection on service provider is not really valid. So demand was not -- it didn't fall off a cliff by any stretch. In fact, U.S. enterprise, after a upper 20s growth in the prior year, they actually posted low single-digit positive growth again. So that was a positive sign. Our order linearity within the quarter was in line. And remember, it was our second largest Q1 orders ever. So only -- the only quarter that was bigger was the quarter a year ago. So that's positive.\n Now what you're trying to get at, and I think everybody is trying to get at is, is this year being driven by backlog? And then as we go beyond that, everything falls apart. So let me give you some data points on this. Even if our orders are down 10% this year, which is not our forecast, we will still -- we project today that we will end the fiscal year with 2 to 3x our historic year-end normal backlog. That normal backlog is typically $4 billion to $5 billion. So I'm giving you actual numbers here. And then when you couple that with 43% of our revenue now coming from recurring, which is reflected in our RPO, that's what gives us a high degree of confidence and a high degree of visibility in the near term. So hopefully, that helps you as I answer your question, Tal. And remember, bookings contribute to both backlog and RPO. Yes, Ittai. We've actually modeled out various bookings scenarios for the year, and it would have to be significantly worse than what I told you for it to be concerning. Scott, do you have any other comments? Yes. Two good questions, Tim. So on the cloud vertical, I think you're calling out the right thing that the normalization of the orders is going to probably occur over the next few quarters. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised to see our trailing fourth quarter rates over the next couple quarters, maybe even dip negative because of such -- so much ordering ahead that we've seen. But we continue to see real strong demand in general from them. We've done a great deal of long-term planning with them. We have some number of orders that aren't even in book -- they don't even show up in bookings yet because they're out past our bookings lead time window. So that's positive. So we continue to see success there. We continue to win franchises, and we feel good about where we are there.\n On the software side, what I would say is that the 9K renewals are improving. They're still not material right now. I think next year, we'll see that occur. What we did announce is the -- this past year is that we are going to manage all of the Catalyst portfolio under the Meraki dashboard, the Meraki platform, and that will be delivered to our customers who have the DNA license and the premium license. So we think that, in itself, we've already launched the monitoring capability there and the management. We think we'll even include -- we'll even improve our renewals beyond that. But as we said, we had a record quarter for Cat 9K. So we're real happy with how it's performing. Scott? I couldn't understand the question. Yes. Amit, thank you for that. And I think the reality around that one is simply if you go back a year ago, that segment grew 65%. I think that's the fundamental issue. I don't think there's anything else going on. No, there's nothing that's giving us pause in that. I mean, we guided up the full year in revenue from what had been a guide of 4% to 6% growth to 4.5% to 6.5%. That effectively rolls forward the outperformance that we had in Q1 into the full year. There's no change in the way we're looking at the second half of the year either plus or minus. But it's a prudent view of what we expect in the next 3 quarters. Yes, I'll make some comments, and then, Scott, if you want to add some color, feel free. The range on the products is very wide right now. We still have a couple product areas that we have component issues that we're doing some work, and I think we've got probably one more quarter before we start improving those. We've got other products like we have certain firewalls that are down to 3-week lead times. We have some of the products we've redesigned that I've talked about before. It went from 40 weeks to 12 weeks and will continue to improve. I think we made improvements in roughly half of the portfolio. Half of the product families improved during the last quarter, and we would expect to continue that progress as we move forward. Yes. I think the whole market share discussion is reflected in our backlog. I mean, that's the issue. And as we ship it, you will see us -- I think, you'll see us over the next 12 months gain market share as we have an outsized backlog that we'll be delivering. So I would expect that to have a positive impact. Yes. So we're actually speaking to our employees tomorrow about this. So I'd be reluctant to go into a lot of detail here until we're able to talk to them. I would say that what we're doing is rightsizing certain businesses. We're really focused on resources moving into like in the enterprise networking space, accelerating our platform strategy. We'll be making significant investments in security and beefing up our team there and the capacity to continue to innovate there. Those are important areas.\n And so if you would understand, I'd prefer to wait and talk to our employees tomorrow about it. But you can just assume that we're going to -- we're not actually -- there's nothing that's a lower priority, but we are rightsizing certain businesses. And since you asked about collab, I'll tell you a little bit about what -- we see incredible strength right now in our Calling business, our Cloud Calling business. We see great strength in our Cloud Contact Center business. And the compares on the meeting side are going to start to make that -- give us the ability for that to be a much more favorable component. So we're -- I actually am optimistic over the next 12 months about our collaboration portfolio. The team has done an amazing job. I truly believe that they built the best platform in the business.\n And when you look at our devices and the interoperability that the team has been driving with the Microsoft interoperability, that is a huge, huge thing when you -- from a customer perspective for us to give them that flexibility. So I think they've done a good job, and I feel pretty good about that business as we go forward. We just need to rightsize some of the OpEx. But we do have a -- if you look at the number of jobs that we have opened in the areas that we're trying to invest, it is just slightly lower than the number of people that we believe will be impacted. We're going to be working really hard to help match our employees to those roles to the extent there's a skill match. So we're going to work really hard at that. Yes, Samik, it's a good question. And I would say -- the first thing I would say is that Gartner recently came out with a survey of executives in our customer base, and they've -- almost half of them said that their technology investments will be the last thing they cut. So that's just a backdrop for, I think, how important customers view their technology investments these days.\n When we look at where customers are investing, many of them are investing to -- they're moving forward with their hybrid work investments, right, and creating the infrastructure that they need to deal with this new world. We see customers continuing. We saw a recent survey that talked about customers who are balancing their private cloud and public cloud workloads. And so the whole rearchitecture of the infrastructure to deal with these new traffic patterns is another area. I mentioned in Europe with the power, with the energy costs, there's a lot of focus.\n IoT has just been accelerating over the last 2 to 3 years, and we saw another -- I think we had a record bookings quarter in Q1, I believe. It was really strong, where customers are really looking to connect these systems to actually optimize their power consumption and their efficiency. And again, we see a lot of customers who are moving -- who are doing greenfield real estate projects that are really focused on reducing -- going to low-voltage architectures, which leads them to Power-over-Ethernet, which leads them to rebuilding their infrastructure.\n And then you've got cybersecurity, and you've got full stack observability. We continue to see 5G build-outs there. There are just lots of -- there's a lot of positive tailwinds, notwithstanding the short-term dynamic environment that we're in. You mean if all our backlog was actually shipped and reported? Yes. I think that will be true. I mean, look, we operate in lots of different markets. So is it true 100% of the markets? That would be difficult for me to say. But I believe that as we ship out the -- particularly our Secure Agile networks, our enterprise and networking products, that's certainly going to help. As we catch up on our data center infrastructure, I think that's going to help.\n There's also just reporting dynamics that occur. Some of our competitors report certain routing products into data center switching, and we've reported into routing, which makes it difficult to ascertain. So it's an imperfect science on top of that. But I do believe that as we -- as our backlog unwinds and gets back to normal levels over the next 18, 24 months, then I think that you'll see -- I think you will see that dynamic. I think that's right. In certain key areas. I mean, not perhaps across everyone. I'd have to go do the analysis. But in some of the key ones that I know all of you are worried about, the answer is yes. In the bigger markets. Thanks, Marilyn, and thank you all for joining us today. I just want to reiterate it, we feel like we had a very strong quarter, largest quarterly revenue in history. As I said earlier, the orders, the visibility, the easing of supply chain gives us the confidence to raise the year, obviously. We're very focused. We're managing the business for growth. We are going to go through this process of reinvesting into strategic areas. And the people impact is difficult. And I just want our employees who are listening in today to know that this afternoon and tomorrow, we'll be communicating about how we're going to go about this. It's always a difficult decision, but we have a lot of opportunity.\n I'm very optimistic about the future. I'm proud of the teams and what they've accomplished and really excited about the visibility and the confidence that we have in the near term. So thanks for joining us, and we look forward to next time."

Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis. The matters will be -- the matters we'll be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we'll be providing for the first quarter and full-year fiscal 2025. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. I will now turn it over to Chuck.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Sami, and thank you all for joining us today. We had a strong close to fiscal '24, delivering $13.6 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter, coming in above the high end of our guidance range and $53.8 billion in revenue for the year, coupled with growth in annualized recurring revenue, remaining performance obligations and subscription revenue. We also generated excellent margins boosted by Splunk. Our gross margin of 67.5% was the highest for Cisco in 20 years. We saw steady demand as we closed the year with total product order growth of 14% and growth of 6% excluding Splunk, indicating that the period of inventory digestion by our customers is now largely behind us as we expected. We've also been investing to accelerate critical innovation in key areas with Hypershield and hyperfabric for AI being two outstanding examples. With Splunk now part of Cisco, we believe we have an unmatched capability to unlock the full power of the network with market leading security and observability solutions to deliver even greater value for our customers. We have hit the ground running since we brought the Splunk and Cisco teams together, integrating powerful new customer solutions and beginning to realize early synergies. We know that our biggest competitive differentiator is the power of our full portfolio. This is why earlier today, we announced that we will be bringing our networking, security and collaboration teams together as one organization with Jeetu Patel stepping into an expanded role as Chief Product Officer to lead this group effective immediately. As we complete the full integration of Splunk into Cisco, the Splunk product line will also integrate into this new organization at the right time, bringing our entire product portfolio together as one team. With this new organization, our products will come together in a more integrated way than ever before, positioning us to deliver incredibly powerful outcomes for our customers. Looking ahead, we remain laser focused on growth and consistent execution as we invest to win in AI, cloud and cyber security. To focus on these key priority areas, today, we announced a restructuring plan to allow us to both invest in key growth opportunities as well as drive more efficiency in our business. Now let me share some details on our fourth quarter. We delivered solid performance in Q4 with revenue coming above the high end of our guidance range. Strong operating leverage across our business once again drove non-GAAP margins above the high end of our expectations, resulting in earnings per share also coming in above the high end of our guidance range. We continue to focus on growth in our recurring revenue streams, annualized recurring revenue, remaining performance obligations and subscription revenue all showed solid growth and subscriptions made up 56% of our revenue in the quarter. We also continued to deliver on our commitment to consistent capital returns. In Q4, we returned $3.6 billion in value to our shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends, bringing the total to $12.1 billion in value returned in fiscal '24 or 119% of free cash flow. In terms of customer demand, as I mentioned earlier, we saw steady demand in Q4. This resulted in double-digit product order growth across all geographies and strength in all customer markets despite persistent macro uncertainty. Public sector demand was particularly strong worldwide, driven by federal spending in the U.S. and strength in APJC. Enterprise demand returned to strength in the quarter with solid performance in the Americas and EMEA and even stronger results in APJC. We signed several $100 million plus transactions in the quarter with global enterprises, who are leveraging the breadth of our technology platforms to modernize and automate their network operations and deploy next-generation machine learning and AI applications. I'd like to highlight one of the largest deals we signed in the quarter with a leading global logistics company to advance their efforts in creating the world's most flexible, efficient and intelligent logistics network. Cisco's technology platforms across switching, routing, security and observability will enable our customer to automate network operations with cutting edge innovations like AI-powered robotics and unmatched supply chain visibility. We also signed our first cross portfolio agreement that includes Splunk with a major automotive company in this quarter. AI is transforming every aspect of our customers' IT environments. They need to modernize their infrastructure, harness the full power of AI and data and improve their cybersecurity posture, all while building agility and resiliency across their entire digital footprint. Our customers continue to put their trust in Cisco and we are very well-positioned to be their strategic partner for this era. In-service provider, while our telco and cable customer demand remain muted overall amid continued industry wide pressure, we saw strength in EMEA, driven by investment in AI operations and autonomous networks by service providers to help them monetize their B2B offerings. We are also encouraged to see signs of stabilization and improved performance in webscale in terms of pipeline and demand with double-digit order growth. To provide some incremental color, let me share some data on demand through the lens of our products. Excluding Splunk, security product orders grew double-digits. Collaboration product orders grew double-digits. In our networking portfolio, data center switching also saw double-digit product order growth and enterprise routing, campus switching and wireless orders were also strong with wireless orders greater than $1 million, up more than 20% year-over-year as customers look to enhance their office environments. Across the breadth of our portfolio and global customer base, our product order results demonstrate strengthening demand as our customers focused on their next top priority technology investments. While customers continue to ruthlessly prioritize their investments, our product order results demonstrate that our customers continue to look to Cisco as they focus on their most important technology initiatives. Now turning to look at our product categories in more detail. We saw revenue growth in security and double-digit growth in observability year-over-year, excluding Splunk as customers look to enhance their digital resilience with Cisco's technologies. We've had extremely positive feedback from customers with early access to Hypershield, the first truly distributed AI-native cybersecurity solution built into the fabric of the network. Hypershield furthers our vision for the Cisco Security Cloud, which is expected to deliver the industry's most comprehensive, unified platform with end-to-end solutions, making it easier for our customers to protect against evolving threats and we look forward to making it available this fall. Our new security solutions, XDR and Secure Access are continuing to gain strong traction. We added over 230 new XDR customers in Q4. Early in the quarter, we announced the integration of Cisco XDR with Splunk Enterprise Security. And at the Black Hat Cybersecurity Conference earlier this month, we announced the availability of Talos Incident response for Splunk customers, enabling access to the full suite of proactive and emergency services to help prepare for, respond to and recover from a breach. We also continue to capitalize on the multi-billion dollar AI infrastructure opportunity. We have now crossed $1 billion in AI orders with web scale customers to date with three of the top four hyperscalers deploying our Ethernet AI fabric, leveraging Cisco validated designs for AI infrastructure. We expect an additional $1 billion of AI product orders in fiscal year '25. As I shared at our Investor Day in June, this momentum is being fueled by multiple use cases in production with the hyperscalers, several of which are in AI. In addition, we have multiple design wins with roughly two-third of these in AI. Over and above the web scale AI opportunity, we believe we are well-positioned to be the key beneficiary of AI application proliferation in the enterprise. Our hyperfabric AI cluster solution created with NVIDIA helps our enterprise customers build infrastructure to run generative AI models and inference applications. The on-premise solution will guide users from design to validated deployment to monitoring and assurance when it becomes available later this fiscal year. We are also enhancing our own productivity by using AI in our services and customer experience organization. We have a robust AI and automation framework that touches at least 50% of our service requests. In addition, we are incorporating AI assistance into our products so that our customer and partners have efficient options to access support. Before I hand it over to Scott, I want to take a moment to thank our teams for all their hard work to close out the year and their relentless focus on our customers. In closing, while we're pleased with our performance in a dynamic environment, we know we have to drive strong execution to be successful in the growing markets we serve. We believe this will result in strong growth and profitability as we enter fiscal 2025. I'll now turn it over to Scott to provide more detail on the quarter and our outlook.\nScott Herren: Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter, then cover the full-fiscal year, followed by our guidance. Our Q4 results reflect solid execution with strong margins and strength in orders as customer buying patterns begin to return to normal. For the quarter, total revenue was above the high-end of our guidance range at $13.6 billion, down 10% year-over-year comparing against our strongest quarter ever in the fourth quarter of fiscal '23. Float contributed approximately $960 million in revenue for the quarter, in line with our expectations. Non-GAAP net income was $3.5 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share was above the high-end of our guidance range at $0.87. The interest impact from financing the Splunk acquisition more than offset the positive operating impact of Splunk. The net effect was a negative impact of $0.04 on non-GAAP earnings per share for the quarter. Looking at our Q4 revenue in more detail. Total product revenue was $9.9 billion, down 15% as we move through the final quarter of customer inventory issues and services revenue was $3.8 billion, up 6%. Networking, our largest product category was down 28% when compared to our Q4 '23 networking revenues, which benefited from near-record shipments of excess backlog. Security was up 81%, including the benefit from Splunk. Excluding Splunk, security grew 6%, driven by competitive wins and growth in SASE and double-digit growth in network security. Collaboration was flat, driven by growth in our cloud calling and CPaaS offerings, offset by declines in meetings and devices. Observability was up 41%, driven by growth in our observability suite, our Splunk observability offering and 1000 hours Network services. Excluding Splunk, observability grew 12% for the quarter. Looking at our recurring metrics, ARR ended the quarter at $29.6 billion, which increased 22% due to continued strong performance and contribution from Splunk. These factors also drove our product ARR growth of 43%. Without Splunk, ARR was $25.3 billion, up 4% and product ARR was up 9%. Total subscription revenue increased 17% to $7.7 billion, which now represents 56% of Cisco's total revenue. Without Splunk, total subscription revenue was up 2%, representing 53% of Cisco's total revenue. Total software revenue was up 15% at $5.3 billion, with software subscription revenue up 25%. 92% of our total software revenue was subscription-based. Without Splunk, software revenue was down 5% due to declines in perpetual license software as we move to more subscription-based software arrangements. Software subscription revenue was up 2%. Total RPO was $41.0 billion, up 18% due to both strong organic performance and the addition of Splunk. Product RPO grew 27%. Total short-term RPO was up 17%. Without Splunk, RPO was $37.5 billion, up 8% with product RPO also grew at 8%. As Chuck said, Q4 product orders were up 14% year-over-year. Excluding Splunk, product orders were up 6% year-over-year, indicating the period of inventory digestion by our customers is now largely behind us. Looking at our product orders across our geographic segments year-over-year, Americas was up 15%, EMEA was up 12% and APJC was up 16%. In our customer markets, public sector was up 20%, enterprise was up 13% and service provider cloud was up 5%. Total non-GAAP gross margin came in at 67.9%, up 200 basis points year-over-year and exceeding the high-end of our guidance range. Product gross margin was 67.0%, up 150 basis points, largely driven by Splunk and favorable product mix, offset by price. Services gross margin was 70.3%, up 280 basis points. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at the high-end of our guidance range at 32.5%. Shifting to the balance sheet We ended Q4 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $17.9 billion. Operating cash flow was $3.7 billion. Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we returned $3.6 billion to shareholders comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and $2.0 billion of share repurchases. We took advantage of market conditions to increase our share repurchases during the quarter. Turning to the full-fiscal year. We delivered strong margins and increased our operating leverage. Revenue at $53.8 billion made fiscal '24 Cisco's second strongest year on record as compared to the all-time high revenues of $57 billion in fiscal '23, which benefited from significant shipments of heightened backlog. Splunk contributed approximately $1.4 billion in revenue after the close of the acquisition in March of this year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.73, exceeding the high-end of our guidance range, down 4% year-over-year. Splunk was $0.04 dilutive to full-year earnings, including the impact of financing costs. In terms of our recurring metrics, total software revenue for the full-year was up 9% at $18.4 billion, with the product portion also up 9%. Software subscription revenue was up 15%. 89% of total software revenue was subscription-based. Without Splunk, total software revenue was up 1%. Total subscription revenue was $27.4 billion, an increase of 11%. Without Splunk, total subscription revenue was up 6%. As Chuck mentioned, total non-GAAP gross margin was 67.5%, up 300 basis points and the highest in 20 years. On the bottom line, non-GAAP net income was $15.2 billion. Operating cash flow was $10.9 billion. As a reminder, cash flow was impacted by the timing of large tax payments in fiscal '24 compared to fiscal '23. In the year, we returned $12.1 billion in value to shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases. It was comprised of $6.4 billion in quarterly cash dividends and $5.8 billion of share repurchases. We increased our dividend for the 13th consecutive year in fiscal '24, reinforcing our confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows. To summarize, we executed well in Q4 and the fiscal year. We exited the year with order levels improving as customers largely completed the implementation of record Cisco product shipments. Further, as Chuck mentioned, we are realigning our expenses to better capture the opportunities ahead. As part of our announced restructuring plan, we expect to impact approximately 7% of our global workforce with total estimated pre-tax charges of up to $1 billion. Turning to our financial guidance. For fiscal Q1, our guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $13.65 billion to $13.85 billion. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 67% to 68%. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 32% to 33%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.86 to $0.88. And in Q1, we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 19%. For fiscal year '25, our guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $55 billion to $56.2 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $3.52 to $3.58. And we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 19%. Sami, let's now move into the Q&A.\nSami Badri: Thank you, Scott. Before we start the Q&A portion of the call, I would like to remind analysts to ask one question and a single follow-up question. Operator, can we move to the first analyst in the queue?\nOperator: Thank you. Our first caller is Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks so much. Chuck, I just wanted to maybe start with you in terms of what you're seeing in terms of budget prioritization from customers. Clearly, they're coming out of a digestion period, but just any sense of how they're balancing different enterprise or initiatives, particularly trying to balance AI initiatives? And then maybe second, just for Scott, is the full-risk embedded in the fiscal '25 guidance, just any clarification? Thanks.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Meta. Yes, I would say if you look across the portfolio, just if I go around the world a little bit on the demand side, from a geographic perspective, it was very balanced at Americas and Europe up 6%, Asia up 8%. This is -- these all these numbers are excluding Splunk that I'm going to talk about real quickly. The segments enterprise was plus 3%, cloud and SP was plus 2% and then public sector was plus 15%. And so we saw a pretty balanced strength there. But across the technology portfolio, it was incredibly balanced. So we saw double-digit growth, as we said in security, double-digit growth in collaboration. And then in the networking space, I think it's important to point out the switching business and the enterprise -- the enterprise switching and the enterprise routing businesses were both up high-single-digits and the wireless business was up double-digits. And again, I think Scott had in his remarks that the number of $1 million transactions in wireless alone was up 20% year-over-year. So we saw super balanced demand across the portfolio. The one thing I would say that we heard for the first time this quarter that we haven't heard before is that customers -- enterprise customers are now actually upgrading their infrastructure in preparation for AI. And in some cases, they're taking some of the dollars that they've set aside for AI to actually spend it on modernizing their infrastructure in order to get ready for that. And you saw that with some of the examples we gave in these platform sales, the large logistics company that we have that actually bought the cross-portfolio solution, the whole platform, Cisco platforms and they're looking to enable AI-powered robotics, AI-powered supply chain visibility, et cetera. So we think we're beginning to see customers actually prepare for AI applications, even though in many cases, they may not know the full range of what they will be deploying, but they know they need to be ready. So that's kind of what we saw.\nScott Herren: And Meta, I want to make sure I got your second question right. Did you say it's the full-risk embedded in fiscal '25 guidance?\nMeta Marshall: Just the layoffs that were announced, just whether that is fully embedded, the savings from the 7% cut are embedded in the fiscal '25 guidance.\nScott Herren: Yes, it is. And it's a good place to kind of explain a little bit more detail what that -- what that action is about. It's not about cost saving. So the answer is yes. It's embedded in the guide, but it's much more about finding efficiencies across the company so that we can pivot more resources, much like we did last year into the fastest growth areas within the company, which are pivoting more into AI, pivoting more into cloud and pivoting more into cyber security. So think of it more as reallocating versus being in pursuit of cost savings. But yes, it's all built into the guide.\nChuck Robbins: Yes, Meta, I would just add on that one that there -- we actually are shifting hundreds of millions of dollars into AI, into AI networking for cloud, into AI infrastructure, silicon and cyber. So it's a -- it's a meaningful shift, but we feel like the market is moving so quickly we have to do that.\nSami Badri: Thank you, Meta. Operator, next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Tal Liani with BofA Securities. You may go ahead, sir.\nTal Liani: Hi, guys. The last question a little bit stole my thunder somewhat, but I want to ask it anyway. On one hand, there is always a correlation between business cycles and restructuring. And here you see a company that is improving on all fronts with orders growing and still you are announcing a major 7% restructuring. Is there anything in the environment that makes you more cautious? Is there anything that drives the timing of this restructuring ahead of what is expected to be a good year? So I'm wondering what can we learn from your view on the environment given the timing of restructuring? And\u2026\nChuck Robbins: Let me -- I'm sorry. Go ahead.\nTal Liani: Okay. I'll just ask my second question together. It's a quick one. On security, great performance finally improving. Was there any implication of what we've seen with CrowdStrike? Have you seen any change in purchasing behavior or any different dynamics among customers because of what happened with CrowdStrike? Thanks.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks , Tal. Let me just make a comment on the restructuring and Scott, you can talk a little bit about it, and then I'll take the security question back. So on the restructuring, the answer to that is no, there's nothing else out there. We had tremendous demand across the portfolio. It was very broad based and it was very consistent. It really is about ensuring in a rapidly moving markets that we serve that we're able to shift resources into the most important areas. So that's really it. Scott, anything to add?\nScott Herren: Just -- Tal, this is just a continuation of what you've seen us do. And we talked at Investor Day about having already pivoted on the R&D front, little more than 50% of our R&D spend into those three areas, into AI, cloud and cyber security. Obviously, networking continues to be incredibly important to us and we'll continue to support that space as well. But it's looking for efficiencies as we -- as we look across the company really in every way so that we can take those resources and allocate them into the fastest growing spaces. I think it's -- think of it as more of just the financial discipline that you've always seen from us. I mean, if you just look at the year we just closed, obviously, it was a challenging year on the top line for revenue and yet we reported the highest operating margin in the history of the company. So this is just more of the financial discipline that I think you've noticed for.\nChuck Robbins: And then on the security question, yes, Tal, if you think back to -- go back about a year, what I had said, I felt like what happened is that we would start seeing improvement in the second half of fiscal '24. We were high-single-digits in Q3, we were double-digits in Q4, and I said we should see the real momentum kick in '25. And I think that's what we're feeling the beginning of that. As it relates specifically to CrowdStrike, it's hard for me to say, I will tell you that we added 230 more XDR customers, we're pushing 600 customers on that platform, which is a -- it's a pretty significant decision when customers make that decision. So that's encouraging. And candidly, the secure access product that is the cloud edge security solution is actually ramping even faster than XDR did. So the teams have done a great job with this innovation. We have 2,200 customers now that are using our AI assistant in security. And so that's very encouraging as well. So we're really optimistic about what the teams have been doing in this space.\nSami Badri: Thank you, Tal. Michelle, we'll go to the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may go ahead, sir.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi, thanks for taking my question. And before I ask the question, congratulations to Jeetu on the expanded role as well. Maybe just starting off with the AI orders, Chuck, I think you mentioned you already cumulatively crossed $1 billion and are on track for the $1 billion next year. Maybe if you can give us some sense on what's the current sort of run rate that you're hitting relative to the $1 billion target you have for next year? And as you sort of get more visibility in terms of some of these deployments, how are you thinking about the orders, timing of the orders translating into revenue? And I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Samik, could you ask a follow-up now, please?\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay. On the follow-up, I was just really going to more ask about what's embedded in terms of the guide relative to the Splunk growth versus the core business? And if we are sort of calculating it right, it looks like Splunk's growth was about 5% in the quarter, looks a bit more subdued than sort of the double-digit growth I think everyone was expecting. So any guide -- any sort of thoughts on why it was a bit more subdued if I'm doing the math right and how to think about sort of what's embedded in the guide for fiscal '25? Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Yes. So on the AI orders, we did talk about the fact that we crossed $1 billion to date in the web scale space, which is solid. And at Investor Day, we talked about the number of design wins we've had, which are wins where we have received the go ahead from these customers that they're going to go with us assuming we execute and deliver on the design as they have spected. And so we're only 2.5 weeks into the year, so it's hard to say right now how those are going to flow throughout the balance of the year. But I will say that one of the absolute largest players in this space actually told us last week that they are releasing orders in one of those design wins. So one of those design wins will start to generate orders in the near future. So I think things are playing out as we expected. And candidly, it's just up to us to execute and deliver on what they've asked us to deliver.\nScott Herren: Yes. And Samik, on Splunk, as we said in the opening commentary, it's progressing right in line with our expectations that the focus of that transaction was much more about driving revenue. Of course, it's a long sales cycle. We've already seen, as Chuck mentioned, double-digit number of deals that have closed with our two sales forces selling together. So the momentum in the field is good, Splunk. The better metric for Splunk, we talked about revenue because that obviously shows up in the P&L. The better metric for them is ARR and their ARR is continuing to grow in double-digits, which is right where it was the last time they reported as a public company. So continuing to see good momentum and beginning to see the green shoots of the sales force is really selling together. We've also done a fair number of product integrations. And I think Chuck talked about several of those in his piece of the script. And so what's going to happen over time is it's going to be harder and harder to say what is with these integrated product sets, what is Splunk revenue and what is Cisco revenue. I will tell you, we've built in the full impact of where we expect the combined company to be. But I think defining longer-term, how much of that is allocated to historical Splunk and how much that's allocated to historical Cisco is going to get tougher and tougher. So what I'd tell you is it's built -- it's performing well. We're already seeing good signs of the sales forces selling together and it's built into the guide.\nChuck Robbins: Yes, I think that's really important, Scott, because we said that Splunk typically has a six to nine months sales cycle. And we closed I think over 10 of these cross-sell deals that were worked between the Cisco sales force and the Splunk sales force last quarter, which was promising and we also, as I said in my comments, we did the first cross-portfolio agreement that would have traditionally been a Cisco offer to one of our largest customers in the U.S. and we actually transacted it with Splunk included in that. So we're beginning to see what we would have expected at this point and maybe even a little ahead of what I would have expected at this point.\nSami Badri: Thank you, Samik. Michelle, we can move to the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. George Notter with Jefferies. You may go ahead, sir.\nGeorge Notter: Hi, thanks very much, guys. I wanted to ask about putting the organization together, networking, security, collaboration. Can you talk a bit about what's driving that integration? I assume you're going to talk about the need for products to be integrated, especially as we leverage AI, leverage big data sets. But can you walk through kind of the precise motivations driving it? Thanks.\nChuck Robbins: Yes, George, thank you. You nailed it. Actually, you could answer for me. I think the -- if you look at what our biggest competitive differentiation is in the marketplace, it's really when we do deep cross integration across the portfolio and we're delivering on a platform strategy for our customers. And I felt like with the pace at which the AI revolution is moving and what our enterprise customers need from us. And candidly as security and networking continue to become more tightly intertwined, I just felt like it was important for us to have a single leader. And if you look at what Jeetu has accomplished in his four years here when he took on the collaboration business originally, I think everybody remembers what the portfolio was like then versus what it's doing now with double-digit growth this quarter. And obviously in the security portfolio, he's done exactly as we had expected. And I think we have a great networking team and I think his focus on execution, innovation and sense of urgency, I think is going to be really welcome there. And so we look forward to seeing what that -- what the teams accomplished and the innovation that they'll deliver in the future.\nGeorge Notter: Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Thank you.\nSami Badri: Thank you, George. Michelle, can we move to the next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI. You may go ahead, sir.\nAmit Daryanani: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I guess maybe to start with, Chuck, your commentary around customer demand patterns kind of getting back to normal, the orders showing positive growth all sound really good. Maybe you could just contrast that and help us frame that versus your guidance for overall revenues being up 3% inclusive of Splunk. There's obviously a fear that Cisco is losing share. Maybe you can just talk about how to think about your revenue growth, what headwinds you have for maybe backlog normalization that should be factored into this 3%, 3.5% revenue guide? That would be really helpful to sort of understand. And then perhaps just as a follow-up, Scott, can you just quantify what sort of cost savings are you expecting from this reduction program? I realize none of this will flow to the bottom-line. It sounds like you want to invest it back in the business. But just to frame it up, what sort of savings on a gross level maybe you expect from these cost reduction initiatives? Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Yes, Amit, on the first one, we've talked about this in the past. The headwind that we have for fiscal '25, we talked about this back at the -- on the Q3 call and again at our Investor Day, we still have a tough compare in Q1, as you know. Q1 of fiscal '24, the year that just ended, we had significant amount of product shipments from excess backlog. Round number is $4 billion of shipment, we included in those Q1 numbers. And obviously, you can only ship that backlog once. So we don't get to ship that again in Q1 of this year. That not only creates a dislocation in what the growth rates are for Q1, but it impacts the entire year as well. So one of the things that we talked about on the last call was if you looked at our growth rate of the core business and said X backlog and X Splunk, you can do the pencil math and see what is that growth rate. And it's in that same range that we gave you for the long-term growth rate. So that's what's kind of underneath the positive news that we're seeing around demand returning to normal patterns, but then the headwind that creates to revenue growth for the year in the guide. On the cost reductions from the actions that we're taking, it really is a case, much like it was last year of us finding those efficiencies across the company and really reallocating. So think of it as much more of a reallocation process than it is a cost savings process. That's -- this is the same financial discipline you've seen from us for the last couple of years. And as I said in answering the question earlier that the kind of the hallmark of that is when you look at a year, which was a tough year in terms of revenue production and with the discipline that we have, we still delivered the highest operating margin we have in the company -- in the history of the company. So think of it that way. We need to pivot more resources into the fastest growth areas of our business and we're doing it by finding efficiencies and then reallocating those costs.\nSami Badri: Thank you, Amit. Michelle, we come up to the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Simon Leopold with Raymond James. You may go ahead, sir.\nSimon Leopold: Great. Thank you for taking the question. I'm -- I'm interested in maybe unpacking a little bit of the $1 billion of incremental AI orders you talked about for fiscal '25. And what I'm sort of trying to understand is, are you looking at this as sort of more of the same, meaning very similar in the customer mix and product mix of the first $1 billion or are we expecting the beginning of maybe enterprise adoption for inferencing or what's the nature of that incremental $1 billion? And then my follow-up is quick and probably one that might be a little bit trickier to answer. But what are you budgeting for fiscal '25 OpEx? I think we're all trying to get to that one way or another. Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Simon. So I'll take the AI one. I would say that it doesn't have a meaningful amount of enterprise built into it. It's -- we are beginning to see the enterprise pipeline build a bit, but it's mostly predominantly the same thing that we've talked about in the past, which is a web scale infrastructure space. So if the enterprise picks up materially somewhere along the way, then that number could be higher. The other thing I'd point out is, I also believe over time, it's going to be -- it's going to get more and more difficult to really identify orders that are AI related because as I said earlier, we're beginning to see enterprise that are enterprises now that are updating their infrastructure as a result of AI. So does that count as an AI order or not? But anyway, we're going to -- we're going to stay pretty pure to how we measured them so far as we -- as we continue to update you on these numbers, but I think that's how it's going to play out over the course of the year.\nScott Herren: And Simon, on your second question, obviously, for the full-year, we don't guide at that level. We guide -- we've given you revenue, we've given you what -- what to expect on EPS. But for Q1, we also gave you the ranges for gross margin and op margin. And you know there's in below the op margin line in OI&E, we've talked about the interest impact of the money that we spent to acquire Splunk. And I think you understand what that looks like. So what I'd give you as an additional modeling point is when you look through the year, we talked about the Q1 guide being gross margin in the 67% to 68% range and op margins being in the 32% to 33% range, it stays pretty well in that range for the full-year as well.\nSami Badri: Thank you, Simon.\nSimon Leopold: Thank you.\nSami Badri: We will move to the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead.\nMatt Niknam: Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. On the point around the platform approach, maybe, Chuck, if you can speak to where the platform approach is resonating more across your different customer sets within enterprise, SP and public sector? And how much of these purchasing decisions, primarily around bundle -- buying networking and security adjacent to one another. How much of this is actually being done in unison today and where do you think that goes over time? Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Matthew. I think that, look, these are happening primarily in the large enterprise and in the large public sector customers. That's where we see it. In the quarter, we had large enterprise and large public sector customers that actually executed on these nine figure deals. So it's happening across a broad array of customers in different industries. And I would say that when it comes to security and networking, you're seeing it particularly in the -- at the cloud edge. As you know, when you see SD-WAN and the cloud security coming together. But we're also beginning to see it and we're going to actually drive it in the data center with Hypershield where you have security embedded deeply in the network. And I think that one of the -- one of the key benefits of the organizational change that we made is that you're going to see more and more innovation that is going to actually come from us where the security and the network are more tightly connected in the future.\nScott Herren: And Matt, what I'd add to the second part of your question kind of how much of the large deals and where does that go? Just a quick data point for you. We talked about product order growth ex-Splunk being at 6%. If you netted out these large -- we call them whole portfolio agreements. If you netted those out of both years, actually the product order bookings growth goes up modestly. Think of it as being in the same range. So while it was a good quarter for that, it always is in Q4, it's not the outsized driver of our growth. We're seeing growth really across the board.\nSami Badri: Thank you, Matthew. Michelle, we can move to the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. You may go ahead.\nIttai Kidron: Thanks, guys. A couple of questions for me. First, Doug, in your prepared remarks, you had in the slides 4 examples of $100 million platform deals, multiple platforms, I guess, within each single customer. Maybe can you talk about where these -- all of these customers were naturally big Cisco customers before these renewals and deals. So I guess the question is, where is the incremental value, in what product areas do you see yourself really gaining more from a footprint when you're coming with these platform deals? And the second question relates to the cloud order growth, only two points, if I'm getting that right, not all that impressive this quarter. Maybe you can unpack that a little bit more. Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Yes, thanks Ittai. You're right. Most of these large platform deals are existing customers for sure. In some cases, these are the first -- this is the first time we've done one and in some cases, it's a renewal of one we did three, five years ago. So it varies. And I would say in all the customers, I'd say the big thing is probably an expansion for us now is the -- is the real recognition that the security portfolio is much more robust and the innovation that's been driven in that platform, I think is one of the advantages that the customers are really seeing through these platform deals that we're seeing. But also, again, I think when you get into the use cases, it's really important to understand that some of them are actually doing these now in preparation for these AI workloads like the AI-powered robotics example that we gave earlier. On the cloud order growth, that 2% was a combination of service provider and traditional service provider and cloud, the hyperscalers. And so if you look at the hyperscalers, we saw very significant growth in the second half of the year and in Q4. We said double-digits. I would just say it was meaningful and it was really refreshing to see. And as Scott said earlier, we feel like this digestion period is behind us now as we -- as we had hoped and thought it would be by the end of Q4. And so we hope to see normal buying behavior in the hyperscalers over the coming quarters.\nIttai Kidron: Thank you.\nSami Badri: Thank you Ittai. Thank you, Ittai. Michelle, next question.\nOperator: Jim Fish with Piper Sandler. You may go ahead.\nJim Fish: Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions here. You guys are reducing 7% of the workforce, but based on your comments, Scott, it sounds as though that is kind of the gross number. So is there a way to think about sort of that net number by year end and how many employees are actually affected? And as a follow-up, obviously, Gary has been now in his role for a bit longer and you guys are starting a new fiscal year here. So how are you guys thinking about changes to the sales efforts or compensation structures with this kind of ongoing restructuring and meanwhile is kind of push more towards a platform sale? Thanks, guys.\nScott Herren: Yes, Jim, I'll start. I think the -- again, think of that as the reduction that we're doing as much more of a reallocation versus a headcount savings. In some cases, the efficiencies that we're going to get will be from by moving into lower cost locations. So it's not as easy to do the math to say like, hey, if you were 90,000 heads before and 7%, I expect you to be at whatever the math works out to. Some of that is not going to be just a one-for-one headcount change, it's going to be savings that come by putting more work into lower cost locations. So it's -- I don't think the math is going to help you as you try to build out your model.\nChuck Robbins: Yes, I think from Gary's perspective, he's not on the call with us today, but I think he's focused on -- we're putting in cross-sell incentives for the -- for Splunk on the Cisco sales force. We're going to be -- we're going to incent the security sellers inside Cisco. We're looking at the Splunk sales force over time being able to sell the security portfolio from Cisco. But he's focused on simplicity. He's focused on more frontline quota carrying reps. He's focused on investing in more capacity in the enterprise space where these platform deals are more prevalent, more systems engineering and a real doubling down on the focus on core networking and infrastructure. So I think you're going to see a real -- a real renewed effort to get the team's focus not only on some of the software assets and security, but really doubling down on core networking.\nSami Badric: Thank you, Jim. Michelle, we can move to the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. You may go ahead.\nBen Reitzes: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask you, Chuck, a little bit more about the getting ready for AI, the uptick in orders where you see folks getting ready. Did you mean like some of the wireless orders where they're anticipating using apps or did you mean that they're anticipating doing training on top of some LLMs? I just wanted a little more if you had any insight as to what they're really using it for and which area of your portfolio that you're really seeing it in? And if you're getting a sense like for what they're really prepping for? And then -- oh, sorry. And then my follow-up is -- my follow-up is just with regard to NVIDIA. So a follow-up there is, with regard to your orders, it sounds like enterprise is small with regard to the AI orders, but wondering if you're seeing any interest in the NVIDIA partnership yet? Thanks.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Ben. So on the enterprise AI, what I would say is some customers like these platform deals that we talked about, they're buying the entire portfolio to refresh their infrastructure to actually because they have applications that they've already identified like the ones we were referencing earlier. In other cases, they are updating their data center infrastructure and their core network infrastructure to be ready for smaller training models on their own private data and or inference. It just varies across the board. And I think to be honest with you, a lot of customers are -- would tell you that we're not really sure exactly what the applications are going to look like, but I know one thing for sure is it I need to have a modern and up-to-date infrastructure to be prepared for that. So I'm just going to go in and see where do I -- where do I need to make those investments. In some cases, I may need to update my switching infrastructure. In some cases, it may be new wireless. We saw data center switching in double-digits as well. So I think it -- I think it was fairly broad based. And then I'd say on the NVIDIA partnership, it's too early. We're not even in early field trials yet with that solution. So I don't think there's a lot to share yet.\nSami Badri: Thank you, Ben. Michelle, we can move to the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. You may go ahead, sir.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the questions. Sticking on the AI theme, I'm just -- as we think about this $1 billion of orders, I think last quarter you talked about line of sight into the $1 billion going into fiscal '25. I'm curious if you can unpack that a little bit in terms of, are these back end network deployment, competing against Arista, internal switching offerings from the cloud guys? And is it switching? Is it Silicon One, full switch? Is any kind of granularity you can give between within that $1 billion orders? And then I'll say my second question. As we think about the split contribution in the fiscal '25. If we annualize the fourth quarter contribution, to me, it's going to lead me to think that core Cisco is kind of flattish kind of embedded in your guidance for the full-year. Is that fair? And if so, how are you thinking about the networking growth for the full-year guide? Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Yes. So on the $1 billion, I would say it is primarily back end and it is a combination of both Ethernet and optics. We have a very robust optics business and it is competing with the players that you would suspect that we would compete with. In some cases, it's a system from us. In some cases, it's a -- perhaps it's a white box solution. But one of the big advantages we have is that we can actually sell them silicon, we can sell them, we can help them build white boxes or we can sell them integrated systems and it's a combination of all those things as well as optics. And then on the second one, you want to take?\nScott Herren: Yes, well, Aaron, and this is back to what I was touching on earlier that if you remember, Q1 of fiscal '24, the compare point for our current quarter, also had a pretty significant amount of excess backlog clearance in it. We talked about it at Investor Day that it was in the $3.5 billion to $4 billion range of clearance that happened in Q1 a year ago. Obviously, that won't repeat in Q1 of this year. So while we're seeing a nice normalization of demand across the board, we've got that year-on-year headwind compare of not being able to have the significant backlog clearance again in Q1 of this year. You can add that to your math and you'll get a different outcome on what's happening in the core.\nChuck Robbins: Yes. Thanks, Aaron.\nSami Badri: Thank you, Aaron. Michelle, we can move to the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is Atif Malik with Citi. You may go ahead.\nAdrian Colby: Hi, it's Adrian Colby for Atif. With regards to the inventory levels normalizing and a bit to the prior question, how should we think about the quarterly trends in the business? Are we sort of back to a scenario with regular sort of prior seasonal dynamics or as the business mix has evolved, are things changing? And also as we think about fiscal year '25, how should we think about the January dynamic with Splunk? It looks like historically that was a pretty strong quarter for Splunk.\nChuck Robbins: I'll answer the first and then Scott, you can take the second. The -- we believe that we are finally back to normal ordering patterns. And we were talking about it as we're getting ready for this call and it's literally been four years that we've been going through this and with -- between COVID and then the supply chain shock and then having to deal with this digestion challenge at the end. So we're quite happy to be here. But we feel like we are back to normal ordering patterns. So it should be -- should be like it was prior to the pandemic. Scott?\nScott Herren: Yes. And on the January dynamic on Splunk, like most enterprise software companies, not only do they get back end loaded into what was previously their fourth quarter, the January quarter that you talked about, but they also get very back end loaded within that quarter to the very end of it, right? And you see that with almost all enterprise software companies. The one bit of normalization that we've had to do is we brought Splunk in, our fiscal quarters don't actually end on the last day of the month. They end on the last Saturday of the month of that quarter. And so there's typically a tail of two or three days that would be the normal end of the Splunk quarter that doesn't fall into the end of our quarter. So it will be a muted impact on our second -- that January quarter is our second quarter. It will have a muted impact because we'll lose two or three days, which are two or three big days out of our Q2. Some of that will bleed over into Q3 for us.\nSami Badri: Thank you, Adrian. Operator -- Michelle, we can move to the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Karl Ackerman with BNP Paribas. You may go ahead.\nKarl Ackerman: Yes, thank you. You indicated that inventory digestion for hyperscale and enterprise networking is largely behind you. Though, Scott, I think you noted in your -- in general that price was somewhat of a headwind to product revenue in the quarter. Could you speak to the rate of change in the improving order visibility since the beginning of this year? In other words, as visibility improved from three months to say six to nine months? And then second, do you anticipate the pricing environment stabilizing or improving from here as you look to your fiscal '25 revenue outlook? Thank you.\nScott Herren: I would say on the -- on the ability to look out and see the demand side, notwithstanding some unforeseen shock, I think the teams are back to their normal visibility. I think that -- I'm trying to even remember what it was. It's been so long ago since we had it. But I think the -- they clearly have much greater visibility over the next 90-day period. That's -- we've seen that the last couple of quarters. And obviously with this final Q4 where we think that the issue is behind us. I think going-forward, you'll see it. And I think we'll continue to see greater visibility into the outer quarters relative to where we were over the last couple of years.\nChuck Robbins: Yes. And on price stability, Karl, if you go -- you got to go back away as Chuck just said. But if you go back to where we were before the supply chain issues and then of course, the price increases that we had to put in place because our cost went up significantly. And then it took a while, as you remember, for those price increases to turn into orders, those orders to work-through the backlog and get shipped out. We've now sort of lapped the point where we've gotten to price stability. So expect to see price impact back where it's always been historically. It's typically -- every deal we do is a competitive deal, all right. And so there's always some price competition around that, but expect it to be in the range that it was historically somewhere in that -- anywhere from 0.5% to 1.5% per quarter.\nSami Badri: Thank you, Karl. I now want to hand it over back to Chuck for some closing remarks.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks. I want to thank all of you for joining again today. We appreciate you being with us. I want to thank our teams, our customers and our partners for helping us with a strong finish to the challenging year. As we stated, we think the inventory digestion is complete and we're now returning to a more normalized demand environment. I'm encouraged by the broad based demand that we saw in the quarter across the -- and the continued progress we're making with our customers around AI and particularly cyber security as well as core networking and beginning to see that it is actually getting a lift from AI in the enterprise space. We're very pleased with the progress we've made with Splunk with the early traction and some of the wins. You can count on us for continued financial discipline as you always have seen. And you can always also count on us to continue to invest in the future as we're doing in AI infrastructure, networking, silicon and cyber to drive future growth and future profitability. So thank you for being with us and we look forward to seeing you all soon.\nSami Badri: Thank you all for joining us. Cisco's next quarterly call, which will reflect our fiscal year 2025 first quarter results will be on Wednesday, November 13th, 2024 at 1:30 p.m., Pacific Time, 4:30 p.m., Eastern Time. I'll hand it over to Michelle.\nOperator: Thank you for participating on today's conference call. If you would like to listen to the call in its entirety, you may call 866-510-4837.

            "name": "Chuck Robbins",
            "content": "Thanks, Sami, and thank you all for joining us today. We had a strong close to fiscal '24, delivering $13.6 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter, coming in above the high end of our guidance range and $53.8 billion in revenue for the year, coupled with growth in annualized recurring revenue, remaining performance obligations and subscription revenue. We also generated excellent margins boosted by Splunk. Our gross margin of 67.5% was the highest for Cisco in 20 years. We saw steady demand as we closed the year with total product order growth of 14% and growth of 6% excluding Splunk, indicating that the period of inventory digestion by our customers is now largely behind us as we expected. We've also been investing to accelerate critical innovation in key areas with Hypershield and hyperfabric for AI being two outstanding examples. With Splunk now part of Cisco, we believe we have an unmatched capability to unlock the full power of the network with market leading security and observability solutions to deliver even greater value for our customers. We have hit the ground running since we brought the Splunk and Cisco teams together, integrating powerful new customer solutions and beginning to realize early synergies. We know that our biggest competitive differentiator is the power of our full portfolio. This is why earlier today, we announced that we will be bringing our networking, security and collaboration teams together as one organization with Jeetu Patel stepping into an expanded role as Chief Product Officer to lead this group effective immediately. As we complete the full integration of Splunk into Cisco, the Splunk product line will also integrate into this new organization at the right time, bringing our entire product portfolio together as one team. With this new organization, our products will come together in a more integrated way than ever before, positioning us to deliver incredibly powerful outcomes for our customers. Looking ahead, we remain laser focused on growth and consistent execution as we invest to win in AI, cloud and cyber security. To focus on these key priority areas, today, we announced a restructuring plan to allow us to both invest in key growth opportunities as well as drive more efficiency in our business. Now let me share some details on our fourth quarter. We delivered solid performance in Q4 with revenue coming above the high end of our guidance range. Strong operating leverage across our business once again drove non-GAAP margins above the high end of our expectations, resulting in earnings per share also coming in above the high end of our guidance range. We continue to focus on growth in our recurring revenue streams, annualized recurring revenue, remaining performance obligations and subscription revenue all showed solid growth and subscriptions made up 56% of our revenue in the quarter. We also continued to deliver on our commitment to consistent capital returns. In Q4, we returned $3.6 billion in value to our shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends, bringing the total to $12.1 billion in value returned in fiscal '24 or 119% of free cash flow. In terms of customer demand, as I mentioned earlier, we saw steady demand in Q4. This resulted in double-digit product order growth across all geographies and strength in all customer markets despite persistent macro uncertainty. Public sector demand was particularly strong worldwide, driven by federal spending in the U.S. and strength in APJC. Enterprise demand returned to strength in the quarter with solid performance in the Americas and EMEA and even stronger results in APJC. We signed several $100 million plus transactions in the quarter with global enterprises, who are leveraging the breadth of our technology platforms to modernize and automate their network operations and deploy next-generation machine learning and AI applications. I'd like to highlight one of the largest deals we signed in the quarter with a leading global logistics company to advance their efforts in creating the world's most flexible, efficient and intelligent logistics network. Cisco's technology platforms across switching, routing, security and observability will enable our customer to automate network operations with cutting edge innovations like AI-powered robotics and unmatched supply chain visibility. We also signed our first cross portfolio agreement that includes Splunk with a major automotive company in this quarter. AI is transforming every aspect of our customers' IT environments. They need to modernize their infrastructure, harness the full power of AI and data and improve their cybersecurity posture, all while building agility and resiliency across their entire digital footprint. Our customers continue to put their trust in Cisco and we are very well-positioned to be their strategic partner for this era. In-service provider, while our telco and cable customer demand remain muted overall amid continued industry wide pressure, we saw strength in EMEA, driven by investment in AI operations and autonomous networks by service providers to help them monetize their B2B offerings. We are also encouraged to see signs of stabilization and improved performance in webscale in terms of pipeline and demand with double-digit order growth. To provide some incremental color, let me share some data on demand through the lens of our products. Excluding Splunk, security product orders grew double-digits. Collaboration product orders grew double-digits. In our networking portfolio, data center switching also saw double-digit product order growth and enterprise routing, campus switching and wireless orders were also strong with wireless orders greater than $1 million, up more than 20% year-over-year as customers look to enhance their office environments. Across the breadth of our portfolio and global customer base, our product order results demonstrate strengthening demand as our customers focused on their next top priority technology investments. While customers continue to ruthlessly prioritize their investments, our product order results demonstrate that our customers continue to look to Cisco as they focus on their most important technology initiatives. Now turning to look at our product categories in more detail. We saw revenue growth in security and double-digit growth in observability year-over-year, excluding Splunk as customers look to enhance their digital resilience with Cisco's technologies. We've had extremely positive feedback from customers with early access to Hypershield, the first truly distributed AI-native cybersecurity solution built into the fabric of the network. Hypershield furthers our vision for the Cisco Security Cloud, which is expected to deliver the industry's most comprehensive, unified platform with end-to-end solutions, making it easier for our customers to protect against evolving threats and we look forward to making it available this fall. Our new security solutions, XDR and Secure Access are continuing to gain strong traction. We added over 230 new XDR customers in Q4. Early in the quarter, we announced the integration of Cisco XDR with Splunk Enterprise Security. And at the Black Hat Cybersecurity Conference earlier this month, we announced the availability of Talos Incident response for Splunk customers, enabling access to the full suite of proactive and emergency services to help prepare for, respond to and recover from a breach. We also continue to capitalize on the multi-billion dollar AI infrastructure opportunity. We have now crossed $1 billion in AI orders with web scale customers to date with three of the top four hyperscalers deploying our Ethernet AI fabric, leveraging Cisco validated designs for AI infrastructure. We expect an additional $1 billion of AI product orders in fiscal year '25. As I shared at our Investor Day in June, this momentum is being fueled by multiple use cases in production with the hyperscalers, several of which are in AI. In addition, we have multiple design wins with roughly two-third of these in AI. Over and above the web scale AI opportunity, we believe we are well-positioned to be the key beneficiary of AI application proliferation in the enterprise. Our hyperfabric AI cluster solution created with NVIDIA helps our enterprise customers build infrastructure to run generative AI models and inference applications. The on-premise solution will guide users from design to validated deployment to monitoring and assurance when it becomes available later this fiscal year. We are also enhancing our own productivity by using AI in our services and customer experience organization. We have a robust AI and automation framework that touches at least 50% of our service requests. In addition, we are incorporating AI assistance into our products so that our customer and partners have efficient options to access support. Before I hand it over to Scott, I want to take a moment to thank our teams for all their hard work to close out the year and their relentless focus on our customers. In closing, while we're pleased with our performance in a dynamic environment, we know we have to drive strong execution to be successful in the growing markets we serve. We believe this will result in strong growth and profitability as we enter fiscal 2025. I'll now turn it over to Scott to provide more detail on the quarter and our outlook. Thanks, Meta. Yes, I would say if you look across the portfolio, just if I go around the world a little bit on the demand side, from a geographic perspective, it was very balanced at Americas and Europe up 6%, Asia up 8%. This is -- these all these numbers are excluding Splunk that I'm going to talk about real quickly. The segments enterprise was plus 3%, cloud and SP was plus 2% and then public sector was plus 15%. And so we saw a pretty balanced strength there. But across the technology portfolio, it was incredibly balanced. So we saw double-digit growth, as we said in security, double-digit growth in collaboration. And then in the networking space, I think it's important to point out the switching business and the enterprise -- the enterprise switching and the enterprise routing businesses were both up high-single-digits and the wireless business was up double-digits. And again, I think Scott had in his remarks that the number of $1 million transactions in wireless alone was up 20% year-over-year. So we saw super balanced demand across the portfolio. The one thing I would say that we heard for the first time this quarter that we haven't heard before is that customers -- enterprise customers are now actually upgrading their infrastructure in preparation for AI. And in some cases, they're taking some of the dollars that they've set aside for AI to actually spend it on modernizing their infrastructure in order to get ready for that. And you saw that with some of the examples we gave in these platform sales, the large logistics company that we have that actually bought the cross-portfolio solution, the whole platform, Cisco platforms and they're looking to enable AI-powered robotics, AI-powered supply chain visibility, et cetera. So we think we're beginning to see customers actually prepare for AI applications, even though in many cases, they may not know the full range of what they will be deploying, but they know they need to be ready. So that's kind of what we saw. Yes, Meta, I would just add on that one that there -- we actually are shifting hundreds of millions of dollars into AI, into AI networking for cloud, into AI infrastructure, silicon and cyber. So it's a -- it's a meaningful shift, but we feel like the market is moving so quickly we have to do that. Let me -- I'm sorry. Go ahead. Thanks , Tal. Let me just make a comment on the restructuring and Scott, you can talk a little bit about it, and then I'll take the security question back. So on the restructuring, the answer to that is no, there's nothing else out there. We had tremendous demand across the portfolio. It was very broad based and it was very consistent. It really is about ensuring in a rapidly moving markets that we serve that we're able to shift resources into the most important areas. So that's really it. Scott, anything to add? And then on the security question, yes, Tal, if you think back to -- go back about a year, what I had said, I felt like what happened is that we would start seeing improvement in the second half of fiscal '24. We were high-single-digits in Q3, we were double-digits in Q4, and I said we should see the real momentum kick in '25. And I think that's what we're feeling the beginning of that. As it relates specifically to CrowdStrike, it's hard for me to say, I will tell you that we added 230 more XDR customers, we're pushing 600 customers on that platform, which is a -- it's a pretty significant decision when customers make that decision. So that's encouraging. And candidly, the secure access product that is the cloud edge security solution is actually ramping even faster than XDR did. So the teams have done a great job with this innovation. We have 2,200 customers now that are using our AI assistant in security. And so that's very encouraging as well. So we're really optimistic about what the teams have been doing in this space. Samik, could you ask a follow-up now, please? Yes. So on the AI orders, we did talk about the fact that we crossed $1 billion to date in the web scale space, which is solid. And at Investor Day, we talked about the number of design wins we've had, which are wins where we have received the go ahead from these customers that they're going to go with us assuming we execute and deliver on the design as they have spected. And so we're only 2.5 weeks into the year, so it's hard to say right now how those are going to flow throughout the balance of the year. But I will say that one of the absolute largest players in this space actually told us last week that they are releasing orders in one of those design wins. So one of those design wins will start to generate orders in the near future. So I think things are playing out as we expected. And candidly, it's just up to us to execute and deliver on what they've asked us to deliver. Yes, I think that's really important, Scott, because we said that Splunk typically has a six to nine months sales cycle. And we closed I think over 10 of these cross-sell deals that were worked between the Cisco sales force and the Splunk sales force last quarter, which was promising and we also, as I said in my comments, we did the first cross-portfolio agreement that would have traditionally been a Cisco offer to one of our largest customers in the U.S. and we actually transacted it with Splunk included in that. So we're beginning to see what we would have expected at this point and maybe even a little ahead of what I would have expected at this point. Yes, George, thank you. You nailed it. Actually, you could answer for me. I think the -- if you look at what our biggest competitive differentiation is in the marketplace, it's really when we do deep cross integration across the portfolio and we're delivering on a platform strategy for our customers. And I felt like with the pace at which the AI revolution is moving and what our enterprise customers need from us. And candidly as security and networking continue to become more tightly intertwined, I just felt like it was important for us to have a single leader. And if you look at what Jeetu has accomplished in his four years here when he took on the collaboration business originally, I think everybody remembers what the portfolio was like then versus what it's doing now with double-digit growth this quarter. And obviously in the security portfolio, he's done exactly as we had expected. And I think we have a great networking team and I think his focus on execution, innovation and sense of urgency, I think is going to be really welcome there. And so we look forward to seeing what that -- what the teams accomplished and the innovation that they'll deliver in the future. Thank you. Yes, Amit, on the first one, we've talked about this in the past. The headwind that we have for fiscal '25, we talked about this back at the -- on the Q3 call and again at our Investor Day, we still have a tough compare in Q1, as you know. Q1 of fiscal '24, the year that just ended, we had significant amount of product shipments from excess backlog. Round number is $4 billion of shipment, we included in those Q1 numbers. And obviously, you can only ship that backlog once. So we don't get to ship that again in Q1 of this year. That not only creates a dislocation in what the growth rates are for Q1, but it impacts the entire year as well. So one of the things that we talked about on the last call was if you looked at our growth rate of the core business and said X backlog and X Splunk, you can do the pencil math and see what is that growth rate. And it's in that same range that we gave you for the long-term growth rate. So that's what's kind of underneath the positive news that we're seeing around demand returning to normal patterns, but then the headwind that creates to revenue growth for the year in the guide. On the cost reductions from the actions that we're taking, it really is a case, much like it was last year of us finding those efficiencies across the company and really reallocating. So think of it as much more of a reallocation process than it is a cost savings process. That's -- this is the same financial discipline you've seen from us for the last couple of years. And as I said in answering the question earlier that the kind of the hallmark of that is when you look at a year, which was a tough year in terms of revenue production and with the discipline that we have, we still delivered the highest operating margin we have in the company -- in the history of the company. So think of it that way. We need to pivot more resources into the fastest growth areas of our business and we're doing it by finding efficiencies and then reallocating those costs. Thanks, Simon. So I'll take the AI one. I would say that it doesn't have a meaningful amount of enterprise built into it. It's -- we are beginning to see the enterprise pipeline build a bit, but it's mostly predominantly the same thing that we've talked about in the past, which is a web scale infrastructure space. So if the enterprise picks up materially somewhere along the way, then that number could be higher. The other thing I'd point out is, I also believe over time, it's going to be -- it's going to get more and more difficult to really identify orders that are AI related because as I said earlier, we're beginning to see enterprise that are enterprises now that are updating their infrastructure as a result of AI. So does that count as an AI order or not? But anyway, we're going to -- we're going to stay pretty pure to how we measured them so far as we -- as we continue to update you on these numbers, but I think that's how it's going to play out over the course of the year. Thanks, Matthew. I think that, look, these are happening primarily in the large enterprise and in the large public sector customers. That's where we see it. In the quarter, we had large enterprise and large public sector customers that actually executed on these nine figure deals. So it's happening across a broad array of customers in different industries. And I would say that when it comes to security and networking, you're seeing it particularly in the -- at the cloud edge. As you know, when you see SD-WAN and the cloud security coming together. But we're also beginning to see it and we're going to actually drive it in the data center with Hypershield where you have security embedded deeply in the network. And I think that one of the -- one of the key benefits of the organizational change that we made is that you're going to see more and more innovation that is going to actually come from us where the security and the network are more tightly connected in the future. Yes, thanks Ittai. You're right. Most of these large platform deals are existing customers for sure. In some cases, these are the first -- this is the first time we've done one and in some cases, it's a renewal of one we did three, five years ago. So it varies. And I would say in all the customers, I'd say the big thing is probably an expansion for us now is the -- is the real recognition that the security portfolio is much more robust and the innovation that's been driven in that platform, I think is one of the advantages that the customers are really seeing through these platform deals that we're seeing. But also, again, I think when you get into the use cases, it's really important to understand that some of them are actually doing these now in preparation for these AI workloads like the AI-powered robotics example that we gave earlier. On the cloud order growth, that 2% was a combination of service provider and traditional service provider and cloud, the hyperscalers. And so if you look at the hyperscalers, we saw very significant growth in the second half of the year and in Q4. We said double-digits. I would just say it was meaningful and it was really refreshing to see. And as Scott said earlier, we feel like this digestion period is behind us now as we -- as we had hoped and thought it would be by the end of Q4. And so we hope to see normal buying behavior in the hyperscalers over the coming quarters. Yes, I think from Gary's perspective, he's not on the call with us today, but I think he's focused on -- we're putting in cross-sell incentives for the -- for Splunk on the Cisco sales force. We're going to be -- we're going to incent the security sellers inside Cisco. We're looking at the Splunk sales force over time being able to sell the security portfolio from Cisco. But he's focused on simplicity. He's focused on more frontline quota carrying reps. He's focused on investing in more capacity in the enterprise space where these platform deals are more prevalent, more systems engineering and a real doubling down on the focus on core networking and infrastructure. So I think you're going to see a real -- a real renewed effort to get the team's focus not only on some of the software assets and security, but really doubling down on core networking. Thanks, Ben. So on the enterprise AI, what I would say is some customers like these platform deals that we talked about, they're buying the entire portfolio to refresh their infrastructure to actually because they have applications that they've already identified like the ones we were referencing earlier. In other cases, they are updating their data center infrastructure and their core network infrastructure to be ready for smaller training models on their own private data and or inference. It just varies across the board. And I think to be honest with you, a lot of customers are -- would tell you that we're not really sure exactly what the applications are going to look like, but I know one thing for sure is it I need to have a modern and up-to-date infrastructure to be prepared for that. So I'm just going to go in and see where do I -- where do I need to make those investments. In some cases, I may need to update my switching infrastructure. In some cases, it may be new wireless. We saw data center switching in double-digits as well. So I think it -- I think it was fairly broad based. And then I'd say on the NVIDIA partnership, it's too early. We're not even in early field trials yet with that solution. So I don't think there's a lot to share yet. Yes. So on the $1 billion, I would say it is primarily back end and it is a combination of both Ethernet and optics. We have a very robust optics business and it is competing with the players that you would suspect that we would compete with. In some cases, it's a system from us. In some cases, it's a -- perhaps it's a white box solution. But one of the big advantages we have is that we can actually sell them silicon, we can sell them, we can help them build white boxes or we can sell them integrated systems and it's a combination of all those things as well as optics. And then on the second one, you want to take? Yes. Thanks, Aaron. I'll answer the first and then Scott, you can take the second. The -- we believe that we are finally back to normal ordering patterns. And we were talking about it as we're getting ready for this call and it's literally been four years that we've been going through this and with -- between COVID and then the supply chain shock and then having to deal with this digestion challenge at the end. So we're quite happy to be here. But we feel like we are back to normal ordering patterns. So it should be -- should be like it was prior to the pandemic. Scott? Yes. And on price stability, Karl, if you go -- you got to go back away as Chuck just said. But if you go back to where we were before the supply chain issues and then of course, the price increases that we had to put in place because our cost went up significantly. And then it took a while, as you remember, for those price increases to turn into orders, those orders to work-through the backlog and get shipped out. We've now sort of lapped the point where we've gotten to price stability. So expect to see price impact back where it's always been historically. It's typically -- every deal we do is a competitive deal, all right. And so there's always some price competition around that, but expect it to be in the range that it was historically somewhere in that -- anywhere from 0.5% to 1.5% per quarter. Thanks. I want to thank all of you for joining again today. We appreciate you being with us. I want to thank our teams, our customers and our partners for helping us with a strong finish to the challenging year. As we stated, we think the inventory digestion is complete and we're now returning to a more normalized demand environment. I'm encouraged by the broad based demand that we saw in the quarter across the -- and the continued progress we're making with our customers around AI and particularly cyber security as well as core networking and beginning to see that it is actually getting a lift from AI in the enterprise space. We're very pleased with the progress we've made with Splunk with the early traction and some of the wins. You can count on us for continued financial discipline as you always have seen. And you can always also count on us to continue to invest in the future as we're doing in AI infrastructure, networking, silicon and cyber to drive future growth and future profitability. So thank you for being with us and we look forward to seeing you all soon."

            "content": "Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter, then cover the full-fiscal year, followed by our guidance. Our Q4 results reflect solid execution with strong margins and strength in orders as customer buying patterns begin to return to normal. For the quarter, total revenue was above the high-end of our guidance range at $13.6 billion, down 10% year-over-year comparing against our strongest quarter ever in the fourth quarter of fiscal '23. Float contributed approximately $960 million in revenue for the quarter, in line with our expectations. Non-GAAP net income was $3.5 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share was above the high-end of our guidance range at $0.87. The interest impact from financing the Splunk acquisition more than offset the positive operating impact of Splunk. The net effect was a negative impact of $0.04 on non-GAAP earnings per share for the quarter. Looking at our Q4 revenue in more detail. Total product revenue was $9.9 billion, down 15% as we move through the final quarter of customer inventory issues and services revenue was $3.8 billion, up 6%. Networking, our largest product category was down 28% when compared to our Q4 '23 networking revenues, which benefited from near-record shipments of excess backlog. Security was up 81%, including the benefit from Splunk. Excluding Splunk, security grew 6%, driven by competitive wins and growth in SASE and double-digit growth in network security. Collaboration was flat, driven by growth in our cloud calling and CPaaS offerings, offset by declines in meetings and devices. Observability was up 41%, driven by growth in our observability suite, our Splunk observability offering and 1000 hours Network services. Excluding Splunk, observability grew 12% for the quarter. Looking at our recurring metrics, ARR ended the quarter at $29.6 billion, which increased 22% due to continued strong performance and contribution from Splunk. These factors also drove our product ARR growth of 43%. Without Splunk, ARR was $25.3 billion, up 4% and product ARR was up 9%. Total subscription revenue increased 17% to $7.7 billion, which now represents 56% of Cisco's total revenue. Without Splunk, total subscription revenue was up 2%, representing 53% of Cisco's total revenue. Total software revenue was up 15% at $5.3 billion, with software subscription revenue up 25%. 92% of our total software revenue was subscription-based. Without Splunk, software revenue was down 5% due to declines in perpetual license software as we move to more subscription-based software arrangements. Software subscription revenue was up 2%. Total RPO was $41.0 billion, up 18% due to both strong organic performance and the addition of Splunk. Product RPO grew 27%. Total short-term RPO was up 17%. Without Splunk, RPO was $37.5 billion, up 8% with product RPO also grew at 8%. As Chuck said, Q4 product orders were up 14% year-over-year. Excluding Splunk, product orders were up 6% year-over-year, indicating the period of inventory digestion by our customers is now largely behind us. Looking at our product orders across our geographic segments year-over-year, Americas was up 15%, EMEA was up 12% and APJC was up 16%. In our customer markets, public sector was up 20%, enterprise was up 13% and service provider cloud was up 5%. Total non-GAAP gross margin came in at 67.9%, up 200 basis points year-over-year and exceeding the high-end of our guidance range. Product gross margin was 67.0%, up 150 basis points, largely driven by Splunk and favorable product mix, offset by price. Services gross margin was 70.3%, up 280 basis points. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at the high-end of our guidance range at 32.5%. Shifting to the balance sheet We ended Q4 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $17.9 billion. Operating cash flow was $3.7 billion. Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we returned $3.6 billion to shareholders comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and $2.0 billion of share repurchases. We took advantage of market conditions to increase our share repurchases during the quarter. Turning to the full-fiscal year. We delivered strong margins and increased our operating leverage. Revenue at $53.8 billion made fiscal '24 Cisco's second strongest year on record as compared to the all-time high revenues of $57 billion in fiscal '23, which benefited from significant shipments of heightened backlog. Splunk contributed approximately $1.4 billion in revenue after the close of the acquisition in March of this year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.73, exceeding the high-end of our guidance range, down 4% year-over-year. Splunk was $0.04 dilutive to full-year earnings, including the impact of financing costs. In terms of our recurring metrics, total software revenue for the full-year was up 9% at $18.4 billion, with the product portion also up 9%. Software subscription revenue was up 15%. 89% of total software revenue was subscription-based. Without Splunk, total software revenue was up 1%. Total subscription revenue was $27.4 billion, an increase of 11%. Without Splunk, total subscription revenue was up 6%. As Chuck mentioned, total non-GAAP gross margin was 67.5%, up 300 basis points and the highest in 20 years. On the bottom line, non-GAAP net income was $15.2 billion. Operating cash flow was $10.9 billion. As a reminder, cash flow was impacted by the timing of large tax payments in fiscal '24 compared to fiscal '23. In the year, we returned $12.1 billion in value to shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases. It was comprised of $6.4 billion in quarterly cash dividends and $5.8 billion of share repurchases. We increased our dividend for the 13th consecutive year in fiscal '24, reinforcing our confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows. To summarize, we executed well in Q4 and the fiscal year. We exited the year with order levels improving as customers largely completed the implementation of record Cisco product shipments. Further, as Chuck mentioned, we are realigning our expenses to better capture the opportunities ahead. As part of our announced restructuring plan, we expect to impact approximately 7% of our global workforce with total estimated pre-tax charges of up to $1 billion. Turning to our financial guidance. For fiscal Q1, our guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $13.65 billion to $13.85 billion. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 67% to 68%. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 32% to 33%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.86 to $0.88. And in Q1, we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 19%. For fiscal year '25, our guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $55 billion to $56.2 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $3.52 to $3.58. And we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 19%. Sami, let's now move into the Q&A. And Meta, I want to make sure I got your second question right. Did you say it's the full-risk embedded in fiscal '25 guidance? Yes, it is. And it's a good place to kind of explain a little bit more detail what that -- what that action is about. It's not about cost saving. So the answer is yes. It's embedded in the guide, but it's much more about finding efficiencies across the company so that we can pivot more resources, much like we did last year into the fastest growth areas within the company, which are pivoting more into AI, pivoting more into cloud and pivoting more into cyber security. So think of it more as reallocating versus being in pursuit of cost savings. But yes, it's all built into the guide. Just -- Tal, this is just a continuation of what you've seen us do. And we talked at Investor Day about having already pivoted on the R&D front, little more than 50% of our R&D spend into those three areas, into AI, cloud and cyber security. Obviously, networking continues to be incredibly important to us and we'll continue to support that space as well. But it's looking for efficiencies as we -- as we look across the company really in every way so that we can take those resources and allocate them into the fastest growing spaces. I think it's -- think of it as more of just the financial discipline that you've always seen from us. I mean, if you just look at the year we just closed, obviously, it was a challenging year on the top line for revenue and yet we reported the highest operating margin in the history of the company. So this is just more of the financial discipline that I think you've noticed for. Yes. And Samik, on Splunk, as we said in the opening commentary, it's progressing right in line with our expectations that the focus of that transaction was much more about driving revenue. Of course, it's a long sales cycle. We've already seen, as Chuck mentioned, double-digit number of deals that have closed with our two sales forces selling together. So the momentum in the field is good, Splunk. The better metric for Splunk, we talked about revenue because that obviously shows up in the P&L. The better metric for them is ARR and their ARR is continuing to grow in double-digits, which is right where it was the last time they reported as a public company. So continuing to see good momentum and beginning to see the green shoots of the sales force is really selling together. We've also done a fair number of product integrations. And I think Chuck talked about several of those in his piece of the script. And so what's going to happen over time is it's going to be harder and harder to say what is with these integrated product sets, what is Splunk revenue and what is Cisco revenue. I will tell you, we've built in the full impact of where we expect the combined company to be. But I think defining longer-term, how much of that is allocated to historical Splunk and how much that's allocated to historical Cisco is going to get tougher and tougher. So what I'd tell you is it's built -- it's performing well. We're already seeing good signs of the sales forces selling together and it's built into the guide. And Simon, on your second question, obviously, for the full-year, we don't guide at that level. We guide -- we've given you revenue, we've given you what -- what to expect on EPS. But for Q1, we also gave you the ranges for gross margin and op margin. And you know there's in below the op margin line in OI&E, we've talked about the interest impact of the money that we spent to acquire Splunk. And I think you understand what that looks like. So what I'd give you as an additional modeling point is when you look through the year, we talked about the Q1 guide being gross margin in the 67% to 68% range and op margins being in the 32% to 33% range, it stays pretty well in that range for the full-year as well. And Matt, what I'd add to the second part of your question kind of how much of the large deals and where does that go? Just a quick data point for you. We talked about product order growth ex-Splunk being at 6%. If you netted out these large -- we call them whole portfolio agreements. If you netted those out of both years, actually the product order bookings growth goes up modestly. Think of it as being in the same range. So while it was a good quarter for that, it always is in Q4, it's not the outsized driver of our growth. We're seeing growth really across the board. Yes, Jim, I'll start. I think the -- again, think of that as the reduction that we're doing as much more of a reallocation versus a headcount savings. In some cases, the efficiencies that we're going to get will be from by moving into lower cost locations. So it's not as easy to do the math to say like, hey, if you were 90,000 heads before and 7%, I expect you to be at whatever the math works out to. Some of that is not going to be just a one-for-one headcount change, it's going to be savings that come by putting more work into lower cost locations. So it's -- I don't think the math is going to help you as you try to build out your model. Yes, well, Aaron, and this is back to what I was touching on earlier that if you remember, Q1 of fiscal '24, the compare point for our current quarter, also had a pretty significant amount of excess backlog clearance in it. We talked about it at Investor Day that it was in the $3.5 billion to $4 billion range of clearance that happened in Q1 a year ago. Obviously, that won't repeat in Q1 of this year. So while we're seeing a nice normalization of demand across the board, we've got that year-on-year headwind compare of not being able to have the significant backlog clearance again in Q1 of this year. You can add that to your math and you'll get a different outcome on what's happening in the core. Yes. And on the January dynamic on Splunk, like most enterprise software companies, not only do they get back end loaded into what was previously their fourth quarter, the January quarter that you talked about, but they also get very back end loaded within that quarter to the very end of it, right? And you see that with almost all enterprise software companies. The one bit of normalization that we've had to do is we brought Splunk in, our fiscal quarters don't actually end on the last day of the month. They end on the last Saturday of the month of that quarter. And so there's typically a tail of two or three days that would be the normal end of the Splunk quarter that doesn't fall into the end of our quarter. So it will be a muted impact on our second -- that January quarter is our second quarter. It will have a muted impact because we'll lose two or three days, which are two or three big days out of our Q2. Some of that will bleed over into Q3 for us. I would say on the -- on the ability to look out and see the demand side, notwithstanding some unforeseen shock, I think the teams are back to their normal visibility. I think that -- I'm trying to even remember what it was. It's been so long ago since we had it. But I think the -- they clearly have much greater visibility over the next 90-day period. That's -- we've seen that the last couple of quarters. And obviously with this final Q4 where we think that the issue is behind us. I think going-forward, you'll see it. And I think we'll continue to see greater visibility into the outer quarters relative to where we were over the last couple of years."

        "content": "Operator: Welcome to Cisco's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. At the request of Cisco, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now, I would like to introduce Sami Badri, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\nSami Badri: Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's third quarter fiscal year '24 conference call. This is Sami Badri, Cisco's Head of Investor Relations, and I am joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO, and Scott Herren, our CFO. And given our recently closed acquisition of Splunk, we are also joined by Gary Steele, the former CEO of Splunk, which is now a Cisco company. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2024. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. I will now turn it over to Chuck.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Sami, and thank you all for joining us today. We delivered a solid performance in Q3 with organic revenue coming in at the high end of our guidance range. Strong operating leverage across our business drove gross margins to exceed the high end of our expectations, resulting in better-than-anticipated earnings per share performance. We once again delivered good growth in annualized recurring revenue, remaining performance obligations and subscription revenue. We have transformed our business model with revenue from subscriptions now accounting for more than half of our total revenue even before the addition of Splunk. With the success of our transformation, we are well positioned to drive long-term growth powered by innovation across the organization. I want to thank the entire Cisco team as it is through their dedicated efforts that our research and development engine has never been stronger across networking and silicon, observability, security, collaboration, and AI. The strength of our core business continues to produce strong cash flows, reinforcing our ongoing commitment to delivering consistent capital returns. In Q3, we returned $2.9 billion in value to our shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends in the quarter with a total of $8.5 billion in value returned year-to-date. Q3 was significant for us in two important ways. First, I couldn't be more excited about the successful close of our Splunk acquisition, Cisco's largest ever. Our acquisition of Splunk was completed midway through our Q3 on March 18, earlier than initially anticipated. Splunk significantly expands our portfolio of software-based solutions, contributing over $4 billion in annualized recurring revenue and adds to our position as one of the largest software companies in the world. We are thrilled to welcome the Splunk team to Cisco and are very excited about what we can deliver for our customers as we integrate our complementary security and observability capabilities. Our unified platform will revolutionize how customers connect and protect their organizations using data in new ways to enhance their entire digital footprint. Second, we introduced Cisco Hypershield, our most significant new security innovation with a groundbreaking AI-powered approach to highly distributed security, a first-of-its-kind. Combining security and networking in a way only Cisco can, Hypershield is built in the very fabric of the network, bringing the power of hyperscaler security and connectivity to the enterprise. I will talk more about these developments and our innovation momentum in a few moments. But now, I'd like to turn to our performance in Q3 and what we're seeing in terms of customer demand. The breadth of our portfolio, together with our many touch points with partners and customers around the world, provides us with differentiated insight into what's happening in our customer base. Based on activations to the cloud, which we track as well as conversations with our customers and partners, we believe that the products customers have on hand are being steadily deployed in line with the expectations we laid out last quarter, meaning we currently expect customers to complete the installation of the majority of their inventory by the end of our fiscal year in July. At a time where customers are ruthlessly prioritizing their IT investments, we saw product order growth in two of our largest product portfolios, data center switching and campus switching, as well as product order growth in our security and collaboration product categories. Overall, product orders were up 4%, and excluding Splunk, product orders were flat year-on-year. In our customer markets, public sector was strong in EMEA and APJC, but continuing resolution discussions in the U.S. temporarily impacted public sector performance in the Americas. We believe this has since cleared with the subsequent signing of the most recent U.S. Federal Government funding legislation. While our telco and cable customer demand remain muted worldwide, we are encouraged to see early signs of stabilization and improved performance in Webscale in terms of pipeline and orders. Overall, our win rates are stable, and we saw increased strength as we move through the quarter. This reflects our competitive strength and successful execution and gives us confidence in the long term. We also know that the value of our portfolio is greater than ever as evidenced by recent sell-side research IT spending surveys, which show that Cisco is expected to be the only net share gainer within large network budgets over the next 12 months. Now, let's look at our performance in Q3 in more detail. We saw revenue growth in security and double-digit growth in observability year-over-year, excluding Splunk as customers look to enhance their digital resilience with Cisco's technologies. In the past year, we've accelerated our pace of innovation in security and I'm proud of what our teams have achieved. As I mentioned earlier, last month, we introduced Cisco Hypershield, the first truly distributed AI-native cybersecurity solution, which will be built into our networking fabric. This new innovation leverages the recently closed Isovalent acquisition to facilitate deployment in software and the first shipment is scheduled for August this year. This launch furthers our vision for the Cisco Security Cloud, which is expected to deliver the industry's most comprehensive unified platform with end-to-end solutions, making it easier for our customers to protect against the threats of today and tomorrow. Our newest available security solutions, XDR and Secure Access continue to ramp quickly with strong customer feedback. Just last week at RSA, we also announced the integration of Cisco XDR with Splunk Enterprise Security, which will give our customers even more value and insights. The closing of the Splunk acquisition in Q3 will also enable us to begin driving revenue synergies in our security and observability markets. Upon closing the deal, we identified 5,000 existing Cisco customers who have the potential to become meaningful Splunk customers and our sales teams are already making those connections. We also see significant opportunities for revenue synergies by leveraging Cisco's robust partner and customer ecosystem in markets where Splunk had limited or no presence. Earlier this week, Splunk was ranked as the leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for security incident and event management, which is a testament to the strength of the offering and the continued business momentum that Splunk has delivered. We are working on rapid integration, investing in both product integration and go-to-market resources, starting with aligning our Cisco and Splunk sales forces and accelerating channel enablement processes for cross-selling and upselling our combined solutions. We also continue to capitalize on the multi-billion-dollar AI infrastructure opportunity. In Webscale, we continue to see momentum with three of the top-four hyperscalers deploying our Ethernet AI fabric, leveraging Cisco-validated designs for AI infrastructure. In the past two quarters, Cisco has been granted additional design awards based on our 51.2 terabit G200 Silicon One ASIC. We expect these awards to yield orders in fiscal year '25, reinforcing our confidence in our line of sight to $1 billion of AI product orders in fiscal '25. Additionally, for those leading-edge enterprise customers who seek to be the early adopters of AI, our partnership with NVIDIA will offer easy-to-deploy cloud-based and on-prem networking solutions for AI inferencing. We believe we are well-positioned to be the key beneficiary of AI enterprise application proliferation with the breadth of our portfolio and the vast amounts of data we see. Before I turn it over to Scott, I'd like to share one more update. Earlier today, we announced that Jeff Sharritts, our Chief Customer and Partner Officer, is departing Cisco and that Gary Steele, Splunk's former CEO, has been named Cisco's new President of Go-to-Market. Gary is well known for his operational excellence, and in this new role, he will work closely with me to set and execute against our strategic plans and goals for the company. He will continue to lead the Splunk team through the integration process to ensure a seamless integration into Cisco. Gary's operational mindset, combined with his intense focus on simplicity and proven ability to drive growth, position him well in this role and I look forward to working closely with him in this new capacity. I'd also like to take a moment to thank Jeff for all that he's helped Cisco achieve, which is quite a long list of accomplishments in his 24 years here. Moving back to Q3, let me briefly summarize. While our core product portfolio is trending toward normalization as we continue to see customer deployments of shipped equipment progress, we are pleased that our security and observability portfolios have continued to grow and are significantly enhanced by the acquisitions of Splunk and Isovalent. As our customers adopt and deploy AI, they need the infrastructure to power it, the data to develop it and the security to protect it. And we believe only Cisco can deliver and integrate all three. With our unified platform approach, vast global partner ecosystem and ability to support hybrid and multi-cloud environments, we will deliver innovation at an unprecedented pace and scale to organizations around the globe. I'll now turn it over to Scott to provide more detail on the quarter and our outlook.\nScott Herren: Thanks, Chuck. Our Q3 results reflect solid execution with strong margins and a stabilization of orders. Both including and excluding Splunk, our revenue, gross margin, and non-GAAP earnings per share were at or above the high end of our Q3 guidance range. Total revenue was $12.7 billion, down 13% year-over-year. Splunk contributed $413 million in revenue in the partial quarter post-close. Non-GAAP net income was $3.6 billion, down 14%. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.88, down 12%. The interest cost of financing with Splunk acquisition slightly more than offset the positive operating impact of Splunk. The net effect was a negative impact of $0.1 on non-GAAP earnings per share. Looking at our Q3 revenue in more detail, total product revenue was $9 billion, down 19% and service revenue was $3.7 billion, up 6%. Networking, our largest product category, was down 27%. We saw declines across almost all geographic segments due to the continued implementation of inventory by our customers. Bear in mind that our Q3 2023 networking revenues benefited from significant shipments of excess backlog. Security was up 36%, including the benefit received from the Splunk acquisition. Excluding Splunk, security grew 3%, driven by growth in SASE and double-digit growth in our Zero Trust offering. Collaboration was flat, driven by growth in our cloud calling and contact center offerings, offset by declines in meetings and devices. And observability was up 27%, driven by growth in ThousandEyes Network Services and the benefit from the Splunk acquisition. Excluding Splunk, observability grew 14% for the quarter. As Chuck said, we have successfully transformed our business model. ARR ended the quarter at $29.2 billion, which increased 22% due to continued strong performance and contribution from Splunk. These factors also drove our product ARR growth of 44%. Without Splunk, ARR was $25 billion, up 5% and product ARR was up 9%. Total subscription revenue increased 12% to $6.9 billion, which now represents 54% of Cisco's total revenue. Without Splunk, total subscription revenue was up 5%, representing 53% of Cisco's total revenue. Total software revenue was up 5% at $4.5 billion, with software subscription revenue up 17%. Without Splunk, total software revenue was down 4% and software subscription revenue was up 6%. 91% of our total software revenue was subscription-based. Total RPO was $38.8 billion, up 21% due to both strong performance and the Splunk acquisition. Product RPO grew 29%. Total short-term RPO was $20.1 billion, up 19%. Without Splunk, RPO was $35.3 billion, up 10% with product RPO also growing at 10%. Q3 product orders were up 4%. Excluding Splunk, product orders were flat year-over-year. We see customer product implementations progressing in line with our expectations and we expect these deployments to be largely complete by the end of our current fiscal year. Looking at our geographic segments year-over-year, the Americas was up 6%, EMEA was up 4%, and APJC was down 1%. In our customer markets, service provider and cloud was up 10%, the public sector was up 6% and enterprise was up 2%. Total non-GAAP gross margin came in at 68.3%, up 310 basis points year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. Product gross margin was 66.9%, up 240 basis points, of which Splunk contributed 70 basis points. The remaining improvement was driven primarily by a favorable product mix and lower freight and other costs. Service gross margin was 71.6%, up 430 basis points. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 34.2%, up 30 basis points, driven by our continued commitment to disciplined spend management. Operating cash flow was $4 billion, down 24%. Shifting to the balance sheet. We ended Q3 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $18.8 billion. Uses of cash during the quarter included a net outflow of $27.4 billion related to our acquisition of Splunk and in line with our capital allocation strategy, we returned $2.9 billion in value to our shareholders, including $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and $1.3 billion of share repurchases. Year-to-date, we've returned $8.5 billion in capital to our shareholders. To summarize, we successfully completed the acquisition of Splunk, drove strong non-GAAP margins, and increased our operating leverage in the quarter. Turning to our financial guidance that includes our integration of Splunk. For Q4, our guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $13.4 billion to $13.6 billion. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 66.5% to 67.5%. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to range from 31.5% to 32.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.84 to $0.86. Our Q4 guidance includes $950 million to $1 billion in revenue from Splunk and non-GAAP EPS of negative $0.03 as the interest impact more than offsets the operating benefit. In Q4, we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 18%. For fiscal year '24, our guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $53.6 billion to $53.8 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is expected to range from $3.69 to $3.71. We're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 19%. Looking beyond Q4 and into our fiscal 2025, in addition to the top-line benefits from the Splunk acquisition, there are a few points to bear in mind as you build your models. First, we expect revenue growth to be in the low-to mid-single-digit range next year. Second is the interest impact from the acquisition, which we expect to be a headwind of approximately $350 million per quarter, including both the foregone interest from cash off the balance sheet and the additional interest payments on debt. Third, we're working to quickly integrate Splunk into our product offerings, go-to-market engine and expect to invest in OpEx in fiscal '25 to drive those revenue synergies. Given these points, we expect fiscal '25 operating margin to be in line with our Q4 guidance. We'll give more formal guidance as we get to the next earnings call, but I want to make sure you have those three thoughts in mind. And as we've stated, we expect the deal to be non-GAAP earnings per share accretive in fiscal '26 and beyond. Sami, let's now move into the Q&A.\nA - Sami Badri: Thank you, Scott. Before we start the Q&A portion of the call, I'd like to remind analysts to ask one question and a single follow-up question. Operator, can we move to the first analyst in the queue?\nOperator: Thank you. Amit Daryanani with Evercore. You may go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I have two. I'll ask them both at the same time. Chuck, it's really nice to hear about inventory digestion sort of being done and order growth getting back to flat and growing in some of the verticals. Some of your tech -- some of the tech companies, I guess, have talked about a softer macro-environment that's resulting in some positive spending. So, I'd love to understand kind of away from the inventory digestion that this seems like it's happening, what are you seeing from a macro-environment and if that's actually starting to improve as well for you folks? And then if I could just follow up on a different side, the $1 billion of AI orders that you have -- you know that you see -- that you believe you can get in fiscal '25, can you just talk about is this other wins more coming from the Silicon One side or optical or on the switching solution? Just any clue on kind of where do you expect to get these wins would be helpful. Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Thank you, Amit. Appreciate the questions. So from a macro perspective, what I would say is that ironically, we saw the quarter actually slow -- showed slight improvement as we move through the quarter. So the end of the quarter was actually a little stronger than the beginning. So we -- and look, we obviously believe that our customers now are on track with the inventory digestion that we talked about last quarter, so that's positive. But we saw the Americas excluding Splunk was up 2%, so that was a positive sign and Europe was flat. So that was good. And when you see campus switching and data center switching, both positive. And by the way, data center switching was in the mid-teens growth. So customers are investing in these private data centers and collaboration being positive, security being high-single-digits on the order side, it was, you know, but we didn't see any different behavior from our customers during this quarter than we've seen. They still are ruthlessly prioritizing what projects they spend money on, where they spend their IT dollars, but we didn't see any fundamental shift in the macro. On the second question, on the $1 billion of AI, it is largely driven by the Webscale infrastructure. As I said, we had -- we've got three out of four that are running our AI Ethernet fabric and we also had two or three more design wins during the quarter, I believe, in the back-end networks inside these Webscale players. So, it's predominantly that. However, we are beginning to see enterprise pipeline materialize, as I said last quarter. So that's really what it's made up of. And it is both systems as well as optics across those customers.\nSami Badri: Thank you, Amit. Operator, can we move to the next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next caller is Simon Leopold with Raymond James. You may go ahead, sir.\nSimon Leopold: Great. Appreciate you taking the question. I wanted to see if you could give us some metrics or some help trying to extrapolate the 5,000-customer opportunity for Splunk. And just give us a better idea of what that could mean from a dollars perspective, if you're able to penetrate it? And my follow-up is really, I'm trying to seek a little bit more clarification on this $1 billion AI pipeline because there's been a lot of debate in the investment community regarding it. So I want to see if we can get some clarification that when we talk about the context of what's in there, it's explicitly in the back-end that there's not some extrapolation to front-end data center applications. So explicitly back-end and I think, Chuck, you are saying that it is mostly switching in the back-end with some optics and some Silicon One. I really would like to clarify this because we're getting a lot of questions. Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: All right. Let me answer the second one first, if you don't mind since I just went on that one. It's a $1 billion of orders that we have line of sight to and next fiscal year is what I had said. And on one of the earlier calls, maybe last call, I think I said our pipeline was roughly three times that we see, but we believe we have good visibility to $1 billion in orders in FY '25. That is primarily back-end, and it is a combination of systems that are based on Silicon One, potentially some standalone Silicon One, but mostly systems and then optics as well. And then there's -- we're beginning to see some enterprise use cases, but it's predominantly back-end in the hyperscaler space. On the 5,000 customers, we basically did an analysis of where we have -- and Cisco has super strong relationships and Splunk doesn't have a presence of 5,000 customers and we've now mapped those to the sales teams. And Gary, you want to make a comment on that because you've been involved in that deeply.\nGary Steele: Yes. So we're excited about the fact that basically, we've identified these 5,000 customers where Splunk traditionally has had no footprint. And the goal there is to have the Cisco sellers open the door for the Splunk team. There's also a financial incentive or spiff in place to incent the Cisco sellers to support this activity. And that's really -- that's one aspect of where we see tremendous opportunity. And then second to that, obviously, there's a lot of overlap in our customers where the Cisco team may have higher, more strategic relationships where they can extend our footprint, assist in helping extend our footprint within the existing Splunk base and we're already seeing that activity right out of the gate. So we feel like we're off to a very good start and I'm super encouraged by the level of collaboration we've seen so far.\nSami Badri: Thank you, Simon. Operator, can we move to the next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next caller is Tal Liani with Bank of America. You may go ahead, sir.\nTal Liani: Hi, guys. I'm going to ask my two questions also together. They're linked. You have great motions in security with lots of new products and you have Splunk introduction to the channel and you have also the AI opportunity for Ethernet. Can you give us a sense of timing, meaning how long -- security grew again only 3%, ex-Splunk and how long does it take to get all the benefits that you're talking about in these three main areas or in general, is it something we're going to see early in '25 or later in '25 or '26, if you can give us just a sense of timing of all these initiatives? The second part is related to it. If I remove Splunk from the numbers and you gave us enough data to completely remove Splunk from '24 and I can take consensus for '25, then your core Cisco, meaning your initial growth expectations for '25 is about 5% because we need to remove also the backlog contribution this year. So, Cisco ex backlog contribution should grow 5%. It's higher than before. So the question is, are you comfortable with Cisco growing 5% next year, give or take? And what is the contribution -- what is the main component of this growth. Thanks.\nChuck Robbins: Tal, thanks for the question. So on the -- let's go with the first question and I'll say on the organic Cisco Security front, you're right, revenue was up 3%, but as I said, our demand was as high -- as the highest it's been in probably a couple of years and it was high-single-digits. So we're seeing the traction on these new products. They're just ramping, right? They're new, customers are testing, they're implementing. And by the way, a lot of it is ratable. So you don't -- you take the orders and then, you know, like close to 80% of our security portfolio is ratable. So that actually impacts the time for it to transition into revenue. So that's on the security side. But I think on the security and Splunk side, I'll talk about it a little bit. We've -- and then I'll let Gary comment on some of the integration. But we announced our first integration last week at RSA. Our intent is just to continue pushing innovation out. We'll have more announcements at Cisco Live. So I think that you'll continue to see that happen. I've always said on the security front even before Splunk that we had brought in a new team, we've been building new innovation. The team has built five new products and solutions from the ground up over the last 12 months, as you alluded to, just done a phenomenal job. And I had always said that second half of '24, I expected you would see an improvement and then in '25, you'll see it get to where we really need it to be. And I think that still stands. You want to comment on the Cisco, the integration stuff, Gary?\nGary Steele: You bet. So, one of the things I'm super excited about is the progress we've made from an integration standpoint. So last week at RSA, for example, we announced the integration between the Cisco XDR solution and Splunk's Enterprise Security solution. So bring -- bringing high telemetry alerts into Splunk Enterprise Security gives a Splunk customer that much more value in terms of threat detection. And this is just the start of the elements of integration that we can deliver that will ultimately drive growth for the security portfolio broadly, but also Splunk. And as we've described earlier, integration strategy really is a strong ground game, meaning we want to move the ball three yards at a time and we're going to demonstrate to the industry that we can continue to innovate at a rapid pace as a combined business. And we feel like we're on a really good track to do that.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Gary. And then on your AI timing question in '25, my suspicion is that that's going to start low at the beginning of the year, and it will ramp as we get through the year. So I'll be thinking more back-half, but we'll have to see how these pilots go. We'll probably know a little more about -- we'll know more in the next 90 days on that. On your second question, first of all, I appreciate the fact that you recognize that several billion of backlog that we cleared last year because this is the last -- this is a -- '25 will be a year where we're still going to have strange comparisons because we're just still coming out of the tail end of this supply chain situation and this whole digestion issue and the inventories, shipments and everything. So '26 over '25 will be the year where you will really hopefully get back to real apples-to-apples year-over-year comparisons. And while I'm not -- we aren't giving a breakdown today of the FY '25 Cisco or Splunk contribution, we'll obviously have an Analyst Day in June and we'll go into more detail there. And Scott, do you have anything to add to that? Or is that good?\nScott Herren: No, I think you said it right and Cal, the fact that you've recognized the backlog work off it, it clearly is a headwind on just the core Cisco when you look at year-on-year growth rate into fiscal '25. Bear in mind too, obviously, Q3 was a tough compare. If you remember that we had those three consecutive quarters of revenue growth in the mid-to-upper teens, Q3 of '23 that we're comparing to now, Q4 and then Q1 of this year. And so in addition to doing the year-on-year growth rates the way you're doing it, you need to think of the backlog impact on the year-on-year growth rates in both this quarter, next quarter, and again a tough compare in Q1 of '25.\nSami Badri: Thank you, Tal. Operator, can we move to the next question?\nOperator: Thank you. David Vogt with UBS. You may go ahead, sir.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thanks, guys, for taking my question. So maybe, Scott, I want to follow up on that line of questioning from Tal. Now I recognize that you have that backlog headwind in '24, but if I just kind of run through what Splunk should be doing versus what they contributed this year, it certainly looks like the backlog headwind is going to cause -- of course, is going to be down next year. I know you said you're going to hold off on giving numbers. Is that the right math? And so basically all of the low-single to mid-single-digit growth comes from Splunk. And then from a gross margin perspective, obviously, Splunk is going to be a much bigger part of the business. Can you maybe walk through, you gave us an operating margin framework, but sort of what do you expect from a gross margin perspective, given the strong gross margin profile of Splunk being a bigger part of the business next year versus this year? Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Yes. Thanks, David. You remember Q4 -- Q1 of this current fiscal year of fiscal '24 was really the last quarter where we shipped a lot of, I'll call it excess backlog, right? There's always an ambient level of backlog where we had a lot of excess backlog that built up during the supply constraints. So when you think about the growth rate from '24 to '25, clearly Splunk is a positive on that, obviously adding that to it. But you also have to think of this year, fiscal '24 having a non-repeatable bit of excess backlog that was shipped in the first quarter of this year. Remember first quarter this year, we grew in the mid-teens on revenue. So if you net that out and that's the math that Tal was doing to say the core business is actually growing in those mid-single digits in fiscal '25. And where we can walk through, I know there's a lot of moving parts there. David, we can walk through that if you want. On the gross margins, I think the way to think about that, we had some benefit in the quarter. Splunk itself is a benefit, of course. We had some benefits in the quarter on product mix and some cost savings that I don't think are repeatable longer-term. So I talked about the guide for Q4 being gross margins in the 66.5% to 67.5% range for Q4. I think that's the right range as you think about fiscal '25 as well.\nSami Badri: Thank you, David. Operator, can we move to the next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. Maybe first question, Chuck, if you could just kind of update where your kind of conversations with customers are around AI, either in kind of desire to invest on-premise or invest in kind of Cisco Security products for preparedness or just impact to budgets? And then maybe second question for Scott. Just as we think about kind of the OpEx investment that you guys noted for Splunk, you know, how should we think of that versus kind of original targets to have Splunk be kind of accretive one year post close? Thanks.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Meta. I would say the conversations, I think the webscalers is pretty well understood. So I'll talk about the enterprise. And I think most enterprises, there are some that are certainly running pilots that are doing some work today and we actually have had some -- we had a handful of wins in the enterprise space for infrastructure that was supporting AI build-outs, I'd say they're still very, very, very early. We had our Global Customer Advisory Board last week in Canada and I think we had about 60 customers there and they're all still trying to figure out exactly what their use cases are and how the architecture is going to play out. So I would say it's still super early on the enterprise side.\nGary Steele: And then--\nChuck Robbins: Sorry, did you want to add something, Gary? Go ahead and start.\nGary Steele: And in terms of the way to think about the OpEx comment that I made, you know, we talked, Meta, when we announced the acquisition of Splunk that this is much more driven by revenue synergies than cost synergies. There's no question there will be cost synergies as we work our way through this, but we will spend fiscal '25 -- from this point through fiscal '25, ensuring that we get both the product integration right, the organizational integration right, we have to do channel enablement, we have to train their sales team on Cisco, train the Cisco sales team on Splunk. There's investment that goes along with that integration and fiscal '25 is the year we'll do that. We said in the first year post-acquisition that we would be accretive in cash flow, and we will, that we'll be accretive in gross margin from Splunk and we will and that we'll be accretive in earnings per share in the second year. So that's -- think of that as fiscal '26. I know this closed a little bit early and I think there's this perception that it closed six months early. So those times ought to be accelerated. We thought the acquisition would close around the end of our fourth quarter. It closed around the middle of our third quarter. So round numbers, it was a little more than a quarter early. So I think the way to think about that is EPS accretive in fiscal '26, but still being cash-flow and gross margin-accretive in fiscal '25 as we invest in the integration.\nSami Badri: Thank you, Meta. Operator, next question.\nOperator: Thank you. James Fish with Piper Sandler. You may go ahead.\nJames Fish: Hi, guys. Did want to double-click on Meta's question here because it's a serious ramp on the OpEx side to get really earnings going down again in '25, if my math is right, somewhere around $3.50 a share. Can you elaborate a little bit further as to why it's going to go -- be that much? Do we -- should we be expecting revenue synergies starting in fiscal '25 with that initial kind of low- to mid-single-digit growth rate or is that just going to take too much time, another year or so to really get? And just not to layer on the question here, but is some of the OpEx ramp due to the conversion of stock-based comp of Splunk to cash comp because historically, Splunk and Cisco have had two totally different philosophies on compensation?\nChuck Robbins: Yes. Thanks, Jim. On the OpEx ramp, I mean, it's -- I know we haven't -- the Spunk team didn't put out guidance for this fiscal year, but you can look at where their OpEx was headed and layer that into the OpEx that we had. There is some growth year-on-year, there's some investment. It's not -- it's not a substantial ramp-up though in the investment on integration. It's more a question of just pulling the Splunk team together with ours. As I said, there will be some cost synergies that are likely to come more in the second half of the year, but this wasn't a deal that was motivated by cost synergies. It was much more motivated by revenue synergies. I think you will -- what you said, I think is spot on. We will see those revenue synergies begin to ramp in the second part of fiscal '25 as these are not short sales cycles as we get our team ramped up on how to sell Splunk as we get the Splunk team ramped up on how to sell Cisco and as we get our channel fully enabled to sell that. So yes, you're going to see those revenue synergies, but you'll need to think about them more in the second half of the year.\nGary Steele: Yes. And I think the revenue synergies that we're focused on really are driven around the 5,000 accounts that we talked about earlier. The sales cycles on those are six to nine months. And so you're not going to see that immediately, but that work is happening. And we're also seeing tremendous collaboration across the organization where sales teams are working together to more broadly penetrate accounts. I think you start to see that in the first half, but it's going to layer in, you're going to see more momentum as we get to the middle part of the year.\nSami Badri: Thank you, Jim. Operator, next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may go ahead, sir.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I have a couple as well if I may. I know you're talking today about the deployments with your customers, enterprise customers being higher than what you're shipping to and that implies you'll take a step-up in terms of revenue and that inventory digestion ends. I was just curious in sort of the order trends. You had mentioned you'll be back to a normal seasonality of orders, maybe more in fiscal '25, but how close are you seeing sort of order trends return on a sequential or quarterly basis to more normalized sort of seasonal trends? Is that pointing you in any direction in terms of whether that gap between deployment and your orders are starting to sort of compress? And for the second one, just on the quick follow-up on the AI order of $1 billion sort of target here. Just trying to understand if you feel like you need one or two more big wins in terms of customers or the land and expand with the existing ones should be good enough to get you to that $1 billion target that you have? Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Scott, you want to take the sequential one?\nScott Herren: Yes. Well, on the enterprise deployments, we are seeing that progress, Samik. And one of the things that's been encouraging, and we've given you some of the data on this is where we see it moving more quickly. We talked about WiFi and how our wireless business is growing, where the -- if the enterprise deployments of all the product that was pushed out has progressed more quickly, we're seeing demand return. Normal seasonality, if you're talking about year-on-year growth rates is a lot tougher, right? You've got to get to a point where you actually have a normal quarter and which we're headed toward now once we get through this inventory consumption at the end of this quarter and then you have to lap it by a year. To get to a year-on-year compare, that's an apples-to-apples compare. So think of the normal seasonality in terms of year-on-year growth rates beginning much more in fiscal '26. From a sequential standpoint, you'll see that start to happen in the second half of fiscal '25.\nSamik Chatterjee: Yes.\nScott Herren: And then on the AI, the $1 billion -- the $1 billion that we talked about, those are actually identified opportunities that our teams have a high degree of confidence. This is not like -- we didn't set a $1 billion target and tell people to go find deals. There are deals behind $1 billion and there are actual wins that we either have already won or we have a high degree of confidence that we will win. There's certainly execution that has to occur between now and whenever we get it -- when we get them done. We have to get through the pilots. There's a lot of testing that has to take place. There's power consumption testing that goes on. So a lot of that's going on. But based on what we know, this is what our teams believe today. So this is not some aspiration that we have to go find. This is -- these are opportunities that have been identified that our teams feel good about.\nSami Badri: Thank you, Samik. Operator, next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Matt Nicknam with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead, sir.\nMatt Nicknam: Hi, guys. Thanks so much. One question, one small follow-up, and I think this has been the theme most of the call. On the main question, actually for Scott, you've got leverage now that sits just under one turn, but the business now has a greater mix of recurring revenue, more visibility that that naturally lends itself to. So I'm just wondering how you think about optimal leverage for the business and uses of excess cash from here. And then just on the follow-up, as we think about low-to mid-singles growth next year, well aware of the backlog and the tougher comp that that creates in fiscal 1Q of next year. Just as we unpack the networking assumptions, are you assuming normal demand and purchasing cadence returns next year once inventories have been digested? Or is there any incremental caution that's embedded there from a macro perspective? Thanks.\nChuck Robbins: Scott, you want to take the first one?\nScott Herren: Yes, I'll talk about cash first, Matt. And yes, we moved obviously with the acquisition of Splunk, and this beta is out there. We raised about $13.5 billion of term debt that's out there, and we actually funded a lot of it with some cash off the balance sheet, but also with commercial paper with the expectation that as rates come down, obviously, commercial paper is a more real-time reflection of those lower rates. So it's a way of saving money on that. Moved to a net-debt position for the first time and certainly in my career, probably in the first time in the -- here at Cisco, probably the first time in the last two decades here at Cisco. The use of cash though, like we talked about Splunk being cash-flow accretive in its very first year, which is highly unusual for a transaction of this size, it will be. And so our capital allocation process is not going to change. And just to reiterate what it is, first and foremost, it's support growth, right behind that. If that's one, 1A is, of course, continuing to support the dividend and you see we've continued to grow the dividend on a year-on-year basis. Return cash to shareholders through share buybacks. That's been at a steady $1.25 billion per quarter for the last now several quarters. We'll continue to do that. And to the extent that we've met those three and there still is excess cash, we'll determine whether it makes sense to take that cash and delever or if it makes more sense to return that to shareholders at that time.\nChuck Robbins: And Matt, on the demand normalization, based on what we see today, I think we would expect starting in Q1 and beyond, we should see that normalize. Obviously, with the caveat that there are a lot of hot spots around the world, there are a lot of potential risks out there that are happening. We've got elections all over the world and the most important one perhaps in the United States. So we're certainly going to have to see how all of this plays out. But so far, based on what we see, I think that's a decent assumption for FY '25.\nSami Badri: Thank you, Matt. Operator, next question.\nOperator: Thank you. George Notter with Jefferies. You may go ahead, sir.\nGeorge Notter: Hi, there. Thanks very much. I guess I wanted to ask about gross margin impacts from the inventory digestion. As we look around the space, we've seen companies use tools like stock rotation or rebates to try to push inventory through the channel. Sometimes that can certainly have an impact on margins. Are you guys seeing any of that in the gross margin results right now? Thanks.\nChuck Robbins: No, we're not, George. There's very little inventory that -- in the channel that is something that we continue to own. In other words, when we ship it to the channel, it's sold at that point. There's very little stocking that happens inside our channel. So we're not seeing that benefit. What we are seeing is, of course, we've put in place the price increases to help offset the higher cost that we saw coming through the supply chain constraints and we've lapped those. But there's actually a little bit, you'll see when our Q comes out a little bit of pricing headwind back to the normal what it had been kind of pre-pandemic, but big benefits, of course, with the product mix of Splunk coming in and some one-off things that we benefited from during the quarter.\nSami Badri: Thank you, George. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. You may go ahead, sir.\nIttai Kidron: Thanks. I had a question for Gary. I guess, off the press, Palo Alto just announced its acquisition of the SIM business from IBM. Exabeam this morning announced the merger with LogRhythm. So it seems like the market you're operating in is moving at a very fast pace at consolidation. Maybe you can talk about the competitive landscape for your business and why should we not assume that pricing pressures are going to significantly rise in this environment as everybody is trying to fight for footprint?\nGary Steele: Yes. No, great question. There obviously is a lot of activity in this particular market. One of the things that we feel very good about and Chuck referenced in his prepared remarks earlier is our position in Gartner's Magic Quadrant where we stood out as the leader in the SIM market. We -- so we have a very strong established market position, and our pace of innovation has fundamentally changed over the last couple of years. We've continued to deliver very interesting innovative capability that we think is very high value. So for example, last week at RSA, we announced what we call Splunk Asset and Risk Intelligence. This is a critical capability to help organizations do self-discovery of assets across their environment and then understand the risks associated with those things. Coupled with that, we're now getting the broad benefit of the Cisco Security product line where we can bring in interesting capabilities like the integration with the XDR solution that we also announced. So, we feel like while, yes, it is competitive, we feel like we're incredibly well positioned to continue to drive very important innovation. And we've also taken a very different approach than our competitors and we think broadly about how do you bring together on a single platform the security capabilities that customers want broadly all the way through observability and it's very difficult across the industry to see anybody taking the position that we have and driving value. With respect to pricing, we don't have any fundamental change in our pricing strategy. We're very much focused on driving very good adoption across our customer base and ensuring that they feel like they're getting value every day. And the capabilities that we're offering are hard to match in the industry. So we're not -- we're not shifting gears from a pricing point of view.\nSami Badri: Thank you, Ittai. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. You may go ahead, sir.\nBen Reitzes: Yes, hi. Thanks for the question. I -- in the spirit of the two, I wanted to ask, if we take, let's say, $1 billion to $2 billion of the hit from inventory in 2025 and from the prior question, I just want to make sure that I heard it right that you -- do you underwrite that the real industry growth is about -- or the real networking growth is in that mid-single-digit range that was mentioned in a prior question. And then if that's the case, I guess this is the second one, then does it mean at your Analyst Day, we'll hear more about how 2026 could be a higher single-digit growth business for Cisco overall? I mean, you're mixing towards Splunk and software and therefore, the math would -- therefore have you guys on a normalized basis after, you know, after the organic growth is very muted in 2025, accelerating by several hundred basis points to the higher single-digits in 2026, if that's true. Be happy to repeat any of this, but hopefully, you were able to follow that. Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Yes. I got it, Ben. And you're asking me now for fiscal '26 guide at the same time. Is that the right takeaway? Just you're thinking about it right. The underlying business, the core business of Cisco net out the benefits of the Splunk acquisition when you look at fiscal '25, but also when you take '24, net out the impact of the excess backlog that we shipped early in fiscal '24, mostly in Q1, a small amount in Q2 as well, and you get to that mid-single-digit growth of the core business that we've had. So, I think you're thinking about that right. We will talk more -- I'm not going to do it on this call, but we will talk more about fiscal '26 and beyond at our Investor Day in June in Vegas. So hopefully, I'll see you there.\nSami Badri: Thank you, Ben. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Atif Malik with Citi. You may go ahead, sir.\nAtif Malik: Hi, thank you for taking my questions. The first one is for Gary. Gary, Splunk has been using AI/ML for the last year and a half with natural language assistant SPL and also event detection and response. Can you big-picture talk about how Cisco data will improve your AI capabilities?\nGary Steele: You bet. And so if you look at the history with Splunk, we were very early driving capabilities with machine learning. We launched the MLTK package in 2017 and we've had a quarter of a billion -- excuse me, quarter of a million users on that. So there's been broad adoption. We then extended that when we brought Gen AI into the picture, delivering an SPL assistant, SPL being our proprietary search language, being able to use English to be able to do that. We're also bringing AI directly into the workflows. So think about SOAR as an example and how you can bring AI into the picture to drive better outcomes from a remediation point of view. So, we've been investing across the product line. You're going to hear and see more announcements from us over at Cisco Live as well as at our user conference, which follows Cisco Live. And the benefit that we're getting -- bringing it into Cisco is Cisco has made -- independently been making a whole set of investments. We get to leverage those assets in addition to the richness of data that we get. So where we benefit from Cisco is the broad rich datasets that exist across networking where you -- so think lateral movement, how can we leverage that data to do a better job from a detection point of view? And frankly, the data and insights that we have as a combined entity, I think are second to none in terms of the competitive environment. So we just basically accelerate our AI efforts as part of Cisco and the outcomes we can deliver to be really important.\nSami Badri: Thank you, Atif. Michelle, can we move to the last question?\nOperator: Thank you. Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead, sir.\nMichael Ng: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in. I just have two as well. First, I think that the guidance this year implies 34% EBIT margins. You commented that fiscal '25 can look like the guide for fiscal 4Q. I mean I think it's about $1 billion of OpEx investments. I was just wondering if you could kind of qualitatively talk about where most of those OpEx investments will lie? And then secondly, last quarter, you characterized the fiscal '24 guidance as conservative, I believe. How would you characterize your initial financial outlook for fiscal '25? Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Okay. Michael, thanks for the question. The year-on-year, again, the -- I think what you're struggling with on the fiscal '25 look is expectations if you just added -- straight added where the run rate of Cisco spend to what your expectations are the run rate of the Splunk spend. And I'd say a couple of things to bear in mind. There are some one-time benefits that we had this year in our OpEx for the Core Cisco pre-Splunk acquisition, up frankly in our variable comp plans, which, you know, it has been a tough year and we've come up short of our plan. And so there's some savings in variable comp for this year and fiscal '24, obviously, I don't plan on repeating those in fiscal '25. So there are some -- and then obviously will do a merit increase as well. So there's some small increase that is just kind of the reset of the comp plans and ongoing merit. There is some investment as well in the integration, but it's not even approaching the number that with the quick math that you just did. So that's kind of the way to think about that piece. Now if you look at the guide for next year, kind of how would I say -- what I'd say about the guide for next year is I feel with a lot of the tailwinds that we're seeing right now, so let's just go back. Consumption of all the inventory that we shipped to customers that they were working very hard to get implemented is going in line with our expectation. We think we work our way through that headwind mostly by the end of this quarter, our fourth fiscal quarter. That's a tailwind for next year. Obviously, the AI opportunity that we've talked about and being more second half, but for the full-year -- second half of fiscal '25, but for the full-year, that's a tailwind as we look ahead. Security business is doing what we said it was going to do, right? It's -- we've launched new products there even before the acquisition of Splunk and those products are getting good traction. So that's a tailwind as we look at next year as well. So I think all-in-all, I feel like it's kind of a down-the-middle view of fiscal '25 at this point. It's not a formal guide. I just wanted to give you a sense of what that looked like and we'll do -- we'll give you a better feel for what the longer-term looks like at our Investor Day in June, and then we'll give you a more fulsome guidance when we get to our Q4 call in August.\nSami Badri: Thank you, Michael. I now want to hand it over back to Chuck for some closing remarks.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Sami, and thanks to all of you for spending time with us today. I guess I'd say I'm pleased that we're getting to the tail end of this supply chain situation that we've been navigating for the last several years, on track to get this consumption issue behind us as we enter FY '25. I feel good about the overall demand environment we saw in Q4, which supports the fact that our customers are getting this digestion done. As we look to the future, we obviously are optimistic about AI, both from an infrastructure perspective, a data perspective as well as a cybersecurity perspective. Security in general, we believe will continue to improve. And obviously, we're super excited about the Splunk integration and we're committed to deliver for both our customers and for you. I also just want to quickly thank Jeff Sharritts for everything he's done at Cisco and also they were very excited to have Gary taking on the new role here and thank you all for being with us today.\nSami Badri: As a reminder, we will be hosting our 2024 Investor Day as part of Cisco Live on June 4, 2024. Cisco's next quarterly call, which will reflect our fiscal year 2024 fourth-quarter and full-year results, will be on Wednesday, August 14th, 2024, at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time, 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time. This concludes today's call. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact the Cisco Investor Relations Department. We thank you very much for joining the call today.\nOperator: And thank you for participating in today's conference call. If you would like to listen to the call in its entirety, you may call 1-800-391-9851. For participants dialing from outside the U.S., please dial 203-369-3268. This concludes today's conference call.

            "name": "Chuck Robbins",
            "content": "Thanks, Sami, and thank you all for joining us today. We delivered a solid performance in Q3 with organic revenue coming in at the high end of our guidance range. Strong operating leverage across our business drove gross margins to exceed the high end of our expectations, resulting in better-than-anticipated earnings per share performance. We once again delivered good growth in annualized recurring revenue, remaining performance obligations and subscription revenue. We have transformed our business model with revenue from subscriptions now accounting for more than half of our total revenue even before the addition of Splunk. With the success of our transformation, we are well positioned to drive long-term growth powered by innovation across the organization. I want to thank the entire Cisco team as it is through their dedicated efforts that our research and development engine has never been stronger across networking and silicon, observability, security, collaboration, and AI. The strength of our core business continues to produce strong cash flows, reinforcing our ongoing commitment to delivering consistent capital returns. In Q3, we returned $2.9 billion in value to our shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends in the quarter with a total of $8.5 billion in value returned year-to-date. Q3 was significant for us in two important ways. First, I couldn't be more excited about the successful close of our Splunk acquisition, Cisco's largest ever. Our acquisition of Splunk was completed midway through our Q3 on March 18, earlier than initially anticipated. Splunk significantly expands our portfolio of software-based solutions, contributing over $4 billion in annualized recurring revenue and adds to our position as one of the largest software companies in the world. We are thrilled to welcome the Splunk team to Cisco and are very excited about what we can deliver for our customers as we integrate our complementary security and observability capabilities. Our unified platform will revolutionize how customers connect and protect their organizations using data in new ways to enhance their entire digital footprint. Second, we introduced Cisco Hypershield, our most significant new security innovation with a groundbreaking AI-powered approach to highly distributed security, a first-of-its-kind. Combining security and networking in a way only Cisco can, Hypershield is built in the very fabric of the network, bringing the power of hyperscaler security and connectivity to the enterprise. I will talk more about these developments and our innovation momentum in a few moments. But now, I'd like to turn to our performance in Q3 and what we're seeing in terms of customer demand. The breadth of our portfolio, together with our many touch points with partners and customers around the world, provides us with differentiated insight into what's happening in our customer base. Based on activations to the cloud, which we track as well as conversations with our customers and partners, we believe that the products customers have on hand are being steadily deployed in line with the expectations we laid out last quarter, meaning we currently expect customers to complete the installation of the majority of their inventory by the end of our fiscal year in July. At a time where customers are ruthlessly prioritizing their IT investments, we saw product order growth in two of our largest product portfolios, data center switching and campus switching, as well as product order growth in our security and collaboration product categories. Overall, product orders were up 4%, and excluding Splunk, product orders were flat year-on-year. In our customer markets, public sector was strong in EMEA and APJC, but continuing resolution discussions in the U.S. temporarily impacted public sector performance in the Americas. We believe this has since cleared with the subsequent signing of the most recent U.S. Federal Government funding legislation. While our telco and cable customer demand remain muted worldwide, we are encouraged to see early signs of stabilization and improved performance in Webscale in terms of pipeline and orders. Overall, our win rates are stable, and we saw increased strength as we move through the quarter. This reflects our competitive strength and successful execution and gives us confidence in the long term. We also know that the value of our portfolio is greater than ever as evidenced by recent sell-side research IT spending surveys, which show that Cisco is expected to be the only net share gainer within large network budgets over the next 12 months. Now, let's look at our performance in Q3 in more detail. We saw revenue growth in security and double-digit growth in observability year-over-year, excluding Splunk as customers look to enhance their digital resilience with Cisco's technologies. In the past year, we've accelerated our pace of innovation in security and I'm proud of what our teams have achieved. As I mentioned earlier, last month, we introduced Cisco Hypershield, the first truly distributed AI-native cybersecurity solution, which will be built into our networking fabric. This new innovation leverages the recently closed Isovalent acquisition to facilitate deployment in software and the first shipment is scheduled for August this year. This launch furthers our vision for the Cisco Security Cloud, which is expected to deliver the industry's most comprehensive unified platform with end-to-end solutions, making it easier for our customers to protect against the threats of today and tomorrow. Our newest available security solutions, XDR and Secure Access continue to ramp quickly with strong customer feedback. Just last week at RSA, we also announced the integration of Cisco XDR with Splunk Enterprise Security, which will give our customers even more value and insights. The closing of the Splunk acquisition in Q3 will also enable us to begin driving revenue synergies in our security and observability markets. Upon closing the deal, we identified 5,000 existing Cisco customers who have the potential to become meaningful Splunk customers and our sales teams are already making those connections. We also see significant opportunities for revenue synergies by leveraging Cisco's robust partner and customer ecosystem in markets where Splunk had limited or no presence. Earlier this week, Splunk was ranked as the leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for security incident and event management, which is a testament to the strength of the offering and the continued business momentum that Splunk has delivered. We are working on rapid integration, investing in both product integration and go-to-market resources, starting with aligning our Cisco and Splunk sales forces and accelerating channel enablement processes for cross-selling and upselling our combined solutions. We also continue to capitalize on the multi-billion-dollar AI infrastructure opportunity. In Webscale, we continue to see momentum with three of the top-four hyperscalers deploying our Ethernet AI fabric, leveraging Cisco-validated designs for AI infrastructure. In the past two quarters, Cisco has been granted additional design awards based on our 51.2 terabit G200 Silicon One ASIC. We expect these awards to yield orders in fiscal year '25, reinforcing our confidence in our line of sight to $1 billion of AI product orders in fiscal '25. Additionally, for those leading-edge enterprise customers who seek to be the early adopters of AI, our partnership with NVIDIA will offer easy-to-deploy cloud-based and on-prem networking solutions for AI inferencing. We believe we are well-positioned to be the key beneficiary of AI enterprise application proliferation with the breadth of our portfolio and the vast amounts of data we see. Before I turn it over to Scott, I'd like to share one more update. Earlier today, we announced that Jeff Sharritts, our Chief Customer and Partner Officer, is departing Cisco and that Gary Steele, Splunk's former CEO, has been named Cisco's new President of Go-to-Market. Gary is well known for his operational excellence, and in this new role, he will work closely with me to set and execute against our strategic plans and goals for the company. He will continue to lead the Splunk team through the integration process to ensure a seamless integration into Cisco. Gary's operational mindset, combined with his intense focus on simplicity and proven ability to drive growth, position him well in this role and I look forward to working closely with him in this new capacity. I'd also like to take a moment to thank Jeff for all that he's helped Cisco achieve, which is quite a long list of accomplishments in his 24 years here. Moving back to Q3, let me briefly summarize. While our core product portfolio is trending toward normalization as we continue to see customer deployments of shipped equipment progress, we are pleased that our security and observability portfolios have continued to grow and are significantly enhanced by the acquisitions of Splunk and Isovalent. As our customers adopt and deploy AI, they need the infrastructure to power it, the data to develop it and the security to protect it. And we believe only Cisco can deliver and integrate all three. With our unified platform approach, vast global partner ecosystem and ability to support hybrid and multi-cloud environments, we will deliver innovation at an unprecedented pace and scale to organizations around the globe. I'll now turn it over to Scott to provide more detail on the quarter and our outlook. Thank you, Amit. Appreciate the questions. So from a macro perspective, what I would say is that ironically, we saw the quarter actually slow -- showed slight improvement as we move through the quarter. So the end of the quarter was actually a little stronger than the beginning. So we -- and look, we obviously believe that our customers now are on track with the inventory digestion that we talked about last quarter, so that's positive. But we saw the Americas excluding Splunk was up 2%, so that was a positive sign and Europe was flat. So that was good. And when you see campus switching and data center switching, both positive. And by the way, data center switching was in the mid-teens growth. So customers are investing in these private data centers and collaboration being positive, security being high-single-digits on the order side, it was, you know, but we didn't see any different behavior from our customers during this quarter than we've seen. They still are ruthlessly prioritizing what projects they spend money on, where they spend their IT dollars, but we didn't see any fundamental shift in the macro. On the second question, on the $1 billion of AI, it is largely driven by the Webscale infrastructure. As I said, we had -- we've got three out of four that are running our AI Ethernet fabric and we also had two or three more design wins during the quarter, I believe, in the back-end networks inside these Webscale players. So, it's predominantly that. However, we are beginning to see enterprise pipeline materialize, as I said last quarter. So that's really what it's made up of. And it is both systems as well as optics across those customers. All right. Let me answer the second one first, if you don't mind since I just went on that one. It's a $1 billion of orders that we have line of sight to and next fiscal year is what I had said. And on one of the earlier calls, maybe last call, I think I said our pipeline was roughly three times that we see, but we believe we have good visibility to $1 billion in orders in FY '25. That is primarily back-end, and it is a combination of systems that are based on Silicon One, potentially some standalone Silicon One, but mostly systems and then optics as well. And then there's -- we're beginning to see some enterprise use cases, but it's predominantly back-end in the hyperscaler space. On the 5,000 customers, we basically did an analysis of where we have -- and Cisco has super strong relationships and Splunk doesn't have a presence of 5,000 customers and we've now mapped those to the sales teams. And Gary, you want to make a comment on that because you've been involved in that deeply. Tal, thanks for the question. So on the -- let's go with the first question and I'll say on the organic Cisco Security front, you're right, revenue was up 3%, but as I said, our demand was as high -- as the highest it's been in probably a couple of years and it was high-single-digits. So we're seeing the traction on these new products. They're just ramping, right? They're new, customers are testing, they're implementing. And by the way, a lot of it is ratable. So you don't -- you take the orders and then, you know, like close to 80% of our security portfolio is ratable. So that actually impacts the time for it to transition into revenue. So that's on the security side. But I think on the security and Splunk side, I'll talk about it a little bit. We've -- and then I'll let Gary comment on some of the integration. But we announced our first integration last week at RSA. Our intent is just to continue pushing innovation out. We'll have more announcements at Cisco Live. So I think that you'll continue to see that happen. I've always said on the security front even before Splunk that we had brought in a new team, we've been building new innovation. The team has built five new products and solutions from the ground up over the last 12 months, as you alluded to, just done a phenomenal job. And I had always said that second half of '24, I expected you would see an improvement and then in '25, you'll see it get to where we really need it to be. And I think that still stands. You want to comment on the Cisco, the integration stuff, Gary? Thanks, Gary. And then on your AI timing question in '25, my suspicion is that that's going to start low at the beginning of the year, and it will ramp as we get through the year. So I'll be thinking more back-half, but we'll have to see how these pilots go. We'll probably know a little more about -- we'll know more in the next 90 days on that. On your second question, first of all, I appreciate the fact that you recognize that several billion of backlog that we cleared last year because this is the last -- this is a -- '25 will be a year where we're still going to have strange comparisons because we're just still coming out of the tail end of this supply chain situation and this whole digestion issue and the inventories, shipments and everything. So '26 over '25 will be the year where you will really hopefully get back to real apples-to-apples year-over-year comparisons. And while I'm not -- we aren't giving a breakdown today of the FY '25 Cisco or Splunk contribution, we'll obviously have an Analyst Day in June and we'll go into more detail there. And Scott, do you have anything to add to that? Or is that good? Yes. Thanks, David. You remember Q4 -- Q1 of this current fiscal year of fiscal '24 was really the last quarter where we shipped a lot of, I'll call it excess backlog, right? There's always an ambient level of backlog where we had a lot of excess backlog that built up during the supply constraints. So when you think about the growth rate from '24 to '25, clearly Splunk is a positive on that, obviously adding that to it. But you also have to think of this year, fiscal '24 having a non-repeatable bit of excess backlog that was shipped in the first quarter of this year. Remember first quarter this year, we grew in the mid-teens on revenue. So if you net that out and that's the math that Tal was doing to say the core business is actually growing in those mid-single digits in fiscal '25. And where we can walk through, I know there's a lot of moving parts there. David, we can walk through that if you want. On the gross margins, I think the way to think about that, we had some benefit in the quarter. Splunk itself is a benefit, of course. We had some benefits in the quarter on product mix and some cost savings that I don't think are repeatable longer-term. So I talked about the guide for Q4 being gross margins in the 66.5% to 67.5% range for Q4. I think that's the right range as you think about fiscal '25 as well. Thanks, Meta. I would say the conversations, I think the webscalers is pretty well understood. So I'll talk about the enterprise. And I think most enterprises, there are some that are certainly running pilots that are doing some work today and we actually have had some -- we had a handful of wins in the enterprise space for infrastructure that was supporting AI build-outs, I'd say they're still very, very, very early. We had our Global Customer Advisory Board last week in Canada and I think we had about 60 customers there and they're all still trying to figure out exactly what their use cases are and how the architecture is going to play out. So I would say it's still super early on the enterprise side. Sorry, did you want to add something, Gary? Go ahead and start. Yes. Thanks, Jim. On the OpEx ramp, I mean, it's -- I know we haven't -- the Spunk team didn't put out guidance for this fiscal year, but you can look at where their OpEx was headed and layer that into the OpEx that we had. There is some growth year-on-year, there's some investment. It's not -- it's not a substantial ramp-up though in the investment on integration. It's more a question of just pulling the Splunk team together with ours. As I said, there will be some cost synergies that are likely to come more in the second half of the year, but this wasn't a deal that was motivated by cost synergies. It was much more motivated by revenue synergies. I think you will -- what you said, I think is spot on. We will see those revenue synergies begin to ramp in the second part of fiscal '25 as these are not short sales cycles as we get our team ramped up on how to sell Splunk as we get the Splunk team ramped up on how to sell Cisco and as we get our channel fully enabled to sell that. So yes, you're going to see those revenue synergies, but you'll need to think about them more in the second half of the year. Scott, you want to take the sequential one? Scott, you want to take the first one? And Matt, on the demand normalization, based on what we see today, I think we would expect starting in Q1 and beyond, we should see that normalize. Obviously, with the caveat that there are a lot of hot spots around the world, there are a lot of potential risks out there that are happening. We've got elections all over the world and the most important one perhaps in the United States. So we're certainly going to have to see how all of this plays out. But so far, based on what we see, I think that's a decent assumption for FY '25. No, we're not, George. There's very little inventory that -- in the channel that is something that we continue to own. In other words, when we ship it to the channel, it's sold at that point. There's very little stocking that happens inside our channel. So we're not seeing that benefit. What we are seeing is, of course, we've put in place the price increases to help offset the higher cost that we saw coming through the supply chain constraints and we've lapped those. But there's actually a little bit, you'll see when our Q comes out a little bit of pricing headwind back to the normal what it had been kind of pre-pandemic, but big benefits, of course, with the product mix of Splunk coming in and some one-off things that we benefited from during the quarter. Yes. I got it, Ben. And you're asking me now for fiscal '26 guide at the same time. Is that the right takeaway? Just you're thinking about it right. The underlying business, the core business of Cisco net out the benefits of the Splunk acquisition when you look at fiscal '25, but also when you take '24, net out the impact of the excess backlog that we shipped early in fiscal '24, mostly in Q1, a small amount in Q2 as well, and you get to that mid-single-digit growth of the core business that we've had. So, I think you're thinking about that right. We will talk more -- I'm not going to do it on this call, but we will talk more about fiscal '26 and beyond at our Investor Day in June in Vegas. So hopefully, I'll see you there. Okay. Michael, thanks for the question. The year-on-year, again, the -- I think what you're struggling with on the fiscal '25 look is expectations if you just added -- straight added where the run rate of Cisco spend to what your expectations are the run rate of the Splunk spend. And I'd say a couple of things to bear in mind. There are some one-time benefits that we had this year in our OpEx for the Core Cisco pre-Splunk acquisition, up frankly in our variable comp plans, which, you know, it has been a tough year and we've come up short of our plan. And so there's some savings in variable comp for this year and fiscal '24, obviously, I don't plan on repeating those in fiscal '25. So there are some -- and then obviously will do a merit increase as well. So there's some small increase that is just kind of the reset of the comp plans and ongoing merit. There is some investment as well in the integration, but it's not even approaching the number that with the quick math that you just did. So that's kind of the way to think about that piece. Now if you look at the guide for next year, kind of how would I say -- what I'd say about the guide for next year is I feel with a lot of the tailwinds that we're seeing right now, so let's just go back. Consumption of all the inventory that we shipped to customers that they were working very hard to get implemented is going in line with our expectation. We think we work our way through that headwind mostly by the end of this quarter, our fourth fiscal quarter. That's a tailwind for next year. Obviously, the AI opportunity that we've talked about and being more second half, but for the full-year -- second half of fiscal '25, but for the full-year, that's a tailwind as we look ahead. Security business is doing what we said it was going to do, right? It's -- we've launched new products there even before the acquisition of Splunk and those products are getting good traction. So that's a tailwind as we look at next year as well. So I think all-in-all, I feel like it's kind of a down-the-middle view of fiscal '25 at this point. It's not a formal guide. I just wanted to give you a sense of what that looked like and we'll do -- we'll give you a better feel for what the longer-term looks like at our Investor Day in June, and then we'll give you a more fulsome guidance when we get to our Q4 call in August. Thanks, Sami, and thanks to all of you for spending time with us today. I guess I'd say I'm pleased that we're getting to the tail end of this supply chain situation that we've been navigating for the last several years, on track to get this consumption issue behind us as we enter FY '25. I feel good about the overall demand environment we saw in Q4, which supports the fact that our customers are getting this digestion done. As we look to the future, we obviously are optimistic about AI, both from an infrastructure perspective, a data perspective as well as a cybersecurity perspective. Security in general, we believe will continue to improve. And obviously, we're super excited about the Splunk integration and we're committed to deliver for both our customers and for you. I also just want to quickly thank Jeff Sharritts for everything he's done at Cisco and also they were very excited to have Gary taking on the new role here and thank you all for being with us today."

            "content": "Thanks, Chuck. Our Q3 results reflect solid execution with strong margins and a stabilization of orders. Both including and excluding Splunk, our revenue, gross margin, and non-GAAP earnings per share were at or above the high end of our Q3 guidance range. Total revenue was $12.7 billion, down 13% year-over-year. Splunk contributed $413 million in revenue in the partial quarter post-close. Non-GAAP net income was $3.6 billion, down 14%. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.88, down 12%. The interest cost of financing with Splunk acquisition slightly more than offset the positive operating impact of Splunk. The net effect was a negative impact of $0.1 on non-GAAP earnings per share. Looking at our Q3 revenue in more detail, total product revenue was $9 billion, down 19% and service revenue was $3.7 billion, up 6%. Networking, our largest product category, was down 27%. We saw declines across almost all geographic segments due to the continued implementation of inventory by our customers. Bear in mind that our Q3 2023 networking revenues benefited from significant shipments of excess backlog. Security was up 36%, including the benefit received from the Splunk acquisition. Excluding Splunk, security grew 3%, driven by growth in SASE and double-digit growth in our Zero Trust offering. Collaboration was flat, driven by growth in our cloud calling and contact center offerings, offset by declines in meetings and devices. And observability was up 27%, driven by growth in ThousandEyes Network Services and the benefit from the Splunk acquisition. Excluding Splunk, observability grew 14% for the quarter. As Chuck said, we have successfully transformed our business model. ARR ended the quarter at $29.2 billion, which increased 22% due to continued strong performance and contribution from Splunk. These factors also drove our product ARR growth of 44%. Without Splunk, ARR was $25 billion, up 5% and product ARR was up 9%. Total subscription revenue increased 12% to $6.9 billion, which now represents 54% of Cisco's total revenue. Without Splunk, total subscription revenue was up 5%, representing 53% of Cisco's total revenue. Total software revenue was up 5% at $4.5 billion, with software subscription revenue up 17%. Without Splunk, total software revenue was down 4% and software subscription revenue was up 6%. 91% of our total software revenue was subscription-based. Total RPO was $38.8 billion, up 21% due to both strong performance and the Splunk acquisition. Product RPO grew 29%. Total short-term RPO was $20.1 billion, up 19%. Without Splunk, RPO was $35.3 billion, up 10% with product RPO also growing at 10%. Q3 product orders were up 4%. Excluding Splunk, product orders were flat year-over-year. We see customer product implementations progressing in line with our expectations and we expect these deployments to be largely complete by the end of our current fiscal year. Looking at our geographic segments year-over-year, the Americas was up 6%, EMEA was up 4%, and APJC was down 1%. In our customer markets, service provider and cloud was up 10%, the public sector was up 6% and enterprise was up 2%. Total non-GAAP gross margin came in at 68.3%, up 310 basis points year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. Product gross margin was 66.9%, up 240 basis points, of which Splunk contributed 70 basis points. The remaining improvement was driven primarily by a favorable product mix and lower freight and other costs. Service gross margin was 71.6%, up 430 basis points. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 34.2%, up 30 basis points, driven by our continued commitment to disciplined spend management. Operating cash flow was $4 billion, down 24%. Shifting to the balance sheet. We ended Q3 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $18.8 billion. Uses of cash during the quarter included a net outflow of $27.4 billion related to our acquisition of Splunk and in line with our capital allocation strategy, we returned $2.9 billion in value to our shareholders, including $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and $1.3 billion of share repurchases. Year-to-date, we've returned $8.5 billion in capital to our shareholders. To summarize, we successfully completed the acquisition of Splunk, drove strong non-GAAP margins, and increased our operating leverage in the quarter. Turning to our financial guidance that includes our integration of Splunk. For Q4, our guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $13.4 billion to $13.6 billion. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 66.5% to 67.5%. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to range from 31.5% to 32.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.84 to $0.86. Our Q4 guidance includes $950 million to $1 billion in revenue from Splunk and non-GAAP EPS of negative $0.03 as the interest impact more than offsets the operating benefit. In Q4, we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 18%. For fiscal year '24, our guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $53.6 billion to $53.8 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is expected to range from $3.69 to $3.71. We're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 19%. Looking beyond Q4 and into our fiscal 2025, in addition to the top-line benefits from the Splunk acquisition, there are a few points to bear in mind as you build your models. First, we expect revenue growth to be in the low-to mid-single-digit range next year. Second is the interest impact from the acquisition, which we expect to be a headwind of approximately $350 million per quarter, including both the foregone interest from cash off the balance sheet and the additional interest payments on debt. Third, we're working to quickly integrate Splunk into our product offerings, go-to-market engine and expect to invest in OpEx in fiscal '25 to drive those revenue synergies. Given these points, we expect fiscal '25 operating margin to be in line with our Q4 guidance. We'll give more formal guidance as we get to the next earnings call, but I want to make sure you have those three thoughts in mind. And as we've stated, we expect the deal to be non-GAAP earnings per share accretive in fiscal '26 and beyond. Sami, let's now move into the Q&A. No, I think you said it right and Cal, the fact that you've recognized the backlog work off it, it clearly is a headwind on just the core Cisco when you look at year-on-year growth rate into fiscal '25. Bear in mind too, obviously, Q3 was a tough compare. If you remember that we had those three consecutive quarters of revenue growth in the mid-to-upper teens, Q3 of '23 that we're comparing to now, Q4 and then Q1 of this year. And so in addition to doing the year-on-year growth rates the way you're doing it, you need to think of the backlog impact on the year-on-year growth rates in both this quarter, next quarter, and again a tough compare in Q1 of '25. Yes. Well, on the enterprise deployments, we are seeing that progress, Samik. And one of the things that's been encouraging, and we've given you some of the data on this is where we see it moving more quickly. We talked about WiFi and how our wireless business is growing, where the -- if the enterprise deployments of all the product that was pushed out has progressed more quickly, we're seeing demand return. Normal seasonality, if you're talking about year-on-year growth rates is a lot tougher, right? You've got to get to a point where you actually have a normal quarter and which we're headed toward now once we get through this inventory consumption at the end of this quarter and then you have to lap it by a year. To get to a year-on-year compare, that's an apples-to-apples compare. So think of the normal seasonality in terms of year-on-year growth rates beginning much more in fiscal '26. From a sequential standpoint, you'll see that start to happen in the second half of fiscal '25. And then on the AI, the $1 billion -- the $1 billion that we talked about, those are actually identified opportunities that our teams have a high degree of confidence. This is not like -- we didn't set a $1 billion target and tell people to go find deals. There are deals behind $1 billion and there are actual wins that we either have already won or we have a high degree of confidence that we will win. There's certainly execution that has to occur between now and whenever we get it -- when we get them done. We have to get through the pilots. There's a lot of testing that has to take place. There's power consumption testing that goes on. So a lot of that's going on. But based on what we know, this is what our teams believe today. So this is not some aspiration that we have to go find. This is -- these are opportunities that have been identified that our teams feel good about. Yes, I'll talk about cash first, Matt. And yes, we moved obviously with the acquisition of Splunk, and this beta is out there. We raised about $13.5 billion of term debt that's out there, and we actually funded a lot of it with some cash off the balance sheet, but also with commercial paper with the expectation that as rates come down, obviously, commercial paper is a more real-time reflection of those lower rates. So it's a way of saving money on that. Moved to a net-debt position for the first time and certainly in my career, probably in the first time in the -- here at Cisco, probably the first time in the last two decades here at Cisco. The use of cash though, like we talked about Splunk being cash-flow accretive in its very first year, which is highly unusual for a transaction of this size, it will be. And so our capital allocation process is not going to change. And just to reiterate what it is, first and foremost, it's support growth, right behind that. If that's one, 1A is, of course, continuing to support the dividend and you see we've continued to grow the dividend on a year-on-year basis. Return cash to shareholders through share buybacks. That's been at a steady $1.25 billion per quarter for the last now several quarters. We'll continue to do that. And to the extent that we've met those three and there still is excess cash, we'll determine whether it makes sense to take that cash and delever or if it makes more sense to return that to shareholders at that time."

        "content": "Operator: Welcome to Cisco's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. At the request of Cisco, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now I would like to introduce Sami Badri, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\nSami Badri: Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's second quarter fiscal year '24 conference call. This is Sami Badri, Cisco's Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO; and Scott Herren, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons are made throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis. The matters we'll be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the third quarter and full year of fiscal 2024. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please feel free to see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. I will now turn it over to Chuck.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Sami, and thank you all for joining us today. We delivered a solid Q2 performance with revenue coming in at the high end of our guidance range. Strong operating leverage across our business drove our margins, which exceeded the high end of our expectations and allowed us to deliver better-than-anticipated earnings per share. In Q2, we once again returned a total of $2.8 billion in value through dividends and share repurchases. We also announced today another increase to Cisco's dividend payout rate, reaffirming our ongoing commitment to returning significant value to our shareholders through consistent capital returns. Overall, our Q2 results continue to advance our strategic business transformation around driving higher levels of software subscriptions and annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, both of which showed performance gains in the quarter. Our pending acquisition of Splunk also further supports our transformation strategy by fueling stronger growth, expanding our portfolio of software-based solutions and generating higher levels of ARR with roughly $4 billion in additional ARR expected upon closing and will make us one of the largest software companies in the world. Before turning to our performance in the quarter, I'd like to start by commenting on the demand environment. First, in terms of the macro environment, we are seeing a greater degree of caution and scrutiny of deals given the high level of uncertainty. As we're hearing this from our customers, it's leading us to be more cautious with our forecast and expectations. Second, as we discussed last quarter and subsequently saw in other technology provider results, customers have been taking time since the start of our fiscal 2024 to deploy the elevated levels of products shipped to them in recent quarters, and this is taking longer than our initial expectations. Third, we also continue to see weak demand with our telco and cable service provider customers. This industry has seen significant pressure and they are adjusting deployment phasing, which is weighing on our business outlook. Given these factors, we are adjusting our expenses and investments to reflect the current environment. That said, for the product categories in which we can measure customer inventory absorption through connections to the cloud, we are seeing steady progress. However, based on conversations with customers, we still believe we are 1 to 2 quarters away from full implementation of their inventory, which, as I mentioned, is longer than we expected. We continue to track Meraki activations, which are moving slightly faster in wireless and slightly slower in switching. Using our Meraki business as a proxy for our wider enterprise networking portfolio, we expect the current implementation of shipped products to be broadly complete by the end of fiscal 2024. Looking at our wireless business as an example, we are encouraged by the number of orders of $1 million or more, which increased approximately 50% sequentially in Q2. This indicates that many wireless customers have finished absorbing what we've shipped to them and are preparing for larger deployments in the coming months. Our team is also partnering closely with customers to assist with this heightened focus on deployments of Cisco equipment on hand, contributing to our services revenue increase year-over-year. It's also worth noting that non-hardware-centric revenue in areas such as security and collaboration increased and our observability offerings grew double digits year-over-year. Finally, despite the near-term challenges, our win rates are stable and on a rolling 4-quarter basis, our market share remained steady in three of our four largest markets. Now moving on to our performance in Q2. As I mentioned earlier, our performance in the quarter was broadly in line with or better than our Q2 expectations. Given the trust our customers place in us and the criticality of our technologies to the outcomes our customers are seeking, I am confident about the foundational strength of our portfolio and our future growth opportunities. With our innovation, we deliver and enable our customers to deploy next-generation applications in a highly secure manner. As part of this, we help facilitate their growth through our products and services so that when our customers adopt new technologies, we grow alongside them. We continue to accelerate our innovation across high-growth areas. Last week at Cisco Live EMEA, we announced new capabilities in networking, furthering our vision for the Cisco networking cloud. We also announced several new capabilities across our security, collaboration and observability portfolios leveraging AI throughout. We also continue to capitalize on the multibillion-dollar AI infrastructure opportunity. This quarter, we announced the next phase in our partnership with Nvidia to offer enterprises simplified, cloud-based and on-prem AI infrastructure. This includes both networking hardware and software to support advanced AI workloads. We are clear beneficiaries of AI adoption, and this partnership further demonstrates the central role we play in AI and the overall technology ecosystem. Our combined solution will be sold through our extensive global channel with professional services and support from key partners who are committed to helping businesses deploy their GPU clusters via Ethernet infrastructure. In web scale, we continue to see momentum with three of the top four customers deploying our hyperscale Ethernet AI fabric, leveraging Cisco-validated designs for AI infrastructure. While there is tremendous opportunity ahead, we are still in the early stages of adoption of AI workloads. In security, we continue to execute against our product roadmap to deliver the industry's most comprehensive unified platform with end-to-end solutions. This quarter, we introduced Cisco Identity Intelligence, an analytics layer that pulls data from identity infrastructure and performs behavior-based assessments to help protect against identity-based attacks which are at the forefront of cyber threats today. AI is also becoming more pervasive across the Cisco Security Cloud. For example, our new AI Assistant and Secure Access lets customers create security access policies using natural language prompts, reducing errors and speeding up policy administration by 70%. Our new security solutions like XDR and Secure Access are ramping quickly after being launched this fall with now over 230 Cisco XDR customers. Over the next 6 months, you can expect more meaningful announcements across the portfolio through our accelerated organic innovation and inorganic investments. In addition, we have now extended our AI-powered ThousandEyes into Cisco Secure Access joining past integrations with AppDynamics, Webex, Catalyst and Meraki platforms. ThousandEyes allows our customers to understand the digital experience of users, applications and things through billions of daily measurements of the Internet and public SaaS, as well as thousands of enterprise customers creating best-in-class digital experiences for users. In observability, we introduced the Cisco Digital Experience Monitoring application, providing deep insights into the performance of browser and mobile applications and efficient resolution of session level issues. Our continued generative AI innovations build upon our existing platform capabilities, further enabling operations teams to focus on what matters most, minimizing tool sprawl, improving overall performance and delivering highly secure digital experiences. Going back to the pending Splunk acquisition, the combination of Splunk's complementary capabilities with ours and AI, security and observability will create an end-to-end data platform to enhance our customers' digital resiliency. We are excited that together, we will bring trusted innovation leadership, an outstanding go-to-market engine and a world-class culture that will help our customers achieve their technology outcomes with innovative products and solutions. I would also like to provide a brief update on timing. While the closing of the acquisition of Splunk remains subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, given the positive progress to date on the required regulatory approvals, we now expect to close the transaction late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter of calendar year 2024, which is in our fiscal third quarter. Before I turn it over to Scott, let me summarize three key takeaways. First, we have reset our expectations for the second half of the year given the cautious macro environment, our customers absorbing high levels of inventory and ongoing weakness in Service Provider. Second, you can count on us to take a disciplined approach regardless of the environment. We remain committed to operating leverage, capital allocation and expense management. Lastly, our portfolio continues to get stronger and stronger every day. While we have work in front of us and despite the current environment, we remain confident in our long-term strategy. We are relentlessly focused on our commitment to driving long-term value for our shareholders and industry-leading innovation for our customers. I'll now turn it over to Scott to provide more detail on the quarter and our outlook.\nScott Herren: Thanks, Chuck. Our Q2 results reflect solid execution again with strong margins and increasing operating leverage. For the quarter, total revenue was at the high end of our guidance range at $12.8 billion, down 6% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $3.5 billion, down 3%, and non-GAAP earnings per share was above the high end of our guidance range at $0.87, down 1%. Looking at our Q2 revenue in more detail. Total product revenue was $9.2 billion, down 9% and service revenue was $3.6 billion, up 4%. Networking, our largest product category was down 12%. We saw declines across switching, wireless and routed optical networking, driven primarily by weakness in the Enterprise and Service Provider & Cloud markets. Security was up 3% with our Zero Trust offering growing double digits. Collaboration was up 3%, driven by growth in collaboration devices and calling, partially offset by a decline in meetings. Observability was up 16%, driven by growth across the portfolio with continued strength in ThousandEyes network services. As Chuck mentioned, ThousandEyes helps monitor and assure digital experience everywhere, on-premise, Internet and the cloud. We continue to make progress on our transformation to more recurring revenue-based offerings. We saw strong performance in our ARR of $24.7 billion, which increased 6% with product ARR growth of 9%. Total software revenue was flat at $4.2 billion, with software subscription revenue up 5%. 88% of our software revenue was subscription-based. Total subscription revenue increased 6% to $6.4 billion, which now represents 50% of Cisco's total revenue, an increase of 6 percentage points over last year. RPO was $35.7 billion, up 12% year-over-year. Product and service RPO both increased 12%. In total short-term RPO was $17.9 billion, up 6%. Q2 product orders declined 12%, a significant improvement from Q1 as customers continue to work down product shipments from prior quarters. Looking at our geographic segments year-over-year. The Americas was down 10%, EMEA down 8% and APJC was down 27%. In our customer markets, Service Provider & Cloud was down 40%, Enterprise was down 6% and Public Sector was down 5%. Backlog at the end of Q2 has now returned to normal levels. Total non-GAAP gross margin came in at 66.7%, up 280 basis points year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. Product gross margin was 65.2%, up 310 basis points. The improvement was driven primarily by lower freight and component costs and favorable product mix, partially offset by negative impact on pricing. Service gross margin was 70.5%, up 140 basis points. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 33%, up 50 basis points and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Strong non-GAAP gross margin and continued cost management drove the leverage. Further, we are realigning our investments and expenses to reflect the current environment to help maximize long-term value for our shareholders. As part of our announced restructuring plan, we expect to impact approximately 5% of our global workforce with estimated pretax charges of approximately $800 million. Shifting to the balance sheet. We ended Q2 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $25.7 billion. Consistent with our expectations, operating cash flow was $800 million, driven in large part by the timing of federal tax payments and the higher annual payment of the TCJA transition tax. This quarter, we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and $1.3 billion of share repurchases. Year-to-date, we have returned $5.7 billion in value to shareholders, we plan to continue our share repurchases at the current quarterly level throughout fiscal 2024. Increasing shareholder returns through greater operating leverage, maintaining a higher level of annual share repurchases and growing our dividend is consistent with our capital allocation strategy. Given the confidence we have in our business today, we announced we are raising our dividend by $0.01 to $0.40 per quarter. This dividend increase demonstrates our commitment to returning a minimum of 50% of free cash flow annually to our shareholders and our confidence in the strength of our ongoing cash flows. To summarize, we executed well with continued strong margins and increased operating leverage as we help our customers complete record deployments and implementations. We continue to progress our business model shift to more recurring revenue. We are strategically investing in innovation to capitalize on our growth opportunities and are committed to delivering long-term shareholder value. With regard to our proposed acquisition of Splunk, we continue to work through regulatory approvals and closing conditions. And as Chuck mentioned, we're optimistic that it will close ahead of what we had originally anticipated. We have not included any impact from the Splunk acquisition in our forward-looking guidance. Turning to our guidance. As previously mentioned, we have reset our expectations for the second half of the year to account for the caution around macro uncertainty, the continued absorption by our customers of record levels of product shipments they received from us and the weakness of our Service Provider market. For Q3, our guidance is as follows, we expect revenue to be in the range of $12.1 billion to $12.3 billion. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 66% to 67%. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 33.5% to 34.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.84 to $0.86. For fiscal year '24, our guidance is as follows, we expect revenue to be in the range of $51.5 billion to $52.5 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is expected to range from $3.68 to $3.74. In both our Q3 and full year guidance, we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. Sami, let's now move into the Q&A.\nSami Badri: Thank you, Scott. Before we start the Q&A portion of the call, I would like to remind analysts to ask one question and a single follow-up question. Operator, can we move to the first analyst in the queue.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Amit Daryanani with Evercore. You may go ahead, sir.\nAmit Daryanani: Yes, good afternoon. I'll ask both my questions upfront. Chuck, when I think about the lower revenue guide for the full year by about 500 basis points versus 90 days ago. Can you just touch on how much of that do you think is the digestion getting extended versus the macro versus the telco weakness? And then how do you sort of think about getting back to a positive revenue cadence organically? And then as a follow-up, I'd love to just understand this Nvidia announcement you folks had. There's a bit of a perception that it's more about servers, less about networking. I would love for you to just flush that out, what that means for Cisco? Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Amit, thank you very much. So obviously, with the lower guide, we talked about the feeling that there's some macro uncertainty. We talk to our teams in preparation for this, and they obviously submitted their forecast. And what we really saw was what they previously told us 90 days ago relative to the second half versus what they told us a couple of weeks ago had changed materially, which means customers are pushing things out and putting a little more scrutiny on them. So that's the difference that we've seen. As far as trying to break down what percentage comes from each of those - the three, including the digestion issue, as well as the telco and SP piece. I think it's pretty difficult to do, honestly. However, I will say that we think that the consumption of the elevated inventory levels should be - we should be through that by the end of our fiscal year. We think that SP telcos, the SP telco and cable side of it, we're hopeful that in the '25, they will begin investing again. We originally had anticipated that they would begin to invest in the second half of this year, and we no longer believe that to be true. And I think that - so I think the consumption issue and the SP thing or the consumption issue is temporary through the end of the year. The macro thing is one that we're going to have to wait and see and the SP telco probably similarly. And all of these things led us obviously to reset the second half of the year. On the Nvidia partnership, it is definitely Ethernet. I was in the meeting when we first talked about this with Jensen, and he agreed that we would include our Ethernet technology with their GPUs and creating the stack. There will also be servers as well, and there'll be multiple versions of this over time. So - but it will include our Ethernet technology when they're connecting multiple clusters.\nSami Badri: Thank you, Amit. Michelle, we have the next analyst.\nOperator: Thank you. Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. Maybe you've mentioned Service Provider, but I guess just getting a sense of whether you're seeing more weakness on data center or edge or if it comes to kind of the five investment priorities that you had noted that enterprises had a couple of quarters ago, or any one of those areas still getting prioritized significantly versus not getting prioritized significantly? And then just maybe as a second question, how are you seeing enterprises think about AI and think about where the budgets for AI are coming from? Just any commentary would be helpful there. Thanks.\nChuck Robbins: Yes. Thanks, Meta. So I would say that what we do see customers investing in is clearly cybersecurity. We see observability as you saw the 16% growth rate. We even saw collaboration positive this quarter, which was a good sign. They're at various phases of still dealing with this hybrid work situation. We had a very strong quarter with our devices, our video device businesses. We see customers investing in their customer experience through technologies like contact center. And so we see a lot of that. We see customers continuing to invest in their application rearchitecture, which leads to both observability opportunities, as well as the rearchitecture of their networks to deal with the traffic flows that we've been talking about for a couple of years. I think the real issue right now is that we shipped so much networking in our core business that that's where the challenge is that they're just trying to get all that implemented right now. As it relates to the enterprise and how they're thinking about AI, what I would tell you is that over the last 90 days, we began to see the - the pipeline for AI use cases in the enterprise began to emerge. And there's a heavy work going on in financial services. I would say it's early in what they're trying to think through, but we are seeing opportunities arise. And I think that there have been some comments, not enough for me to translate this to a massive trend, but there were some comments from some of our field teams that they see customers holding budget back just to be ready to extend it on AI once they get their strategy fully baked. So that's about what I could tell you at this point.\nSami Badri: Thank you, Meta. Michelle, can we go to the next analyst.\nOperator: Yes, David Vogt with UBS. You may go ahead.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thanks, guys, for taking my question. So maybe I just want to step back for a second, Chuck and maybe for Scott also. If I look at your guide for this year, I mean, we're basically back to fiscal '19 revenue levels. So I'm just trying to think about how your longer-term model works in the context of that 5% to 7% guide that you laid out at the investor briefing a number of years ago as a sort of investor - as sort of customer digest product. Obviously, it would suggest that maybe there's some more share loss going on in the core networking portfolio, given some of the other parts of the business has grown. So I just wanted to kind of try to get a sense for how you're thinking about the portfolio today, given we're kind of back to fiscal '19. And then from a profitability standpoint, obviously, you've done a tremendous job, and I would imagine the cost cutting goes along those lines to keep margins higher. But is there an opportunity to use margin and maybe price going forward to take back some of the share if there's a disruption in the market by a potential strategic transaction in the marketplace today? Thanks.\nScott Herren: Yes, David, I'll start and then Chuck, you can chime in on share. The way to think about the 5% to 7%, if you go back to when we gave that metric, you remember, it was in 2021, actually pre all of the supply chain volatility that we've seen. And since then, of course, we've seen the supply chain set in, which caused a spike in product orders and then a subsequent big building up of our backlog as we cleared the backlog, we saw a spike in revenue. And so it's been difficult to look at year-on-year compares as all those dynamics were going on. What we're seeing now is as we've cleared the backlog, and we cleared it very quickly, given the strength of our supply chain team, that bottleneck has just moved downstream. So I don't think you can look at this year's revenue and try to somehow compare it to historical because of all the moving parts underneath the covers. What underpinned that 5% to 7% when we gave it to you was that's the aggregated growth of the TAM of the markets that we play in, right? And so at this point, we still see that as the longer term where we're headed. I think looking at year-on-year growth rates, I don't think you're going to see those growth rates begin to normalize until we work through the inventory that's in the field right now, which is one of the biggest headwinds we've got, right? Then we can get back to regular ordering and then you need to lap that, right? You need to go four quarters out to be able to compare it to a more normalized point. So I think that's the way you need to think about that longer term. But there's no change at this point. We'll update the longer-term model after we finish the acquisition of Splunk and can give you better insight into what we look like as a combined company.\nChuck Robbins: And David, on the share loss, I think if you look at the - just look at the last published reports that came out after Q...\nScott Herren: Q3, calendar...\nChuck Robbins: Calendar Q3, the - in our four largest markets, so if you take campus switching, you take wireless and you take SP routing, we actually gained share. So I don't know where the share loss thesis is coming from. When you look at data center switching, you will see it show up as a share loss. But to be - we have to understand that one of our major competitors there reports their web scale sales into data center switching, and we report our web scale sales into SP routing. So those turn into sort of apples and oranges categories. But the others, based on the last reports that were put out, we actually have gained share if you look at a rolling four quarter even over the last 3 years.\nSami Badri: Thank you, David. Michelle, next analyst.\nOperator: Thank you. Simon Leopold with Raymond James. You may go ahead, sir.\nSimon Leopold: Thanks for taking the question. I've got an easy one and a little bit harder one. I'll start with the easy one and ask the other. It just looks like your order trajectory is getting somewhat better. So the orders this quarter down 12%, not too bad. And I know you don't forecast orders, but maybe if you can talk about when you expect orders could turn positive again, given the comparison and the trend. The other question I wanted to see if you could discuss how you envision the AI clusters in terms of will the web-scale operators choose multiple vendors in a single cluster or will they designate maybe different data centers to different suppliers? Or will they mix and match, how do you see the split playing out, particularly in the hyperscale opportunity? And I really mean this more longer term, '25, '26, not currently when we're dominated by InfiniBand, but when Ethernet starts taking more share. Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Yes. Thanks, Simon. So on the order trajectory, I think what - we clearly don't guide bookings. But what I would tell you is that even as our teams modified their second half outlook, the second half will still be more favorable than the first half. So your assessment of sort of the trajectory, I think, is valid, and I'll leave it at that. On the AI clusters, I think it's a good question because what you'll hear is us and competitors talking about a number of web scale players that are using our technology underneath GPUs, our Ethernet technology and our GPUs. And so I think it's important to remember, they always tend to have a dual vendor strategy. They always want two sources, and so we're both actually - the two of us are actually playing in this space today. And I'd say today, they're completely homogeneous clusters. And I think it's too early to tell whether there will be some benefit over time for them to mix those. My sense is, unless there's something that changes significantly or there's some sort of technology reason for GPUs to be mixed, which I can't speak to at this point. I don't think the underlying network will be mixed. I just don't think there's any benefit for them to do that.\nSami Badri: Thank you, Simon. Michele, next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Tal Liani with Bank of America. You may go ahead.\nTal Liani: Hi. I have two questions. The first one is security. The market is great. And we met 2 years ago and 3 years ago when you spoke about new strategy and going to market, but it's still only growing 3%. What is happening there? And what can you do to fix security and benefit from this market growth? And then maybe I'll ask my follow-up.\nChuck Robbins: Okay. Thanks, Tal. So I think over the last few quarters, I've been pretty consistent that we thought the second half of this fiscal year, we would start to see an acceleration of security. And I can give you some highlights where we are seeing some of that - some green shoots early. Some of the new innovation like XDR and Secure Access, Multicloud Defense suites are - we're seeing good pipeline build with those technologies. XDR, we now have - we announced that in April last year, we shipped in August. And we have 230 customers, 230-plus customers on the platform today. And the important thing to remember is that it's a big platform play. And we actually typically see that as a 6 to 9-month sales cycle. So to have 230 customers already, I think, is a statement on the value that our customers are seeing. That's going to be a real important integration point with Splunk, by the way. So that we see, we see - we feel good about the pipeline. From a demand perspective, just to give you some insight, the Americas, the demand was almost double digits this past quarter, which is the highest we've seen in a while. So I think we're seeing a lot of good indicators. And if you just watch over the next 6 to 9 months, you're going to see more and more innovation that comes out. And I think you'll begin to believe and see the results around that same time frame.\nSami Badri: Thank you, Tal. And we'll get to your other question at some point after the call. Michelle, can we move to the next speaker.\nOperator: Thank you. Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may go ahead, sir.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Chuck, I'm going to - for my first question, I ask you to go back to sort of the drivers of demand that you're seeing here. We walked away from the call last time, sensing a sense of optimism about a sharp rebound when you see the inventory digestion complete. But I guess what I'm hearing from you today is even as that inventory digestion ends in fiscal '24, you're seeing a bit more of a macro impact on your customer demand? And are your expectations still sort of intact in terms of thinking about a more sharp rebound as you go into fiscal '25, if you can share what you're seeing from customers there. And for my follow-up, the Nvidia partnership, how should we think about the impact of that on your AI order [ph] target of $1 billion ? Or is it really most of that partnership that realizes beyond that sort of target window, target time frame? Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks. I would say on the thing that's changed from last quarter is that we do just see a little more caution with our customers. I don't want to over-rotate and say that it's a massive shift, but we definitely saw more caution. We talked with our sales leaders ahead of the call, and they indicated - we asked them point blank, was there more caution or the same caution from the prior quarter, and we heard more, a little bit more. And then we saw the push out of the forecast. So that just tells us that there is a little bit more in the system. So therefore, I think we need a couple of quarters to see it play out before we can declare what's going to happen in fiscal '25. On the Nvidia discussion, a couple of comments. We talked about the $1 billion of orders, which I know someone is going to ask me about at some point. And what I would say is that in the last 90 days, our pipeline of AI opportunities continue to grow. The pipeline is now almost three times that particular number that we gave last time, which were more orders that we see in '25. The total pipeline is now about three times that, roughly three times that. And I would say that virtually none of that is anything associated with the Nvidia partnership yet. It's all independent of that.\nSami Badri: Thank you, Samik. Michelle, next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. You may go ahead.\nBen Reitzes: Hey, thanks for the question, guys. Hey, Chuck. Hey, Scott. I wanted to ask about the HP, Juniper deal. Are you seeing any uncertainty in the market near term? And how do you think that helps you long term? And if you - Chuck, if you don't mind, just with regard to that last AI comment, your - one of your competitors, obviously, is expecting quite a big pickup next year, next calendar year. Do you feel like that AI $3 billion in pipeline or so kicks in next year, next calendar year? Or what's your timing on that? Thanks so much.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Ben. So I would say on the HP, Juniper deal, the one area where they have meaningful overlap is in wireless. And I don't know if there's any connection to the fact that we had a 50% increase in $1 million-plus wireless deal sequentially. So it's hard to say. But I mean there is a lot of noise in the system or in the industry about what they do there, but I can't say specifically that any customers have talked to me about it, to be honest. So I think we're - I think it's a little early for them to - for the customers to be expressing that concern. They may be asking them directly, but they're not talking to us. On the timing, yes, I think we said fiscal '25, which starts in August of this year. And I think you probably should assume most of that is probably in the second half, I would guess, but we'll see how things play out. I think customers are going to move as fast as they possibly can, but we're still in the early strategy and planning stages right now on most of it. The pipeline stuff are well-defined use cases that are already in place with certain customers, and we're actually just working through the opportunities.\nScott Herren: Yeah. But, Ben, our expectation is the majority of that $1 billion in orders will turn into revenue in our fiscal '25, just to be clear.\nSami Badri: Thank you, Ben. Michelle, next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead, sir.\nMatt Niknam: Hey, thanks so much. And I'll keep it to one and one follow-up. So main question, just around inventory digestion. Is that dynamic primarily affecting enterprise and commercial customers? And can you talk a little bit about the visibility you've got towards this actually resolving itself by fiscal year-end? And then a follow-up just on gross margins. You were fairly stable sequentially, and I think the guide implies more of the same. So I'm just wondering, are we now largely past a lot of the supply chain dynamics or headwinds? Or has anything changed on the supply chain front? Thanks.\nChuck Robbins: Yes. So I'll take the first, and then Scott can take the second. On the inventory digestion issue, I think it's - I would say it's largely an Enterprise and a Service Provider issue and particularly the cloud providers, we think they've got probably in excess of 20-plus weeks of inventory that they're working through right now as they built up when the lead times were so long. We have a lot of our Enterprise products that are tethered to the cloud for management perspectives. And so we see the lag between when we ship it to the customer and when they connected. I gave the Meraki example in my prepared remarks. And so we do have visibility, and we can actually see on some aspects of the portfolio, how the time frame between shipments and connectivity is shrinking, and it's not shrinking as fast as we thought it would, which leads us to believe this is going to extend through the end of '24, so that's where we are. Scott, gross margins?\nScott Herren: Yes. What you saw in the quarter is, of course, gross margins continue to show a year-on-year improving trend, roughly flat, as you said, sequentially. There's a couple of dynamics. But to your question on where does this settle in? I think it settles in the range we're in right now in the 66% to 67% range through the end of the year. There's both the things that are happening from a freight and delivery standpoint, freight costs with what's happening in the Red Sea have gone up slightly, and we continue to see a little bit of component pressure, although in the commodity sections, we're seeing some benefit there. The scale of the services ramp up as you - obviously, services revenue trails the product revenue. We had those three really strong quarters of product revenue growth. We're seeing the tail of that now in our services revenue growth. And since a lot of the cost underneath our services are fixed, you get better leverage when that happens. So I think when you add all those together, we should settle in, in the 66% to 67% range. And the majority of, if not all of the supply chain constraints that we felt are behind us at this point.\nSami Badri: Thank you, Matt. Michelle, next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead, sir.\nMichael Ng: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for the question, Chuck and Scott. I just have two. First, just on the revenue guidance, I think based on the midpoint of it, the implied fiscal 4Q revenue guidance only implies about plus 1% quarter-on-quarter. Given that we're back to a normal backlog, what's preventing that from going back to a more normal level of seasonality? And then as a follow-up to Amit's question earlier on the Nvidia AI deal. I just wanted to clarify. I understand that it's Ethernet, but will it be both Nvidia's, Spectrum-X, as well as Cisco's Ethernet? And how will that be sold together, if that's the correct assumption? Thank you.\nScott Herren: Michael, on the midpoint of the revenue guide, the math would lead you to what you just said. I think no one ever wants to have to reset guidance, much less have to do it twice. As Chuck just said, as we look at all the various factors coming in from the field, we see caution. And I think you should expect that there's caution in our guide at this point.\nChuck Robbins: On the Nvidia front, I think, look, one of the key benefits that they see is leveraging our enterprise go to market, and our global ecosystem and partner community. And therefore, when these solutions are flowing through our channels and our sales teams and our partners, it will be Cisco Ethernet.\nSami Badri: Thank you, Michael. Michelle, next question.\nOperator: Thank you. George Notter with Jefferies. You may go ahead, sir.\nGeorge Notter: Hi, guys. Thanks very much. I guess I'm just curious about - are there any mechanisms or activities you guys are using to help accelerate the clearance of inventory from the channel? Any price discounting, any rebating stock rotation, how are you taking an active approach here? Thanks.\nChuck Robbins: I'll comment - I'll make one quick comment. I think I said this in my prepared remarks as well. We've deployed a lot of transaction services for some of our larger customers just to help them do that. And I know that our sales teams were talking this week, Scott, maybe you remember or you have some more detail on looking at some partner incentives to help?\nScott Herren: Yes. We absolutely are working with the field on that. In a lot of cases, it boils down to a lack of the skilled resources required at both - sometimes at our partner level, sometimes at the customer level to get that done. There's only so much you can do to accelerate it. We have put in place incentives to make that accelerate. To your other point on cancellations or stock rotation, we're seeing those continuing to be well below where they were pre-pandemic. So we're not seeing any of that - any pressure on that front.\nSami Badri: Thank you, George. Michelle, next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Woo Jin Ho with Bloomberg Intelligence. You may go ahead.\nWoo Jin Ho: Great. Thank you for taking my question. Given that most of the weakness is going to be on the networking side, could you just talk a little bit more about the future software subscription renewal rates. You did a good job this quarter with software subscriptions going up 5%, but given that networking is poised to be down, curious where that's heading going forward.\nChuck Robbins: Yes. I think - thanks for the question, Woo Jin. I think the way to think about it is, we put a - as you can imagine, when you built up the level of annualized recurring revenue that we have, we've put a huge amount of focus on both customer success and driving adoption and then turning that adoption into renewals. We've invested fairly heavily in that space over the last couple of years, and we're seeing renewal rates respond accordingly. When you look at where we're more software-heavy outside of networking, but in both security and collab, as you saw, we reported growth - revenue growth in both of those categories. Observability is almost exclusively software, and we posted 16% revenue growth in observability. So we are seeing that actually trend in the right direction.\nSami Badri: Thank you. Woo Jin. Michelle, next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Tim Long with Barclays. You may go ahead, sir.\nTim Long: Thank you. Yes, one question, one follow-up. So first, maybe, Chuck, can you talk a little bit, excuse me, about the kind of margin growth trade-off with the headcount reduction, obviously, protect the margin here, but how do you think about that trade-off given the challenging growth we've seen? And then just on a follow-up with all of the AI comments, Chuck, could you just remind us kind of where we are with - from a product standpoint, are you seeing more traction for Silicon One or software or the full system products? If you could just give us a little color on kind of where you're seeing that pipeline growing? Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Yes. Thanks, Tim. So on the margin growth trade-off, we're always considering that. And we're very disciplined, though. And we think that gross margins are clearly a reflection of the value that your customers see and your technology and what you deliver. And if you look at a lot of our competitors, and you look at some of the market share, I mean, some of the gross margins that they have, that tells you that they're viewed more as a commodity. And I think that our customers see real value in what we deliver to them. So while we always look at margins versus growth, we also are - we're just disciplined across both. On the AI front, Silicon One is a big play, clearly. We've delivered next-generation silicon into several of the cloud providers right now. We've got the Ethernet running in three of the four big ones, and we'll use the same silicon in the enterprise data center over time. We've got GPUs in our UCS platforms. And so it's evolving, but we have - I tell our teams unlike the original cloud transition that we talked on this call several times about how we were not prepared for the infrastructure play in the cloud world. I think we are absolutely ready and well equipped to succeed in this transition to AI. It will be a tailwind for us as we get into it over time.\nSami Badri: Thank you, Tim. Michelle, next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I'll speak to one, just building on that last question. I know over periods of time, you've talked a little bit about how large your webscale business is. Can you just remind us again the presence you have in some of the webscale opportunities, either from a size and maybe ex the AI discussion, what kind of growth rates you're seeing, particularly with those webscale customers right now?\nChuck Robbins: So our team measures what their use cases or franchises or however you want to think about it, there are specific areas within the infrastructure that we identify for each of the webscale players. And Scott, keep me honest, I want to say we're designed into '16 or...\nA -: 21.\nChuck Robbins: 21 of those. And so that's how I would think about it. I don't think that right now, if you looked at the growth numbers, they wouldn't be reflective of what's going on because they're just digesting inventory right now. So they're not in a position where they need to order a lot because lead times have normalized so much. So I don't think that's - it's not even relevant. I think understanding those 21 use cases. And as I said earlier, they want dual source, and they want dual source all the way down to the silicon level. In the traditional days with carriers, they wanted two vendors who would provide two different integrated systems. In this case, that may be the case with cloud, but they also look at silicon, they look at components. They're very deep on wanting to make sure that they have resiliency and optionality.\nScott Herren: Aaron, the only thing I'd add is - and we said it earlier, there's no question that over time, given the way we're positioned, both from a complete box, a white box and a silicon standpoint, there's no question that AI is a tailwind for us longer term.\nSami Badri: Thank you, Aaron. And Michelle, we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. James Fish with Piper Sandler. You may go ahead, sir.\nJames Fish: Hey, guys, thanks for squeezing me in here. Scott, based on a couple of comments you made around gross margins. Just wondering, with supply chain starting to go the other way and supply more readily available, could we see the price increases enacted in the past now have to be given back? And any sense to how should we think about the annualized cost savings on these reductions, understanding there are people here and difficulty and what areas you guys expect to kind of reduce down and if some of those reductions are filled elsewhere in terms of like a net basis on headcount? Thanks, guys.\nScott Herren: Yes. On the price declines, you got to remember, go back to why we put the price increases in to begin with. And that was really to offset the higher cost that we were seeing from many of our suppliers as everyone was dealing with constraints and supply demand is pretty straightforward. What we haven't seen in the wake of this, some of the commodities, the prices have come down, memory is a good example. But we haven't seen broadly is cost decreases coming in from our providers at this point. And so with that - and you see that reflected in our gross margins, which have returned to a more normal range, but are still sitting in that 66% to 67% range. So I'm not anticipating at this point, price declines pending significant cost declines coming into us. On the cost savings, you can see where we are year-to-date. We've got - if you just look at operating expenses for a minute, year-to-date, operating expenses are modestly up. And after working our way through the restructuring that we discussed today, for the full year, we think they'll be modestly down. So I think that's probably the right way to think about it as you're looking to build your model.\nSami Badri: Thank you, Jim.

            "name": "Chuck Robbins",
            "content": "Thanks, Sami, and thank you all for joining us today. We delivered a solid Q2 performance with revenue coming in at the high end of our guidance range. Strong operating leverage across our business drove our margins, which exceeded the high end of our expectations and allowed us to deliver better-than-anticipated earnings per share. In Q2, we once again returned a total of $2.8 billion in value through dividends and share repurchases. We also announced today another increase to Cisco's dividend payout rate, reaffirming our ongoing commitment to returning significant value to our shareholders through consistent capital returns. Overall, our Q2 results continue to advance our strategic business transformation around driving higher levels of software subscriptions and annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, both of which showed performance gains in the quarter. Our pending acquisition of Splunk also further supports our transformation strategy by fueling stronger growth, expanding our portfolio of software-based solutions and generating higher levels of ARR with roughly $4 billion in additional ARR expected upon closing and will make us one of the largest software companies in the world. Before turning to our performance in the quarter, I'd like to start by commenting on the demand environment. First, in terms of the macro environment, we are seeing a greater degree of caution and scrutiny of deals given the high level of uncertainty. As we're hearing this from our customers, it's leading us to be more cautious with our forecast and expectations. Second, as we discussed last quarter and subsequently saw in other technology provider results, customers have been taking time since the start of our fiscal 2024 to deploy the elevated levels of products shipped to them in recent quarters, and this is taking longer than our initial expectations. Third, we also continue to see weak demand with our telco and cable service provider customers. This industry has seen significant pressure and they are adjusting deployment phasing, which is weighing on our business outlook. Given these factors, we are adjusting our expenses and investments to reflect the current environment. That said, for the product categories in which we can measure customer inventory absorption through connections to the cloud, we are seeing steady progress. However, based on conversations with customers, we still believe we are 1 to 2 quarters away from full implementation of their inventory, which, as I mentioned, is longer than we expected. We continue to track Meraki activations, which are moving slightly faster in wireless and slightly slower in switching. Using our Meraki business as a proxy for our wider enterprise networking portfolio, we expect the current implementation of shipped products to be broadly complete by the end of fiscal 2024. Looking at our wireless business as an example, we are encouraged by the number of orders of $1 million or more, which increased approximately 50% sequentially in Q2. This indicates that many wireless customers have finished absorbing what we've shipped to them and are preparing for larger deployments in the coming months. Our team is also partnering closely with customers to assist with this heightened focus on deployments of Cisco equipment on hand, contributing to our services revenue increase year-over-year. It's also worth noting that non-hardware-centric revenue in areas such as security and collaboration increased and our observability offerings grew double digits year-over-year. Finally, despite the near-term challenges, our win rates are stable and on a rolling 4-quarter basis, our market share remained steady in three of our four largest markets. Now moving on to our performance in Q2. As I mentioned earlier, our performance in the quarter was broadly in line with or better than our Q2 expectations. Given the trust our customers place in us and the criticality of our technologies to the outcomes our customers are seeking, I am confident about the foundational strength of our portfolio and our future growth opportunities. With our innovation, we deliver and enable our customers to deploy next-generation applications in a highly secure manner. As part of this, we help facilitate their growth through our products and services so that when our customers adopt new technologies, we grow alongside them. We continue to accelerate our innovation across high-growth areas. Last week at Cisco Live EMEA, we announced new capabilities in networking, furthering our vision for the Cisco networking cloud. We also announced several new capabilities across our security, collaboration and observability portfolios leveraging AI throughout. We also continue to capitalize on the multibillion-dollar AI infrastructure opportunity. This quarter, we announced the next phase in our partnership with Nvidia to offer enterprises simplified, cloud-based and on-prem AI infrastructure. This includes both networking hardware and software to support advanced AI workloads. We are clear beneficiaries of AI adoption, and this partnership further demonstrates the central role we play in AI and the overall technology ecosystem. Our combined solution will be sold through our extensive global channel with professional services and support from key partners who are committed to helping businesses deploy their GPU clusters via Ethernet infrastructure. In web scale, we continue to see momentum with three of the top four customers deploying our hyperscale Ethernet AI fabric, leveraging Cisco-validated designs for AI infrastructure. While there is tremendous opportunity ahead, we are still in the early stages of adoption of AI workloads. In security, we continue to execute against our product roadmap to deliver the industry's most comprehensive unified platform with end-to-end solutions. This quarter, we introduced Cisco Identity Intelligence, an analytics layer that pulls data from identity infrastructure and performs behavior-based assessments to help protect against identity-based attacks which are at the forefront of cyber threats today. AI is also becoming more pervasive across the Cisco Security Cloud. For example, our new AI Assistant and Secure Access lets customers create security access policies using natural language prompts, reducing errors and speeding up policy administration by 70%. Our new security solutions like XDR and Secure Access are ramping quickly after being launched this fall with now over 230 Cisco XDR customers. Over the next 6 months, you can expect more meaningful announcements across the portfolio through our accelerated organic innovation and inorganic investments. In addition, we have now extended our AI-powered ThousandEyes into Cisco Secure Access joining past integrations with AppDynamics, Webex, Catalyst and Meraki platforms. ThousandEyes allows our customers to understand the digital experience of users, applications and things through billions of daily measurements of the Internet and public SaaS, as well as thousands of enterprise customers creating best-in-class digital experiences for users. In observability, we introduced the Cisco Digital Experience Monitoring application, providing deep insights into the performance of browser and mobile applications and efficient resolution of session level issues. Our continued generative AI innovations build upon our existing platform capabilities, further enabling operations teams to focus on what matters most, minimizing tool sprawl, improving overall performance and delivering highly secure digital experiences. Going back to the pending Splunk acquisition, the combination of Splunk's complementary capabilities with ours and AI, security and observability will create an end-to-end data platform to enhance our customers' digital resiliency. We are excited that together, we will bring trusted innovation leadership, an outstanding go-to-market engine and a world-class culture that will help our customers achieve their technology outcomes with innovative products and solutions. I would also like to provide a brief update on timing. While the closing of the acquisition of Splunk remains subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, given the positive progress to date on the required regulatory approvals, we now expect to close the transaction late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter of calendar year 2024, which is in our fiscal third quarter. Before I turn it over to Scott, let me summarize three key takeaways. First, we have reset our expectations for the second half of the year given the cautious macro environment, our customers absorbing high levels of inventory and ongoing weakness in Service Provider. Second, you can count on us to take a disciplined approach regardless of the environment. We remain committed to operating leverage, capital allocation and expense management. Lastly, our portfolio continues to get stronger and stronger every day. While we have work in front of us and despite the current environment, we remain confident in our long-term strategy. We are relentlessly focused on our commitment to driving long-term value for our shareholders and industry-leading innovation for our customers. I'll now turn it over to Scott to provide more detail on the quarter and our outlook. Amit, thank you very much. So obviously, with the lower guide, we talked about the feeling that there's some macro uncertainty. We talk to our teams in preparation for this, and they obviously submitted their forecast. And what we really saw was what they previously told us 90 days ago relative to the second half versus what they told us a couple of weeks ago had changed materially, which means customers are pushing things out and putting a little more scrutiny on them. So that's the difference that we've seen. As far as trying to break down what percentage comes from each of those - the three, including the digestion issue, as well as the telco and SP piece. I think it's pretty difficult to do, honestly. However, I will say that we think that the consumption of the elevated inventory levels should be - we should be through that by the end of our fiscal year. We think that SP telcos, the SP telco and cable side of it, we're hopeful that in the '25, they will begin investing again. We originally had anticipated that they would begin to invest in the second half of this year, and we no longer believe that to be true. And I think that - so I think the consumption issue and the SP thing or the consumption issue is temporary through the end of the year. The macro thing is one that we're going to have to wait and see and the SP telco probably similarly. And all of these things led us obviously to reset the second half of the year. On the Nvidia partnership, it is definitely Ethernet. I was in the meeting when we first talked about this with Jensen, and he agreed that we would include our Ethernet technology with their GPUs and creating the stack. There will also be servers as well, and there'll be multiple versions of this over time. So - but it will include our Ethernet technology when they're connecting multiple clusters. Yes. Thanks, Meta. So I would say that what we do see customers investing in is clearly cybersecurity. We see observability as you saw the 16% growth rate. We even saw collaboration positive this quarter, which was a good sign. They're at various phases of still dealing with this hybrid work situation. We had a very strong quarter with our devices, our video device businesses. We see customers investing in their customer experience through technologies like contact center. And so we see a lot of that. We see customers continuing to invest in their application rearchitecture, which leads to both observability opportunities, as well as the rearchitecture of their networks to deal with the traffic flows that we've been talking about for a couple of years. I think the real issue right now is that we shipped so much networking in our core business that that's where the challenge is that they're just trying to get all that implemented right now. As it relates to the enterprise and how they're thinking about AI, what I would tell you is that over the last 90 days, we began to see the - the pipeline for AI use cases in the enterprise began to emerge. And there's a heavy work going on in financial services. I would say it's early in what they're trying to think through, but we are seeing opportunities arise. And I think that there have been some comments, not enough for me to translate this to a massive trend, but there were some comments from some of our field teams that they see customers holding budget back just to be ready to extend it on AI once they get their strategy fully baked. So that's about what I could tell you at this point. And David, on the share loss, I think if you look at the - just look at the last published reports that came out after Q... Calendar Q3, the - in our four largest markets, so if you take campus switching, you take wireless and you take SP routing, we actually gained share. So I don't know where the share loss thesis is coming from. When you look at data center switching, you will see it show up as a share loss. But to be - we have to understand that one of our major competitors there reports their web scale sales into data center switching, and we report our web scale sales into SP routing. So those turn into sort of apples and oranges categories. But the others, based on the last reports that were put out, we actually have gained share if you look at a rolling four quarter even over the last 3 years. Yes. Thanks, Simon. So on the order trajectory, I think what - we clearly don't guide bookings. But what I would tell you is that even as our teams modified their second half outlook, the second half will still be more favorable than the first half. So your assessment of sort of the trajectory, I think, is valid, and I'll leave it at that. On the AI clusters, I think it's a good question because what you'll hear is us and competitors talking about a number of web scale players that are using our technology underneath GPUs, our Ethernet technology and our GPUs. And so I think it's important to remember, they always tend to have a dual vendor strategy. They always want two sources, and so we're both actually - the two of us are actually playing in this space today. And I'd say today, they're completely homogeneous clusters. And I think it's too early to tell whether there will be some benefit over time for them to mix those. My sense is, unless there's something that changes significantly or there's some sort of technology reason for GPUs to be mixed, which I can't speak to at this point. I don't think the underlying network will be mixed. I just don't think there's any benefit for them to do that. Okay. Thanks, Tal. So I think over the last few quarters, I've been pretty consistent that we thought the second half of this fiscal year, we would start to see an acceleration of security. And I can give you some highlights where we are seeing some of that - some green shoots early. Some of the new innovation like XDR and Secure Access, Multicloud Defense suites are - we're seeing good pipeline build with those technologies. XDR, we now have - we announced that in April last year, we shipped in August. And we have 230 customers, 230-plus customers on the platform today. And the important thing to remember is that it's a big platform play. And we actually typically see that as a 6 to 9-month sales cycle. So to have 230 customers already, I think, is a statement on the value that our customers are seeing. That's going to be a real important integration point with Splunk, by the way. So that we see, we see - we feel good about the pipeline. From a demand perspective, just to give you some insight, the Americas, the demand was almost double digits this past quarter, which is the highest we've seen in a while. So I think we're seeing a lot of good indicators. And if you just watch over the next 6 to 9 months, you're going to see more and more innovation that comes out. And I think you'll begin to believe and see the results around that same time frame. Thanks. I would say on the thing that's changed from last quarter is that we do just see a little more caution with our customers. I don't want to over-rotate and say that it's a massive shift, but we definitely saw more caution. We talked with our sales leaders ahead of the call, and they indicated - we asked them point blank, was there more caution or the same caution from the prior quarter, and we heard more, a little bit more. And then we saw the push out of the forecast. So that just tells us that there is a little bit more in the system. So therefore, I think we need a couple of quarters to see it play out before we can declare what's going to happen in fiscal '25. On the Nvidia discussion, a couple of comments. We talked about the $1 billion of orders, which I know someone is going to ask me about at some point. And what I would say is that in the last 90 days, our pipeline of AI opportunities continue to grow. The pipeline is now almost three times that particular number that we gave last time, which were more orders that we see in '25. The total pipeline is now about three times that, roughly three times that. And I would say that virtually none of that is anything associated with the Nvidia partnership yet. It's all independent of that. Thanks, Ben. So I would say on the HP, Juniper deal, the one area where they have meaningful overlap is in wireless. And I don't know if there's any connection to the fact that we had a 50% increase in $1 million-plus wireless deal sequentially. So it's hard to say. But I mean there is a lot of noise in the system or in the industry about what they do there, but I can't say specifically that any customers have talked to me about it, to be honest. So I think we're - I think it's a little early for them to - for the customers to be expressing that concern. They may be asking them directly, but they're not talking to us. On the timing, yes, I think we said fiscal '25, which starts in August of this year. And I think you probably should assume most of that is probably in the second half, I would guess, but we'll see how things play out. I think customers are going to move as fast as they possibly can, but we're still in the early strategy and planning stages right now on most of it. The pipeline stuff are well-defined use cases that are already in place with certain customers, and we're actually just working through the opportunities. Yes. So I'll take the first, and then Scott can take the second. On the inventory digestion issue, I think it's - I would say it's largely an Enterprise and a Service Provider issue and particularly the cloud providers, we think they've got probably in excess of 20-plus weeks of inventory that they're working through right now as they built up when the lead times were so long. We have a lot of our Enterprise products that are tethered to the cloud for management perspectives. And so we see the lag between when we ship it to the customer and when they connected. I gave the Meraki example in my prepared remarks. And so we do have visibility, and we can actually see on some aspects of the portfolio, how the time frame between shipments and connectivity is shrinking, and it's not shrinking as fast as we thought it would, which leads us to believe this is going to extend through the end of '24, so that's where we are. Scott, gross margins? On the Nvidia front, I think, look, one of the key benefits that they see is leveraging our enterprise go to market, and our global ecosystem and partner community. And therefore, when these solutions are flowing through our channels and our sales teams and our partners, it will be Cisco Ethernet. I'll comment - I'll make one quick comment. I think I said this in my prepared remarks as well. We've deployed a lot of transaction services for some of our larger customers just to help them do that. And I know that our sales teams were talking this week, Scott, maybe you remember or you have some more detail on looking at some partner incentives to help? Yes. I think - thanks for the question, Woo Jin. I think the way to think about it is, we put a - as you can imagine, when you built up the level of annualized recurring revenue that we have, we've put a huge amount of focus on both customer success and driving adoption and then turning that adoption into renewals. We've invested fairly heavily in that space over the last couple of years, and we're seeing renewal rates respond accordingly. When you look at where we're more software-heavy outside of networking, but in both security and collab, as you saw, we reported growth - revenue growth in both of those categories. Observability is almost exclusively software, and we posted 16% revenue growth in observability. So we are seeing that actually trend in the right direction. Yes. Thanks, Tim. So on the margin growth trade-off, we're always considering that. And we're very disciplined, though. And we think that gross margins are clearly a reflection of the value that your customers see and your technology and what you deliver. And if you look at a lot of our competitors, and you look at some of the market share, I mean, some of the gross margins that they have, that tells you that they're viewed more as a commodity. And I think that our customers see real value in what we deliver to them. So while we always look at margins versus growth, we also are - we're just disciplined across both. On the AI front, Silicon One is a big play, clearly. We've delivered next-generation silicon into several of the cloud providers right now. We've got the Ethernet running in three of the four big ones, and we'll use the same silicon in the enterprise data center over time. We've got GPUs in our UCS platforms. And so it's evolving, but we have - I tell our teams unlike the original cloud transition that we talked on this call several times about how we were not prepared for the infrastructure play in the cloud world. I think we are absolutely ready and well equipped to succeed in this transition to AI. It will be a tailwind for us as we get into it over time. So our team measures what their use cases or franchises or however you want to think about it, there are specific areas within the infrastructure that we identify for each of the webscale players. And Scott, keep me honest, I want to say we're designed into '16 or... 21 of those. And so that's how I would think about it. I don't think that right now, if you looked at the growth numbers, they wouldn't be reflective of what's going on because they're just digesting inventory right now. So they're not in a position where they need to order a lot because lead times have normalized so much. So I don't think that's - it's not even relevant. I think understanding those 21 use cases. And as I said earlier, they want dual source, and they want dual source all the way down to the silicon level. In the traditional days with carriers, they wanted two vendors who would provide two different integrated systems. In this case, that may be the case with cloud, but they also look at silicon, they look at components. They're very deep on wanting to make sure that they have resiliency and optionality."

            "name": "Scott Herren",
            "content": "Thanks, Chuck. Our Q2 results reflect solid execution again with strong margins and increasing operating leverage. For the quarter, total revenue was at the high end of our guidance range at $12.8 billion, down 6% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $3.5 billion, down 3%, and non-GAAP earnings per share was above the high end of our guidance range at $0.87, down 1%. Looking at our Q2 revenue in more detail. Total product revenue was $9.2 billion, down 9% and service revenue was $3.6 billion, up 4%. Networking, our largest product category was down 12%. We saw declines across switching, wireless and routed optical networking, driven primarily by weakness in the Enterprise and Service Provider & Cloud markets. Security was up 3% with our Zero Trust offering growing double digits. Collaboration was up 3%, driven by growth in collaboration devices and calling, partially offset by a decline in meetings. Observability was up 16%, driven by growth across the portfolio with continued strength in ThousandEyes network services. As Chuck mentioned, ThousandEyes helps monitor and assure digital experience everywhere, on-premise, Internet and the cloud. We continue to make progress on our transformation to more recurring revenue-based offerings. We saw strong performance in our ARR of $24.7 billion, which increased 6% with product ARR growth of 9%. Total software revenue was flat at $4.2 billion, with software subscription revenue up 5%. 88% of our software revenue was subscription-based. Total subscription revenue increased 6% to $6.4 billion, which now represents 50% of Cisco's total revenue, an increase of 6 percentage points over last year. RPO was $35.7 billion, up 12% year-over-year. Product and service RPO both increased 12%. In total short-term RPO was $17.9 billion, up 6%. Q2 product orders declined 12%, a significant improvement from Q1 as customers continue to work down product shipments from prior quarters. Looking at our geographic segments year-over-year. The Americas was down 10%, EMEA down 8% and APJC was down 27%. In our customer markets, Service Provider & Cloud was down 40%, Enterprise was down 6% and Public Sector was down 5%. Backlog at the end of Q2 has now returned to normal levels. Total non-GAAP gross margin came in at 66.7%, up 280 basis points year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. Product gross margin was 65.2%, up 310 basis points. The improvement was driven primarily by lower freight and component costs and favorable product mix, partially offset by negative impact on pricing. Service gross margin was 70.5%, up 140 basis points. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 33%, up 50 basis points and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Strong non-GAAP gross margin and continued cost management drove the leverage. Further, we are realigning our investments and expenses to reflect the current environment to help maximize long-term value for our shareholders. As part of our announced restructuring plan, we expect to impact approximately 5% of our global workforce with estimated pretax charges of approximately $800 million. Shifting to the balance sheet. We ended Q2 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $25.7 billion. Consistent with our expectations, operating cash flow was $800 million, driven in large part by the timing of federal tax payments and the higher annual payment of the TCJA transition tax. This quarter, we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and $1.3 billion of share repurchases. Year-to-date, we have returned $5.7 billion in value to shareholders, we plan to continue our share repurchases at the current quarterly level throughout fiscal 2024. Increasing shareholder returns through greater operating leverage, maintaining a higher level of annual share repurchases and growing our dividend is consistent with our capital allocation strategy. Given the confidence we have in our business today, we announced we are raising our dividend by $0.01 to $0.40 per quarter. This dividend increase demonstrates our commitment to returning a minimum of 50% of free cash flow annually to our shareholders and our confidence in the strength of our ongoing cash flows. To summarize, we executed well with continued strong margins and increased operating leverage as we help our customers complete record deployments and implementations. We continue to progress our business model shift to more recurring revenue. We are strategically investing in innovation to capitalize on our growth opportunities and are committed to delivering long-term shareholder value. With regard to our proposed acquisition of Splunk, we continue to work through regulatory approvals and closing conditions. And as Chuck mentioned, we're optimistic that it will close ahead of what we had originally anticipated. We have not included any impact from the Splunk acquisition in our forward-looking guidance. Turning to our guidance. As previously mentioned, we have reset our expectations for the second half of the year to account for the caution around macro uncertainty, the continued absorption by our customers of record levels of product shipments they received from us and the weakness of our Service Provider market. For Q3, our guidance is as follows, we expect revenue to be in the range of $12.1 billion to $12.3 billion. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 66% to 67%. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 33.5% to 34.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.84 to $0.86. For fiscal year '24, our guidance is as follows, we expect revenue to be in the range of $51.5 billion to $52.5 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is expected to range from $3.68 to $3.74. In both our Q3 and full year guidance, we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. Sami, let's now move into the Q&A. Yes, David, I'll start and then Chuck, you can chime in on share. The way to think about the 5% to 7%, if you go back to when we gave that metric, you remember, it was in 2021, actually pre all of the supply chain volatility that we've seen. And since then, of course, we've seen the supply chain set in, which caused a spike in product orders and then a subsequent big building up of our backlog as we cleared the backlog, we saw a spike in revenue. And so it's been difficult to look at year-on-year compares as all those dynamics were going on. What we're seeing now is as we've cleared the backlog, and we cleared it very quickly, given the strength of our supply chain team, that bottleneck has just moved downstream. So I don't think you can look at this year's revenue and try to somehow compare it to historical because of all the moving parts underneath the covers. What underpinned that 5% to 7% when we gave it to you was that's the aggregated growth of the TAM of the markets that we play in, right? And so at this point, we still see that as the longer term where we're headed. I think looking at year-on-year growth rates, I don't think you're going to see those growth rates begin to normalize until we work through the inventory that's in the field right now, which is one of the biggest headwinds we've got, right? Then we can get back to regular ordering and then you need to lap that, right? You need to go four quarters out to be able to compare it to a more normalized point. So I think that's the way you need to think about that longer term. But there's no change at this point. We'll update the longer-term model after we finish the acquisition of Splunk and can give you better insight into what we look like as a combined company. Q3, calendar... Yeah. But, Ben, our expectation is the majority of that $1 billion in orders will turn into revenue in our fiscal '25, just to be clear. Yes. What you saw in the quarter is, of course, gross margins continue to show a year-on-year improving trend, roughly flat, as you said, sequentially. There's a couple of dynamics. But to your question on where does this settle in? I think it settles in the range we're in right now in the 66% to 67% range through the end of the year. There's both the things that are happening from a freight and delivery standpoint, freight costs with what's happening in the Red Sea have gone up slightly, and we continue to see a little bit of component pressure, although in the commodity sections, we're seeing some benefit there. The scale of the services ramp up as you - obviously, services revenue trails the product revenue. We had those three really strong quarters of product revenue growth. We're seeing the tail of that now in our services revenue growth. And since a lot of the cost underneath our services are fixed, you get better leverage when that happens. So I think when you add all those together, we should settle in, in the 66% to 67% range. And the majority of, if not all of the supply chain constraints that we felt are behind us at this point. Michael, on the midpoint of the revenue guide, the math would lead you to what you just said. I think no one ever wants to have to reset guidance, much less have to do it twice. As Chuck just said, as we look at all the various factors coming in from the field, we see caution. And I think you should expect that there's caution in our guide at this point. Yes. We absolutely are working with the field on that. In a lot of cases, it boils down to a lack of the skilled resources required at both - sometimes at our partner level, sometimes at the customer level to get that done. There's only so much you can do to accelerate it. We have put in place incentives to make that accelerate. To your other point on cancellations or stock rotation, we're seeing those continuing to be well below where they were pre-pandemic. So we're not seeing any of that - any pressure on that front. Aaron, the only thing I'd add is - and we said it earlier, there's no question that over time, given the way we're positioned, both from a complete box, a white box and a silicon standpoint, there's no question that AI is a tailwind for us longer term. Yes. On the price declines, you got to remember, go back to why we put the price increases in to begin with. And that was really to offset the higher cost that we were seeing from many of our suppliers as everyone was dealing with constraints and supply demand is pretty straightforward. What we haven't seen in the wake of this, some of the commodities, the prices have come down, memory is a good example. But we haven't seen broadly is cost decreases coming in from our providers at this point. And so with that - and you see that reflected in our gross margins, which have returned to a more normal range, but are still sitting in that 66% to 67% range. So I'm not anticipating at this point, price declines pending significant cost declines coming into us. On the cost savings, you can see where we are year-to-date. We've got - if you just look at operating expenses for a minute, year-to-date, operating expenses are modestly up. And after working our way through the restructuring that we discussed today, for the full year, we think they'll be modestly down. So I think that's probably the right way to think about it as you're looking to build your model."

        "content": "Operator: Welcome to Cisco's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. At the request of Cisco, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect. Now, I would like to introduce Sami Badri, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\nSami Badri: Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's first quarter fiscal year '24 quarterly conference call. This is Sami Badri, Cisco's new Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO; and Scott Herren, our CFO. Having followed Cisco on the sell-side for 10 years, I couldn't be more excited to join the company and look forward to engaging with you all in my new role. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. As a reminder, we have simplified how we report product and service revenue and customer markets. Starting this quarter, we are reporting revenue in the following five categories: networking, security, collaboration, observability, and services. And we are reporting customer markets in the following three categories: enterprise, public sector, and service provider and cloud. Also, as is customary in Q1, we have made certain reclassifications to prior period amounts to conform to the current period's presentation. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the second quarter and full year of fiscal 2024. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on forms 10-K which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. I will now turn it over to Chuck.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Sami, and welcome to Cisco. I hope everyone is doing well, and thanks for joining us today. We delivered a solid start to fiscal 2024, with the strongest first quarter results in Cisco's history in terms of revenue and profitability. Our Q1 revenue was at the upper end of our guided range. EPS exceeded the high end of our guidance, driven by strength in gross margins and expense control, resulting in strong operating leverage. Our disciplined expense management and the tailwinds from our business model transformation resulted in our highest non-GAAP gross margin in over 17 years and record non-GAAP operating margin. We also returned $2.8 billion in Q1 via cash dividends and share repurchases, delivering on our capital return commitments to our shareholders. As we continue to transform our business towards more software and recurring revenue streams, fueled by accelerated innovation, we remain committed to driving operating leverage and shareholder returns. Now turning to the demand environment, after three quarters of exceptionally strong product delivery, our customers are now focused on installing and implementing these unprecedented levels of products. The bottleneck that we previously saw in the supply chain has now shifted downstream to implementation by our customers and partners. Our order lead times and backlog have largely returned to normal levels. As deliveries rose, the channel inventory we track at our distributors also steadily declined during this time. Simply put, customers are now taking time to onboard and deploy these heightened product deliveries. While the macro challenges we have discussed still exist, we believe this implementation phase is the primary reason for the slowdown in new orders. We saw it mostly with our larger enterprise, service provider, and cloud customers, and it was most pronounced in October. Based on our analysis, we believe this phase is temporary and estimate there is an additional one quarter to two quarters worth of shipped orders in customers' hands, still waiting to be deployed. This has near-term consequences for revenue and our outlook for the next couple of quarters, which Scott will discuss shortly. However, it does not change our longer-term confidence. We expect product order growth rates to increase in the second half of the fiscal year. We also remain very confident in the foundational strength of our business and future growth opportunities given the criticality of our technologies. Overall, our win rates are stable, cancellation and return rates remain below pre-pandemic levels, and we have gained market share, all of which are testaments to the strength of our portfolio and how it aligns to our customers' most pressing needs. As we look to enhance our capabilities in higher growth areas, in the first quarter of fiscal '24, we announced our intent to acquire Splunk. The combination of Cisco and Splunk will create an end-to-end data platform to enhance our customers' digital resiliency with our complementary capabilities in AI, security, and observability. The combination of Cisco and Splunk also directly supports our strategic objectives around driving higher levels of growth, software capabilities, and ARR. Together, we will bring trusted innovation leadership and outstanding go-to-market engine and a world-class culture that will help our customers achieve their technology outcomes with innovative products and solutions. Now, let me comment on our quarterly performance. As I previously mentioned, we delivered strong revenues in Q1, which was broad-based across our product portfolio and driven by our customers' investments in generative AI, cloud, security and full stack observability. As expected, we continued to gain market share with the release of the calendar Q2 results, recording another quarter of year-over-year gains in three of our largest networking markets: campus switching, wireless LAN and SP routing. In webscale, we see continued momentum in AI, with three of the top four customers deploying our hyperscale ethernet AI fabric. We also already have line of sight to over $1 billion in orders for AI infrastructure from major cloud providers in fiscal year '25. To help advance AI, we are working with key GPU and storage partners to create solutions including ethernet technologies, GPU-enabled infrastructure, and joint tested and validated reference architectures with a commitment to open networking for AI. Collectively, we believe there is a great opportunity for a broad set of innovations and compute GPU networking software and services to support core and edge AI infrastructure. According to the 650 Group, the AI switching market is forecasted to exceed $10 billion in 2027. Our scalable fabric for AI, coupled with a proven power saving capabilities of Cisco Silicon One put us in a strong position to build-out the infrastructure needed for AI clusters and we are laser-focused on winning in this space. Moving to Security, we continue to execute against our product roadmap and strengthen our unified security platform. Since our Cisco XDR solution became available this summer, we have added recovery to the response process giving security teams the ability to snapshot and restore their business critical data at the first sign of a ransomware attack. With our three new offers around XDR, Cisco Secure Access and Multicloud Defense, we already have over $500 million in the pipeline across over 1,000 customers. We also launched our new Cisco security firewall solution this quarter. We are actively engaged in competitive sales with all these products and expect to see meaningful positive results in the coming quarters. In our Collaboration portfolio, we recently introduced a range of truly game changing AI capabilities, spanning the entire Webex suite as well as new devices for reimagined workspaces at our WebexOne event. Before I turn it over to Scott, let me briefly summarize three key takeaways. First, as we consider where we're at today, the primary issue with demand is that customers are taking time to onboard and deploy heightened product deliveries. While we were not immune to the macro, we believe this is temporary as our customers and partners continue to tell us that our portfolio is stronger than ever and we have continued to see share gains in key markets. Second, we remain confident in our future, with the incremental multi-billion dollar AI infrastructure opportunity, the increasing criticality of security and observability, and what we believe Cisco and Splunk can do together for our customers is truly exciting. Lastly, you can always count on us to take a disciplined approach, regardless of the environment. We remain committed to operating leverage, capital allocation, and expense management. I'll now turn it over to Scott to provide more detail on the quarter and our outlook.\nScott Herren: Thanks, Chuck. We delivered solid results in Q1, driven by the prior strategic actions we took to mitigate the supply chain constraints. For the quarter, we reported strong revenue growth and a record non-GAAP operating margin. Total revenue was $14.7 billion, up 8% year-over-year, at the high end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP net income was $4.5 billion, up 28%. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.11, up 29%, exceeding the high-end of our guidance range. Looking at our Q1 revenue in more detail, total product revenue was $11.1 billion, up 9%; and service revenue was $3.5 billion, up 4%. Networking, our largest product category, drove the increase with 10% growth. Within networking, the growth was driven by switching, where campus and datacenter were both up double-digits on the strength of our Catalyst 9000 and Nexus 9000 offerings. This was partially offset by a decline in wireless. Security was up 4%, driven by our Zero Trust and threat intelligence, detection and response offerings. Collaboration was up 3% driven by growth in Calling and Contact Center, partially offset by a decline in Meetings. Observability was up 21%, driven by growth across the portfolio, including double-digit growth in ThousandEyes and AppDynamics. We continue to make progress in our transformation to more recurring revenue based offerings. We saw solid performance in our ARR of $24.5 billion, which increased 5% with product ARR growth of 10%. Total software revenue was $4.4 billion, a 13% increase with software subscription revenue also up 13%. 85% of our software revenue was subscription-based. Total subscription revenue increased 10% to $6.5 billion, which represents 44% of Cisco's total revenue, an increase of 1 percentage point over last year. RPO was $34.8 billion, up 12% year-over-year. Product RPO increased 14% and service RPO increased 11%. In total, short-term RPO was up 8% to $17.6 billion. Looking at our product orders by geographic segment, year-over-year, overall product orders declined 20% with the Americas down 19%, EMEA down 13% and APJC down 38%. In our customer markets, Service Provider & Cloud was down 38%, Enterprise was down 26%, and Public Sector was up slightly at 2%. Total non-GAAP gross margin came in at 67.1%, up 410 basis points year-over-year and 110 basis points above the high-end of our guidance range. Product gross margin was 66.5%, up 550 basis points. The increase was driven primarily by productivity improvements, with lower freight, logistics, and component costs. Favorable mix and positive pricing also contributed to the year-over-year improvement. Services non-GAAP gross margin was 69%, up slightly. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 36.6%, up 480 basis points and exceeding the high-end of our guidance range. This improved leverage was driven by both our strong non-GAAP gross margin and ongoing disciplined cost management. Shifting to the balance sheet, we ended Q1 with total cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $23.5 billion. We had operating cash flow for the quarter of $2.4 billion, down 40% primarily due to the $2.8 billion tax payment related to prior quarters, which was associated with the IRS tax relief due to the California floods. This quarter we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders, comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and $1.3 billion of share repurchases. Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we are committed to increasing shareholder returns through greater operating leverage, maintaining a higher level of annual share repurchases, and growing our dividend. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. During Q1, we announced our intent to acquire Splunk, which we expect to close by the end of the third quarter of calendar year 2024, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, including approval by Splunk shareholders. In Q1, we also closed several acquisitions, all of which are highly complementary to our internal R&D in line with our strategy to strengthen our position in cloud, security, observability and AI with targeted strategic M&A. To summarize, we delivered a solid quarter highlighted by topline growth and increased operating leverage that resulted in stronger than anticipated earnings per share. We continue to make progress in our business model shift to more recurring revenue. We remain focused on disciplined expense management without losing sight of the strategic investments necessary to innovate and capitalize on growth opportunities. Turning to our financial guidance, as Chuck outlined, the bottleneck that we previously saw in the supply chain has now shifted downstream to implementation by our customers and partners. Most of the supply chain constraints are now behind us and both shipment lead times and backlog have largely returned to normal levels. Q1 product orders declined 20% as our largest customers are implementing elevated levels of product shipments from prior quarters as we delivered orders from our historically high backlog levels. As Chuck mentioned, we believe there are one quarter to two quarters worth of shipped orders awaiting implementation by our customers. Our revenue guidance assumes, one quarter to two quarters of lower revenue and then a return to more typical sequential growth rates. Consequently, for Q2, we expect revenue to be in the range of $12.6 billion to $12.8 billion. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 65% to 66%. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 31.5% to 32.5%. And non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.82 to $0.84. For fiscal year 2024, our guidance is updated as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $53.8 billion to $55 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $3.87 to $3.93. In both our Q2 and full year guidance, we are assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. I'd like to thank our teams for their focus and execution this quarter. We remain confident in the strength of the business and our ability to capitalize on the key growth opportunities ahead. I'll now turn it back to Sami, so we can move into the Q&A.\nSami Badri: Thanks, Scott. Michelle, let's go ahead and queue-up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Tal Liani with Bank of America. You may go ahead, sir.\nSami Badri: Tal, you there?\nTal Liani: Yes. Sorry. I was on mute. Now you can hear me. What is your assumption on the growth seasonality after the next quarter? Are we back in your assumptions to normal seasonality? Or do you expect kind of different seasonality than previous years?\nChuck Robbins: Yes, Tal, it's a great question. As I said in -- well, we talked about one quarter to two quarters of basically inventory, but shipped product that's at our customers, it's not yet been installed. I expect the impact to be greatest in Q2 and in Q3. But when you look at the order growth, we do see a return to order growth in the second-half of the year, both sequentially and year-on year as we get there.\nTal Liani: So in terms of revenue recognition, you expect 3Q to -- the 2Q to 3Q sequentials, that's -- that was my question. Do you expect 3Q to be weaker than previous seasonality? Or do you expect it to be the same as previous seasonality? Or even sequentially?\nChuck Robbins: No, from a revenue standpoint, we don't guide bookings, Tal, but from a revenue standpoint, I do see sequential increase, Q2 to Q3.\nTal Liani: Okay. Thank you.\nSami Badri: All right. Thank you, Tal.\nChuck Robbins: Thank you, Tal.\nSami Badri: Michelle, next question.\nOperator: Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley Investment Research. You may go ahead.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks so much. Maybe just a question on, if you see the investment categories kind of changing maybe free, the orders that you've seen, and then when do you see them come back in a couple of quarters. I guess, I'm just trying to get a sense of have much of the orders we've seen over the last year been catch-up investments like campus and data center? And then areas of investment will change as we come back or is this really just inventory digestion and the investment categories and kind of investment prioritization will stay the same with customers? Thanks.\nChuck Robbins: Yes, Meta, thanks for the question. I think your latter comment is probably the closest to the truth. We don't anticipate a big difference. Although, I think with the improvements that we've seen in our portfolio and security, we should see security accelerate. Obviously, we'll continue to update you on the AI opportunity that's out there. We think that's going to continue to be a driver over the next couple of years. But in general, I think it will look more normal once we get through this.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thank you.\nSami Badri: Thank you, Meta. Michelle, next question.\nOperator: Amit Daryanani with Evercore. You may go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, Chuck, one of the things I think folks will struggle to understand is the conviction you have that this is an implementation pause and not a macro demand-centric weakness. So I'd love to just understand whatever you can talk about it and why you're so convinced this is a one-quarter to two-quarter implementation rather than enterprise demand is just getting weaker. Anything on that front would be helpful? And then, I just want to clarify the spot. You folks had $1 billion in AI orders that's two times the number you gave last time is that correct? Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Yes. Amit, thank you. So if you'll be patient with me, I'll give you a few data points and some context around why we think this -- this is a -- an inventory issue that's sitting with our customers. First of all, our customers and our sales organizations have been very clear with us over the last 90-days that this is the issue, particularly our large enterprise and our large -- and our service providers. We talked about that with the service providers prior, but it shifted into the enterprise space in a big way. The other thing is, we had our Partner Summit last week and some of our largest partners unsolicited began their conversations with me by talking about this very issue, which candidly I knew the customers had talked about it and our sales teams had talked about it. I was actually surprised to hear. It's so consistently at that Partner Summit. So, that's sort of the subjective view and then we've done some analysis and there's three things I'd point out. The first is, in certain parts of our portfolio, we actually can -- we can see the timeframe from shipment of a product until the product begins to connect to the cloud, back to the cloud like Meraki/And what we've seen is a one-quarter to two-quarter delay versus what historically you would see when these products get shipped, how long it takes for them to be activated and connect to the Meraki cloud. So that's the first piece. The second is, we had a very strong quarter in federal, U.S. federal, from an orders perspective. And so, we looked into why big customer like the U.S. government, Department of Defense, would not have the same issue. And the reality is, is that they have special clauses in their contracts that give them most favored nation status when we're actually making shipment decisions, and certainly with the Department of Defense, we prioritize them during the supply chain crisis. So they never had a big influx, they had a very steady flow of products across, which explains why their order numbers look fairly normal. The third point I'd say is that we noticed a serious uptick in Q1 in our Transactional Advanced Services, which is loosely translated to be implementation services, where that grew almost 20% and the forecast for Q2 is almost double-digits again. So it's clear that customers are asking us to come help them get this done. And I'll give you one final subjective data point and then I'll talk about the AI stuff. We had one big partner tell us that they will have literally hired 200 people in the last 90-days, solely focused on implementing technology for their customers. So there is just so many things that we've learned over the last 90-days. Clearly, this surprised us. But I think we feel pretty good right now. I'll make a comment about why I don't think it's macro, candidly it might have been easier for me to say it was macro. But as we've discussed prior, we have -- the traditional service provider has been tough and it remains that way. We've talked about elongated sales cycle, they remain. We've talked about, in some cases, the need for extra signatures, which is pretty normal, that's remained. But we didn't see it get materially worse in the quarter. And so all of that -- and I'm sorry for the long answer, but I wanted to be thorough, all of that is really what led us to believe this -- that this is a consumption issue with our customers. So I'm going to pause there, and then I'm going to answer your AI question. What we gave last time was orders to-date. We have taken orders for over $500 million. For infrastructure to support AI networks, AI GPUs inside the cloud players. Then -- and I'll talk a little bit more about that in a moment. The numbers that we gave today is a forward-looking set of numbers. Let's say, in fiscal year \u201825, which is when we said, we believe that the broad ethernet build-out would occur underneath GPUs. We have already seen -- we have line of sight to $1 billion plus of orders that our teams feel pretty good that we're going to get and/or we've been designed in already. So that's just sort of a forward-looking set of orders that we've identified for fiscal \u201825, okay. I will also just cover real quickly, we are now -- we now have our ethernet fabric deployed underneath GPUs in three of the four Hyperscalers, major Hyperscalers in the United States. We also are working very closely with AMD, Intel and NVIDIA, to create solutions including ethernet technology's GPU-enabled infrastructure joint -- jointly tested and validated reference architectures. And I will say even this week, yesterday, Jensen from NVIDIA and four of his -- four, five of his executives came over to see us and we spent 90 minutes together with my executive team. And we believe we have a great opportunity to actually build some integrated solutions between our technology and their technology to actually take to the enterprise. So we're beginning to see the use cases in the enterprise evolve. And we think that partnership with NVIDIA, in that case, with our underlying technology and our strength of go to market, we think will be a winning combination. So we're working on that as well. So there's a lot going on in the AI space.\nSami Badri: All right. Thank you, Amit. Michelle, next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Simon Leopold with Raymond James. You may go ahead.\nSimon Leopold: Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if maybe you'd be willing to unpack the networking segment a little bit in terms of the trends. And really what I'm trying to get at is, understand sort of what's doing better, what's doing worse, and in that I suspect it's datacenter bounced us pretty good whereas maybe campus is a bit weaker and declining. And that hopefully during this transition to the new segmentation, if you could give us a little bit more color within networking? Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Hey, Simon, thanks for that. I would say the bigger variance that we're seeing, I mean, right now, obviously the demand signal is little bit tough because of the amount of inventory that's out in the field and that we have normalized lead times at this point. We knew that would happen sometime in the first half. That's now happened. Our lead times are back to where they were pre-pandemic. And our backlog has shipped. The supply chain team has done a terrific job getting product out the door. That's what's kind of moved the bottleneck from our level down to our customers' level. But when you start to unpack within networking, we're not seeing at this point, a huge difference between, for example, datacenter or campus networking. But what we are seeing is a little more field-based inventory on wireless access points. That's been slightly slower than what we've seen. It just because of the amount of product that's been shipped out than what we've seen in the rest of the networking.\nSimon Leopold: Thank you very much.\nSami Badri: All right. Thank you, Simon.\nChuck Robbins: Yes. Thanks, Simon.\nSami Badri: All right. Michelle, next question.\nOperator: Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. You may go ahead, sir.\nBen Reitzes: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to ask about your share repurchase cadence. Stock obviously could get hit here. We have been talking about $5 billion in buybacks or so for the year. I know some of that stops that dilution. If you guys are confident in the second half pickup, is there any potential that you would be more aggressive in the upcoming quarter? And how are you thinking about share repo this year, given current dynamics with the Splunk deal coming? Thanks.\nChuck Robbins: Yes, Ben, as we said on the Splunk transaction, it's going to be outside of the transactional costs. It's going to be cash flow positive from the first year forward. So the Splunk transaction is not, in any way, having an effect on our capital return, either through the dividend or through the -- through share buybacks. We expect to continue that higher level and consistent higher level of share buybacks, and to continue to show increases in our dividend. We also will obviously look at the opportunity -- at the chance to be opportunistic on the share buyback. I'm not going to commit to that at this moment, but that is something that we will obviously take a look at.\nSami Badri: All right. Thank you, Ben.\nBen Reitzes: Thank you.\nSami Badri: All right. Michelle, next question.\nOperator: Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, if I can just clarify one thing first. I think, Chuck, in your prepared remarks, you did say, you saw the more pronounced impact on the orders in the month of October. I think that's what I heard you say. I mean, just curious, are you implying that you did see an improvement in orders in the sort of first couple of weeks of November itself and that's maybe part of your confidence in that? It's a bit more temporary than a longer pause from the customers? And then you did mention large partners really being the ones that are facing this sort of inventory installation problem. What gives you sort of color that SMB, the smaller customers sort of not going to face the similar issue or are you also baking that in, in terms of your sort of next couple of quarters of headwinds that you're thinking about on the revenue side? Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Samik. I think my point with October was that if you go back to the end of Q4, we talked about on the last call that we had a fair amount of momentum as we exited the quarter, which is one of the reasons we didn't expect to see this. And we had our normal year-end sales, moving accounts around, moving territories around, and getting sort of the sales start-up process that happens in the first say six weeks of the fiscal year, which we went through. So what we tend to look for is the middle of the quarter. And then into October is when we expect to see, the actual quarter materialize and everything kind of come together, and it just didn't. And that's what -- that was the comment about that it was primarily -- we really -- it was really clear to us in October that -- that this was going to be the situation. Relative to they\u2019re the ones who are having the consumption issue because they have the most inventory. You asked how we -- what confidence we have if it's not SMB, if you look at orders, we look at -- we look at a sub-segmentation within enterprise now, and within service provider, etc., and SMB was fine. And in fact, the smaller the customer we had, the better their order performance for us in the quarter was. So it just follow the trend that the consumption issue was upmarket and small to mid-sized customers didn't feel it.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay. Thank you.\nSami Badri: All right. Thank you, Samik. Michelle, next question.\nOperator: David Vogt with UBS. You may go ahead, sir.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thanks, guys, for taking my question. Scott, maybe this is for you. I just want to unpack maybe one of the comments that you made. And I know you don't guide to orders. But I think in your prepared remarks, you said backlog is back at normal levels at the end of the quarter. So, we do assume that the guide for Q2 and the rest of the year doesn't include backlog conversion into revenue? And then, if that's the case, to your comment about orders accelerating in the second half, I know you don't guide specifically to orders, but you did make a comment that revenue is going be up, I think, sequentially in the third quarter year-over-year and in the fourth quarter sequentially and year-over-year. Doesn't that suggest like a pretty steep order acceleration, not just an acceleration, but significant positive order trajectory in the fourth quarter and the third quarter? I know, it's easy comps. But just some more color there would be helpful. Thanks.\nScott Herren: Yes. Yes, David, we did say that. I do. We are expecting sequential improvement in the second half of the year in both Q3 and in Q4. And in both -- and again, we don't guide this, but in both orders and revenue as you'd expect. Backlog is normalized at this point. We knew that would happen in the first half. I think supply chain team did a great job getting those orders in the hands of our customers. We would now need them to implement them, but we've got the orders in the hands of our customers. So we do see sequential increases. And as you said, as you noted from a bookings standpoint, our order standpoint, the second half has easier compare points. Obviously, the reverse is true on revenue and the second half revenue will have very difficult compare points than last year.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thank you.\nSami Badri: All right. Thank you, David. Michelle, next question.\nOperator: Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead.\nMatt Niknam: Hey, guys, thank you for taking the question. Maybe just to dovetail one follow-up to the prior question, I have just another one on margins. Just on the prior one, is the expectation for a second-half improvement in a one-quarter to two-quarter digestion, does that vary at all across the three different customer sets you outlined? And then just on the margins, 36.6% on op income margins this quarter, I think the guide implies a 400 basis point to 500 basis point dip. Is that due to just the sheer revenue decline sequentially? Or are there other cost items we should consider on either the gross margin or OI margin line? Thanks.\nScott Herren: Yes. To your second question, it is just based on how the revenues are flowing through the second half of the year. I think gross margins, we've said will settle in somewhere in this 65% to 66% range. I think at this point, it looks like it will be closer to the higher end of that range for the second part of the year. So that's the way I see the year flowing out. Remind me, Matt, what was the first part of your question.\nMatt Niknam: Just around the expectation for second-half improvement in orders one quarter to two quarters worth of installation, is that broad across the three customer sets? Or does it vary across service provider, enterprise and federal?\nScott Herren: Yes, right. I think, we expect -- I certainly would expect service provider to continue to be difficult through the second-half of the year. Within service provider, we've got both telco and cable, which has one set of market dynamics going on. I think that will be -- continue to be a difficult space. On the other side, we have web scale, and we do see the web scale orders while they've got also inventory to work their way through. We do see line of sight to them beginning to increase their orders again in the second half of the year. So, SP is a bit of a mixed bag, but I think it will continue to have probably the greater impact.\nMatt Niknam: Thank you.\nSami Badri: All right. Thank you, Matt. Michelle, next question.\nOperator: George Notter with Jefferies. You may go ahead.\nGeorge Notter: Hi. Thanks a lot, guys. Just continuing on, on that last question. If I look around the space, companies have been dealing with excess inventories for really three quarters now. And I guess, I'm just curious why is this now becoming more evident at Cisco versus a few quarters ago? And then also you mentioned that the issue is spreading more to enterprises. We don't typically think about enterprises is inventorying infrastructure. So I guess, the question for you is, has something changed there or is this more distribution channel inventory? Any insight would be great. Thanks.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, George. I think that the reason it's become relevant now is because if -- I mean, we really unloaded our backlog in the last six months. I mean -- and it was billions of dollars more than what we would normally ship to customers during that time period. So they -- I think it's just -- and we know that the cloud providers, as an example, had been buying ahead and they had been doing it for sure to your point. And all along, we have very sequenced purchasing cycles with those players. So we kind of know when they are going to start placing their next orders. I think on the enterprise, we're talking about the top 200 customers, right. These are the big customers who actually -- if they're doing a refresh of their infrastructure, they might order 400, 500 switches, as an example. Or they may be doing a branch rollout. And in some cases, to your point, it could be sitting with them or they could have a partner who's doing the staging, and the partner may be backed up with resources to try to get the staging done. So it varies, but it could be a -- either one of those or a combination of both.\nScott Herren: And George, just to put some data to that. And you have this data, but I'll repeat it. Our revenue growth, obviously, the quarter we're announcing now, product revenue growth was 9%. But if you go back to Q4, product revenue growth was 20%. And in Q3, it was 17%. So obviously, we get revenue when we can complete a shipment and get it out the door. It gives you a sense of just how much has been pushed out and as Chuck said in the last two or three quarters.\nGeorge Notter: Alright. Thank you.\nSami Badri: Thank you, George. And then Michelle, we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead.\nMichael Ng: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for the question. I just have two. First, on the AI orders, $1 billion. What's the feedback from the hyperscalers on your improving position with these customers relative to a few years ago? Is it selling in a more disaggregated fashion with Silicon One? Is it a desire for silicon diversification? And then the second question just as a follow-up on the order slowdown. Was that more concentrated in the campus with wireless LAN and wired or data center or both, just within enterprise specifically?\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Michael. On the AI question relative to the cloud players, I think that -- look, I think early on, we regained our footing there because we listened and we showed flexibility with our willingness to disaggregate if they wanted to do so. And we're in -- I can't even remember, but numerous use cases across the large web scale players. And I think we added over 10 new use cases last quarter alone, where we had been designed in. And I think it's -- so I think that the disaggregation and the flexibility and us listening to them and understanding what they wanted was the reason that we got back in. And now the feedback is as long as we're performing, I think they like our products, they like the power savings of Silicon One. It's a massive power -- lower -- massively lower power consumption. I think they do like silicon diversity for sure. And then as you look at the AI infrastructure that's currently primarily being supported via InfiniBand, they just want to move to more of a standard broad-based technology like Ethernet that they can actually have multiple sources. And so we think that's what's driving that now. And now it's just about performing and executing and delivering on what we tell them we're going to do. Scott, do you want to take the second?\nScott Herren: Yes. Michael, I think I touched on this earlier in the -- as the question came up. I think the way to think about it is, first of all, if you're trying to generalize the trend more broadly across the industry, it may be a little difficult because we've cleared our backlog, I think, significantly faster than others have. But where we saw a differentiation was less between big data center infrastructure and campus networking and more between networking and wireless. We did see -- because we've shipped an enormous amount of wireless access points out. We did see that take a little bit more of an impact just because it's -- our customers are sitting on more inventory on hand of that, that they're looking to get installed.\nMichael Ng: Great. Thank you, Chuck. Thank you, Scott.\nChuck Robbins: Thank you.\nSami Badri: All right. Thank you, Michael, and all right. So we'll go ahead and turn it over to you, Chuck, for some closing remarks.\nChuck Robbins: Yes. Thank you, Sami, and welcome again. Listen, we're proud of the team for the performance in Q1. Obviously, a very solid quarter with the exception of this demand issue that we talked about. We'll always try to be transparent with you and share with you exactly what we're seeing. We know what's going on. We're on top of it, and we do feel that it's temporary. At the same time, we're very confident in our opportunities long term. We're confident in the AI opportunity. We're very encouraged by our improving position in security, observability. And we're also very encouraged by the opportunities that will come with the Splunk acquisition. I think many of you know that on Monday night, the waiting period for review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act in the U.S. expired, meaning that we've effectively pass the antitrust review period in the United States. We're excited about that. At our Partner Summit last night -- or last week, the feedback on our portfolio right now was probably as good as it's been in a long time. And I also just want to reiterate our commitment to delivering value to you and our shareholders with the operating leverage, capital allocation and obviously managing our expenses in times when we see challenges like we have right now. So thank you for joining us today, and I'll turn it back over to Sami.\nSami Badri: Cisco's next quarterly call, which will reflect our fiscal year 2024 second quarter results, will be on Wednesday, February 14, 2024 and at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time, 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time. This concludes today's call. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact the Cisco Investor Relations department, and we thank you very much for joining the call today.\nOperator: And thank you for participating on today's conference call. If you would like to listen to the call in its entirety, you may call 1 (800) 834-5839. For participants dialing from outside the U.S., please dial (203) 369-3351. This concludes today's call. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "Chuck Robbins",
            "content": "Thanks, Sami, and welcome to Cisco. I hope everyone is doing well, and thanks for joining us today. We delivered a solid start to fiscal 2024, with the strongest first quarter results in Cisco's history in terms of revenue and profitability. Our Q1 revenue was at the upper end of our guided range. EPS exceeded the high end of our guidance, driven by strength in gross margins and expense control, resulting in strong operating leverage. Our disciplined expense management and the tailwinds from our business model transformation resulted in our highest non-GAAP gross margin in over 17 years and record non-GAAP operating margin. We also returned $2.8 billion in Q1 via cash dividends and share repurchases, delivering on our capital return commitments to our shareholders. As we continue to transform our business towards more software and recurring revenue streams, fueled by accelerated innovation, we remain committed to driving operating leverage and shareholder returns. Now turning to the demand environment, after three quarters of exceptionally strong product delivery, our customers are now focused on installing and implementing these unprecedented levels of products. The bottleneck that we previously saw in the supply chain has now shifted downstream to implementation by our customers and partners. Our order lead times and backlog have largely returned to normal levels. As deliveries rose, the channel inventory we track at our distributors also steadily declined during this time. Simply put, customers are now taking time to onboard and deploy these heightened product deliveries. While the macro challenges we have discussed still exist, we believe this implementation phase is the primary reason for the slowdown in new orders. We saw it mostly with our larger enterprise, service provider, and cloud customers, and it was most pronounced in October. Based on our analysis, we believe this phase is temporary and estimate there is an additional one quarter to two quarters worth of shipped orders in customers' hands, still waiting to be deployed. This has near-term consequences for revenue and our outlook for the next couple of quarters, which Scott will discuss shortly. However, it does not change our longer-term confidence. We expect product order growth rates to increase in the second half of the fiscal year. We also remain very confident in the foundational strength of our business and future growth opportunities given the criticality of our technologies. Overall, our win rates are stable, cancellation and return rates remain below pre-pandemic levels, and we have gained market share, all of which are testaments to the strength of our portfolio and how it aligns to our customers' most pressing needs. As we look to enhance our capabilities in higher growth areas, in the first quarter of fiscal '24, we announced our intent to acquire Splunk. The combination of Cisco and Splunk will create an end-to-end data platform to enhance our customers' digital resiliency with our complementary capabilities in AI, security, and observability. The combination of Cisco and Splunk also directly supports our strategic objectives around driving higher levels of growth, software capabilities, and ARR. Together, we will bring trusted innovation leadership and outstanding go-to-market engine and a world-class culture that will help our customers achieve their technology outcomes with innovative products and solutions. Now, let me comment on our quarterly performance. As I previously mentioned, we delivered strong revenues in Q1, which was broad-based across our product portfolio and driven by our customers' investments in generative AI, cloud, security and full stack observability. As expected, we continued to gain market share with the release of the calendar Q2 results, recording another quarter of year-over-year gains in three of our largest networking markets: campus switching, wireless LAN and SP routing. In webscale, we see continued momentum in AI, with three of the top four customers deploying our hyperscale ethernet AI fabric. We also already have line of sight to over $1 billion in orders for AI infrastructure from major cloud providers in fiscal year '25. To help advance AI, we are working with key GPU and storage partners to create solutions including ethernet technologies, GPU-enabled infrastructure, and joint tested and validated reference architectures with a commitment to open networking for AI. Collectively, we believe there is a great opportunity for a broad set of innovations and compute GPU networking software and services to support core and edge AI infrastructure. According to the 650 Group, the AI switching market is forecasted to exceed $10 billion in 2027. Our scalable fabric for AI, coupled with a proven power saving capabilities of Cisco Silicon One put us in a strong position to build-out the infrastructure needed for AI clusters and we are laser-focused on winning in this space. Moving to Security, we continue to execute against our product roadmap and strengthen our unified security platform. Since our Cisco XDR solution became available this summer, we have added recovery to the response process giving security teams the ability to snapshot and restore their business critical data at the first sign of a ransomware attack. With our three new offers around XDR, Cisco Secure Access and Multicloud Defense, we already have over $500 million in the pipeline across over 1,000 customers. We also launched our new Cisco security firewall solution this quarter. We are actively engaged in competitive sales with all these products and expect to see meaningful positive results in the coming quarters. In our Collaboration portfolio, we recently introduced a range of truly game changing AI capabilities, spanning the entire Webex suite as well as new devices for reimagined workspaces at our WebexOne event. Before I turn it over to Scott, let me briefly summarize three key takeaways. First, as we consider where we're at today, the primary issue with demand is that customers are taking time to onboard and deploy heightened product deliveries. While we were not immune to the macro, we believe this is temporary as our customers and partners continue to tell us that our portfolio is stronger than ever and we have continued to see share gains in key markets. Second, we remain confident in our future, with the incremental multi-billion dollar AI infrastructure opportunity, the increasing criticality of security and observability, and what we believe Cisco and Splunk can do together for our customers is truly exciting. Lastly, you can always count on us to take a disciplined approach, regardless of the environment. We remain committed to operating leverage, capital allocation, and expense management. I'll now turn it over to Scott to provide more detail on the quarter and our outlook. Yes, Tal, it's a great question. As I said in -- well, we talked about one quarter to two quarters of basically inventory, but shipped product that's at our customers, it's not yet been installed. I expect the impact to be greatest in Q2 and in Q3. But when you look at the order growth, we do see a return to order growth in the second-half of the year, both sequentially and year-on year as we get there. No, from a revenue standpoint, we don't guide bookings, Tal, but from a revenue standpoint, I do see sequential increase, Q2 to Q3. Thank you, Tal. Yes, Meta, thanks for the question. I think your latter comment is probably the closest to the truth. We don't anticipate a big difference. Although, I think with the improvements that we've seen in our portfolio and security, we should see security accelerate. Obviously, we'll continue to update you on the AI opportunity that's out there. We think that's going to continue to be a driver over the next couple of years. But in general, I think it will look more normal once we get through this. Yes. Amit, thank you. So if you'll be patient with me, I'll give you a few data points and some context around why we think this -- this is a -- an inventory issue that's sitting with our customers. First of all, our customers and our sales organizations have been very clear with us over the last 90-days that this is the issue, particularly our large enterprise and our large -- and our service providers. We talked about that with the service providers prior, but it shifted into the enterprise space in a big way. The other thing is, we had our Partner Summit last week and some of our largest partners unsolicited began their conversations with me by talking about this very issue, which candidly I knew the customers had talked about it and our sales teams had talked about it. I was actually surprised to hear. It's so consistently at that Partner Summit. So, that's sort of the subjective view and then we've done some analysis and there's three things I'd point out. The first is, in certain parts of our portfolio, we actually can -- we can see the timeframe from shipment of a product until the product begins to connect to the cloud, back to the cloud like Meraki/And what we've seen is a one-quarter to two-quarter delay versus what historically you would see when these products get shipped, how long it takes for them to be activated and connect to the Meraki cloud. So that's the first piece. The second is, we had a very strong quarter in federal, U.S. federal, from an orders perspective. And so, we looked into why big customer like the U.S. government, Department of Defense, would not have the same issue. And the reality is, is that they have special clauses in their contracts that give them most favored nation status when we're actually making shipment decisions, and certainly with the Department of Defense, we prioritize them during the supply chain crisis. So they never had a big influx, they had a very steady flow of products across, which explains why their order numbers look fairly normal. The third point I'd say is that we noticed a serious uptick in Q1 in our Transactional Advanced Services, which is loosely translated to be implementation services, where that grew almost 20% and the forecast for Q2 is almost double-digits again. So it's clear that customers are asking us to come help them get this done. And I'll give you one final subjective data point and then I'll talk about the AI stuff. We had one big partner tell us that they will have literally hired 200 people in the last 90-days, solely focused on implementing technology for their customers. So there is just so many things that we've learned over the last 90-days. Clearly, this surprised us. But I think we feel pretty good right now. I'll make a comment about why I don't think it's macro, candidly it might have been easier for me to say it was macro. But as we've discussed prior, we have -- the traditional service provider has been tough and it remains that way. We've talked about elongated sales cycle, they remain. We've talked about, in some cases, the need for extra signatures, which is pretty normal, that's remained. But we didn't see it get materially worse in the quarter. And so all of that -- and I'm sorry for the long answer, but I wanted to be thorough, all of that is really what led us to believe this -- that this is a consumption issue with our customers. So I'm going to pause there, and then I'm going to answer your AI question. What we gave last time was orders to-date. We have taken orders for over $500 million. For infrastructure to support AI networks, AI GPUs inside the cloud players. Then -- and I'll talk a little bit more about that in a moment. The numbers that we gave today is a forward-looking set of numbers. Let's say, in fiscal year \u201825, which is when we said, we believe that the broad ethernet build-out would occur underneath GPUs. We have already seen -- we have line of sight to $1 billion plus of orders that our teams feel pretty good that we're going to get and/or we've been designed in already. So that's just sort of a forward-looking set of orders that we've identified for fiscal \u201825, okay. I will also just cover real quickly, we are now -- we now have our ethernet fabric deployed underneath GPUs in three of the four Hyperscalers, major Hyperscalers in the United States. We also are working very closely with AMD, Intel and NVIDIA, to create solutions including ethernet technology's GPU-enabled infrastructure joint -- jointly tested and validated reference architectures. And I will say even this week, yesterday, Jensen from NVIDIA and four of his -- four, five of his executives came over to see us and we spent 90 minutes together with my executive team. And we believe we have a great opportunity to actually build some integrated solutions between our technology and their technology to actually take to the enterprise. So we're beginning to see the use cases in the enterprise evolve. And we think that partnership with NVIDIA, in that case, with our underlying technology and our strength of go to market, we think will be a winning combination. So we're working on that as well. So there's a lot going on in the AI space. Hey, Simon, thanks for that. I would say the bigger variance that we're seeing, I mean, right now, obviously the demand signal is little bit tough because of the amount of inventory that's out in the field and that we have normalized lead times at this point. We knew that would happen sometime in the first half. That's now happened. Our lead times are back to where they were pre-pandemic. And our backlog has shipped. The supply chain team has done a terrific job getting product out the door. That's what's kind of moved the bottleneck from our level down to our customers' level. But when you start to unpack within networking, we're not seeing at this point, a huge difference between, for example, datacenter or campus networking. But what we are seeing is a little more field-based inventory on wireless access points. That's been slightly slower than what we've seen. It just because of the amount of product that's been shipped out than what we've seen in the rest of the networking. Yes. Thanks, Simon. Yes, Ben, as we said on the Splunk transaction, it's going to be outside of the transactional costs. It's going to be cash flow positive from the first year forward. So the Splunk transaction is not, in any way, having an effect on our capital return, either through the dividend or through the -- through share buybacks. We expect to continue that higher level and consistent higher level of share buybacks, and to continue to show increases in our dividend. We also will obviously look at the opportunity -- at the chance to be opportunistic on the share buyback. I'm not going to commit to that at this moment, but that is something that we will obviously take a look at. Thanks, Samik. I think my point with October was that if you go back to the end of Q4, we talked about on the last call that we had a fair amount of momentum as we exited the quarter, which is one of the reasons we didn't expect to see this. And we had our normal year-end sales, moving accounts around, moving territories around, and getting sort of the sales start-up process that happens in the first say six weeks of the fiscal year, which we went through. So what we tend to look for is the middle of the quarter. And then into October is when we expect to see, the actual quarter materialize and everything kind of come together, and it just didn't. And that's what -- that was the comment about that it was primarily -- we really -- it was really clear to us in October that -- that this was going to be the situation. Relative to they're the ones who are having the consumption issue because they have the most inventory. You asked how we -- what confidence we have if it's not SMB, if you look at orders, we look at -- we look at a sub-segmentation within enterprise now, and within service provider, etc., and SMB was fine. And in fact, the smaller the customer we had, the better their order performance for us in the quarter was. So it just follow the trend that the consumption issue was upmarket and small to mid-sized customers didn't feel it. Thanks, George. I think that the reason it's become relevant now is because if -- I mean, we really unloaded our backlog in the last six months. I mean -- and it was billions of dollars more than what we would normally ship to customers during that time period. So they -- I think it's just -- and we know that the cloud providers, as an example, had been buying ahead and they had been doing it for sure to your point. And all along, we have very sequenced purchasing cycles with those players. So we kind of know when they are going to start placing their next orders. I think on the enterprise, we're talking about the top 200 customers, right. These are the big customers who actually -- if they're doing a refresh of their infrastructure, they might order 400, 500 switches, as an example. Or they may be doing a branch rollout. And in some cases, to your point, it could be sitting with them or they could have a partner who's doing the staging, and the partner may be backed up with resources to try to get the staging done. So it varies, but it could be a -- either one of those or a combination of both. Thanks, Michael. On the AI question relative to the cloud players, I think that -- look, I think early on, we regained our footing there because we listened and we showed flexibility with our willingness to disaggregate if they wanted to do so. And we're in -- I can't even remember, but numerous use cases across the large web scale players. And I think we added over 10 new use cases last quarter alone, where we had been designed in. And I think it's -- so I think that the disaggregation and the flexibility and us listening to them and understanding what they wanted was the reason that we got back in. And now the feedback is as long as we're performing, I think they like our products, they like the power savings of Silicon One. It's a massive power -- lower -- massively lower power consumption. I think they do like silicon diversity for sure. And then as you look at the AI infrastructure that's currently primarily being supported via InfiniBand, they just want to move to more of a standard broad-based technology like Ethernet that they can actually have multiple sources. And so we think that's what's driving that now. And now it's just about performing and executing and delivering on what we tell them we're going to do. Scott, do you want to take the second? Thank you. Yes. Thank you, Sami, and welcome again. Listen, we're proud of the team for the performance in Q1. Obviously, a very solid quarter with the exception of this demand issue that we talked about. We'll always try to be transparent with you and share with you exactly what we're seeing. We know what's going on. We're on top of it, and we do feel that it's temporary. At the same time, we're very confident in our opportunities long term. We're confident in the AI opportunity. We're very encouraged by our improving position in security, observability. And we're also very encouraged by the opportunities that will come with the Splunk acquisition. I think many of you know that on Monday night, the waiting period for review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act in the U.S. expired, meaning that we've effectively pass the antitrust review period in the United States. We're excited about that. At our Partner Summit last night -- or last week, the feedback on our portfolio right now was probably as good as it's been in a long time. And I also just want to reiterate our commitment to delivering value to you and our shareholders with the operating leverage, capital allocation and obviously managing our expenses in times when we see challenges like we have right now. So thank you for joining us today, and I'll turn it back over to Sami."

            "name": "Scott Herren",
            "content": "Thanks, Chuck. We delivered solid results in Q1, driven by the prior strategic actions we took to mitigate the supply chain constraints. For the quarter, we reported strong revenue growth and a record non-GAAP operating margin. Total revenue was $14.7 billion, up 8% year-over-year, at the high end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP net income was $4.5 billion, up 28%. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.11, up 29%, exceeding the high-end of our guidance range. Looking at our Q1 revenue in more detail, total product revenue was $11.1 billion, up 9%; and service revenue was $3.5 billion, up 4%. Networking, our largest product category, drove the increase with 10% growth. Within networking, the growth was driven by switching, where campus and datacenter were both up double-digits on the strength of our Catalyst 9000 and Nexus 9000 offerings. This was partially offset by a decline in wireless. Security was up 4%, driven by our Zero Trust and threat intelligence, detection and response offerings. Collaboration was up 3% driven by growth in Calling and Contact Center, partially offset by a decline in Meetings. Observability was up 21%, driven by growth across the portfolio, including double-digit growth in ThousandEyes and AppDynamics. We continue to make progress in our transformation to more recurring revenue based offerings. We saw solid performance in our ARR of $24.5 billion, which increased 5% with product ARR growth of 10%. Total software revenue was $4.4 billion, a 13% increase with software subscription revenue also up 13%. 85% of our software revenue was subscription-based. Total subscription revenue increased 10% to $6.5 billion, which represents 44% of Cisco's total revenue, an increase of 1 percentage point over last year. RPO was $34.8 billion, up 12% year-over-year. Product RPO increased 14% and service RPO increased 11%. In total, short-term RPO was up 8% to $17.6 billion. Looking at our product orders by geographic segment, year-over-year, overall product orders declined 20% with the Americas down 19%, EMEA down 13% and APJC down 38%. In our customer markets, Service Provider & Cloud was down 38%, Enterprise was down 26%, and Public Sector was up slightly at 2%. Total non-GAAP gross margin came in at 67.1%, up 410 basis points year-over-year and 110 basis points above the high-end of our guidance range. Product gross margin was 66.5%, up 550 basis points. The increase was driven primarily by productivity improvements, with lower freight, logistics, and component costs. Favorable mix and positive pricing also contributed to the year-over-year improvement. Services non-GAAP gross margin was 69%, up slightly. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 36.6%, up 480 basis points and exceeding the high-end of our guidance range. This improved leverage was driven by both our strong non-GAAP gross margin and ongoing disciplined cost management. Shifting to the balance sheet, we ended Q1 with total cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $23.5 billion. We had operating cash flow for the quarter of $2.4 billion, down 40% primarily due to the $2.8 billion tax payment related to prior quarters, which was associated with the IRS tax relief due to the California floods. This quarter we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders, comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and $1.3 billion of share repurchases. Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we are committed to increasing shareholder returns through greater operating leverage, maintaining a higher level of annual share repurchases, and growing our dividend. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. During Q1, we announced our intent to acquire Splunk, which we expect to close by the end of the third quarter of calendar year 2024, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, including approval by Splunk shareholders. In Q1, we also closed several acquisitions, all of which are highly complementary to our internal R&D in line with our strategy to strengthen our position in cloud, security, observability and AI with targeted strategic M&A. To summarize, we delivered a solid quarter highlighted by topline growth and increased operating leverage that resulted in stronger than anticipated earnings per share. We continue to make progress in our business model shift to more recurring revenue. We remain focused on disciplined expense management without losing sight of the strategic investments necessary to innovate and capitalize on growth opportunities. Turning to our financial guidance, as Chuck outlined, the bottleneck that we previously saw in the supply chain has now shifted downstream to implementation by our customers and partners. Most of the supply chain constraints are now behind us and both shipment lead times and backlog have largely returned to normal levels. Q1 product orders declined 20% as our largest customers are implementing elevated levels of product shipments from prior quarters as we delivered orders from our historically high backlog levels. As Chuck mentioned, we believe there are one quarter to two quarters worth of shipped orders awaiting implementation by our customers. Our revenue guidance assumes, one quarter to two quarters of lower revenue and then a return to more typical sequential growth rates. Consequently, for Q2, we expect revenue to be in the range of $12.6 billion to $12.8 billion. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 65% to 66%. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 31.5% to 32.5%. And non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.82 to $0.84. For fiscal year 2024, our guidance is updated as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $53.8 billion to $55 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $3.87 to $3.93. In both our Q2 and full year guidance, we are assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. I'd like to thank our teams for their focus and execution this quarter. We remain confident in the strength of the business and our ability to capitalize on the key growth opportunities ahead. I'll now turn it back to Sami, so we can move into the Q&A. Yes. Yes, David, we did say that. I do. We are expecting sequential improvement in the second half of the year in both Q3 and in Q4. And in both -- and again, we don't guide this, but in both orders and revenue as you'd expect. Backlog is normalized at this point. We knew that would happen in the first half. I think supply chain team did a great job getting those orders in the hands of our customers. We would now need them to implement them, but we've got the orders in the hands of our customers. So we do see sequential increases. And as you said, as you noted from a bookings standpoint, our order standpoint, the second half has easier compare points. Obviously, the reverse is true on revenue and the second half revenue will have very difficult compare points than last year. Yes. To your second question, it is just based on how the revenues are flowing through the second half of the year. I think gross margins, we've said will settle in somewhere in this 65% to 66% range. I think at this point, it looks like it will be closer to the higher end of that range for the second part of the year. So that's the way I see the year flowing out. Remind me, Matt, what was the first part of your question. Yes, right. I think, we expect -- I certainly would expect service provider to continue to be difficult through the second-half of the year. Within service provider, we've got both telco and cable, which has one set of market dynamics going on. I think that will be -- continue to be a difficult space. On the other side, we have web scale, and we do see the web scale orders while they've got also inventory to work their way through. We do see line of sight to them beginning to increase their orders again in the second half of the year. So, SP is a bit of a mixed bag, but I think it will continue to have probably the greater impact. And George, just to put some data to that. And you have this data, but I'll repeat it. Our revenue growth, obviously, the quarter we're announcing now, product revenue growth was 9%. But if you go back to Q4, product revenue growth was 20%. And in Q3, it was 17%. So obviously, we get revenue when we can complete a shipment and get it out the door. It gives you a sense of just how much has been pushed out and as Chuck said in the last two or three quarters. Yes. Michael, I think I touched on this earlier in the -- as the question came up. I think the way to think about it is, first of all, if you're trying to generalize the trend more broadly across the industry, it may be a little difficult because we've cleared our backlog, I think, significantly faster than others have. But where we saw a differentiation was less between big data center infrastructure and campus networking and more between networking and wireless. We did see -- because we've shipped an enormous amount of wireless access points out. We did see that take a little bit more of an impact just because it's -- our customers are sitting on more inventory on hand of that, that they're looking to get installed."
