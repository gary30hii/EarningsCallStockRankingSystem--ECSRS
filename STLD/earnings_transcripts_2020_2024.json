And now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mark.\nMark Millett: Well, thank you, Tricia. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full Year 2020 earnings call. I apologize for the early hour, particularly for those that may be on the - coming in from the West Coast, but hopefully, you're going to enjoy the results, nonetheless. Because 2020 was a year of unprecedented health and economic challenge as we navigated the impacts from the coronavirus pandemic. Yet through the extraordinary dedication and passion of the Steel Dynamics team, we took care of one another, while also providing for our families and serving our customers. Protecting the health and welfare of our people is our highest priority. And I want to thank each of them for their continued commitment to each other. I am proud to work alongside each of them. They're a special team, and they continue to do incredible things. Despite the challenges, we achieved best-in-class performance, with a record fabrication volume, strong earnings and steel shipments that were only 1% less than our record year, simply a phenomenal performance, given the conditions. We accomplished these milestones while remembering that none of it matters unless everyone goes home safely at the end of each day. Our safety performance improved in the fourth quarter and notably, our annual 2020 injury severity rate was the lowest in our history. Again, nothing is more important than the health and safety of our people. Safety is and always will be our #1 value. Our safety performance is significantly better than industry statistics, but our aim is to have no injuries, and we will work tirelessly to get there. In order to achieve this, we must all be continuously aware of our surroundings and our fellow team members, keep safety top of mind to control safety, both in the traditional sense as it relates to keeping one another in good health. But before I continue, Theresa will provide insights into our recent performance.\nTheresa Wagler: Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to add my sincere appreciation and congratulations to our entire Steel Dynamics team. As Mark mentioned, we achieved numerous milestones despite the social and economic impacts from the coronavirus. We achieved revenues of $9.6 billion derived from record fabrication shipments and our second highest annual steel shipments. Operating income of $847 million and net income of $551 million or $2.59 per diluted share, and cash flow from operations of $987 million and adjusted EBITDA of $1.2 billion, a truly extraordinary performance considering all the peripheral challenges. Regarding our fourth quarter 2020 performance specifically, net income was $188 million or $0.89 per diluted share, which includes financing costs related to our October 2020 refinancing activities of $0.04 per diluted share. Costs net of capitalized interest associated with the construction of our Sinton, Texas flat-rolled steel mill of $0.05 per diluted share, a noncash asset impairment charge related to noncore oil and gas investments of $17 million or $0.06 per diluted share net of noncontrolling interest; and finally, a tax benefit related to the reduction of a valuation allowance of $13 million or $0.06 per diluted share net of noncontrolling interest. Excluding these items, fourth quarter 2020 adjusted net income was $0.97 per diluted share, above our adjusted guidance of $0.80 to $0.84 per share due to stronger-than-anticipated December flat-rolled steel shipments as order activity remains very strong. Our fourth quarter 2020 revenues were $2.6 billion, 12% higher than sequential third quarter results as steel and metals recycling pricing improved. Our fourth quarter 2020 operating income was $259 million, $103 million or 66% higher than sequential third quarter results. Due to higher realized flat-rolled steel pricing more than offsetting increased scrap costs. As we discuss our business this morning, you'll find that we are positive heading into 2021, considering underlying steel fundamentals and confident in our unique earnings catalyst. All 3 of our operating platforms performed well in 2020 and in the fourth quarter, with the steel metals recycling teams achieving their best quarterly performance of the year. Our steel operations generated $298 million of operating income in the fourth quarter, more than double third quarter sequential earnings as flat-rolled steel selling values increased significantly throughout the fourth quarter driving expanded metal margins. Fourth quarter steel shipments of 2.7 million tons were on par with sequential third quarter volume. Our steel mills operated at 84% of their capability during the quarter, well above the industry average of 72%. For the full year 2020, our steel facilities achieved numerous production and shipment records. The platform's full year operating income was $906 million with shipments of 10.7 million tons, again, representing our second highest volume and only 1% less than our record, a truly phenomenal performance. As a reminder, we still have additional market opportunity. It's mostly in the long product side of our steel operations. Based on our existing annual deal shipping capability of over 13 million tons. And as our new Texas Steel Mill begins ramping up, we will have over 16 million tons of steel shipping capabilities. Our value-added product mix, supply chain differentiation and downstream manufacturing businesses provide a powerful strategic advantage to sustain higher steel mill utilization during all demand environment and to increase our through-cycle cash flow. As overall manufacturing rates improved and domestic steel production increased during 2020, scrap generation and demand strengthened in the fourth quarter, resulting in improved pricing and volume. Operating income from our metals recycling operations was $27 million, 75% higher than the sequential third quarter. For the full year 2020, operating income from our metals recycling business was meaningfully higher than prior year, almost 60% higher at $45 million based on higher and more stable fair scrap prices. Our metals recycling operations provide a competitive advantage for sourcing ferrous scrap for our steel mills, allowing for increased scrap quality, melt efficiency and reduction of company-wide working capital requirements. Our vertically connected operating model benefits both platforms. Our steel fabrication business had solid operating income of $25 million in the fourth quarter compared to sequential third quarter record earnings of $39 million. Lower earnings were the result of seasonally lower shipments and metal spread compression as average selling values declined and steel raw material input cost increase. For the full year 2020, fabrication achieved another record year with operating income of $121 million and volume of 666,000 tons. Congratulations to the team. We continue to see strong order inquiry and customer optimism. Although with rapidly rising steel costs, we will likely see margin compression in the coming months. The order backlog is about a 6-month backlog, and the steel raw material that we put on the ground is generally around 2.5 months of steel inventory. So we're likely to see trough margins sometime in the first quarter for fabrication. But the order entry is very strong right now, and they're actually selling at record high joist-and-deck pricing. So we expect to see that crack very quickly as we go into the second quarter. For our cash flow from operations, our cash generation continues to be incredibly strong based on our differentiated business model and highly variable cost structure. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we generated $138 million of cash flow from operations and for the full year, $987 million. We are simply even more agile today than ever before, we more than doubled our average annual free cash flow to $1.2 billion from 2016 to 2020. That's compared to the previous 5-year period. Even in midst coronavirus, we generated $980 million of free cash flow this year. Our 2020 capital investments totaled $1.2 billion, of which $928 million was invested in our new Texas flat-rolled steel mill. For 2021, we currently believe capital investments will be roughly $950 million, with the Texas steel mill representing about $800 million of that amount. The Texas steel mill is expected to be within plan of $1.9 billion. Regarding shareholder distributions, we maintained our quarterly cash dividend at $0.25 per common share after increasing up 4% in the first quarter of this year or the first quarter of 2020, I should say. Since 2016, we've also increased or invested $1.3 billion in our common stock, representing over 15% of our outstanding shares. We repurchased $107 million in 2020 and $444 million remains authorized for repurchase at the end of the year. Additionally, we opportunistically accessed the investment-grade capital markets in both June and October of 2020, extending our debt maturity profile. Since becoming investment grade, we've significantly reduced our effective interest rate from 5.4% to 3.5%. These actions reflect the strength of our capital foundation, consistent cash flow capability and strong liquidity profile and the continued optimism and confidence in our future. We entered 2020 in a position of strength. And ample liquidity, and we remain in a position of strength as we enter 2021. At December 31, 2020, liquidity was over $2.5 billion, comprised of cash of $1.4 billion and our unsecured revolver of $1.2 billion. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes responsible strategic growth with shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that's complemented with a variable share repurchase program, while also being dedicated to preserving our investment-grade credit rating. We're squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable optimized long-term value creation. We also believe sustainability is a part of our long-term value creation, and we're dedicated to our people, our communities and our environment. We're committed to operating our business with the highest integrity and have been since our founding. Today, we produce steel using electric-arc-furnace technology with recycled ferrous scrap as the primary raw material. EAF steel production technology currently has the least environmental impact. It is the most cost-effective and provides the most operational flexibility. With the addition of our mills recycling and fabrication platforms, we intentionally developed a vertically connected operating model, created an almost closed-loop manufacturing business, which both benefits us financially and reduces our environmental impact. In 2020, we shared our qualitative climate-related goals in our most recent sustainability report. During 2021, we plan to also adopt quantitative goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, participate in greater renewable energy use and continue to invest in energy efficiency opportunities. We are currently in the process of assessing the use of renewable energy alternatives at our new Texas steel mill as well. Our sustainability and environmental impact strategy is an ongoing journey, and we're moving forward with the intention to make a positive difference. We plan to continue to address these matters and to play a leadership role in developing innovative ways to reduce our impact on the environment. And on a personal note, I want to thank our teams for their passion and generosity and for the care they're showing for one another's health and safety. Thank you. Mark?\nMark Millett: Well, thanks, Theresa. As you were talking there, it's a great recap, I think, of our financial performance for sure. But the startling metric there, I think you have a team that produced almost $1 billion in free cash flow during a pandemic in an incredible economic downturn. This speaks remarkably for the team that we have. But as you also mentioned, the steel fabrication platform delivered an outstanding performance, achieving record annual earnings and shipments. The nonresidential construction markets remained resilient throughout 2020, especially in areas that support online retail and computing activities, such as warehouses for the retail distribution and cloud computing functions. This continues to be a strong area for our fabrication projects. We ended the year with a record fabrication customer backlog, which is atypical for this time of year as seasonality tends to impact order activity. So I think it bodes well for the future. As steel prices increase quickly, it's likely we'll see near-term margin compression for the fabrication platform. However, the strong steel pricing environment will obviously benefit our steel operations to a much greater degree. This is one of the strengths of the symbiotic nature of the vertical integration of our primary operating platforms. Another is the ability to keep utilization of our steel mills at the highest level. Our fabrication facilities bought almost 460,000 tons of steel from our own steel mills in 2020, helping mitigate the impact of reduced demand in the second quarter, driving a significantly higher utilization rate as compared to the industry as a whole. Our metals recycling operations performed admirably in the wake of a COVID-19 related state mandates and manufacturing disruptions earlier in the year. The team was critical in supplying our steel mills with adequate scrap when supply was severely reduced during the second quarter. Another example of the strength of our vertical operating platforms. As manufacturing resumed mid-year and domestic steel production increased, scrap generation and demand improved significantly in the second half of 2020, culminating in a significant price increase in January '21 of a $100 per gross ton. We believe scrap generation will be strong in 2021 and that pricing will stabilize at moderately lower levels than we have today. The steel team achieved incredible things this year, and I thank everyone involved because it took a team effort in our metals recycling and fabrication teams, our customers and our vendors. Everyone contributed to the performance. Our own steel consuming businesses purchased 1.5 million tons of steel from our steel mills, representing 14% of our total 2020 steel shipments. Clearly, another example of the strength of our vertical operating platforms to mitigate risk and increase through-cycle earnings. As a result of the pandemic, an estimated 15 million tons of higher cost domestic blast furnace flat-rolled steel production was idled in early 2020. Since that time, we believe between 5 million to 6 million tons of net production capacity has resumed. We believe that some of the idle capacity will be permanently off-line due to the high cost required to restart and maintain their operations. We believe this supports our flat roll supply-demand balance theses that the impending additional flat roll capacity will not cause a material supply side imbalance as there are only approximately 6 million tons of new capacity that is planned to start in the next 12 months. Combined with the capacity already restarted, it still doesn't match the tons taken off-line in early 2020. While the overall domestic steel industry operated at 68% utilization, the strength of our differentiated business model, coupled with the passion of our people drove steel dynamics' utilization rate to 86%. Even more remarkable, our flat-rolled steel mills achieved utilization of 97% through the year. In tough environments, the strength of our people and our unique business model becomes even more powerful. As demonstrated this year, during periods of market inflection, we maintained higher volumes compared to our peers, and we gained market share. Uninterrupted low-cost operations help provide customer optionality, value-added product and end market diversification provides flexibility for our commercial teams to go get orders. Unique supply chain solutions create customer value, making us a preferred supplier. And as I mentioned, our internal manufacturing businesses provide meaningful utilization support. We're in an extremely tight flat roll market right now, we can't even supply our internal operations to the extent they would like. Underlying demand for flat-rolled steel recovered much more quickly than expected, coupled with already extremely low supply chain inventories, the flat-rolled steel supply environment tightened in the second half of 2020 and remains extremely tight today. Customers are not yet rebuilding inventory due to limited availability and the speculative risk associated with the accumulation of higher-priced inventory. They appear to be ordering for only immediate needs. As for trade, we believe existing country agreements and legislative steel trade cases that are in place will continue to moderate imports. From an end market perspective, the North American automotive sector has experienced the most rapid rebound, already operating at pre-COVID levels with expectations of production in 2020 of around 16 million units or more. The nonresidential construction sector remains steady as evidenced by record structural and rail division shipments, record steel fabrication shipments and strong customer backlogs. Residential construction has also been strong, generating high demand for related HVAC and appliance products. We're also beginning to see improvements in mining and yellow and green goods at our Engineered Bar Products Division. A slight offset is steel consumption related to the energy sector, which remains historically weak, but is seeing glimpses of turnaround. We are continuing our impressive growth - margin-enhancing growth. We have recently executed several strategic investments that we believe will meaningfully benefit our future through-cycle earnings and free cash flow position. We expanded 2 steel mills by adding 440,000 tons of annual steel rebar production capability, adding product diversification and differentiated customer supply chain. This end market diversification supports higher through-cycle utilization for our structural and Roanoke Bar Steel divisions. The Heartland operations acquired in 2018, continue to expand. The team has been operating at record levels, providing additional internal value-added flat roll production support and operational flexibility for our Butler Flat Roll Division. The acquisition of United Steel Supply has also been an excellent investment. As a regional distributor of prepainted flat-rolled steel construction products, they provide a strategic channel to new, more diversified customers. Our combined brand is powerful in these markets, establishing us as the clear supplier of choice. Since the acquisition of Columbus Flat Roll Division, we have meaningfully increased its through-cycle earnings capability. We have transformed its product portfolio with the expansion of value-added steel products and customer end markets. The team achieved another milestone in July 2020, with a start-up of the new 400,000-ton value-added metallic coating line. Columbus now has 4 value-added coating lines. The investment reduces Columbus's hot-rolled coil exposure and provides a ready southern hot band consumer base for our new Sinton, Texas electric-arc-furnace flat-rolled steel mill when it starts operating later this year. The Sinton investment will be another transformational step function increase to through-cycle cash flow generation, providing next-generation EAF steel production capabilities, new products and new customers. The team's momentum is absolutely unbelievable and to be admired. When you tour the site the excitement there is palpable. We have an incredible depth of experience in the construction, start-up and operation of large steel manufacturing assets. Collectively, we likely have more relevant experience than any other company in the industry. Construction is going well and it's beyond exciting to know we'll be producing steel this coming summer. The new 3 million tons state of the art flat-rolled steel mill will include 2 value-added coating lines, comprised of a 550,000 ton galvanizing line and 250,000 ton paint line. These lines will likely start ahead of the full mill in the second quarter this year using either internally supplied or purchased steel substrate. Our new electric-arc-furnace steel mill is adhering to the same stringent sustainability model as our other steelmaking facilities utilizing state of the art environmental controls and processes to produce high-quality sustainable steel. Our existing electric arc furnace steel mills have a fraction of the greenhouse gas emission and energy intensity of average traditional steelmaking technology. With an 84-inch coil width up to 1 inch thick 100 KSI product, our Texas mill will have product capabilities beyond existing flat-rolled steel producers, competing even more effectively with the integrated steel model and steel imports. The town of Sinton provides a strategic location near the Corpus Christi. We have three targeted regional commercial markets for our new steel mill, which represents over 27 million tons of relevant flat-rolled steel consumption. In the Southern and Western United States and Mexico. We also plan to effectively compete with the steel imports arriving through Houston and the West Coast. Our customers are excited to have a regional flat-rolled steel supplier, we have 3 customers committed to locate on site, representing over 1 million tons of annual processing and consumption capacity. We're still speaking with several other potential on-site customers as well, those that may build facilities off-site but near our campus. Our location provides a significant freight benefit to most of our intended flat roll customers. Compared to the current domestic supply options, we believe the potential custom savings will be at least $20 to $30 per ton, and some would be much higher. This freight advantage, coupled with much shorter lead times, provides a superior customer supply chain solution, allowing us to be a preferred domestic steel supplier in the southern and Western U.S. and Mexico. It allows us to effectively compete with imports, which inherently have long lead times and speculative price risk. We have also made considerable progress concerning our raw material procurement strategy. We completed the acquisition of a Mexican scrap company in August, which I deem a critical step. The acquisition complements our current metals recycling business in both the U.S. and Mexico. The operations are strategically located near high-volume industrial scrap sources throughout Central and Northern Mexico, and prior to our ownership, they shipped 500,000 gross tons of scrap annually, but they have an estimated annual processing capability of almost 2 million gross tons. We plan to increase the volume quickly and have already had success in doing so. Our performance-based operating culture, coupled with our considerable experience in successfully constructing and operating highly profitable steel assets positions us incredibly well to successfully execute this transformational growth. We're not simply adding flat-rolled steel production capacity. We have a differentiated product offering, a unique regional supply chain solution, a significant geographic freight and lead time advantage, and offer a sustainable alternative to regional imports. Our unique culture and the execution of our long-term strategy continues to strengthen our financial position through consistent strong cash flow generation and long-term value creation, differentiating us from others and demonstrating our sustainability. This has clearly been demonstrated during 2020. Again, our commitment is the health and safety of our people, our families and our communities, all while supporting our vendors, serving our customers and sustaining our value creation journey. Our leadership team and our 10,000 strong SDI family drives our success. Collectively, they are second to none. I thank each of you for your passion, strength and commitment to one another during these uncharted times. You truly drive us to excellence. And finally, a sincere and heartfelt thank you to the health care providers and their families, both within Steel Dynamics and those serving individuals across the world. Thank you, and be safe. Be well. So Kevin, please open the call for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is coming from Seth Rosenfeld from Exane BNP Paribas.\nSeth Rosenfeld: If I can kick off please with the question on kind of how we're seeing the market develop in the near term. I think everyone on the line's, at this point, quite excited by the strength of the market right now, but skittish on the outlook going into 2021 with prices where they are. Wondering if you can comment on how you're seeing your order book develop in recent weeks? Has there been any slowdown in order intake due to high prices and some concern about price moment and maybe inflecting in the coming months, are we still seeing the same strength you've already talked through that benefited your Q4 performance?\nMark Millett: Well, certainly, I think it's intrigued that one keeps hearing about the issues with the market because - I'm sorry, I don't know whether you heard that. I may have been on mute. But it's intriguing to me that there's concern about the strength of the market because right now, it is absolutely incredible. I know the supply side tightness, but demand is very, very, very, strong. Automotive recovered, and it's going to be 16 million units or so this year and probably more. And that's very, very strong and for us, we continue to gain market share, both at flat roll and engineered bar. We see residential construction is very, very strong. We can't supply enough steel currently to appliance, HVAC. Garage - metal garage door panels are incredibly strong. So that's a very a good sector. And although people are a little concerned about perhaps ABI numbers coming off a little bit, we certainly don't see that in our order book. As both Theresa and I have said, we have record sort of booking in the backlog at our fabrication platform. The retail shift to online sort of purchasing is really driving massive expansion of the warehouses - distribution warehouses. And cloud computing, likewise, is increasing dramatically and has a considerable build-out, too. And if you look at just the momentum, the Steel Joist Institute bookings for last year was 17% up year-over-year at 1.36 million tons. That's a considerable market. Just below their previous record back in 2007. 2020 shipments were up 7%, and we're seeing that momentum carry into this year, and we are very, very happy with where we are from a backlog perspective.\nTheresa Wagler: I think, Jim Anderson, this morning told me the market is \"red hot.\"\nMark Millett: Yes. So they're a pretty excited team. Let me tell you. And then you get further down into the demand, you look at the truck trailer material handling. Again, they were anticipating a little bit of a flat to down year, but they are - actually changed that. We're anticipating they're going to be up 20% or more. Yellow goods, green goods, we're seeing very, very, very strong demand, and they're telling us at least the, again we don't know what they're doing with other customer - suppliers. But our order book is going to be substantially up throughout this year. Solar is a growing marketplace and a surprisingly large marketplace. And the only real sort of weak area is the oil patch, and we're seeing glimpses of light even there. But they - typically, even in a strong market, they're only 8% of the total marketplace. So it's not a massive, massive impact. So just generally, we see a very, very positive perspective out there. Our order books are incredibly strong. I wish we could make a lot more steel today because we could certainly sell a lot more steel. And we see it sustaining or persisting through the year.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Curt Woodworth from Crédit Suisse.\nCurt Woodworth: Mark, just had a couple of questions around - you talked about the paint line starting up before the mill. At this point, when do you expect first coil production at Sinton? And is the plan to light both EAFs at the same time? Because I know it's kind of a different configuration with dual EAFs but a single caster. So just curious what the time line is looking like?\nMark Millett: Well, the second question, absolutely. We'll be starting both furnaces up at the same time because we're expecting a strong ramp. And I think it's exciting. Again, even through the challenges of last year, that the project still remains on schedule for a summer start-up. And as Theresa said, it's still remaining on a $1.9 billion budget. And if you have seen the - you get on our website and take a look at the drone video that we continually update each year - I don't know, once a month or - not each year. Once a month...\nTheresa Wagler: Not each year. Applicable [indiscernible].\nMark Millett: Yes, you see a big difference each year. But it's - they're making remarkable progress, and it's a massive project. So they've done incredibly well. That doesn't mean to say there haven't been some zigs and zags along the way and likely have some more to come. But the team has done an outstanding job, I think, overcoming the challenges. We have had a few COVID-related delays in equipment and actually more impactful was ocean freight, getting ships to bring it here. But that's no longer an issue. And fortunately, none of that was on the critical path for the project. So again, timing for the project is still on time for a summer start. As I said, the coating lines, the paint line, the galvanizing line and likely the pickle line should be in good shape for the second quarter. Likely as kind of a May-June start there. And we'll be supplying substrate from Columbus likely and purchasing some substrate from third parties.\nOperator: Next question is coming from Timna Tanners from Bank of America.\nTimna Tanners: I wanted to just ask a little bit about the CapEx. It looks like maybe you're a little light in 2020, and that's the explanation for the higher value for 2021, but wanted to get a little bit more color on how that's progressing. And had heard that Sinton was starting a little later because of COVID delays, but sounds like that's not the case. So if you could clarify those items, please?\nTheresa Wagler: Yes, no problem, Timna. From a CapEx perspective, you're actually exactly correct. Simply had about $100 million that shifted from the fourth quarter of 2020 into the first half of 2021. So wherein, as last quarter, I would have suggested CapEx for 2021 would be about $850 million. It's now about $950 million. Unlikely, about $600 million to $700 million of the $950 million will be spent in the first half of the year. As it relates to the time line of Sinton, Mark?\nMark Millett: Yes. I think, Timna, we've always advertised sort of a summer start-up, and that's not changed. Internally, we may have had some more aggressive goals as we typically do within SDI, and if the sun and moon aligned, maybe we could have started up 6 weeks or so earlier. But again, I've got absolutely no problems, no concerns there right now. Everything is progressing well, and the team is doing a phenomenal job.\nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Chris Terry from Deutsche Bank.\nChristopher Terry: Mark and Theresa. I had a question just around working capital. As we think about 2021 and the higher price environment and then also the integration of Sinton. I just wondered if you could talk through maybe a first half and second half '21 expectations on working capital.\nTheresa Wagler: Yes, absolutely. Chris. From the perspective of Sinton stand-alone, Sinton is likely to have a working capital ramp of somewhere around $130 million to $150 million, including all of the inventory and receivables. That will be a ramp. So in the second half of the year. You might get some of the raw materials, so maybe $50 million to $60 million in the first half. But most of that will come second half of 2021 and then into the first half of 2022. As it relates to company-wide working capital, you would have seen that we did have a draw of about $200 million in the fourth quarter related to primarily pricing of raw materials and of finished goods that would be in inventory at that point in time. You're likely to see a bit more of a draw as we're expecting to have higher prices and volumes sustained into the first quarter, but not as much of a draw as you saw in the fourth quarter. So I would say the first half, you're going to see a draw more than you typically would see. Second half, you'd see that moderate.\nChristopher Terry: And then just in terms of the overall capital structure and the buyback, how are you thinking about that in terms of Sinton in the middle of the year and maybe second half?\nTheresa Wagler: So from a capital allocation perspective, obviously, we're still focused on a big capital investment year in 2021. That being said, the cash flow generation that we've been having is quite strong, and we would expect to see that continue in 2021. So from a capital allocation perspective, we would expect to see the positive dividend profile continue. Once Sinton is up and running, that's likely going to be an opportunity for another kind of step function increase in our dividend policy as we like to grow the dividend with sustainable free cash flow. As we have excess cash flow along the way, that's with the share buyback programs for it's to complement the dividend profile because we see the dividends as forever. So you're likely to see us start to look for opportunities potentially from time to time in the market from a share buyback once we get past more of the larger spend for Sinton in the first half of the year. Mark, is that...\nMark Millett: Yes.\nTheresa Wagler: Okay.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Carlos De Alba from Morgan Stanley.\nCarlos De Alba: Mark and Theresa. Just in terms of the potential infrastructure package, there are comments about $1.5 billion potential stimulus in the second half of the year. How do you see that benefit still demand in the U.S. and steel dynamics in particular? I don't know if you can - you have a sense of the volumes or - yes, that you could benefit from it.\nMark Millett: I think the - it's certainly more than likely that we will see an infrastructure package, as you know, which is going to be a great sort of general benefit. But right now, it's difficult to discern where those dollars are going to be spent specifically and hence, where the impact will be from a volume perspective. Certainly, just the upward momentum that it will provide the economy in general will certainly help us. And any actual infrastructure, steel consuming infrastructure projects will be to our benefit. But to actually try to estimate, calculate a volume when you don't really know where the dollars are going to be spent, I think that it would be disingenuous for us to suggest.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from David Gagliano from BMO Capital Markets.\nDavid Gagliano: I just want to ask a little bit about the scrap market and how scrap costs are flowing through the results? Just obviously, historically, steel dynamics has - typically reports quarter-over-quarter changes in scrap costs that are typically less than the change that we've seen in the public market or domain. But this quarter was a pretty big spread. And I'm just wondering, is any of that timing related? Should we be thinking about - how should we be thinking about the first quarter in terms of the scrap input costs? And also if you could just also share your views on the near-term outlook on scrap beyond what looks to be down in February?\nTheresa Wagler: Yes. I'm going to let Mark talk about the scrap markets. But as it relates to the scrap flows, there really hasn't been any change. We're still turning inventories on a monthly basis, both at the mills recycling operations, and we tend to keep somewhere between 3 to 4 weeks on the ground at the steel mills. So I can't really address why it may have been greater than you typically see, but there hasn't been a change in how we're using or accounting for the scrap.\nMark Millett: Yes. Well, I guess, the only impact would be it's such a rapid increase in a short period of time, and you're seeing the difference between the market and our inventory. But just in the scrap market as a whole, obviously, it's gone up some the last month or two, quite considerably. We would imagine that we'll retreat from the current highs or moderate somewhat. It's not going to take all a couple of hundred dollars back, but it's going to retreat, we believe, because the strong pricing is driven a substantial increase in the flow, particularly the obsolete grades. People are out there collecting it's flowing in dramatically, and the industry has actually dropped the scale prices. And so I would expect the market prices to drop over the next couple of months. For prime scrap, flows are fully reestablished in connectivity with the automotive business coming back. We expect prices there to soften, but not quite as much as obsolete grades. So the shred to prime spread will likely expand a little more than it is today. And we think the export market will remain relatively soft. And so there's - again, we feel pricing is going to moderate. I think despite China listing its import restrictions, it's not going to impact the ferrous market dramatically, not in the U.S. anyway. But it is going to give us - or has given us significant upside on nonferrous. Obviously, as many of you know the nonferrous, the copper, aluminum absorber, those sorts of grades, really didn't have much of a home for the last year or so. With them opening up, they're able to increase the margins there. So I think that's a positive for us.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Andreas Bokkenheuser from UBS.\nAndreas Bokkenheuser: Just a follow-up on scrap actually and something we've talked to you about before as well about availability of scrap in the U.S. market. I think you guys have always maintained your view that there is plenty of scrap in the U.S. market for everyone to go around. Does that change now given the new import rules in China? I mean, China obviously reopening that goes for seaborne scrap. And it's obviously not a large seaborne market. So do you think do you think that could go in and kind of tighten the market and maybe even lead to some consolidation of mills in the U.S. they're buying more scrap yards in the same way you guys did in Mexico recently? Or do you still see the U.S. scrap market pretty well supplied? That's my question.\nMark Millett: Well, I can't speak for other companies. I would suggest that, as we've said in the past, we will expand or grow to support our steel mills regionally. So we did that. We bought some Sims yards around our Columbus facility, just to baseload that mill. And Zimmer, obviously, is destined to supply some scrap to Sinton quite cost effectively. So you may see us, again, just add smaller opportunities, but we're not going to be in consolidating the whole scrap market or anything like that, for sure. Regarding scrap supply, I think you're seeing what has been typical in the past. Scrap is incredibly elastic. Certainly, the obsolete grades are incredibly elastic and has - as scrap pricing has increased dramatically in the last month or 2, it's amazing how folks get out there and that flow increases dramatically. And so I don't see a long-term issue with scrap supply in any way shape or form.\nTheresa Wagler: I think one just has to - so as we look at scrap generation, we see it continuing to increase. We see it increasing even more quickly than potentially some of the additional demand that will be derived from some of the new EAF capacity coming online domestically. But one also has to look at the additional HBI, DRI and other projects that are either coming online, have been announced or being contemplated by even the blast furnace participants. So I think there should be ample raw material as Mark's said.\nMark Millett: And with the rationalization of the integrated side of the industry, it's quite possible that you just start to see them actually produce pig iron, which would help the supply balance - supply-demand balance as well.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Phil Gibbs from KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nPhilip Gibbs: Theresa, the question I had was just on the flat-rolled shipments by grade, if you had that handy?\nTheresa Wagler: Yes. I'm sorry, I made you ask, I skipped over. I didn't mean to. So hot-rolled and P&O for the quarter was 749,000 tons, cold rolled, 139,000 tons, and coated products were 973,000 tons for a total of about 1.9 million tons of flat roll.\nPhilip Gibbs: And the coated number again, I'm sorry?\nTheresa Wagler: The coated number was 973,000 tons.\nOperator: Next question is coming from John Tumazos from John Tumazos Very Independent.\nJohn Tumazos: The forward curve for the hot-rolled sheet contract is over 6 months, down $367. I'm not sure I understand that. But do you think the forward curve reflects new supply, so let's just say 1 million tons more flat rolled, 1 million tons more long products? Or do you think the forward curve reflects a fall in the price of iron units? Your mill is only going to be 0.25 million tons a month. Not 1 million or 2 million tons a month and you'll probably just be striking an arc by August where the forward curve is down $367. It seems to me that market's anticipating a lot of supply. I'm not sure where it is, but I appreciate your view, Mark?\nMark Millett: Well, John, simply, I don't understand it either. Again, as I tried to suggest earlier, this isn't just a supply side tightness. Demand, the markets are incredibly strong and robust right now. And we see that persisting. Certainly very, very, very strong first half, and I think it's going to continue into the second half. And I don't see any appreciable change or driver out there to change that. To your point, okay, we're out a few tons here, incremental tons relatively to the market anyway, the second half of the year. Big River reportedly is running. We don't see them in the marketplace necessarily, but they have got their capacity up and running pretty strong from all reports. So there's not that additional capacity there. So I don't see where the relief is going to be. I don't see, to be honest, the Biden administration changing the trade environment materially, at least not near term. I think they recognize that China is a massive threat. Their approach to them might be different than the Trump administration. They will likely ally with our friends in Europe and in places. But they're not - they will likely change 2.32, but I think they will be very cognizant that there needs to be trade controls there. And there are underlying legislative trade constraints in place that aren't just an executive order, they're legislated, and they're going to be there for years to come, Section 201 countervailing duties and [indiscernible]. So I don't see necessarily the - an import flood. The arbitrage certainly has grown to China. But nonetheless, lead times are months and months out. And you see some specialty items coming in, but I don't see any dramatic change in the import profile. So I don't see where the pressure comes off the accelerator to drop $370 here in the next, whatever it is, 6 months. So I agree. I don't understand it either. We don't see - we certainly don't see it within the fundamental drivers of the marketplace.\nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Tyler Kenyon from Cowen and Company.\nTyler Kenyon: Mark and Theresa. Certainly as you've addressed some potential tailwinds for coming from infrastructure spending. But I was just curious if you had any thoughts on how the suspension of border wall construction and the cancellation of the XL pipeline, how that could maybe impact the steel demand and/or scrap supply. I mean, I think we were reading through the Department of Homeland Security that pretty close to 700,000 tons of steel has been consumed since 2008 on the border wall. So yes, the question is, how do you see that impacting the market? And has steel dynamics been participating in supplying steel to any of these projects?\nMark Millett: Well, I think the border wall, to be honest, was relatively incremental. We didn't see much of that product. And that tends to be at the low end, commodity hot band side of the business that we tend not to play in, to any great extent anyway. So - but I don't see that as a massive impact to demand.\nTheresa Wagler: The XL pipeline is hard to tell how much that may have an influence and what the Biden administration may do going forward with additional kind of oil and gas, obviously, is not going to help. From that perspective as Mark said, at least in the fourth quarter, which was prior to some of these things happening, we were starting to see some orders come in from those customers, both at Columbus and at our Engineered Bar Products Division, where we would have the most impact. But I just think it's a little too early to tell.\nMark Millett: Well, and that pipeline - actually, our pipeline, to be honest, a massive amount of that pipe has already been made and is laying on the ground. So it's not going to have a massive impact.\nTyler Kenyon: Got it. And then just, Theresa, just 1 last one, just on cash taxes, if your, I think in the last call, you guided to a pretty, pretty low cash tax rate. Just curious if that's changed significantly? And maybe how we should be thinking about that rate moving even into 2022?\nTheresa Wagler: Well, in 2021, the provisions that allow us to expense the fixed asset investment once we start-up Sinton are still in place. So as long as those provisions are still in place, we'll be able to basically pay maybe 3% state cash taxes in 2020 and likely remain very low - I'm sorry, in 2021 and likely remain very low in 2022 as well. But obviously, we need to watch the administration and things that may change according to that. But right now, we're still planning on the benefit in total being somewhere around $300 million to $350 million of cash tax savings between 2021 and 2022.\nOperator: Our next question today is a follow-up from David Gagliano from BMO Capital Markets.\nDavid Gagliano: Just to circle back on the scrap question, sorry to ask another scrap question. Just on the near term, it's to help calibrate expectations on our side. If we start with the assumption that scrap prices actually don't change for the remainder of the quarter. I realize that's not the view, but if we assume that they don't change, just from a timing perspective, what should we expect for the scrap cost change quarter-over-quarter in the first quarter?\nTheresa Wagler: Well, again, for us, David, from a scrap mix perspective, the mills keep 3 to 4 months on hand. So whatever your estimation would be from - I'm sorry, weeks on hand. So whatever your estimation would be from an index perspective, you can just apply that, and you're going to get very close to what will actually happen.\nOperator: We've reached end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back for any further or closing comments.\nMark Millett: Well, to those on the phone still, we certainly appreciate you're listening in and you're supportive of your company. And I think it's just one last comment that, I guess, didn't really come out clearly. People are focused on price, and it's not price that matters, we're a margin. We're a metal spread business. And again, we anticipate a very strong demand year that's going to support pricing on the price side on the market side. Supply side, inventories remain very, very low. We expect import activity to remain very moderate. A significant portion of the idled blast furnace capacity, we expect to remain down, and lead times are extended. So you couple that with a moderating scrap environment, we see that metal spreads themselves are going to persist sort of higher than the normal through-cycle levels and should be very, very helpful for us, and we're anticipating a remarkable year, in all honesty. That being said, to our customers out there, folks, we had an absolutely phenomenal year - last year, and we couldn't do it without you. So thank you for your support. Similarly for our vendors and service providers. Thank you. And most importantly, thank you to each and every employee out there. It was an absolutely tremendous year. I think it vulcanizes or just affirms our business model, that we are a differentiated company. To make $1 billion of free cash in a year like that, I think just spells out clearly that we're a different company today. And with Sinton coming online, it's going to add 25% to our steelmaking capability. That's going to be a significant step function increase in our through-cycle cash generation. So we've done a phenomenal job, and we're going to keep doing it, and we can't do it without each and every one of you. So thank you. Go ahead, have a great day. Be safe, stay healthy.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mark Millett",
            "content": "Well, thank you, Tricia. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full Year 2020 earnings call. I apologize for the early hour, particularly for those that may be on the - coming in from the West Coast, but hopefully, you're going to enjoy the results, nonetheless. Because 2020 was a year of unprecedented health and economic challenge as we navigated the impacts from the coronavirus pandemic. Yet through the extraordinary dedication and passion of the Steel Dynamics team, we took care of one another, while also providing for our families and serving our customers. Protecting the health and welfare of our people is our highest priority. And I want to thank each of them for their continued commitment to each other. I am proud to work alongside each of them. They're a special team, and they continue to do incredible things. Despite the challenges, we achieved best-in-class performance, with a record fabrication volume, strong earnings and steel shipments that were only 1% less than our record year, simply a phenomenal performance, given the conditions. We accomplished these milestones while remembering that none of it matters unless everyone goes home safely at the end of each day. Our safety performance improved in the fourth quarter and notably, our annual 2020 injury severity rate was the lowest in our history. Again, nothing is more important than the health and safety of our people. Safety is and always will be our #1 value. Our safety performance is significantly better than industry statistics, but our aim is to have no injuries, and we will work tirelessly to get there. In order to achieve this, we must all be continuously aware of our surroundings and our fellow team members, keep safety top of mind to control safety, both in the traditional sense as it relates to keeping one another in good health. But before I continue, Theresa will provide insights into our recent performance. Well, thanks, Theresa. As you were talking there, it's a great recap, I think, of our financial performance for sure. But the startling metric there, I think you have a team that produced almost $1 billion in free cash flow during a pandemic in an incredible economic downturn. This speaks remarkably for the team that we have. But as you also mentioned, the steel fabrication platform delivered an outstanding performance, achieving record annual earnings and shipments. The nonresidential construction markets remained resilient throughout 2020, especially in areas that support online retail and computing activities, such as warehouses for the retail distribution and cloud computing functions. This continues to be a strong area for our fabrication projects. We ended the year with a record fabrication customer backlog, which is atypical for this time of year as seasonality tends to impact order activity. So I think it bodes well for the future. As steel prices increase quickly, it's likely we'll see near-term margin compression for the fabrication platform. However, the strong steel pricing environment will obviously benefit our steel operations to a much greater degree. This is one of the strengths of the symbiotic nature of the vertical integration of our primary operating platforms. Another is the ability to keep utilization of our steel mills at the highest level. Our fabrication facilities bought almost 460,000 tons of steel from our own steel mills in 2020, helping mitigate the impact of reduced demand in the second quarter, driving a significantly higher utilization rate as compared to the industry as a whole. Our metals recycling operations performed admirably in the wake of a COVID-19 related state mandates and manufacturing disruptions earlier in the year. The team was critical in supplying our steel mills with adequate scrap when supply was severely reduced during the second quarter. Another example of the strength of our vertical operating platforms. As manufacturing resumed mid-year and domestic steel production increased, scrap generation and demand improved significantly in the second half of 2020, culminating in a significant price increase in January '21 of a $100 per gross ton. We believe scrap generation will be strong in 2021 and that pricing will stabilize at moderately lower levels than we have today. The steel team achieved incredible things this year, and I thank everyone involved because it took a team effort in our metals recycling and fabrication teams, our customers and our vendors. Everyone contributed to the performance. Our own steel consuming businesses purchased 1.5 million tons of steel from our steel mills, representing 14% of our total 2020 steel shipments. Clearly, another example of the strength of our vertical operating platforms to mitigate risk and increase through-cycle earnings. As a result of the pandemic, an estimated 15 million tons of higher cost domestic blast furnace flat-rolled steel production was idled in early 2020. Since that time, we believe between 5 million to 6 million tons of net production capacity has resumed. We believe that some of the idle capacity will be permanently off-line due to the high cost required to restart and maintain their operations. We believe this supports our flat roll supply-demand balance theses that the impending additional flat roll capacity will not cause a material supply side imbalance as there are only approximately 6 million tons of new capacity that is planned to start in the next 12 months. Combined with the capacity already restarted, it still doesn't match the tons taken off-line in early 2020. While the overall domestic steel industry operated at 68% utilization, the strength of our differentiated business model, coupled with the passion of our people drove steel dynamics' utilization rate to 86%. Even more remarkable, our flat-rolled steel mills achieved utilization of 97% through the year. In tough environments, the strength of our people and our unique business model becomes even more powerful. As demonstrated this year, during periods of market inflection, we maintained higher volumes compared to our peers, and we gained market share. Uninterrupted low-cost operations help provide customer optionality, value-added product and end market diversification provides flexibility for our commercial teams to go get orders. Unique supply chain solutions create customer value, making us a preferred supplier. And as I mentioned, our internal manufacturing businesses provide meaningful utilization support. We're in an extremely tight flat roll market right now, we can't even supply our internal operations to the extent they would like. Underlying demand for flat-rolled steel recovered much more quickly than expected, coupled with already extremely low supply chain inventories, the flat-rolled steel supply environment tightened in the second half of 2020 and remains extremely tight today. Customers are not yet rebuilding inventory due to limited availability and the speculative risk associated with the accumulation of higher-priced inventory. They appear to be ordering for only immediate needs. As for trade, we believe existing country agreements and legislative steel trade cases that are in place will continue to moderate imports. From an end market perspective, the North American automotive sector has experienced the most rapid rebound, already operating at pre-COVID levels with expectations of production in 2020 of around 16 million units or more. The nonresidential construction sector remains steady as evidenced by record structural and rail division shipments, record steel fabrication shipments and strong customer backlogs. Residential construction has also been strong, generating high demand for related HVAC and appliance products. We're also beginning to see improvements in mining and yellow and green goods at our Engineered Bar Products Division. A slight offset is steel consumption related to the energy sector, which remains historically weak, but is seeing glimpses of turnaround. We are continuing our impressive growth - margin-enhancing growth. We have recently executed several strategic investments that we believe will meaningfully benefit our future through-cycle earnings and free cash flow position. We expanded 2 steel mills by adding 440,000 tons of annual steel rebar production capability, adding product diversification and differentiated customer supply chain. This end market diversification supports higher through-cycle utilization for our structural and Roanoke Bar Steel divisions. The Heartland operations acquired in 2018, continue to expand. The team has been operating at record levels, providing additional internal value-added flat roll production support and operational flexibility for our Butler Flat Roll Division. The acquisition of United Steel Supply has also been an excellent investment. As a regional distributor of prepainted flat-rolled steel construction products, they provide a strategic channel to new, more diversified customers. Our combined brand is powerful in these markets, establishing us as the clear supplier of choice. Since the acquisition of Columbus Flat Roll Division, we have meaningfully increased its through-cycle earnings capability. We have transformed its product portfolio with the expansion of value-added steel products and customer end markets. The team achieved another milestone in July 2020, with a start-up of the new 400,000-ton value-added metallic coating line. Columbus now has 4 value-added coating lines. The investment reduces Columbus's hot-rolled coil exposure and provides a ready southern hot band consumer base for our new Sinton, Texas electric-arc-furnace flat-rolled steel mill when it starts operating later this year. The Sinton investment will be another transformational step function increase to through-cycle cash flow generation, providing next-generation EAF steel production capabilities, new products and new customers. The team's momentum is absolutely unbelievable and to be admired. When you tour the site the excitement there is palpable. We have an incredible depth of experience in the construction, start-up and operation of large steel manufacturing assets. Collectively, we likely have more relevant experience than any other company in the industry. Construction is going well and it's beyond exciting to know we'll be producing steel this coming summer. The new 3 million tons state of the art flat-rolled steel mill will include 2 value-added coating lines, comprised of a 550,000 ton galvanizing line and 250,000 ton paint line. These lines will likely start ahead of the full mill in the second quarter this year using either internally supplied or purchased steel substrate. Our new electric-arc-furnace steel mill is adhering to the same stringent sustainability model as our other steelmaking facilities utilizing state of the art environmental controls and processes to produce high-quality sustainable steel. Our existing electric arc furnace steel mills have a fraction of the greenhouse gas emission and energy intensity of average traditional steelmaking technology. With an 84-inch coil width up to 1 inch thick 100 KSI product, our Texas mill will have product capabilities beyond existing flat-rolled steel producers, competing even more effectively with the integrated steel model and steel imports. The town of Sinton provides a strategic location near the Corpus Christi. We have three targeted regional commercial markets for our new steel mill, which represents over 27 million tons of relevant flat-rolled steel consumption. In the Southern and Western United States and Mexico. We also plan to effectively compete with the steel imports arriving through Houston and the West Coast. Our customers are excited to have a regional flat-rolled steel supplier, we have 3 customers committed to locate on site, representing over 1 million tons of annual processing and consumption capacity. We're still speaking with several other potential on-site customers as well, those that may build facilities off-site but near our campus. Our location provides a significant freight benefit to most of our intended flat roll customers. Compared to the current domestic supply options, we believe the potential custom savings will be at least $20 to $30 per ton, and some would be much higher. This freight advantage, coupled with much shorter lead times, provides a superior customer supply chain solution, allowing us to be a preferred domestic steel supplier in the southern and Western U.S. and Mexico. It allows us to effectively compete with imports, which inherently have long lead times and speculative price risk. We have also made considerable progress concerning our raw material procurement strategy. We completed the acquisition of a Mexican scrap company in August, which I deem a critical step. The acquisition complements our current metals recycling business in both the U.S. and Mexico. The operations are strategically located near high-volume industrial scrap sources throughout Central and Northern Mexico, and prior to our ownership, they shipped 500,000 gross tons of scrap annually, but they have an estimated annual processing capability of almost 2 million gross tons. We plan to increase the volume quickly and have already had success in doing so. Our performance-based operating culture, coupled with our considerable experience in successfully constructing and operating highly profitable steel assets positions us incredibly well to successfully execute this transformational growth. We're not simply adding flat-rolled steel production capacity. We have a differentiated product offering, a unique regional supply chain solution, a significant geographic freight and lead time advantage, and offer a sustainable alternative to regional imports. Our unique culture and the execution of our long-term strategy continues to strengthen our financial position through consistent strong cash flow generation and long-term value creation, differentiating us from others and demonstrating our sustainability. This has clearly been demonstrated during 2020. Again, our commitment is the health and safety of our people, our families and our communities, all while supporting our vendors, serving our customers and sustaining our value creation journey. Our leadership team and our 10,000 strong SDI family drives our success. Collectively, they are second to none. I thank each of you for your passion, strength and commitment to one another during these uncharted times. You truly drive us to excellence. And finally, a sincere and heartfelt thank you to the health care providers and their families, both within Steel Dynamics and those serving individuals across the world. Thank you, and be safe. Be well. So Kevin, please open the call for questions. Thank you. Well, certainly, I think it's intrigued that one keeps hearing about the issues with the market because - I'm sorry, I don't know whether you heard that. I may have been on mute. But it's intriguing to me that there's concern about the strength of the market because right now, it is absolutely incredible. I know the supply side tightness, but demand is very, very, very, strong. Automotive recovered, and it's going to be 16 million units or so this year and probably more. And that's very, very strong and for us, we continue to gain market share, both at flat roll and engineered bar. We see residential construction is very, very strong. We can't supply enough steel currently to appliance, HVAC. Garage - metal garage door panels are incredibly strong. So that's a very a good sector. And although people are a little concerned about perhaps ABI numbers coming off a little bit, we certainly don't see that in our order book. As both Theresa and I have said, we have record sort of booking in the backlog at our fabrication platform. The retail shift to online sort of purchasing is really driving massive expansion of the warehouses - distribution warehouses. And cloud computing, likewise, is increasing dramatically and has a considerable build-out, too. And if you look at just the momentum, the Steel Joist Institute bookings for last year was 17% up year-over-year at 1.36 million tons. That's a considerable market. Just below their previous record back in 2007. 2020 shipments were up 7%, and we're seeing that momentum carry into this year, and we are very, very happy with where we are from a backlog perspective. Yes. So they're a pretty excited team. Let me tell you. And then you get further down into the demand, you look at the truck trailer material handling. Again, they were anticipating a little bit of a flat to down year, but they are - actually changed that. We're anticipating they're going to be up 20% or more. Yellow goods, green goods, we're seeing very, very, very strong demand, and they're telling us at least the, again we don't know what they're doing with other customer - suppliers. But our order book is going to be substantially up throughout this year. Solar is a growing marketplace and a surprisingly large marketplace. And the only real sort of weak area is the oil patch, and we're seeing glimpses of light even there. But they - typically, even in a strong market, they're only 8% of the total marketplace. So it's not a massive, massive impact. So just generally, we see a very, very positive perspective out there. Our order books are incredibly strong. I wish we could make a lot more steel today because we could certainly sell a lot more steel. And we see it sustaining or persisting through the year. Well, the second question, absolutely. We'll be starting both furnaces up at the same time because we're expecting a strong ramp. And I think it's exciting. Again, even through the challenges of last year, that the project still remains on schedule for a summer start-up. And as Theresa said, it's still remaining on a $1.9 billion budget. And if you have seen the - you get on our website and take a look at the drone video that we continually update each year - I don't know, once a month or - not each year. Once a month... Yes, you see a big difference each year. But it's - they're making remarkable progress, and it's a massive project. So they've done incredibly well. That doesn't mean to say there haven't been some zigs and zags along the way and likely have some more to come. But the team has done an outstanding job, I think, overcoming the challenges. We have had a few COVID-related delays in equipment and actually more impactful was ocean freight, getting ships to bring it here. But that's no longer an issue. And fortunately, none of that was on the critical path for the project. So again, timing for the project is still on time for a summer start. As I said, the coating lines, the paint line, the galvanizing line and likely the pickle line should be in good shape for the second quarter. Likely as kind of a May-June start there. And we'll be supplying substrate from Columbus likely and purchasing some substrate from third parties. Yes. I think, Timna, we've always advertised sort of a summer start-up, and that's not changed. Internally, we may have had some more aggressive goals as we typically do within SDI, and if the sun and moon aligned, maybe we could have started up 6 weeks or so earlier. But again, I've got absolutely no problems, no concerns there right now. Everything is progressing well, and the team is doing a phenomenal job. Yes. I think the - it's certainly more than likely that we will see an infrastructure package, as you know, which is going to be a great sort of general benefit. But right now, it's difficult to discern where those dollars are going to be spent specifically and hence, where the impact will be from a volume perspective. Certainly, just the upward momentum that it will provide the economy in general will certainly help us. And any actual infrastructure, steel consuming infrastructure projects will be to our benefit. But to actually try to estimate, calculate a volume when you don't really know where the dollars are going to be spent, I think that it would be disingenuous for us to suggest. Yes. Well, I guess, the only impact would be it's such a rapid increase in a short period of time, and you're seeing the difference between the market and our inventory. But just in the scrap market as a whole, obviously, it's gone up some the last month or two, quite considerably. We would imagine that we'll retreat from the current highs or moderate somewhat. It's not going to take all a couple of hundred dollars back, but it's going to retreat, we believe, because the strong pricing is driven a substantial increase in the flow, particularly the obsolete grades. People are out there collecting it's flowing in dramatically, and the industry has actually dropped the scale prices. And so I would expect the market prices to drop over the next couple of months. For prime scrap, flows are fully reestablished in connectivity with the automotive business coming back. We expect prices there to soften, but not quite as much as obsolete grades. So the shred to prime spread will likely expand a little more than it is today. And we think the export market will remain relatively soft. And so there's - again, we feel pricing is going to moderate. I think despite China listing its import restrictions, it's not going to impact the ferrous market dramatically, not in the U.S. anyway. But it is going to give us - or has given us significant upside on nonferrous. Obviously, as many of you know the nonferrous, the copper, aluminum absorber, those sorts of grades, really didn't have much of a home for the last year or so. With them opening up, they're able to increase the margins there. So I think that's a positive for us. Well, I can't speak for other companies. I would suggest that, as we've said in the past, we will expand or grow to support our steel mills regionally. So we did that. We bought some Sims yards around our Columbus facility, just to baseload that mill. And Zimmer, obviously, is destined to supply some scrap to Sinton quite cost effectively. So you may see us, again, just add smaller opportunities, but we're not going to be in consolidating the whole scrap market or anything like that, for sure. Regarding scrap supply, I think you're seeing what has been typical in the past. Scrap is incredibly elastic. Certainly, the obsolete grades are incredibly elastic and has - as scrap pricing has increased dramatically in the last month or 2, it's amazing how folks get out there and that flow increases dramatically. And so I don't see a long-term issue with scrap supply in any way shape or form. And with the rationalization of the integrated side of the industry, it's quite possible that you just start to see them actually produce pig iron, which would help the supply balance - supply-demand balance as well. Well, John, simply, I don't understand it either. Again, as I tried to suggest earlier, this isn't just a supply side tightness. Demand, the markets are incredibly strong and robust right now. And we see that persisting. Certainly very, very, very strong first half, and I think it's going to continue into the second half. And I don't see any appreciable change or driver out there to change that. To your point, okay, we're out a few tons here, incremental tons relatively to the market anyway, the second half of the year. Big River reportedly is running. We don't see them in the marketplace necessarily, but they have got their capacity up and running pretty strong from all reports. So there's not that additional capacity there. So I don't see where the relief is going to be. I don't see, to be honest, the Biden administration changing the trade environment materially, at least not near term. I think they recognize that China is a massive threat. Their approach to them might be different than the Trump administration. They will likely ally with our friends in Europe and in places. But they're not - they will likely change 2.32, but I think they will be very cognizant that there needs to be trade controls there. And there are underlying legislative trade constraints in place that aren't just an executive order, they're legislated, and they're going to be there for years to come, Section 201 countervailing duties and [indiscernible]. So I don't see necessarily the - an import flood. The arbitrage certainly has grown to China. But nonetheless, lead times are months and months out. And you see some specialty items coming in, but I don't see any dramatic change in the import profile. So I don't see where the pressure comes off the accelerator to drop $370 here in the next, whatever it is, 6 months. So I agree. I don't understand it either. We don't see - we certainly don't see it within the fundamental drivers of the marketplace. Well, I think the border wall, to be honest, was relatively incremental. We didn't see much of that product. And that tends to be at the low end, commodity hot band side of the business that we tend not to play in, to any great extent anyway. So - but I don't see that as a massive impact to demand. Well, and that pipeline - actually, our pipeline, to be honest, a massive amount of that pipe has already been made and is laying on the ground. So it's not going to have a massive impact. Well, to those on the phone still, we certainly appreciate you're listening in and you're supportive of your company. And I think it's just one last comment that, I guess, didn't really come out clearly. People are focused on price, and it's not price that matters, we're a margin. We're a metal spread business. And again, we anticipate a very strong demand year that's going to support pricing on the price side on the market side. Supply side, inventories remain very, very low. We expect import activity to remain very moderate. A significant portion of the idled blast furnace capacity, we expect to remain down, and lead times are extended. So you couple that with a moderating scrap environment, we see that metal spreads themselves are going to persist sort of higher than the normal through-cycle levels and should be very, very helpful for us, and we're anticipating a remarkable year, in all honesty. That being said, to our customers out there, folks, we had an absolutely phenomenal year - last year, and we couldn't do it without you. So thank you for your support. Similarly for our vendors and service providers. Thank you. And most importantly, thank you to each and every employee out there. It was an absolutely tremendous year. I think it vulcanizes or just affirms our business model, that we are a differentiated company. To make $1 billion of free cash in a year like that, I think just spells out clearly that we're a different company today. And with Sinton coming online, it's going to add 25% to our steelmaking capability. That's going to be a significant step function increase in our through-cycle cash generation. So we've done a phenomenal job, and we're going to keep doing it, and we can't do it without each and every one of you. So thank you. Go ahead, have a great day. Be safe, stay healthy."

            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to add my sincere appreciation and congratulations to our entire Steel Dynamics team. As Mark mentioned, we achieved numerous milestones despite the social and economic impacts from the coronavirus. We achieved revenues of $9.6 billion derived from record fabrication shipments and our second highest annual steel shipments. Operating income of $847 million and net income of $551 million or $2.59 per diluted share, and cash flow from operations of $987 million and adjusted EBITDA of $1.2 billion, a truly extraordinary performance considering all the peripheral challenges. Regarding our fourth quarter 2020 performance specifically, net income was $188 million or $0.89 per diluted share, which includes financing costs related to our October 2020 refinancing activities of $0.04 per diluted share. Costs net of capitalized interest associated with the construction of our Sinton, Texas flat-rolled steel mill of $0.05 per diluted share, a noncash asset impairment charge related to noncore oil and gas investments of $17 million or $0.06 per diluted share net of noncontrolling interest; and finally, a tax benefit related to the reduction of a valuation allowance of $13 million or $0.06 per diluted share net of noncontrolling interest. Excluding these items, fourth quarter 2020 adjusted net income was $0.97 per diluted share, above our adjusted guidance of $0.80 to $0.84 per share due to stronger-than-anticipated December flat-rolled steel shipments as order activity remains very strong. Our fourth quarter 2020 revenues were $2.6 billion, 12% higher than sequential third quarter results as steel and metals recycling pricing improved. Our fourth quarter 2020 operating income was $259 million, $103 million or 66% higher than sequential third quarter results. Due to higher realized flat-rolled steel pricing more than offsetting increased scrap costs. As we discuss our business this morning, you'll find that we are positive heading into 2021, considering underlying steel fundamentals and confident in our unique earnings catalyst. All 3 of our operating platforms performed well in 2020 and in the fourth quarter, with the steel metals recycling teams achieving their best quarterly performance of the year. Our steel operations generated $298 million of operating income in the fourth quarter, more than double third quarter sequential earnings as flat-rolled steel selling values increased significantly throughout the fourth quarter driving expanded metal margins. Fourth quarter steel shipments of 2.7 million tons were on par with sequential third quarter volume. Our steel mills operated at 84% of their capability during the quarter, well above the industry average of 72%. For the full year 2020, our steel facilities achieved numerous production and shipment records. The platform's full year operating income was $906 million with shipments of 10.7 million tons, again, representing our second highest volume and only 1% less than our record, a truly phenomenal performance. As a reminder, we still have additional market opportunity. It's mostly in the long product side of our steel operations. Based on our existing annual deal shipping capability of over 13 million tons. And as our new Texas Steel Mill begins ramping up, we will have over 16 million tons of steel shipping capabilities. Our value-added product mix, supply chain differentiation and downstream manufacturing businesses provide a powerful strategic advantage to sustain higher steel mill utilization during all demand environment and to increase our through-cycle cash flow. As overall manufacturing rates improved and domestic steel production increased during 2020, scrap generation and demand strengthened in the fourth quarter, resulting in improved pricing and volume. Operating income from our metals recycling operations was $27 million, 75% higher than the sequential third quarter. For the full year 2020, operating income from our metals recycling business was meaningfully higher than prior year, almost 60% higher at $45 million based on higher and more stable fair scrap prices. Our metals recycling operations provide a competitive advantage for sourcing ferrous scrap for our steel mills, allowing for increased scrap quality, melt efficiency and reduction of company-wide working capital requirements. Our vertically connected operating model benefits both platforms. Our steel fabrication business had solid operating income of $25 million in the fourth quarter compared to sequential third quarter record earnings of $39 million. Lower earnings were the result of seasonally lower shipments and metal spread compression as average selling values declined and steel raw material input cost increase. For the full year 2020, fabrication achieved another record year with operating income of $121 million and volume of 666,000 tons. Congratulations to the team. We continue to see strong order inquiry and customer optimism. Although with rapidly rising steel costs, we will likely see margin compression in the coming months. The order backlog is about a 6-month backlog, and the steel raw material that we put on the ground is generally around 2.5 months of steel inventory. So we're likely to see trough margins sometime in the first quarter for fabrication. But the order entry is very strong right now, and they're actually selling at record high joist-and-deck pricing. So we expect to see that crack very quickly as we go into the second quarter. For our cash flow from operations, our cash generation continues to be incredibly strong based on our differentiated business model and highly variable cost structure. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we generated $138 million of cash flow from operations and for the full year, $987 million. We are simply even more agile today than ever before, we more than doubled our average annual free cash flow to $1.2 billion from 2016 to 2020. That's compared to the previous 5-year period. Even in midst coronavirus, we generated $980 million of free cash flow this year. Our 2020 capital investments totaled $1.2 billion, of which $928 million was invested in our new Texas flat-rolled steel mill. For 2021, we currently believe capital investments will be roughly $950 million, with the Texas steel mill representing about $800 million of that amount. The Texas steel mill is expected to be within plan of $1.9 billion. Regarding shareholder distributions, we maintained our quarterly cash dividend at $0.25 per common share after increasing up 4% in the first quarter of this year or the first quarter of 2020, I should say. Since 2016, we've also increased or invested $1.3 billion in our common stock, representing over 15% of our outstanding shares. We repurchased $107 million in 2020 and $444 million remains authorized for repurchase at the end of the year. Additionally, we opportunistically accessed the investment-grade capital markets in both June and October of 2020, extending our debt maturity profile. Since becoming investment grade, we've significantly reduced our effective interest rate from 5.4% to 3.5%. These actions reflect the strength of our capital foundation, consistent cash flow capability and strong liquidity profile and the continued optimism and confidence in our future. We entered 2020 in a position of strength. And ample liquidity, and we remain in a position of strength as we enter 2021. At December 31, 2020, liquidity was over $2.5 billion, comprised of cash of $1.4 billion and our unsecured revolver of $1.2 billion. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes responsible strategic growth with shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that's complemented with a variable share repurchase program, while also being dedicated to preserving our investment-grade credit rating. We're squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable optimized long-term value creation. We also believe sustainability is a part of our long-term value creation, and we're dedicated to our people, our communities and our environment. We're committed to operating our business with the highest integrity and have been since our founding. Today, we produce steel using electric-arc-furnace technology with recycled ferrous scrap as the primary raw material. EAF steel production technology currently has the least environmental impact. It is the most cost-effective and provides the most operational flexibility. With the addition of our mills recycling and fabrication platforms, we intentionally developed a vertically connected operating model, created an almost closed-loop manufacturing business, which both benefits us financially and reduces our environmental impact. In 2020, we shared our qualitative climate-related goals in our most recent sustainability report. During 2021, we plan to also adopt quantitative goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, participate in greater renewable energy use and continue to invest in energy efficiency opportunities. We are currently in the process of assessing the use of renewable energy alternatives at our new Texas steel mill as well. Our sustainability and environmental impact strategy is an ongoing journey, and we're moving forward with the intention to make a positive difference. We plan to continue to address these matters and to play a leadership role in developing innovative ways to reduce our impact on the environment. And on a personal note, I want to thank our teams for their passion and generosity and for the care they're showing for one another's health and safety. Thank you. Mark? I think, Jim Anderson, this morning told me the market is \"red hot.\" Not each year. Applicable [indiscernible]. Yes, no problem, Timna. From a CapEx perspective, you're actually exactly correct. Simply had about $100 million that shifted from the fourth quarter of 2020 into the first half of 2021. So wherein, as last quarter, I would have suggested CapEx for 2021 would be about $850 million. It's now about $950 million. Unlikely, about $600 million to $700 million of the $950 million will be spent in the first half of the year. As it relates to the time line of Sinton, Mark? Yes, absolutely. Chris. From the perspective of Sinton stand-alone, Sinton is likely to have a working capital ramp of somewhere around $130 million to $150 million, including all of the inventory and receivables. That will be a ramp. So in the second half of the year. You might get some of the raw materials, so maybe $50 million to $60 million in the first half. But most of that will come second half of 2021 and then into the first half of 2022. As it relates to company-wide working capital, you would have seen that we did have a draw of about $200 million in the fourth quarter related to primarily pricing of raw materials and of finished goods that would be in inventory at that point in time. You're likely to see a bit more of a draw as we're expecting to have higher prices and volumes sustained into the first quarter, but not as much of a draw as you saw in the fourth quarter. So I would say the first half, you're going to see a draw more than you typically would see. Second half, you'd see that moderate. So from a capital allocation perspective, obviously, we're still focused on a big capital investment year in 2021. That being said, the cash flow generation that we've been having is quite strong, and we would expect to see that continue in 2021. So from a capital allocation perspective, we would expect to see the positive dividend profile continue. Once Sinton is up and running, that's likely going to be an opportunity for another kind of step function increase in our dividend policy as we like to grow the dividend with sustainable free cash flow. As we have excess cash flow along the way, that's with the share buyback programs for it's to complement the dividend profile because we see the dividends as forever. So you're likely to see us start to look for opportunities potentially from time to time in the market from a share buyback once we get past more of the larger spend for Sinton in the first half of the year. Mark, is that... Okay. Yes. I'm going to let Mark talk about the scrap markets. But as it relates to the scrap flows, there really hasn't been any change. We're still turning inventories on a monthly basis, both at the mills recycling operations, and we tend to keep somewhere between 3 to 4 weeks on the ground at the steel mills. So I can't really address why it may have been greater than you typically see, but there hasn't been a change in how we're using or accounting for the scrap. I think one just has to - so as we look at scrap generation, we see it continuing to increase. We see it increasing even more quickly than potentially some of the additional demand that will be derived from some of the new EAF capacity coming online domestically. But one also has to look at the additional HBI, DRI and other projects that are either coming online, have been announced or being contemplated by even the blast furnace participants. So I think there should be ample raw material as Mark's said. Yes. I'm sorry, I made you ask, I skipped over. I didn't mean to. So hot-rolled and P&O for the quarter was 749,000 tons, cold rolled, 139,000 tons, and coated products were 973,000 tons for a total of about 1.9 million tons of flat roll. The coated number was 973,000 tons. The XL pipeline is hard to tell how much that may have an influence and what the Biden administration may do going forward with additional kind of oil and gas, obviously, is not going to help. From that perspective as Mark said, at least in the fourth quarter, which was prior to some of these things happening, we were starting to see some orders come in from those customers, both at Columbus and at our Engineered Bar Products Division, where we would have the most impact. But I just think it's a little too early to tell. Well, in 2021, the provisions that allow us to expense the fixed asset investment once we start-up Sinton are still in place. So as long as those provisions are still in place, we'll be able to basically pay maybe 3% state cash taxes in 2020 and likely remain very low - I'm sorry, in 2021 and likely remain very low in 2022 as well. But obviously, we need to watch the administration and things that may change according to that. But right now, we're still planning on the benefit in total being somewhere around $300 million to $350 million of cash tax savings between 2021 and 2022. Well, again, for us, David, from a scrap mix perspective, the mills keep 3 to 4 months on hand. So whatever your estimation would be from - I'm sorry, weeks on hand. So whatever your estimation would be from an index perspective, you can just apply that, and you're going to get very close to what will actually happen."

We appreciate your time and thanks for joining us today. We continue to operate safely and are still closely monitoring the COVID-19 situation. Protecting the health and welfare of our teams is our highest priority. I thank each of them for their continued diligence and commitment. I'm incredibly proud to work alongside each of them, especially during this unsettled time. They are a very special group, accomplishing extraordinary things. We are committed to them, their families and our communities, all while supporting our suppliers and meeting the needs of our customers. So without further ado, I will hand the mike to Teresa to provide further insights into our strong third quarter performance.\nTheresa Wagler: Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Our third quarter 2020 net income was $100 million or $0.47 per diluted share above our guidance of $0.42 to $0.46 per share due to stronger than anticipated flat rolled steel shipments and metals recycling earnings. Our third quarter results were reduced by cost net of capitalized interest associated with the construction of our Sinton Texas Flat Roll Steel Mill of approximately $0.04 per diluted share. Excluding these construction costs, third quarter 2020 adjusted net income was $0.51 per diluted share, also above our adjusted guidance of $0.46 to $0.50 per share. One comment before proceeding, the compatibility of third quarter 2020 financial results to prior year amounts isn't favorable. But to achieve what our teams have achieved in this environment is simply incredible. And I want to add to Mark's comments and sincerely thank and congratulate them. Our third quarter 2020 revenues were $2.3 billion, 11% higher than second quarter sequential results, as volumes improved across all three operating platforms. Our third quarter 2020 operating income was $156 million, fairly steady with the sequential second quarter, but 32% lower than prior year results due to lower steel prices resulting in metal spread compression. However, currently, we've experienced a very strong rebound in domestic steel demand from the second quarter sequential COVID-19 induced trough environment. Customers steel inventory levels were extremely low entering the second quarter, and then were drawn down even further based on market uncertainty. From an operating platform perspective, our steel operations delivered an outstanding performance during this challenging time. Third quarter steel shipments of 2.7 million ton were 7% higher than the sequential second quarter shipments, and on par with prior year's third quarter volume. Our steel mills operated at 85% of their capability, while the rest of the domestic industry operated at only 64%. Due to the momentum from our record first quarter volume, our year-to-date steel shipments are only 1% lower than in 2019. Our ability to maintain higher steel volumes is a result of our value added highly diversified product offerings, our supply chain differentiation and our internal downstream manufacturing businesses. However, based on timing and the impact of flat roll contract related sales, our average quarterly realized steel price per ton declined sequentially, more than offsetting the benefit of lower scrap costs and higher volumes. Our average quarterly realized external steel sales price decreased $21 per ton sequentially to $734 in the third quarter, an average scrap costs only declined $7 per ton, resulting in steel metal margin compression. The result was third quarter 2020 operating income of $144 million for our steel operation, 17% lower than the sequential second quarter.  As states began reopening and domestic manufacturing improved, scrap supply and collection increased. This in combination with higher domestic steel production drove significantly higher ferrous scrap volume. Our operating income from our mills recycling operations was $15 million in the third quarter of 2020 compared to a $6 million loss in the sequential second quarter. We also are benefiting from the addition of Zimmer, our newly acquired Mexican metals recycling business. The acquisition was completed in August. It's a key cog in our ongoing raw material strategy for our new Texas Steel Mill. Our Metals Recycling Operations provide a competitive advantage for sourcing ferrous scrap or steel mills allowing for increased scrap quality; melt efficiency and reduction of company wide working capital. Our vertically connected operating model benefits both platforms. Our Steel Fabrication business had a record operating income of $39 million in the third quarter, compared to sequential results of $27 million due to record shipments and margin expansion as product pricing increased while steel input costs declined. We continue to experience a strong order backlog and customers remain positive concerning our non residential construction projects. In fact, the Steel and Joist Institute recorded one of its strongest historical booking months this last September. Our cash generation continues to be strong based on our differentiated business model and highly variable cost structure. During the third quarter of 2020, we generated $152 million of cash flow from operations and $849 million during the first nine months of the year. We also invested $855 million in fixed assets, of which $640 million was invested in our new Texas Flat Rolls Steel Mill. For the fourth quarter of 2020, we believe capital investments will be roughly $400 million, of which our new Texas Steel Mill represents $360 million. We currently estimate capital investments for the full year of 2021 to be in the range of $850 million, with the Texas Steel Mill representing about $700 million of that amount as their operations are still expected to begin mid year 2021. In addition, I've been getting a lot of questions about our effective tax rate. For 2020, the effective cash tax rate will be approximately 20% for the year. However, based on credits we expect to receive due to the certain Sinton Texas Mill, we would expect 2020 cash taxes to only be approximately 3%. Regarding shareholder distributions, we maintained our quarterly cash dividend at $0.25 per common share after increasing at 4% in the first quarter of this year. Since 2016, we've also invested $1.3 billion in our common stock, representing over 15% of our outstanding shares, and $444 million remains authorized for repurchase at the end of the third quarter.  Additionally, we opportunistically access the investment grade capital markets in both June and October of this year, extending our debt maturity profile and significantly reducing our effective interest rate. We're thrilled with the differentiation our investment grade bond investors recognize that Steel Dynamics provides in our fundamental free cash flow generation capability on a through cycle basis. As evident in October, we issued $350 million of 1.65%, seven year paper, and $400 million as 3.25% 30 year paper with proceeds intended to refinance our existing 2025 notes, and other general corporate purposes. These actions reflect the strength of our capital foundation, consistent cash flow capability and strong liquidity profile, demonstrating our confidence and our sustainable through cash strong generation. We enter 2020 in a position of strength with ample cash and available liquidity of $2.8 billion. And at the end of the third quarter, we maintain strong liquidity of $2.5 billion comprised of cash of $1.3 billion and our fully available revolving unsecured credit facility of $1.2 billion. Pro forma our October financing activities, our liquidity would have been $2.8 billion. As a reminder, you're seeing this is our performance in the current market environment. And you can look historically at our financial performance to determine either a future trough or peak, we've grown significantly transformed our Columbus Flat Roll division, further diversified our steel product offerings and incorporated even more levers to increase our through cycles financial performance.  In addition, collectively, our primary reason and plan strategic growth investments provide an estimated incremental annual future EBITDA of over $425 million on a through cycle historical spread basis. This estimate includes our Texas Steel Mill and third Columbus Metallic Coating line, as well as our two operational rebar expansions. We are simply even more agile today than ever before. We more than doubled our annual free cash flow from operations to $1.1 billion from 2015 to 2019, compared to 2010 to 2014. We are dedicated to preserving our investment grade credit rating, our capital allocation strategy prioritizes responsible strategic growth with appropriate shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that is complemented with a variable share repurchase program. We are squarely positioned for the continuation of the sustainable optimized long-term value creation. Some of you also use some more detailed information for flat roll operations. I'll give you the third quarter shipment profile now; our hot roll coiled shipments for the third quarter were 803,000 tons. Our cold rolled shipments were 144,000 tons. And our coated shipments were 1,013,000 tons for a total of 1,960,000 tons. And on a personal note, I really do want to thank our teams for their passion and their generosity, and really the care they're showing for each other's health and safety. Mark?\nMark Millett: Thank you, Teresa. Thank you for clearly articulating the differentiation of SDI amongst its competition, I think we've just navigated just navigated to an incredible cycle, then turn and then recovery and the performance that our team is turned in is just the beyond words, it's humbling. And speaking of them, in the end, nothing really is more important than the safety of our team. Safety is and always will be our number one value. Our safety performance continues to be significantly better than industry averages, but our continued goal is to have no injuries among our people. Our safety performance is further improved from a severity perspective. However, among some of the operating platforms, our third quarter safety results were not what we would like to see for our teams. We all must be continuous aware of our surroundings, and our fellow team members, I asked all of us to keep safety top of mind to control safety, we can take charge of safety, both in the traditional sense as it relates to keeping one another in good health.  Steel Fabrication platform delivered a remarkable third quarter performance with record quarterly volume and earnings. Our fabrication order backlog remains strong is higher than it was this time last year, and in fact higher than 2018. Customers remain positive concerning non residential construction projects. We anticipate the strength remaining through the rest of this year and into 2021. The metals recycling volumes and earnings also meaningfully improved in the third quarter. As states rescinded shelter in place mandates, and the automotive supply chain restarted, scrap flows dramatically improved through the third quarter. The same time domestic steel production utilization increased from an average 56% to an estimated 64% and first scraps demand significantly improved. As flows continue to increase and steel production remains steady. We believe scrap prices should remain fairly stable through the remainder of the year, with likely seasonal price appreciation in December, January timeframe.  We also welcome the Zimmer team into the Steel Dynamics family. The addition of this Mexican metals recycling business is a meaningful step in our raw material sourcing strategy for our Texas Flat Roll Steel Mill. The combination of Zimmer with our existing operations has already resulted in new business, and we're excited for the continued growth. The steel team continues to achieve an outstanding performance, especially considering the environment and a sincere thank you to all involved, especially our customers for helping us achieve volumes that only modestly less than record shipments achieved in the first quarter of this year. As a result of COVID-19 related implications, a considerable number of high cost blast furnaces flat roll steel operations were idled earlier this year, potentially as much as 15 million tons. Since that timeframe, as steel demand and pricing has improved, an estimated 5 to 6 million tons has been brought back online. Although some additional volume may return, we don't believe all of it will come back. The cost of restart along with through cycle market pricing not supporting ongoing profitability will likely keep significant volume curtailed, offsetting the new capacity increases to be seen over the next 24 months.  While the overall domestic industry operated only 64%; the strength of our differentiated business model, coupled with the passion of our people drove SDI steel mill production utilization to 85%. Even more remarkable, our flat roll steel mills achieve utilization 99%. In tough environments, the strength of our people and our superior business model become even more evident. As demonstrated this year, during periods of market inflection we maintain higher volumes compared to our steel peers and gain market share. And uninterrupted low cost operations provide the greatest customer optionality. Our broad product portfolio and end market diversification within value added market niches drives flexibility for our commercial teams.  Superior Supply Chain Solutions create additional value for our customers, making us a preferred place to shop. Furthermore, a powerful driver is the optionality of internal steel sourcing from our captive manufacturing businesses, what we call pull through volume. To put this in perspective, our steel fabrication platform and steel processing locations purchased 2.3 million tons of steel in 2019. Only about half of this volume is typically sourced from SDI own steel mills, but in difficult markets, where the option to direct the higher proportion of these orders internally. As states continue to reopen to varying degrees, many steel consuming businesses have resumed operations. At the same time, customer inventory levels have been reduced to extremely low levels. This combination of increasing demand coupled with low inventory reserves has resulted in a tight flat roll steel supply environment. As a result, lead times stretched out and flat roll steel pricing has significantly improved. The hot rolled coil CIU Price Index increased almost $160 per ton from the beginning of August to September, and has since increased another $40 to $50 per ton. The automotive supply chain has experienced the most significant recovery, attending production levels of either close to or in some cases more than pre-COVID levels of concern. Our construction sector remains resilient and related steel demand has been steady as evidenced by our structural rail division volume, and our record steel fabrication shipments and strong customer backlog. The order activity from our construction sector customers combined with strength in our steel fabrication order backlog support our optimism for continued strength through the rest of this year, heading into 2021. Residential Construction has also been surprisingly strong, generating high demand for HVAC and appliance products. The energy sector though continues to be structurally weak and will likely require long than recovery period. Related to our growth, we have a summary update of recent investments in our most recently investor deck. In the last 12 to 24 months, we've executed several strategic investments that have already or will meaningfully benefit our through cycle earnings and free cash flow position. We expanded two steel mills by the combined addition of 440,000 tons of annual steel rebar production capability, providing product diversification and a differentiated customer supply chain. This end market diversification is providing for hire through cycle utilization for our structural and Roanoke steel divisions. We continue to expand capacity at Harlan. It is an 800,000 ton value added flat roll steel processor. The team has been operating at record levels, providing additional internal production support and operational flexibility for our Butler Flat Roll division, increasing the utilization of our steel assets and broadening our value added product portfolio. The acquisition of 75% of United Steel Supply has also been an excellent investment in addition to our portfolio. As a local distributor of pre painted construction products, it has provided meaningful channels and new more diversified customers. United Steel Supply continues to break shipping records. Since the acquisition of Columbus Flat Roll division in 2014, we have meaningfully increased it through cycling and its capability. We've transformed its product portfolio with the expansion of its value added steel capabilities and the diversification of its customer base.  The team achieved another milestone in July with a startup of a new 400,000 ton of value add coating line. Columbus now has four higher margin coating lines there. The investment both reduces Columbus' hot roll coil exposure and provides a ready Southern hot band consumer base for our Sinton Texas Steel Mill. We remain incredibly excited about the new generation of flat rolled steel mill, is significant contribution to our growth and future earnings capability. As Theresa explained, we purposefully ended 2020 from a point of financial strength, providing ample liquidity for the required investment associated with this transformational project. Our team has incredible depth of experience in the construction, startup and operation of large steel manufacturing assets. Collectively, we believe they have more experience than exists in any other company in our industry. The Texas' team's performance and momentum continues to be absolutely remarkable. Construction is going extremely well. We're still on track for a mid year 2021 start date. We're having frequent conversations with equipment suppliers regarding the impact of COVID-19 and currently don't believe our planned schedule has been meaningfully impacted. The new state of the art 3 million tons steel mill will include two value added coating lines, comprised of 550,000 tons of galvanizing and 250,000 tons of prepaint. We'll follow the same stringent sustainability model as either steel making facilities with state of the art environmental controls and processes. Our existing steel mills have a fraction of the greenhouse gas emission and energy intensity of average traditional steel making technology. With an 84-inch coil width and up to one inch thick, 100 KSI products; the Texas mill will have capabilities beyond the existing electric arc furnace produces competing even more effectively with the integrated steel model and foreign competition. The Steel Mill is strategically located in Central Texas, near Corpus Christi. We have three target regional sales markets for the Sinton Mill, representing over 27 million tons of relevant flat roll steel consumption. In the Southern and West Coast, United States and Mexico. We also plan to effectively compete with heavy imports in Houston and the West Coast. Our customers are excited to have a regional flat roll steel supplier. We now have three customers committed to locate on site representing between 800,000 and a million tons of annual processing and consumption capacity; we're still speaking with several other interested parties. The Sinton location provides a significant freight benefit to most of our intended customers relative to the current supply chain options. This trade advantage coupled with much shorter lead times; provides a superior customer supply chain, allowing us to be the preferred domestic steel supplier in the South and Western US. It also allows us to effectively compete with imports, which inherently have long lead times and speculative price risk. We've also made considerable progress concerning our raw material strategy for Sinton. As I mentioned, we completed the acquisition of a Mexican scrap company in August. This is a critical step in our strategy; the acquisition complements our current metals recycling business in both the US and Mexico, and Zimmer's operations are strategically located near high volume industrial scrap sources throughout Central and Northern Mexico. Prior to our ownership, they shipped approximately 500,000 gross tons of scrap annually, but they have an estimated annual processing capability of almost 2 million gross tons a year, we plan to ramp up that volume quickly. We believe our performance based operating culture, coupled with our consumer experience in successfully constructing and operating highly profitable steel mills positions is incredibly well to successfully execute the transformational Texas growth investment. We're not simply adding the flat roll production capacity. We have a differentiated product offering, a unique regional supply chain solution, a significant geographic freight and lead time advantage and offer an important import alternative to a region in need of options. Our unique culture and the execution of a long-term strategy continue to strengthen our financial position through consistent, strong cash flow generation and long-term value creation. Clearly differentiates us from our competition and demonstrating our sustainability.  This is clearly been demonstrated during the past two quarters. Again, our commitment is to the health and safety of our people, our families and our communities, all while supporting our vendors serving our customers, and sustaining our value creation journey. Our team is extraordinary. And I would like to thank each of them for their patience, resilience and commitment during these uncharted times. They have an indomitable spirit that drives us to excellent. Additionally, a sincere and heartfelt thank you to the healthcare providers and their families within steel Nanites and those serving individuals across the world.  Thank you, be safe, and be well. So Shomali, please open the call for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Seth Rosenfeld with Exane BNP Paribas.\nSethRosenfeld: Good morning. Thank you for taking our questions today. If I can kick off please just with a question on kind of the near to medium term outlook for demand. In your prepared remarks you presented quite an optimistic outlook on steel demand highlighting both autos and construction. Can you just speak with regards to the outlook for Q4? How should we expect the trade off between the kinds of post COVID real demand recovery to potentially offset by normal seasonality that we've seen in the years past? What should we expect per shipments in your mills and fab businesses over that time period? And then just a follow up on that with regards to construction in particular, your comments with regards to the backlog in particular can be much more positive, we heard last week from one of your peers. Can you speak a bit about the regions or maybe the private versus public sector mix that's contributing to the optimism? Thank you.\nMarkMillett: Certainly, I would carry my comments that, as I've said in the past, you can, I think always clearly see what's happening in the marketplace through one's order book. And I think our order books across our space are in pretty good shape. But generally, obviously, fat roll demand is going to cutting probably strong momentum. There's a robust market recovery there, inventories are at almost a starkly low levels. We have low import activity, there's a -- although is diminishing, the arbitrage is still somewhat unattractive. So the supply side is very, very tight; lead times, as you see are extending; mills are -- some mills anyway have late deliveries. And all-in-all, that's driving market pricing up significantly, quite helpfully.  That being said, obviously, our third quarter results were impacted by sort of contract pricing lag. And that will revert obviously in Q4, but just specifically to the market times up in automotive, the US producers have I think achieved their anticipated 90% run rate, pre-COVID run rates. And I would say that the European producers actually are exceeding that. They're more than 100% of pre-COVID for sure. And that's being supported, obviously by low inventory levels in the dealerships. Dealerships that I talked to are struggling to get product. And I think if you look at just the automotive market in general, it's supports that; used car prices are extremely high today. And interestingly, that's somehow an impact on the scrap market. Because hoaxer, the pickup guys are keeping their cars longer.  And it's given a little tightness to the scrap supply. But nonetheless, it's a good market environment. And we believe that's going to continue. The low interest rate environment is obviously a positive as our low gas prices. I saw just yesterday, our gas prices dropped to $1 95. And so that tends to help certainly the truck sales. And I think generally, that's going to continue, the sort of urban desertion of people moving out of the cities. Rideshare sharing and Uber and most not necessarily as available. And people are needing cars. And I think automotives will remain strong. It's not just a sort of a two month three month replenishment of inventory. In that environment, we've been fortunate, we've been gaining market share. And I think both in flat roll and in MSPQ, just generally manufacturing is strong. We see residential construction, incredibly strong. And I think that's having an impact both the new construction and HVAC and appliance and garage door products, but also kind of the do-it-yourself renovation projects. There's been a change, I think, in consumer spending, people are not going out as much; they see themselves not going on vacations. And so they are actually I think spending that cash closer to home. And I think that's a positive going to next year for sure. Energy, low gas prices, low energy prices; global demand is there. So I think that's going to be weak for some time to come. A very, very strong positive is non residential construction. It's been in all honesty, incredibly resilient.  We see that in sort of heavy structural products demand fabricators are busy. Service center processes are buying stock off of our floor. And so I think there's generally low inventory through the supply chain there. And if you look at the Steel Joist Institute information, I think is incredibly persuasive. In September, Steel Joist Institute bookings were its third highest month in history; bookings are about 10% year-over-year. And it's largely driven by warehouse expansion and you keep seeing the e- commerce increasing; e-commerce in the first quarter at 11%, last quarter is about 16%. So the Amazons of the world are the distribution channel is going to remain strong. I think just yesterday, on Bloomberg, you saw Amazon reporting that they're going to be constructing about a 1,000 warehouses in the next year or two. So that business is going to be incredibly, incredibly positive, going forward. And that's translating into sort of a record backlog for new millennium, and is obviously [Indiscernible] into strong building products on the flat roll side of our business. It's HVAC pre paint is very, very strong. So I think, generally, it's a very, very positive environment, and we're very bullish. Again, you can tell what may happen as the pandemic continue to unravel. But through our eyes, through our order book today, is an incredibly solid, positive upward momentum.\nTheresaWagler: So, Seth, your other questions related to the mix between private and public sector on the construction side, I would tell you that it's very heavily weighted at this point to private sector. Hopefully, if maybe some things happen in Washington, it could get more into the public sector eventually. But we're not seeing that at this point to Mark's earlier comments. And from a seasonality perspective as it relates to volumes. And we did come off record volumes for the fabrication, I'm not sure that will stay as strong, but we'd expect to see very strong shipments heading into the fourth quarter. And the split on the steel side, you really I think need to look at a split between long products and flat products. It's our estimation that given the strong demand that is existing today for the flat rolled products, I doubt you're going to see a lot of seasonality, or at least much less than you would see typically. And the long product, you're likely to see some but again, I think coming off of the very weak second quarter, we would expect to see some momentum carry into the fourth quarter environment and meet that seasonality impact.\nOperator: Our next question is from Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank.\nChristopherTerry: Hi, Mark and Theresa. And a quick question for me, your utilization rate is about 20% above the industry, I think you said you had market share gains in autos, just wanted if you could elaborate on other product basis or end markets where you're getting those market gains from. Thanks.\nMarkMillett: I think from automotive perspective, we are, the fact that we remain running, gave customer base optionality and just the availability of product for one thing, but secondly, the whole ESG sustainability story, I think is planning incredibly well for us and for electric arc furnace produces, particularly with the Europeans in all honesty and as they see their North American options. The fact that we have a wonderful sort of recycling ESG story is helping us now. So I think in the market share automotive is strong, also SPQ in auto, obviously, we constructed and ramped up the smaller diameter mill there some years ago. We're seeing some positive market share gains there as well.\nTheresaWagler: And, I guess, the other component I would add is that with the advent of having reinforcing bar as a product set as we enter the market, we've been seeing some positive momentum from that as well.\nOperator: Our next question is from Timna Tanners from with Bank of America.\nTimnaTanners: Hey, good morning, guys. I wanted to dive in a little bit more if you could on the recycling and fabricated. I think my question that was maybe answered a bit but just those were really strong rebounds sequentially and even strong from a trend basis. So I was hoping that you could tell us how sustainable those might be and fab may have had a bit margin expansion on the low steel price maybe that reverses, but just in general terms like is that a good new run rate or what to think about going forward in those areas?\nTheresaWagler: Well, certainly for scrapped, Timna, we would see that going forward. Obviously in that business, it's kind of an inventory flow. You buy one month and you sell the next month. So when you have a stable pricing environment, one tends to do a lot better, as opposed to the periods where you just see progressive downward pricing trends month over month, and obviously volume played a big role in recycling.\nTheresaWagler: Yes, from a recycling perspective, I'd say that remember we did close on the Mexican scrap company in the first part of August, which was actually very beneficial; we find that the Mexican market is a little bit different than domestic market. So it might be a natural hedge going forward as well. In addition to that, to Mark's point, if domestic steel productions phase very strong, which we expected to stay strong in the fourth quarter, you're going to see that volume come to metal recycling arena. So we would expect it to be very steady as not improving. And I think for the fabrication, you really kind of hit it a bit too in that with the low raw material input costs it had, it really did benefit from where the steel mills sort of suffered in the second quarter. So you will see that sustainable for a little while. But as steel prices continue to increase, it's not likely that you're going to get dollar for dollar margin expansion in fabrication, but we do expect to see still very strong volumes and good results.\nTimnaTanners: Got you. Okay. Thanks. And then my second question was if you could just discuss a little bit more the outlook for CapEx as a couple things I wanted to follow up on. So one is that you talk about a little higher number than possibly the $850 million compares to $700 million, $750 million in last quarters. So is that just kind of a drag from this year maybe a little lighter spending next year catching up? And how do we think about further capital allocation beyond if you could start to give us some thoughts on what you're looking at that?\nTheresaWagler: Well, from the CapEx perspective, it's not more capital, Timna, but to your comment, it's actually a transfer. So we're expecting to probably spend about $100 million less in 2020. As it relates to Sinton Mill, it's just hard to project, it's when equipment arrives, et cetera, nothing is delaying the project, it's just we believe that probably about $100 million will shift from the fourth quarter into 2021. So that's why 2021 total capital estimate today is $850 million versus a $750 million. It's simply related to timing. Mark, did you want to talk about the capital allocation or -?\nMarkMillett: Well, I think Timna, our strategy is not going to change; we've always been somewhat conservative relative to the balance sheet and liquidity. We still remain very comfortable with our dividend profile, it's very manageable through cycle and it will remain intact. And during periods of excess cash flow we will continue to share repurchase program to complement that dividend policy. But right now, we see immediate strength and momentum in the markets. And I think things are good. But we'd like to see how things unravel for next three, four months, before we reinitiate any repurchase program. \nTheresaWagler: And I would just add to that as a quick reminder that our sustaining capital is only $150 million per year. So as we get on the other side of the Texas Steel Mill, there'll be considerable cash generation, which we can use to Mark's point for continued growth, both organic and inorganic.\nOperator: Our next question is from Andreas Bokkenheuser with UBS.\nAndreasBokkenheuser: Thank you very much. Just a follow up question for you. I mean, you obviously mentioned the Texas Mill and you've talked about it before and in terms of where you intend to kind of capture market share. But in particularly now with a lot of integrated capacity down and for your point, Mark, you guys don't expect all of it to come back. Are there any particular products where you see the new Texas Mill base capturing market share namely on the auto side, products that you weren't able to produce before, but you will be able to produce with the new mills, will you effectively could just continue that market share capturing trend as well?\nMarkMillett: I think we can gone on market share on several different fronts obviously just pure economics, the geographic location of that facility, and freight savings to the customer will be very, very persuasive. Number one, number two, we will be able to be very strong option for imports that floats through Houston. So just general economics or pricing or value to the customer will be massive. And, again, as we see a 27 million ton market between Southwest, the West Coast import market and, and Mexico. But also the technology is going to allow us to produce combinations of grade, strength and dimensional characteristics that are totally unavailable today in the US. It's an 84-inch mill, although a -- let me rephrase that, it's going to make a real 84 -inch wide coil, the current 84-inch mills in the US are just the width of the row itself, and so cannot make 84-inch true width, and you need 84-inch width to get into 26 inch diameter pipe.  And so that is a very differentiating commodity, particularly when you can go to one inch thick, 100 KSI steel. The technology, as we've said in past calls, it's a thicker slab. So it's going to allow a much, much superior surface condition. And if there was a technology or minimal technology to get into, exposed automotive, this would be it. We're not advertising that, but certainly would hope we get that one day. But higher toughness, highest strength steel will certainly differentiate the product portfolio compared to what's available in the States today.\nTheresaWagler: And I think from an end market perspective, what you'll see is that this will take market share along the lines, especially because we're starting with a paint line and a galvanizing metal coating line will be in the appliance arena, especially in Mexico, automotive in Mexico, HVAC, metal buildings will be a big focus point as well, then obviously, when the energy market comes back, we'll be right in the middle of that arena.\nAndreasBokkenheuser: That's very clear. And in terms of sourcing of raw materials, I mean, you're obviously you've got pig iron coming in, and you have scrap from Mexico and so on. Any thoughts on HPI? I mean, we're obviously seeing some HPI capacity coming online in the US. Some of it might all be spoken for. But any thoughts on HPI that's going to be part of your product makes it a great deal going forward?\nMarkMillett: Well, we would contemplate all raw materials in honestly, I think you have obviously Nucor has been ramping up and is doing well now there. You have Cliffs will be starting their facility that likely would be ineffective from a freight perspective to go all the way down into Sinton. But certainly will find its way into the Midwest market. And just by association, they help the raw material pricing environment. Voest has a DRI or HBI facility in Corpus Christi. And I would imagine the Sinton mill would be a natural home for someone that material and so again, if the value is right, we would be consuming some of that material.\nOperator: Our next question is from Chris Olin with Tier4.\nChrisOlin: Yes, sorry about that. Hey, I wanted to first see if I can get a clarification. Theresa, did you say the cash tax was 3% for 2021? And then I guess I had a mini follow up question regarding this whole market share issue. I guess my question is there were some outages, I guess unplanned if you will, at some of the steel assets or coating lines for your competitors and I guess I wanted to make sure there wasn't some type of volume or mixed benefit in the Quarter that potentially goes away or we need to think about going forward. Thanks.\nTheresaWagler: I'll answer the first question, Chris. And yes, our cash, our effective cash tax rate for 2021 is likely to only be around 3%. And that's just reflective of state taxes. Because at least currently with the tax code, with Sinton actually starting in 2021, we're able to, from a tax perspective, take the immediate depreciation impact for that. And it's quite significant. So we would expect that to take care of all the cash requirements from a federal basis for 2021. And likely that would roll into having some protection into 2022 as well; we just don't have that estimate at this point. \nMarkMillett: Yes and regarding the ban, yes. There's some shifting of products here and there between the different players. But the market strength, and our results are; it's just the underlying demand profile there, which is going to remain in place for some time to come.  That concludes our question-and-answer session; I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for any closing remarks.\nMark Millett: Thank you. And for those remaining on the call seriously, thank you for your support and your time today to listen to our perspectives. To the customers that may be listening, sincere thank you on my behalf. And on behalf of every one of the 9,000 SDI employees and their families; you helped us through a challenging time. And we will hopefully continue to earn your business and to all our team members on the call. Again, one shout out regarding safety, please double down on safety. It wasn't a disastrous quarter in any respect, severity continues to improve. But nonetheless, we need to continue our improving trend there. And just thank you for your passion, your commitment through this challenging quarter. It's been a crazy time. But you folks have come through as always shining like superstars. So thank you, you guys. Be safe. Have a great day. Bye-bye.\nOperator: Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation and have a great and safe day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mark Millett",
            "content": "Well, thank you, Tricia. Good morning. Welcome to our third quarter 2020 earnings call. We appreciate your time and thanks for joining us today. We continue to operate safely and are still closely monitoring the COVID-19 situation. Protecting the health and welfare of our teams is our highest priority. I thank each of them for their continued diligence and commitment. I'm incredibly proud to work alongside each of them, especially during this unsettled time. They are a very special group, accomplishing extraordinary things. We are committed to them, their families and our communities, all while supporting our suppliers and meeting the needs of our customers. So without further ado, I will hand the mike to Teresa to provide further insights into our strong third quarter performance. Thank you, Teresa. Thank you for clearly articulating the differentiation of SDI amongst its competition, I think we've just navigated just navigated to an incredible cycle, then turn and then recovery and the performance that our team is turned in is just the beyond words, it's humbling. And speaking of them, in the end, nothing really is more important than the safety of our team. Safety is and always will be our number one value. Our safety performance continues to be significantly better than industry averages, but our continued goal is to have no injuries among our people. Our safety performance is further improved from a severity perspective. However, among some of the operating platforms, our third quarter safety results were not what we would like to see for our teams. We all must be continuous aware of our surroundings, and our fellow team members, I asked all of us to keep safety top of mind to control safety, we can take charge of safety, both in the traditional sense as it relates to keeping one another in good health.  Steel Fabrication platform delivered a remarkable third quarter performance with record quarterly volume and earnings. Our fabrication order backlog remains strong is higher than it was this time last year, and in fact higher than 2018. Customers remain positive concerning non residential construction projects. We anticipate the strength remaining through the rest of this year and into 2021. The metals recycling volumes and earnings also meaningfully improved in the third quarter. As states rescinded shelter in place mandates, and the automotive supply chain restarted, scrap flows dramatically improved through the third quarter. The same time domestic steel production utilization increased from an average 56% to an estimated 64% and first scraps demand significantly improved. As flows continue to increase and steel production remains steady. We believe scrap prices should remain fairly stable through the remainder of the year, with likely seasonal price appreciation in December, January timeframe.  We also welcome the Zimmer team into the Steel Dynamics family. The addition of this Mexican metals recycling business is a meaningful step in our raw material sourcing strategy for our Texas Flat Roll Steel Mill. The combination of Zimmer with our existing operations has already resulted in new business, and we're excited for the continued growth. The steel team continues to achieve an outstanding performance, especially considering the environment and a sincere thank you to all involved, especially our customers for helping us achieve volumes that only modestly less than record shipments achieved in the first quarter of this year. As a result of COVID-19 related implications, a considerable number of high cost blast furnaces flat roll steel operations were idled earlier this year, potentially as much as 15 million tons. Since that timeframe, as steel demand and pricing has improved, an estimated 5 to 6 million tons has been brought back online. Although some additional volume may return, we don't believe all of it will come back. The cost of restart along with through cycle market pricing not supporting ongoing profitability will likely keep significant volume curtailed, offsetting the new capacity increases to be seen over the next 24 months.  While the overall domestic industry operated only 64%; the strength of our differentiated business model, coupled with the passion of our people drove SDI steel mill production utilization to 85%. Even more remarkable, our flat roll steel mills achieve utilization 99%. In tough environments, the strength of our people and our superior business model become even more evident. As demonstrated this year, during periods of market inflection we maintain higher volumes compared to our steel peers and gain market share. And uninterrupted low cost operations provide the greatest customer optionality. Our broad product portfolio and end market diversification within value added market niches drives flexibility for our commercial teams.  Superior Supply Chain Solutions create additional value for our customers, making us a preferred place to shop. Furthermore, a powerful driver is the optionality of internal steel sourcing from our captive manufacturing businesses, what we call pull through volume. To put this in perspective, our steel fabrication platform and steel processing locations purchased 2.3 million tons of steel in 2019. Only about half of this volume is typically sourced from SDI own steel mills, but in difficult markets, where the option to direct the higher proportion of these orders internally. As states continue to reopen to varying degrees, many steel consuming businesses have resumed operations. At the same time, customer inventory levels have been reduced to extremely low levels. This combination of increasing demand coupled with low inventory reserves has resulted in a tight flat roll steel supply environment. As a result, lead times stretched out and flat roll steel pricing has significantly improved. The hot rolled coil CIU Price Index increased almost $160 per ton from the beginning of August to September, and has since increased another $40 to $50 per ton. The automotive supply chain has experienced the most significant recovery, attending production levels of either close to or in some cases more than pre-COVID levels of concern. Our construction sector remains resilient and related steel demand has been steady as evidenced by our structural rail division volume, and our record steel fabrication shipments and strong customer backlog. The order activity from our construction sector customers combined with strength in our steel fabrication order backlog support our optimism for continued strength through the rest of this year, heading into 2021. Residential Construction has also been surprisingly strong, generating high demand for HVAC and appliance products. The energy sector though continues to be structurally weak and will likely require long than recovery period. Related to our growth, we have a summary update of recent investments in our most recently investor deck. In the last 12 to 24 months, we've executed several strategic investments that have already or will meaningfully benefit our through cycle earnings and free cash flow position. We expanded two steel mills by the combined addition of 440,000 tons of annual steel rebar production capability, providing product diversification and a differentiated customer supply chain. This end market diversification is providing for hire through cycle utilization for our structural and Roanoke steel divisions. We continue to expand capacity at Harlan. It is an 800,000 ton value added flat roll steel processor. The team has been operating at record levels, providing additional internal production support and operational flexibility for our Butler Flat Roll division, increasing the utilization of our steel assets and broadening our value added product portfolio. The acquisition of 75% of United Steel Supply has also been an excellent investment in addition to our portfolio. As a local distributor of pre painted construction products, it has provided meaningful channels and new more diversified customers. United Steel Supply continues to break shipping records. Since the acquisition of Columbus Flat Roll division in 2014, we have meaningfully increased it through cycling and its capability. We've transformed its product portfolio with the expansion of its value added steel capabilities and the diversification of its customer base.  The team achieved another milestone in July with a startup of a new 400,000 ton of value add coating line. Columbus now has four higher margin coating lines there. The investment both reduces Columbus' hot roll coil exposure and provides a ready Southern hot band consumer base for our Sinton Texas Steel Mill. We remain incredibly excited about the new generation of flat rolled steel mill, is significant contribution to our growth and future earnings capability. As Theresa explained, we purposefully ended 2020 from a point of financial strength, providing ample liquidity for the required investment associated with this transformational project. Our team has incredible depth of experience in the construction, startup and operation of large steel manufacturing assets. Collectively, we believe they have more experience than exists in any other company in our industry. The Texas' team's performance and momentum continues to be absolutely remarkable. Construction is going extremely well. We're still on track for a mid year 2021 start date. We're having frequent conversations with equipment suppliers regarding the impact of COVID-19 and currently don't believe our planned schedule has been meaningfully impacted. The new state of the art 3 million tons steel mill will include two value added coating lines, comprised of 550,000 tons of galvanizing and 250,000 tons of prepaint. We'll follow the same stringent sustainability model as either steel making facilities with state of the art environmental controls and processes. Our existing steel mills have a fraction of the greenhouse gas emission and energy intensity of average traditional steel making technology. With an 84-inch coil width and up to one inch thick, 100 KSI products; the Texas mill will have capabilities beyond the existing electric arc furnace produces competing even more effectively with the integrated steel model and foreign competition. The Steel Mill is strategically located in Central Texas, near Corpus Christi. We have three target regional sales markets for the Sinton Mill, representing over 27 million tons of relevant flat roll steel consumption. In the Southern and West Coast, United States and Mexico. We also plan to effectively compete with heavy imports in Houston and the West Coast. Our customers are excited to have a regional flat roll steel supplier. We now have three customers committed to locate on site representing between 800,000 and a million tons of annual processing and consumption capacity; we're still speaking with several other interested parties. The Sinton location provides a significant freight benefit to most of our intended customers relative to the current supply chain options. This trade advantage coupled with much shorter lead times; provides a superior customer supply chain, allowing us to be the preferred domestic steel supplier in the South and Western US. It also allows us to effectively compete with imports, which inherently have long lead times and speculative price risk. We've also made considerable progress concerning our raw material strategy for Sinton. As I mentioned, we completed the acquisition of a Mexican scrap company in August. This is a critical step in our strategy; the acquisition complements our current metals recycling business in both the US and Mexico, and Zimmer's operations are strategically located near high volume industrial scrap sources throughout Central and Northern Mexico. Prior to our ownership, they shipped approximately 500,000 gross tons of scrap annually, but they have an estimated annual processing capability of almost 2 million gross tons a year, we plan to ramp up that volume quickly. We believe our performance based operating culture, coupled with our consumer experience in successfully constructing and operating highly profitable steel mills positions is incredibly well to successfully execute the transformational Texas growth investment. We're not simply adding the flat roll production capacity. We have a differentiated product offering, a unique regional supply chain solution, a significant geographic freight and lead time advantage and offer an important import alternative to a region in need of options. Our unique culture and the execution of a long-term strategy continue to strengthen our financial position through consistent, strong cash flow generation and long-term value creation. Clearly differentiates us from our competition and demonstrating our sustainability.  This is clearly been demonstrated during the past two quarters. Again, our commitment is to the health and safety of our people, our families and our communities, all while supporting our vendors serving our customers, and sustaining our value creation journey. Our team is extraordinary. And I would like to thank each of them for their patience, resilience and commitment during these uncharted times. They have an indomitable spirit that drives us to excellent. Additionally, a sincere and heartfelt thank you to the healthcare providers and their families within steel Nanites and those serving individuals across the world.  Thank you, be safe, and be well. So Shomali, please open the call for questions. Thank you. Thank you. And for those remaining on the call seriously, thank you for your support and your time today to listen to our perspectives. To the customers that may be listening, sincere thank you on my behalf. And on behalf of every one of the 9,000 SDI employees and their families; you helped us through a challenging time. And we will hopefully continue to earn your business and to all our team members on the call. Again, one shout out regarding safety, please double down on safety. It wasn't a disastrous quarter in any respect, severity continues to improve. But nonetheless, we need to continue our improving trend there. And just thank you for your passion, your commitment through this challenging quarter. It's been a crazy time. But you folks have come through as always shining like superstars. So thank you, you guys. Be safe. Have a great day. Bye-bye."

            "name": "Theresa Wagler",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Our third quarter 2020 net income was $100 million or $0.47 per diluted share above our guidance of $0.42 to $0.46 per share due to stronger than anticipated flat rolled steel shipments and metals recycling earnings. Our third quarter results were reduced by cost net of capitalized interest associated with the construction of our Sinton Texas Flat Roll Steel Mill of approximately $0.04 per diluted share. Excluding these construction costs, third quarter 2020 adjusted net income was $0.51 per diluted share, also above our adjusted guidance of $0.46 to $0.50 per share. One comment before proceeding, the compatibility of third quarter 2020 financial results to prior year amounts isn't favorable. But to achieve what our teams have achieved in this environment is simply incredible. And I want to add to Mark's comments and sincerely thank and congratulate them. Our third quarter 2020 revenues were $2.3 billion, 11% higher than second quarter sequential results, as volumes improved across all three operating platforms. Our third quarter 2020 operating income was $156 million, fairly steady with the sequential second quarter, but 32% lower than prior year results due to lower steel prices resulting in metal spread compression. However, currently, we've experienced a very strong rebound in domestic steel demand from the second quarter sequential COVID-19 induced trough environment. Customers steel inventory levels were extremely low entering the second quarter, and then were drawn down even further based on market uncertainty. From an operating platform perspective, our steel operations delivered an outstanding performance during this challenging time. Third quarter steel shipments of 2.7 million ton were 7% higher than the sequential second quarter shipments, and on par with prior year's third quarter volume. Our steel mills operated at 85% of their capability, while the rest of the domestic industry operated at only 64%. Due to the momentum from our record first quarter volume, our year-to-date steel shipments are only 1% lower than in 2019. Our ability to maintain higher steel volumes is a result of our value added highly diversified product offerings, our supply chain differentiation and our internal downstream manufacturing businesses. However, based on timing and the impact of flat roll contract related sales, our average quarterly realized steel price per ton declined sequentially, more than offsetting the benefit of lower scrap costs and higher volumes. Our average quarterly realized external steel sales price decreased $21 per ton sequentially to $734 in the third quarter, an average scrap costs only declined $7 per ton, resulting in steel metal margin compression. The result was third quarter 2020 operating income of $144 million for our steel operation, 17% lower than the sequential second quarter.  As states began reopening and domestic manufacturing improved, scrap supply and collection increased. This in combination with higher domestic steel production drove significantly higher ferrous scrap volume. Our operating income from our mills recycling operations was $15 million in the third quarter of 2020 compared to a $6 million loss in the sequential second quarter. We also are benefiting from the addition of Zimmer, our newly acquired Mexican metals recycling business. The acquisition was completed in August. It's a key cog in our ongoing raw material strategy for our new Texas Steel Mill. Our Metals Recycling Operations provide a competitive advantage for sourcing ferrous scrap or steel mills allowing for increased scrap quality; melt efficiency and reduction of company wide working capital. Our vertically connected operating model benefits both platforms. Our Steel Fabrication business had a record operating income of $39 million in the third quarter, compared to sequential results of $27 million due to record shipments and margin expansion as product pricing increased while steel input costs declined. We continue to experience a strong order backlog and customers remain positive concerning our non residential construction projects. In fact, the Steel and Joist Institute recorded one of its strongest historical booking months this last September. Our cash generation continues to be strong based on our differentiated business model and highly variable cost structure. During the third quarter of 2020, we generated $152 million of cash flow from operations and $849 million during the first nine months of the year. We also invested $855 million in fixed assets, of which $640 million was invested in our new Texas Flat Rolls Steel Mill. For the fourth quarter of 2020, we believe capital investments will be roughly $400 million, of which our new Texas Steel Mill represents $360 million. We currently estimate capital investments for the full year of 2021 to be in the range of $850 million, with the Texas Steel Mill representing about $700 million of that amount as their operations are still expected to begin mid year 2021. In addition, I've been getting a lot of questions about our effective tax rate. For 2020, the effective cash tax rate will be approximately 20% for the year. However, based on credits we expect to receive due to the certain Sinton Texas Mill, we would expect 2020 cash taxes to only be approximately 3%. Regarding shareholder distributions, we maintained our quarterly cash dividend at $0.25 per common share after increasing at 4% in the first quarter of this year. Since 2016, we've also invested $1.3 billion in our common stock, representing over 15% of our outstanding shares, and $444 million remains authorized for repurchase at the end of the third quarter.  Additionally, we opportunistically access the investment grade capital markets in both June and October of this year, extending our debt maturity profile and significantly reducing our effective interest rate. We're thrilled with the differentiation our investment grade bond investors recognize that Steel Dynamics provides in our fundamental free cash flow generation capability on a through cycle basis. As evident in October, we issued $350 million of 1.65%, seven year paper, and $400 million as 3.25% 30 year paper with proceeds intended to refinance our existing 2025 notes, and other general corporate purposes. These actions reflect the strength of our capital foundation, consistent cash flow capability and strong liquidity profile, demonstrating our confidence and our sustainable through cash strong generation. We enter 2020 in a position of strength with ample cash and available liquidity of $2.8 billion. And at the end of the third quarter, we maintain strong liquidity of $2.5 billion comprised of cash of $1.3 billion and our fully available revolving unsecured credit facility of $1.2 billion. Pro forma our October financing activities, our liquidity would have been $2.8 billion. As a reminder, you're seeing this is our performance in the current market environment. And you can look historically at our financial performance to determine either a future trough or peak, we've grown significantly transformed our Columbus Flat Roll division, further diversified our steel product offerings and incorporated even more levers to increase our through cycles financial performance.  In addition, collectively, our primary reason and plan strategic growth investments provide an estimated incremental annual future EBITDA of over $425 million on a through cycle historical spread basis. This estimate includes our Texas Steel Mill and third Columbus Metallic Coating line, as well as our two operational rebar expansions. We are simply even more agile today than ever before. We more than doubled our annual free cash flow from operations to $1.1 billion from 2015 to 2019, compared to 2010 to 2014. We are dedicated to preserving our investment grade credit rating, our capital allocation strategy prioritizes responsible strategic growth with appropriate shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that is complemented with a variable share repurchase program. We are squarely positioned for the continuation of the sustainable optimized long-term value creation. Some of you also use some more detailed information for flat roll operations. I'll give you the third quarter shipment profile now; our hot roll coiled shipments for the third quarter were 803,000 tons. Our cold rolled shipments were 144,000 tons. And our coated shipments were 1,013,000 tons for a total of 1,960,000 tons. And on a personal note, I really do want to thank our teams for their passion and their generosity, and really the care they're showing for each other's health and safety. Mark?"

And now, I am pleased to turn the call over to Mark.\nMark Millett: Well, thank you, Tricia. Good morning. Welcome to our second quarter 2020 earnings call. We certainly appreciate and value your time with us this morning, especially during these uncharted circumstances. Leaders are tasked to make decisions today that have not been required in recent history, regarding the health and the safety of our people, their families and our communities. We are closely monitoring the COVID-19 situation and are continuing to operate safely. None of our operations have been impacted to-date. As always, protecting the health and welfare of our teams is our highest priority. I want to thank each of our 8,400 team members for their passion and continued dedication to excellence. I am incredibly proud to work alongside each of them during this unprecedented time. They are a special group, accomplishing extraordinary things and we are committed to them, their families, and our communities, all while supporting our suppliers and meeting the needs of our customers. But before I continue, Theresa, will you provide insights into our outstanding second quarter performance?\nTheresa Wagler: Absolutely. Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for being here. Our second quarter 2020 net income was $75 million or $0.36 per diluted share, above our guidance of $0.29 per share to $0.33 per share due to stronger than anticipated flat-rolled steel shipments. Our second quarter results were reduced by the following two items, costs related to our June 2020 refinancing activities of approximately $0.08 per diluted share, and costs net of capitalized interest associated with the construction of our new Sinton Texas Flat Roll Steel Mill of approximately $0.03 per diluted share. Excluding these two items, second quarter 2020 adjusted net income was $0.47 per diluted share above our adjusted guidance of $0.40 per share to $0.44 per share. One comment before proceeding, yes, the comparability of second quarter 2020 financial results to sequential or prior year amount is unfavorable, but to achieve what our teams have achieved in this unchartered environment, as Mark mentioned, is simply incredible. Steel and ferrous scrap demand declined significantly in the second quarter of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting temporary closures of numerous steel consuming businesses. As a result, our second quarter 2020 revenues were $2.1 billion, 19% lower than first quarter sequential results and 24% lower than prior year sales. Our second quarter 2020 operating income was $159 million, over 40% lower than those sequential first quarter and prior year results. From an operating platform perspective, our steel operations delivered an outstanding performance during this challenging time. Second quarter steel shipments of 2.5 million tons were only 12% lower than the record 2.8 million tons achieved in the sequential first quarter of this year and only 9% lower than prior year’s second quarter. Our steel mills operated almost 80% of their capability, while the rest of the domestic industry operated at 55%. Due to the momentum in the first quarter, our steel shipments in the first half of 2020 are only 2% lower than in 2019. Our ability to maintain higher steel volumes is a result of our value-added highly diversified product offering, our supply chain differentiation and our internal manufacturing businesses, a sincere congratulation to the entire team. However, steel prices deteriorated, our average quarterly realized sales price decreased $19 per ton to $755 in the second quarter, while average scrap cost decreased only $1 per ton resulting in steel metal margin compression. The result was second quarter 2020 operating income of $172 million for our steel operations, 41% lower than the sequential first quarter. As states issued shelter-in-place mandate and domestic manufacturing slowed, scrap supply and collection declined. This in combination with lower domestic steel production caused weak ferrous scrap demand. As a result, our metals recycling operations recorded an operating loss of $6 million for the second quarter of 2020 but they remained cash flow positive. Our metals recycling operations provide a competitive advantage to sourcing ferrous scrap for our steel mills, allowing for increased scrap quality, melt efficiency and reduction of company-wide working capital requirements. Our vertically connected operating model benefits both platforms. For our Steel Fabrication business, second quarter 2020 operating income remained strong at $27 million, compared to sequential results of $29 million due to steady shipments. We continue to experience a strong backlog and customers remain constructive considering non-residential construction projects. Our cash generation continues to be very strong based on our differentiated business model and highly variable cost structure. During the second quarter of 2020, we generated $486 million of cash flow from operations, representing our second best quarterly performance. As we stated on last quarter’s call, during weaker environment, our working capital can be a meaningful funding source and it was in the second quarter, generating over $290 million of cash flow. For the first half of 2020, we generated $697 million of cash flow from operations, representing a record first half performance. We also invested $527 million in fixed asset, of which $371 million was invested in our new Texas Flat Roll Steel Mill. We also maintained our cash dividend at 25% -- $0.25 per share in the second quarter after increasing a 4% in the first quarter of this year. During the first half of 2020, we have repurchased $107 million of our common stock and $444 million remains authorized for repurchase at the end of the quarter. In June, we also took advantage of the capital market and executed our second investment grade notes offering issuing $400 million of 2.4% notes due in 2025 and $500 million of 3.25% notes due in 2031. These transactions were leveraged neutral and proceeds were used to repay two tranches of our then existing higher cost high yield notes, combined with our December inaugural investment grade refinancing, we have extended our overall debt maturity profile and lowered our effective interest rate to under 4%. These actions reflect the strength of our capital foundation, consistent cash flow capability and strong liquidity profile, demonstrating our confidence in our sustainable through-cycle strong cash generation. For the second half of 2020, we currently are planning for capital investments to be roughly between $800 million and $850 million, of which our new Texas Steel Mill represents $700 million to $750 million of that range. We estimate capital investments for the full year of 2021 to also be in the range of $700 million to $750 million with the Texas Mill representing about $580 million of that amount, as their operations are expected to begin mid-year 2021. We entered 2020 a position of strength with a strong cash position and available liquidity of $2.8 billion and we have remained in a position of strength as we have maintained that liquidity with cash and short-term investments of $1.6 billion and our $1.2 billion fully available revolving credit facility. One can’t look historically at our financial performance to determine either a future trough or peak. We have grown significantly, transformed our Columbus Flat Roll Division, further diversified our steel product offerings and incorporated even more levers to increase our through-cycle financial performance. We have also added new manufacturing businesses to our portfolio that use steel as a raw material, providing additional opportunities to sustain our steel mills’ utilization in a weaker market cycle. In addition, collectively, our primary recent and planned strategic growth investments provide an estimated incremental annual future EBITDA of over $425 million on a through-cycle historical spread basis. You can see that on a slide in our second quarter investor deck. I believe it’s slide 13. This estimate includes our Texas Steel Mill, the third galvanizing line at Columbus, which has just recently started and our two rebar expansions. We are simply even more agile today than we have ever been before. We are also dedicated to preserving our investment-grade credit rating. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes responsible strategic growth with appropriate shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that’s complemented with a variable share repurchase program when appropriate. We are squarely positioned for the continuation of a sustainable optimized long-term value creation. I know that some of you actually model some more specificity within our flat roll group shipments, so I will provide those for you now. During the second quarter, we had flat-rolled shipments representing hot roll coil and pickled and oiled of 746,000 tons, we had cold-rolled shipments of 132,000 tons and we had coated shipments of 900,000 tons, representing 1,778,000 tons in the second quarter in totality. And finally, on a personal note, I just want to sincerely thank the teams for their passion and their generosity, and the care that they are showing for one another’s health and safety. It truly is tremendous. So, thank you. Mark?\nMark Millett: Well, thank you, Theresa. As I have mentioned many times in the past, safety is and is always going to be our number one value because nothing is more important. Our safety performance continues to be significantly better than industry averages. But as I have said also many times before, it’s not enough, our goal is to have zero injuries across the company and we will continue to strive for that. Our safety performance has further improved during the last 12 months, with our second quarter results continuing the positive trend. We all must be continuously aware of our surroundings and our fellow team members. I challenge all of us to be focused both in the traditional sense, but even more so now, as it relates to keeping one another in good health. The steel fabrication platform delivered a strong second quarter performance. Our fabrication order backlog remains strong and is higher than it was at this time last year. Customers remain constructive concerning non-residential construction projects. We have had some jobs delayed or postponed, but it’s not been widespread or material. We anticipate the strength remaining through the rest of this year and expect second half 2020 volume is being equal if not higher than the first half performance. In contrast, as states issued shelter-in-place mandates and domestic manufacturing slowed, scrap supply and collection declined. In particular, prime scrap flow decreased considerably as automotive production ground to an abrupt halt. In addition, significantly lower second quarter domestic steel production utilization, which was estimated at 55% across the industry, resulted in weak ferrous scrap demand. As a result, our metals recycling operations were cash flow positive in the second quarter, but incurred losses at the operating level. As states have started to reopen, scrap flows have improved and we expect our metals recycling platform to return to profitability for the second half of 2020 based on increased volume. The steel team had a tremendous performance in this environment. After record shipments in the first quarter of this year, our volume only decreased 12% in the second quarter. I’d like to commend our commercial teams and the support of our customers for making this happen ad thank you to the metals recycling team for providing the raw materials required to achieve this level of production in what became a very tight market. The strength of our differentiated business model coupled with the passion of our people drove strong steel mill production utilization to almost 80% across the company. While the overall domestic industry, as I said, only operated at 55%. Meaningfully, our flat roll operations achieved utilization of almost 90% in the quarter. As COVID-19 and related state closure implications unfolded in late March through today, steel demand and selling values decreased rapidly from the strength seen in much of the first quarter of this year. Temporary closure of automotive production and the related supply chain closures meaningfully reduced flat-rolled steel demand. The severe decline in energy prices related to oversupply significantly reduced steel demand from steel pipe and tube manufacturers. However, construction-related steel demand was more resilient. Our Structural and Rail Division maintained utilization of over 70% in the second quarter. As a result of reduced flat-rolled steel demand and lower pricing, a considerable number of high cost flat-rolled steel operations came offline since the end of 2019. We believe about 15 million tons or so of flat-rolled sheet capacity has been idled, representing over 20% of annual domestic production capacity. In tough environments, the strength of our people and our superior business model become even more evident. As demonstrated in the second quarter and historically, during periods of market inflection, we maintain higher utilization levels than our peers and gain market share. Uninterrupted low cost operations, provides the greatest customer optionality. Our broad product portfolio and end market diversification within value-added market niches drives flexibility for our commercial teams. Superior supply chain solutions create additional value for our customers, making us a preferred place to shop. And furthermore, a powerful driver is the optionality of internal steel sourcing from our captive manufacturing businesses, which we call pull-through volume. To put this in perspective, our steel fabrication platform and steel processing locations purchased 2.3 million tons of steel in 2019. Only about half of this volume is typically sourced from the SDI-owned steel mills, but in difficult markets, we increase the percentage.  As states continue to determine their reopening guidelines and many steel consuming businesses have resumed operations. We anticipate steel demand will materially improve from the second quarter trough. The automotive sector and its related supply chain have restarted production, and we have started to see some resulting increase in steel demand. The construction sectors remain more resilient and related steel demand has been steady, as evidenced by our Structural and Rail Division volume and steel fabrication customer backlog. The order activity from our construction-related customers, combined with the strength in our steel fabrication order backlog, support our optimism for a continued strength through the rest of the year. The weaker sectors continue to be related to energy and general and industrial consumers, which are likely to require a slightly longer recovery period. Related to continued growth, we provided a summary update of our recent growth investments on our slide in our investor deck posted on the SDI website. In the last 12 months or 24 months, we have executed several strategic investments that have or will benefit our through-cycle earnings and cash flow position. We expanded two steel mills by the combined addition of 440,000 tons of steel rebar production capability, providing product diversification and differentiated supply chain for the customer. Our model provides a meaningful customer optionality and flexibility, with significant logistics, yield and working capital benefits. This end market diversification provides the higher through-cycle utilization for our Structural and Roanoke Steel divisions. We continue to expand capacity at Heartland Steel. It is an 800,000-ton value-added flat-rolled steel processor and the team has been operating at record coating levels, providing additional internal production support and operational flexibility for our Butler Flat Roll Division, increasing the through-cycle utilization of our steel assets and broadening our value-added product mix. The acquisition of 75% of United Steel Supply has been an excellent investment in addition to our portfolio. As a local distributor of pre-painted construction product, it has provided a meaningful channel to new and more diversified customers. With our customer-preferred co-branded supply chain and more rurally located custom base, and recent stimulus dollars flowing these communities, United Steel Supply achieved record second quarter shipments. We anticipate the strength to continue through the rest of this year. Since the acquisition of Columbus Flat Roll Division, we have meaningfully increased its through-cycle earnings capability. We have transformed its product portfolio with the expansion of its value-added steel capabilities, the diversification of its customer base and the addition of a paint line. In a few weeks ago, the team achieved another milestone. They coated their first prime galvanized coil on our new 400,000 ton line. Columbus now has for value-added coating lines. The investment reduces Columbus’ hot-rolled coil exposure and provides a ready hot band consumer base in the south for our new Texas Flat Roll Mill when it starts operating in less than a year from now. We remain incredibly excited about on our new next-generation flat mill in Texas and its certain contribution to our growth and earnings capability. As Theresa explained, our strategy focused on entering 2020 from a point of financial strength, providing for the required investment associated with this transformational project. Our team has an incredible depth of experience in the construction, startup and operation of large steel manufacturing assets. Collectively, we believe they have more experienced than exist in any other company in the industry. The Texas’ team’s performance and momentum have been absolutely remarkable. Construction is going extremely well and within our expanded capital cost of $1.9 billion. We expect the operations to begin in mid-2021. We are having weekly conversations with the equipment suppliers regarding the impact of COVID-19. I don’t believe our planned schedule has been meaningfully impacted thus far. The new state-of-the-art 3-million-ton steel mill will include two value-added coating lines comprised of a 550,000-ton galvanizing line and a 250,000-ton paint line. It will follow the same stringent sustainability model as our other steelmaking facilities with state-of-the-art, environmental controls and processes. Our existing steel mills have a fraction of the greenhouse gas emission and energy intensity of average world’s steelmaking technology, less than 15% of the average producer. With an 84-inch coil width and up to 1-inch thick 100 ksi product, the Texas Mill will have capabilities beyond existing electric-arc furnace flat-rolled steel producers and will compete even more effectively with the integrated steel model and foreign competition. The mill is strategically located in Sinton, Texas near Corpus Christi. We have three targeted regional sales markets for the Sinton Steel Mill, representing over 27 million tons of relevant flat-rolled steel consumption in the Southern and West Coast United States and Mexico. We also plan to effectively compete with the heavy imports in Houston and the West Coast. Our customers are excited to have a regional flat-rolled steel supplier. We have two customers now committed to locate on site with us, representing over 800,000 tons of annual consumption -- processing and consumption capability. We still have others in conversation and would expect to have further volume in the next months. Sinton location provides a significant freight benefit to most of our intended customers relative to their current supply chain options. This freight advantage along with much shorter lead times provides a superior supply chain solution, allowing us to not only be the preferred domestic steel supply in the South and Western U.S., but also to effectively compete with imports, which inherently have long lead times and speculative pricing risk. From a raw material perspective, our metals recycling operations already control a significant and growing scrap volume in Mexico through scrap management relationships, much of which is needed prime scrap. As announced earlier this year, we are also planning to acquire a Mexican scrap company as part of our raw materials strategy for Sinton. Their primary operation is strategically located near high-volume industrial scrap sources throughout Central and Northern Mexico. The company currently ships approximately 500,000 gross tons of scrap annually but have estimated annual process and capability of almost 2 million tons. After the acquisition is finalized in the coming months, we plan to ramp up that volume quickly. We believe our performance-based operating culture, coupled with our considerable experience and successfully constructing and operating highly profitable steel assets positions us incredibly well to successfully execute the transformational Texas growth investment. As I have said before, we are not simply adding flat-rolled production capacity. We have a differentiated product offering, a unique regional supply chain solution, a significant geographic freight and lead time advantage, and offer an import alternative to a region in need of options. Our unique culture and the execution of our long-term strategy continue to strengthen our financial position through consistent strong cash flow generation and long-term value creation, differentiating us from our competition and demonstrating our sustainability. I believe you would all agree this was clearly demonstrated this past quarter. Again, our commitment is to the health and safety of our people, our families and our communities, all while supporting our vendors, serving our customers and sustaining our value creation journey. Our team is incredible. I would like to thank each of them for their patience, their resilience and commitment during these uncharted times. They have an indomitable spirit that drives us all to excellence. Additionally, a sincere and heartfelt thank you to the health care providers and their families within Steel Dynamics and those serving individuals across the world. So, on behalf of SDI, thank you all, be safe, be well. And Laura, we’d like to open the call up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed with your question.\nChris Terry: Hi, Mark and Theresa, and thanks for taking my question. The main thing I wanted to talk about was the market share gains in 2Q, just wanted if you could talk about that on a more granular level, obviously, you had high utilization rates with some of the blast furnaces offline. Just thinking about it though on a sort of a customer basis, is it the broader offerings, the better service, just because the blast furnaces are offline. I just wondered if you could talk about that and then further opportunities, just thinking about it whether it’s sort of step changes or gradual improvements and other opportunities there, obviously, you have got Sinton, which you can get more gains in a year or so, but just thinking about the next couple of quarters?\nMark Millett: I guess that, obviously, that you just, sorry. I got to unmute myself there. You missed the best part. No. I think, as we have always demonstrated in the past, in moments of inflection down and tough markets, we continue to gain market share. And again, I want to emphasize, yeah, our shipments were down 12%. The 12% from a record, record production level in Q1. So it’s an absolutely incredible performance by the team and I think that the fact that we are fully engaged, fully operational, obviously, allows our customer base to access products, particularly when they are constrained in their own inventories. We just allow them to continue and they have got confidence in us. What we are here to deliver and we will deliver a product. We are fortunate, as we have said before, particularly in Columbus, we have been expanding our automotive presence. A lot of our automotive customer base is actually European, so BMW, VW and Mercedes. They have tended not to be as hard hit in Q2 as some of the domestic producers and we certainly benefited from that.\nTheresa Wagler: Yeah. I think I would just complement to what Mark said in that, where we saw the most market share gains was in the flat roll group, as well as structural steels, railroad rail. And then we have a bit of a niche in the solar products with the solar customers as well both within the hot rolled side of the business and within the specialty steel, the Steel of West Virginia. And in addition to that, with the advent of the Columbus teams starting up with the third galvanizing line, it will be nice to see that getting into the market and actually increasing the value add portion of their capabilities in the second half of this year. So I think there’s a lot of opportunity for us to both enrich the mix and then to continue in that market share gain.\nMark Millett: And just to emphasize that…\nChris Terry: Okay.\nMark Millett: Just like anecdotally because we continue to say that part of our strength as a company through-cycle, generating strong through-cycle cash is the diversity of our product mix. And just as an example, Steal of West Virginia, small metal for us, but they were impacted pretty dramatically by the reduction in truck and trailer. That industry is off about 50%. But because of their expansion into solar, they are going to ship about 100,000 tons of solar product, as compared to 30,000 tons last year. And so it’s the diversification both the product and market sector allows us to outperform our competition quarter in, quarter out.\nChris Terry: Thanks. Thanks for the comment. And just a follow-up question on some of your comments around construction specifically, obviously, this is a market where it’s pretty hotly debated where it’s all trending with different indicators, suggesting a slowdown and some concern in that market. Can -- you commented, I think, that there’s been no broad brush cancellation, but some changes in the market on an individual level. Has there been a change in your backlog, your total backlog in that market?\nMark Millett: Well, on a -- from a loan product standpoint, Structural and Rail Division, their backlog is actually up quarter-over-quarter. We see continued strength there that the fabricators are remaining very busy. The large projects remained strong and constructively some of the smaller product -- projects that were kind of delayed or put on hold earlier in the year because of COVID, we are starting to see those projects now getting released. So we are very, very constructive, obviously, we get insight or visibility through our New Millennium Building Systems, our Fabrication business. There, again, very, very strong backlog. No widespread push backs or project postponements. A little softness up in the Northeast, that’s not a big market for us, but some of the construction sites were closed down and have been closed down, but seriously, we see very, very positive strength through the rest of the year.\nChris Terry: Thanks, Mark. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dave Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. You may proceed with your question.\nDave Gagliano: Great. Thanks for asking my questions. I -- first of all, I just have one quick clarification question and I did look at the EBITDA reconciliation tables before asking this. But does the second quarter adjusted EBITDA, the $217 million number, does that include or exclude those $10 million of costs tied to the startup at Sinton and also does that include or exclude some or all of the $25 million at one-time refinancing costs called out in the adjusted EPS?\nTheresa Wagler: Yeah. So, Dave, whatever is in the EBITDA on adjusted basis is -- are non-cash items only. So at Sinton, those are cash items, so there’s nothing that’s been excluded. So they are deducted from the adjusted EBITDA, and from a financing perspective only, I think, about $4 million were actually added back, because they were non-cash write-offs. Otherwise, if it’s cash related, we are not adding that back.\nDave Gagliano: Okay. Great. So it’s consistent. I just want to make sure consistent with the adjusted EPS. Thanks. And then just on the market, you mentioned, obviously, quite a bit of idled sheet capacity. It sounds like at least 5 million of that is coming back very soon or in the process of coming back annual capacity and arguably, perhaps, closer to 7 million to 8 million tons if those reduced utilization rates ramp up. And it seems to be happening when the time -- at a time when lead times are actually still pretty low for the industry overall and then you also flagged obviously prime scrap supplies are coming back as well. So my questions are, do you believe that the demand environment is strong enough to absorb these near-term restarts, and likewise, do you believe that scrap demand will be strong enough to absorb the incremental prime scrap supplies or do you see weakness beyond August for prime scrap prices as well?\nMark Millett: Well, taking your last question on -- from a scrap perspective, we certainly see no issues with the scrap flow. Obviously, there was a month that got a little tight when you had all the automotive or -- virtually all the automotive production and their associated support facilities and the staff was down, prime scrap absolutely ground to a halt. But we are seeing that come back quite dramatically and that’s going to continue to come back. And I think that the scrap market was -- has been over baked for the last few months and that the recent downtick kind of normalized at some. I think you will see a little more -- a bit more softness in August on scrap, I mean, on prime scrap in particular and then stabilize at a more normalized value for the rest of the year. So -- but supply should not be an issue whatsoever.\nTheresa Wagler: Yeah. Dave, I have -- Mark and I are looking into a little bit, because from a capacity standpoint, I guess, maybe you heard things that we haven’t. We are not -- you seemed to suggest that there’s somewhere between 5 million and 7 million tons of capacity coming back online in the near-term and then that’s not a number that we would ascribe to.\nDave Gagliano: What numbers you ascribe -- subscribe to us as far as the capacity of coming back. We just added up the ones that we have heard about in various trade publications…\nTheresa Wagler: We are more…\nDave Gagliano: … that kind of thing?\nTheresa Wagler: Yeah. We actually -- there’s some capacity that we believe is coming offline and I am not sure if that’s been made public or not. But we would say that is likely to be in the 1.5 million to 2 million tons of capacity that we see coming back on line in the near-term. So, from that perspective, I guess, our answer will be that, yes, we believe that that can be satisfied if you will. I mean we are not seeing a big reaction to that. But, again, I -- maybe we are behind on the announcement.\nMark Millett: And obviously it is…\nDave Gagliano: No. That’s helpful. Thanks. \nMark Millett: Obviously, David, it’s a balance between what may come back, and obviously, the increase in demand. There’s absolutely no doubt demand is increasing, obviously, as automotive ramps back up. They are -- there’s some little dislocations here or there in the supply chain, but the demand is picking up, I think, relatively substantially. And if you look at least the conversations I have had out there with some of the large dealerships and if you look at the cars, automotive information and that sort of thing, there is a tightness in inventory, in the dealerships, particularly on pickup, SUV, crossover type vehicles and that’s going to help support at least the output of the automotives. So the automotives I do believe are going to be in good shape, constrained only by, perhaps, regional issues from COVID and making sure they have the employees in their plants. What we are also seeing on the sheet product side of things, the white goods, HVAC appliance, they are coming back very, very strong as well from a potential output sort of demand perspective. In fact, we had one HVAC customer just call us this week making damn sure that we had the material in the pipeline, because they are running at an excessive or above normal volume, and again, only constrained by possible local issues with the sort of manning their plant. So underlying demand we see, and again, those that know don’t predict and those that don’t know predict. All we can go on is what we see in our order book, our order input rate and the commentary from our customers. We see a very healthy underlying economy there, steel consuming economy. We came into this incredibly strong in the first quarter and I think now you have got a little bit of a pent-up demand. Lean -- you have got inventories that are generally lean, particularly in the distributor space as they don’t want to take any speculative risk right now. Imports are going to be constrained for the rest of the year. You have iron ore pricing, raw material pricing actually for the integrated mills is very, very strong, which is going to support the global cost curve. So you have got general dynamics within or general drivers within our industry that I would suggest bode well for the rest of the year.\nDave Gagliano: Okay. That’s helpful. Thanks very much for the additional color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Seth Rosenfeld with Exane BNP Paribas. You may proceed with your question.\nSeth Rosenfeld: Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions today. If I can, I have a couple of questions with regards to the outlook for the Fabrication business, please and the margin there. Can you just comment on how you viewed sustainability at least in healthy fab margins as you look ahead to the second half? In light of the current steel price weakness, is there potential for some upside going into Q3 or do you view the recent run rate being more sustainable in the longer term, I recognize we are already below where we were back in 2019? And then secondly with regards to fab, I wonder if you can comment a little bit with regards to some of the end markets you are serving there with regard potentially any shift between, say, public or private sector activity for fab? Thank you.\nTheresa Wagler: Yeah. Seth, so from the perspective of the fabrication -- the business margin, so as Mark mentioned, the teams are forecasting a pretty strong volume for the second half of this year based on the order backlog that they have and the order inquiry rates that we are seeing, which is great. You asked about specific end markets and they are very much into the, we are going to call the big box buildings, the warehouses. We have a large market share in that. So if you can think about the advent of online ordering, people not going to retail locations, that business right now is fairly strong, because there is needed warehouse space. As far as whether or not we are seeing it more in the public versus private sector, I think, we are seeing it right now still more to the private than to the public sector, but maybe that could change depending upon what stimulus looks like, I don’t think anybody knows what that is at this point in time. Regarding margins, they tend to have anywhere between maybe around even six weeks to eight weeks or more weeks of steel inventory on the ground. So as we work through the lower priced steel environment they will benefit from that. So you could see some margin expansion in the second half of the year related to that. It’s just -- it’s a little bit difficult to predict, but I would suggest, that the margins that they have been able to sustain are not extraordinary from the level of being able to be sustainable into the future.\nSeth Rosenfeld: Very clear. Thank you very much.\nTheresa Wagler: And I am not sure if I hit all your points or not. Okay. Great. Thanks.\nSeth Rosenfeld: That’s great. Thanks. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andreas Bokkenheuser with UBS. You may proceed with your question.\nAndreas Bokkenheuser: Thank you. Just one question from me and just following up on when you are talking about the scrap price coming down obviously and where you on spread. This is typically an environment where we have historically seen you capture market share and you are obviously doing that at the moment. So, I guess, just trying to get a little bit of a stent. How comfortable do you feel about the current spreads as they are at the moment, I mean, we have obviously seen steel prices coming down and scraps coming down as well, and the falling steel price, obviously, effectively prevent some of the integrators on restarting capacity. So do you feel comfortable with spreads at the current level, I guess, the question?\nMark Millett: Again, it’s interesting times to predict and when you said in an environment you used the word typical. I don’t think there is anything typical about the environment that we are in. All I can say is, I do believe we have reached a trough point. Second quarter was the trough for volumes for sure, particularly on the sheet side of our business, and I think, there is an inflection point in pricing in the next few weeks. So I think that that’s a positive direction or a momentum for pricing, and as I suggested, you are likely to see a little softness on prime scrap here in August and then kind of stable for the rest of the year. So you can make your own predictions as to where spreads might go. I need to emphasize that some of you recognize this, but you have got to recognize that some of our business, our flat-rolled business is related to sort of the CRU index-type pricing and so there is a lag impact in the third quarter.\nTheresa Wagler: I am smiling, Andreas, because I don’t know if we are comfortable with spreads. We always like as high a spread as we possibly can have. But to Mark’s point, I think, on a spot basis there is an opportunity to see spreads expand. Is it fair, Mark?\nMark Millett: Yeah. \nAndreas Bokkenheuser: That’s clear. Thank you very much for taking my question.\nMark Millett: You are welcome.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with Very Independent Research. You may proceed with your question. \nJohn Tumazos: Congratulations on all of the good work in a tough time. Your steel…\nMark Millett: Thank you, John. Yeah. We have got a great team.\nJohn Tumazos: Your steel scrap collections fell 2 times or 3 times more than the steel shipments. Were you deliberately reducing mill inventories of scrap or inventories in the recycling system or did the opportunities to collect scrap decline with the economy or did outside brokers gain share and if a business doesn’t earn good returns, maybe it’s okay thing if you let the other guys do more business at a loss?\nMark Millett: Well, I think, a little bit of all of the above. Obviously, scrap flow dropped dramatically because of automotive business. Prime scrap pretty well dried up, so that impacted flows. Flows from OmniSource to our mills was strong, it went up. But at the same time, our competition had their own problems. They weren’t producing as much and so we had less homes to broker scrap to.\nJohn Tumazos: Thank you very much.\nMark Millett: You are welcome.\nOperator: This concludes your question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for closing remarks.\nMark Millett: Well, thank you, Laura. And for those that remain on the call, again, thank you for your attention today, joining us. I just would like to emphasize what an absolutely phenomenal performance our team demonstrated this past quarter. They say when conditions get tough, the tough get going, that’s our team. They did a tremendous, tremendous job and I think it clearly demonstrates the passion, the commitment and the innovation of our team, but also the strength of our business model, because, again, we generated a very, very, very strong cash flow for the quarter under the circumstances. And we would also like to thank our customer base because you folks on the call, you certainly unload us, you certainly supported our ability to perform our peers. So thank you for that. And to all the employees on the call, thank you, thank you, thank you, you did a great job, be safe. Make it a great day. Bye-bye.\nOperator: Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today’s call. Thank you for your participation and have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mark Millett",
            "content": "Well, thank you, Tricia. Good morning. Welcome to our second quarter 2020 earnings call. We certainly appreciate and value your time with us this morning, especially during these uncharted circumstances. Leaders are tasked to make decisions today that have not been required in recent history, regarding the health and the safety of our people, their families and our communities. We are closely monitoring the COVID-19 situation and are continuing to operate safely. None of our operations have been impacted to-date. As always, protecting the health and welfare of our teams is our highest priority. I want to thank each of our 8,400 team members for their passion and continued dedication to excellence. I am incredibly proud to work alongside each of them during this unprecedented time. They are a special group, accomplishing extraordinary things and we are committed to them, their families, and our communities, all while supporting our suppliers and meeting the needs of our customers. But before I continue, Theresa, will you provide insights into our outstanding second quarter performance? Well, thank you, Theresa. As I have mentioned many times in the past, safety is and is always going to be our number one value because nothing is more important. Our safety performance continues to be significantly better than industry averages. But as I have said also many times before, it's not enough, our goal is to have zero injuries across the company and we will continue to strive for that. Our safety performance has further improved during the last 12 months, with our second quarter results continuing the positive trend. We all must be continuously aware of our surroundings and our fellow team members. I challenge all of us to be focused both in the traditional sense, but even more so now, as it relates to keeping one another in good health. The steel fabrication platform delivered a strong second quarter performance. Our fabrication order backlog remains strong and is higher than it was at this time last year. Customers remain constructive concerning non-residential construction projects. We have had some jobs delayed or postponed, but it's not been widespread or material. We anticipate the strength remaining through the rest of this year and expect second half 2020 volume is being equal if not higher than the first half performance. In contrast, as states issued shelter-in-place mandates and domestic manufacturing slowed, scrap supply and collection declined. In particular, prime scrap flow decreased considerably as automotive production ground to an abrupt halt. In addition, significantly lower second quarter domestic steel production utilization, which was estimated at 55% across the industry, resulted in weak ferrous scrap demand. As a result, our metals recycling operations were cash flow positive in the second quarter, but incurred losses at the operating level. As states have started to reopen, scrap flows have improved and we expect our metals recycling platform to return to profitability for the second half of 2020 based on increased volume. The steel team had a tremendous performance in this environment. After record shipments in the first quarter of this year, our volume only decreased 12% in the second quarter. I'd like to commend our commercial teams and the support of our customers for making this happen ad thank you to the metals recycling team for providing the raw materials required to achieve this level of production in what became a very tight market. The strength of our differentiated business model coupled with the passion of our people drove strong steel mill production utilization to almost 80% across the company. While the overall domestic industry, as I said, only operated at 55%. Meaningfully, our flat roll operations achieved utilization of almost 90% in the quarter. As COVID-19 and related state closure implications unfolded in late March through today, steel demand and selling values decreased rapidly from the strength seen in much of the first quarter of this year. Temporary closure of automotive production and the related supply chain closures meaningfully reduced flat-rolled steel demand. The severe decline in energy prices related to oversupply significantly reduced steel demand from steel pipe and tube manufacturers. However, construction-related steel demand was more resilient. Our Structural and Rail Division maintained utilization of over 70% in the second quarter. As a result of reduced flat-rolled steel demand and lower pricing, a considerable number of high cost flat-rolled steel operations came offline since the end of 2019. We believe about 15 million tons or so of flat-rolled sheet capacity has been idled, representing over 20% of annual domestic production capacity. In tough environments, the strength of our people and our superior business model become even more evident. As demonstrated in the second quarter and historically, during periods of market inflection, we maintain higher utilization levels than our peers and gain market share. Uninterrupted low cost operations, provides the greatest customer optionality. Our broad product portfolio and end market diversification within value-added market niches drives flexibility for our commercial teams. Superior supply chain solutions create additional value for our customers, making us a preferred place to shop. And furthermore, a powerful driver is the optionality of internal steel sourcing from our captive manufacturing businesses, which we call pull-through volume. To put this in perspective, our steel fabrication platform and steel processing locations purchased 2.3 million tons of steel in 2019. Only about half of this volume is typically sourced from the SDI-owned steel mills, but in difficult markets, we increase the percentage.  As states continue to determine their reopening guidelines and many steel consuming businesses have resumed operations. We anticipate steel demand will materially improve from the second quarter trough. The automotive sector and its related supply chain have restarted production, and we have started to see some resulting increase in steel demand. The construction sectors remain more resilient and related steel demand has been steady, as evidenced by our Structural and Rail Division volume and steel fabrication customer backlog. The order activity from our construction-related customers, combined with the strength in our steel fabrication order backlog, support our optimism for a continued strength through the rest of the year. The weaker sectors continue to be related to energy and general and industrial consumers, which are likely to require a slightly longer recovery period. Related to continued growth, we provided a summary update of our recent growth investments on our slide in our investor deck posted on the SDI website. In the last 12 months or 24 months, we have executed several strategic investments that have or will benefit our through-cycle earnings and cash flow position. We expanded two steel mills by the combined addition of 440,000 tons of steel rebar production capability, providing product diversification and differentiated supply chain for the customer. Our model provides a meaningful customer optionality and flexibility, with significant logistics, yield and working capital benefits. This end market diversification provides the higher through-cycle utilization for our Structural and Roanoke Steel divisions. We continue to expand capacity at Heartland Steel. It is an 800,000-ton value-added flat-rolled steel processor and the team has been operating at record coating levels, providing additional internal production support and operational flexibility for our Butler Flat Roll Division, increasing the through-cycle utilization of our steel assets and broadening our value-added product mix. The acquisition of 75% of United Steel Supply has been an excellent investment in addition to our portfolio. As a local distributor of pre-painted construction product, it has provided a meaningful channel to new and more diversified customers. With our customer-preferred co-branded supply chain and more rurally located custom base, and recent stimulus dollars flowing these communities, United Steel Supply achieved record second quarter shipments. We anticipate the strength to continue through the rest of this year. Since the acquisition of Columbus Flat Roll Division, we have meaningfully increased its through-cycle earnings capability. We have transformed its product portfolio with the expansion of its value-added steel capabilities, the diversification of its customer base and the addition of a paint line. In a few weeks ago, the team achieved another milestone. They coated their first prime galvanized coil on our new 400,000 ton line. Columbus now has for value-added coating lines. The investment reduces Columbus' hot-rolled coil exposure and provides a ready hot band consumer base in the south for our new Texas Flat Roll Mill when it starts operating in less than a year from now. We remain incredibly excited about on our new next-generation flat mill in Texas and its certain contribution to our growth and earnings capability. As Theresa explained, our strategy focused on entering 2020 from a point of financial strength, providing for the required investment associated with this transformational project. Our team has an incredible depth of experience in the construction, startup and operation of large steel manufacturing assets. Collectively, we believe they have more experienced than exist in any other company in the industry. The Texas' team's performance and momentum have been absolutely remarkable. Construction is going extremely well and within our expanded capital cost of $1.9 billion. We expect the operations to begin in mid-2021. We are having weekly conversations with the equipment suppliers regarding the impact of COVID-19. I don't believe our planned schedule has been meaningfully impacted thus far. The new state-of-the-art 3-million-ton steel mill will include two value-added coating lines comprised of a 550,000-ton galvanizing line and a 250,000-ton paint line. It will follow the same stringent sustainability model as our other steelmaking facilities with state-of-the-art, environmental controls and processes. Our existing steel mills have a fraction of the greenhouse gas emission and energy intensity of average world's steelmaking technology, less than 15% of the average producer. With an 84-inch coil width and up to 1-inch thick 100 ksi product, the Texas Mill will have capabilities beyond existing electric-arc furnace flat-rolled steel producers and will compete even more effectively with the integrated steel model and foreign competition. The mill is strategically located in Sinton, Texas near Corpus Christi. We have three targeted regional sales markets for the Sinton Steel Mill, representing over 27 million tons of relevant flat-rolled steel consumption in the Southern and West Coast United States and Mexico. We also plan to effectively compete with the heavy imports in Houston and the West Coast. Our customers are excited to have a regional flat-rolled steel supplier. We have two customers now committed to locate on site with us, representing over 800,000 tons of annual consumption -- processing and consumption capability. We still have others in conversation and would expect to have further volume in the next months. Sinton location provides a significant freight benefit to most of our intended customers relative to their current supply chain options. This freight advantage along with much shorter lead times provides a superior supply chain solution, allowing us to not only be the preferred domestic steel supply in the South and Western U.S., but also to effectively compete with imports, which inherently have long lead times and speculative pricing risk. From a raw material perspective, our metals recycling operations already control a significant and growing scrap volume in Mexico through scrap management relationships, much of which is needed prime scrap. As announced earlier this year, we are also planning to acquire a Mexican scrap company as part of our raw materials strategy for Sinton. Their primary operation is strategically located near high-volume industrial scrap sources throughout Central and Northern Mexico. The company currently ships approximately 500,000 gross tons of scrap annually but have estimated annual process and capability of almost 2 million tons. After the acquisition is finalized in the coming months, we plan to ramp up that volume quickly. We believe our performance-based operating culture, coupled with our considerable experience and successfully constructing and operating highly profitable steel assets positions us incredibly well to successfully execute the transformational Texas growth investment. As I have said before, we are not simply adding flat-rolled production capacity. We have a differentiated product offering, a unique regional supply chain solution, a significant geographic freight and lead time advantage, and offer an import alternative to a region in need of options. Our unique culture and the execution of our long-term strategy continue to strengthen our financial position through consistent strong cash flow generation and long-term value creation, differentiating us from our competition and demonstrating our sustainability. I believe you would all agree this was clearly demonstrated this past quarter. Again, our commitment is to the health and safety of our people, our families and our communities, all while supporting our vendors, serving our customers and sustaining our value creation journey. Our team is incredible. I would like to thank each of them for their patience, their resilience and commitment during these uncharted times. They have an indomitable spirit that drives us all to excellence. Additionally, a sincere and heartfelt thank you to the health care providers and their families within Steel Dynamics and those serving individuals across the world. So, on behalf of SDI, thank you all, be safe, be well. And Laura, we'd like to open the call up for questions. I guess that, obviously, that you just, sorry. I got to unmute myself there. You missed the best part. No. I think, as we have always demonstrated in the past, in moments of inflection down and tough markets, we continue to gain market share. And again, I want to emphasize, yeah, our shipments were down 12%. The 12% from a record, record production level in Q1. So it's an absolutely incredible performance by the team and I think that the fact that we are fully engaged, fully operational, obviously, allows our customer base to access products, particularly when they are constrained in their own inventories. We just allow them to continue and they have got confidence in us. What we are here to deliver and we will deliver a product. We are fortunate, as we have said before, particularly in Columbus, we have been expanding our automotive presence. A lot of our automotive customer base is actually European, so BMW, VW and Mercedes. They have tended not to be as hard hit in Q2 as some of the domestic producers and we certainly benefited from that. And just to emphasize that... Just like anecdotally because we continue to say that part of our strength as a company through-cycle, generating strong through-cycle cash is the diversity of our product mix. And just as an example, Steal of West Virginia, small metal for us, but they were impacted pretty dramatically by the reduction in truck and trailer. That industry is off about 50%. But because of their expansion into solar, they are going to ship about 100,000 tons of solar product, as compared to 30,000 tons last year. And so it's the diversification both the product and market sector allows us to outperform our competition quarter in, quarter out. Well, on a -- from a loan product standpoint, Structural and Rail Division, their backlog is actually up quarter-over-quarter. We see continued strength there that the fabricators are remaining very busy. The large projects remained strong and constructively some of the smaller product -- projects that were kind of delayed or put on hold earlier in the year because of COVID, we are starting to see those projects now getting released. So we are very, very constructive, obviously, we get insight or visibility through our New Millennium Building Systems, our Fabrication business. There, again, very, very strong backlog. No widespread push backs or project postponements. A little softness up in the Northeast, that's not a big market for us, but some of the construction sites were closed down and have been closed down, but seriously, we see very, very positive strength through the rest of the year. Well, taking your last question on -- from a scrap perspective, we certainly see no issues with the scrap flow. Obviously, there was a month that got a little tight when you had all the automotive or -- virtually all the automotive production and their associated support facilities and the staff was down, prime scrap absolutely ground to a halt. But we are seeing that come back quite dramatically and that's going to continue to come back. And I think that the scrap market was -- has been over baked for the last few months and that the recent downtick kind of normalized at some. I think you will see a little more -- a bit more softness in August on scrap, I mean, on prime scrap in particular and then stabilize at a more normalized value for the rest of the year. So -- but supply should not be an issue whatsoever. And obviously it is... Obviously, David, it's a balance between what may come back, and obviously, the increase in demand. There's absolutely no doubt demand is increasing, obviously, as automotive ramps back up. They are -- there's some little dislocations here or there in the supply chain, but the demand is picking up, I think, relatively substantially. And if you look at least the conversations I have had out there with some of the large dealerships and if you look at the cars, automotive information and that sort of thing, there is a tightness in inventory, in the dealerships, particularly on pickup, SUV, crossover type vehicles and that's going to help support at least the output of the automotives. So the automotives I do believe are going to be in good shape, constrained only by, perhaps, regional issues from COVID and making sure they have the employees in their plants. What we are also seeing on the sheet product side of things, the white goods, HVAC appliance, they are coming back very, very strong as well from a potential output sort of demand perspective. In fact, we had one HVAC customer just call us this week making damn sure that we had the material in the pipeline, because they are running at an excessive or above normal volume, and again, only constrained by possible local issues with the sort of manning their plant. So underlying demand we see, and again, those that know don't predict and those that don't know predict. All we can go on is what we see in our order book, our order input rate and the commentary from our customers. We see a very healthy underlying economy there, steel consuming economy. We came into this incredibly strong in the first quarter and I think now you have got a little bit of a pent-up demand. Lean -- you have got inventories that are generally lean, particularly in the distributor space as they don't want to take any speculative risk right now. Imports are going to be constrained for the rest of the year. You have iron ore pricing, raw material pricing actually for the integrated mills is very, very strong, which is going to support the global cost curve. So you have got general dynamics within or general drivers within our industry that I would suggest bode well for the rest of the year. Again, it's interesting times to predict and when you said in an environment you used the word typical. I don't think there is anything typical about the environment that we are in. All I can say is, I do believe we have reached a trough point. Second quarter was the trough for volumes for sure, particularly on the sheet side of our business, and I think, there is an inflection point in pricing in the next few weeks. So I think that that's a positive direction or a momentum for pricing, and as I suggested, you are likely to see a little softness on prime scrap here in August and then kind of stable for the rest of the year. So you can make your own predictions as to where spreads might go. I need to emphasize that some of you recognize this, but you have got to recognize that some of our business, our flat-rolled business is related to sort of the CRU index-type pricing and so there is a lag impact in the third quarter. Yeah. You are welcome. Thank you, John. Yeah. We have got a great team. Well, I think, a little bit of all of the above. Obviously, scrap flow dropped dramatically because of automotive business. Prime scrap pretty well dried up, so that impacted flows. Flows from OmniSource to our mills was strong, it went up. But at the same time, our competition had their own problems. They weren't producing as much and so we had less homes to broker scrap to. You are welcome. Well, thank you, Laura. And for those that remain on the call, again, thank you for your attention today, joining us. I just would like to emphasize what an absolutely phenomenal performance our team demonstrated this past quarter. They say when conditions get tough, the tough get going, that's our team. They did a tremendous, tremendous job and I think it clearly demonstrates the passion, the commitment and the innovation of our team, but also the strength of our business model, because, again, we generated a very, very, very strong cash flow for the quarter under the circumstances. And we would also like to thank our customer base because you folks on the call, you certainly unload us, you certainly supported our ability to perform our peers. So thank you for that. And to all the employees on the call, thank you, thank you, thank you, you did a great job, be safe. Make it a great day. Bye-bye."

            "name": "Theresa Wagler",
            "content": "Absolutely. Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for being here. Our second quarter 2020 net income was $75 million or $0.36 per diluted share, above our guidance of $0.29 per share to $0.33 per share due to stronger than anticipated flat-rolled steel shipments. Our second quarter results were reduced by the following two items, costs related to our June 2020 refinancing activities of approximately $0.08 per diluted share, and costs net of capitalized interest associated with the construction of our new Sinton Texas Flat Roll Steel Mill of approximately $0.03 per diluted share. Excluding these two items, second quarter 2020 adjusted net income was $0.47 per diluted share above our adjusted guidance of $0.40 per share to $0.44 per share. One comment before proceeding, yes, the comparability of second quarter 2020 financial results to sequential or prior year amount is unfavorable, but to achieve what our teams have achieved in this unchartered environment, as Mark mentioned, is simply incredible. Steel and ferrous scrap demand declined significantly in the second quarter of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting temporary closures of numerous steel consuming businesses. As a result, our second quarter 2020 revenues were $2.1 billion, 19% lower than first quarter sequential results and 24% lower than prior year sales. Our second quarter 2020 operating income was $159 million, over 40% lower than those sequential first quarter and prior year results. From an operating platform perspective, our steel operations delivered an outstanding performance during this challenging time. Second quarter steel shipments of 2.5 million tons were only 12% lower than the record 2.8 million tons achieved in the sequential first quarter of this year and only 9% lower than prior year's second quarter. Our steel mills operated almost 80% of their capability, while the rest of the domestic industry operated at 55%. Due to the momentum in the first quarter, our steel shipments in the first half of 2020 are only 2% lower than in 2019. Our ability to maintain higher steel volumes is a result of our value-added highly diversified product offering, our supply chain differentiation and our internal manufacturing businesses, a sincere congratulation to the entire team. However, steel prices deteriorated, our average quarterly realized sales price decreased $19 per ton to $755 in the second quarter, while average scrap cost decreased only $1 per ton resulting in steel metal margin compression. The result was second quarter 2020 operating income of $172 million for our steel operations, 41% lower than the sequential first quarter. As states issued shelter-in-place mandate and domestic manufacturing slowed, scrap supply and collection declined. This in combination with lower domestic steel production caused weak ferrous scrap demand. As a result, our metals recycling operations recorded an operating loss of $6 million for the second quarter of 2020 but they remained cash flow positive. Our metals recycling operations provide a competitive advantage to sourcing ferrous scrap for our steel mills, allowing for increased scrap quality, melt efficiency and reduction of company-wide working capital requirements. Our vertically connected operating model benefits both platforms. For our Steel Fabrication business, second quarter 2020 operating income remained strong at $27 million, compared to sequential results of $29 million due to steady shipments. We continue to experience a strong backlog and customers remain constructive considering non-residential construction projects. Our cash generation continues to be very strong based on our differentiated business model and highly variable cost structure. During the second quarter of 2020, we generated $486 million of cash flow from operations, representing our second best quarterly performance. As we stated on last quarter's call, during weaker environment, our working capital can be a meaningful funding source and it was in the second quarter, generating over $290 million of cash flow. For the first half of 2020, we generated $697 million of cash flow from operations, representing a record first half performance. We also invested $527 million in fixed asset, of which $371 million was invested in our new Texas Flat Roll Steel Mill. We also maintained our cash dividend at 25% -- $0.25 per share in the second quarter after increasing a 4% in the first quarter of this year. During the first half of 2020, we have repurchased $107 million of our common stock and $444 million remains authorized for repurchase at the end of the quarter. In June, we also took advantage of the capital market and executed our second investment grade notes offering issuing $400 million of 2.4% notes due in 2025 and $500 million of 3.25% notes due in 2031. These transactions were leveraged neutral and proceeds were used to repay two tranches of our then existing higher cost high yield notes, combined with our December inaugural investment grade refinancing, we have extended our overall debt maturity profile and lowered our effective interest rate to under 4%. These actions reflect the strength of our capital foundation, consistent cash flow capability and strong liquidity profile, demonstrating our confidence in our sustainable through-cycle strong cash generation. For the second half of 2020, we currently are planning for capital investments to be roughly between $800 million and $850 million, of which our new Texas Steel Mill represents $700 million to $750 million of that range. We estimate capital investments for the full year of 2021 to also be in the range of $700 million to $750 million with the Texas Mill representing about $580 million of that amount, as their operations are expected to begin mid-year 2021. We entered 2020 a position of strength with a strong cash position and available liquidity of $2.8 billion and we have remained in a position of strength as we have maintained that liquidity with cash and short-term investments of $1.6 billion and our $1.2 billion fully available revolving credit facility. One can't look historically at our financial performance to determine either a future trough or peak. We have grown significantly, transformed our Columbus Flat Roll Division, further diversified our steel product offerings and incorporated even more levers to increase our through-cycle financial performance. We have also added new manufacturing businesses to our portfolio that use steel as a raw material, providing additional opportunities to sustain our steel mills' utilization in a weaker market cycle. In addition, collectively, our primary recent and planned strategic growth investments provide an estimated incremental annual future EBITDA of over $425 million on a through-cycle historical spread basis. You can see that on a slide in our second quarter investor deck. I believe it's slide 13. This estimate includes our Texas Steel Mill, the third galvanizing line at Columbus, which has just recently started and our two rebar expansions. We are simply even more agile today than we have ever been before. We are also dedicated to preserving our investment-grade credit rating. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes responsible strategic growth with appropriate shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that's complemented with a variable share repurchase program when appropriate. We are squarely positioned for the continuation of a sustainable optimized long-term value creation. I know that some of you actually model some more specificity within our flat roll group shipments, so I will provide those for you now. During the second quarter, we had flat-rolled shipments representing hot roll coil and pickled and oiled of 746,000 tons, we had cold-rolled shipments of 132,000 tons and we had coated shipments of 900,000 tons, representing 1,778,000 tons in the second quarter in totality. And finally, on a personal note, I just want to sincerely thank the teams for their passion and their generosity, and the care that they are showing for one another's health and safety. It truly is tremendous. So, thank you. Mark? Yeah. I think I would just complement to what Mark said in that, where we saw the most market share gains was in the flat roll group, as well as structural steels, railroad rail. And then we have a bit of a niche in the solar products with the solar customers as well both within the hot rolled side of the business and within the specialty steel, the Steel of West Virginia. And in addition to that, with the advent of the Columbus teams starting up with the third galvanizing line, it will be nice to see that getting into the market and actually increasing the value add portion of their capabilities in the second half of this year. So I think there's a lot of opportunity for us to both enrich the mix and then to continue in that market share gain. Yeah. So, Dave, whatever is in the EBITDA on adjusted basis is -- are non-cash items only. So at Sinton, those are cash items, so there's nothing that's been excluded. So they are deducted from the adjusted EBITDA, and from a financing perspective only, I think, about $4 million were actually added back, because they were non-cash write-offs. Otherwise, if it's cash related, we are not adding that back. Yeah. Dave, I have -- Mark and I are looking into a little bit, because from a capacity standpoint, I guess, maybe you heard things that we haven't. We are not -- you seemed to suggest that there's somewhere between 5 million and 7 million tons of capacity coming back online in the near-term and then that's not a number that we would ascribe to. We are more... Yeah. We actually -- there's some capacity that we believe is coming offline and I am not sure if that's been made public or not. But we would say that is likely to be in the 1.5 million to 2 million tons of capacity that we see coming back on line in the near-term. So, from that perspective, I guess, our answer will be that, yes, we believe that that can be satisfied if you will. I mean we are not seeing a big reaction to that. But, again, I -- maybe we are behind on the announcement. Yeah. Seth, so from the perspective of the fabrication -- the business margin, so as Mark mentioned, the teams are forecasting a pretty strong volume for the second half of this year based on the order backlog that they have and the order inquiry rates that we are seeing, which is great. You asked about specific end markets and they are very much into the, we are going to call the big box buildings, the warehouses. We have a large market share in that. So if you can think about the advent of online ordering, people not going to retail locations, that business right now is fairly strong, because there is needed warehouse space. As far as whether or not we are seeing it more in the public versus private sector, I think, we are seeing it right now still more to the private than to the public sector, but maybe that could change depending upon what stimulus looks like, I don't think anybody knows what that is at this point in time. Regarding margins, they tend to have anywhere between maybe around even six weeks to eight weeks or more weeks of steel inventory on the ground. So as we work through the lower priced steel environment they will benefit from that. So you could see some margin expansion in the second half of the year related to that. It's just -- it's a little bit difficult to predict, but I would suggest, that the margins that they have been able to sustain are not extraordinary from the level of being able to be sustainable into the future. And I am not sure if I hit all your points or not. Okay. Great. Thanks. I am smiling, Andreas, because I don't know if we are comfortable with spreads. We always like as high a spread as we possibly can have. But to Mark's point, I think, on a spot basis there is an opportunity to see spreads expand. Is it fair, Mark?"

And now, I’m pleased to turn the call over to Mark.\nMark Millett: Thank you, Tricia. Good morning everybody. Welcome to our first quarter of 2020 earnings call. We certainly appreciate and value your time at these unprecedented circumstances. Steel making is designated a critical infrastructure industry by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, but deemed essential to the nation’s defense, infrastructure, transportation and overall economy. As such all our operations have been operating. Protecting the health and wellbeing of the teams is on this critical priority. We are closely monitoring the COVID 19 situation and have implemented numerous additional practices throughout the Company to protect each of us. I want to thank our more than 8,400 team members for remaining steadfast and passionate. We continue to operate safely with a spirit of excellence. I’m incredibly proud to work alongside each of them during this unparallel time. We are committed to the health and safety of our people, the families and our communities, all while supporting our suppliers and meeting the needs of our customers. But before I continue, Theresa, will you please provide insights on the team’s recent incredible performance during the first quarter that should not go unstated, despite these present environmental issues along with our strong financial foundation.\nTheresa Wagler : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Our first quarter 2020 net income was $187 million or $0.88 per diluted share. Above our guidance of $0.83 to $0.87 due to stronger than anticipated March flat-rolled steel shipments. First quarter 2020 revenues were $2.6 billion somewhat lower than prior year’s first quarter sales, 10% higher than fourth quarter sequential results driven by improved steel pricing and shipment. Our first quarter, 2020 operating income was $274 million, $18 million lower than prior year, first quarter, but notably 50% higher than sequential fourth quarter results due to record steel shipments driven by solid first quarter underlying demand. From a platform perspective our steel operation’s first quarter shipments increased 7% sequentially to a record, 2.8 million tons with increased volumes experienced across the platform. Our average quarterly realized sales price increased $10 per ton $774 in the first quarter and average scrap cost increased $24 per ton, profiting steel metal margin compression. The result with first quarter steel operating income of $293 million, 45% higher than the sequential fourth quarter results. For our metals recycling platform first quarter operating income was $8 million compared to a loss of $5 million sequentially. A result of higher ferrous to non-ferrous selling values and shipment with prime scrap industries writing almost $30 per gross ton during the first quarter. About 65% of our mills recycling ferrous shipment served by all the steel mills, increasing our scrap quality, our melting efficiency and reducing our Companywide working capital requirements. Our vertically connected operating model benefits both the platforms. For our steel fabrication business, first quarter of 2020 operating income remains strong at $29 million compared to near record sequential results of $33 million. Primarily due to seasonally lower first quarter shipments, we experienced record order inquiry and bookings in the first quarter and demarche with a record backlog. We are still experiencing strong order inquiry and are entering the traditional construction season on a good footing. Our cash generation continues to be strong. During the first quarter of 2020 we generated $211 million of cash flow from operations offset by operational working capital growth related to higher steel selling values and the $74 million distribution of our annual companywide profit sharing to our teams. We spent $218 million in fixed asset investments during the first quarter of which 130 million related to our New Sinton, Texas Flat-rolled Steel Mill investment. To-date we have funded $335 million of the $1.9 billion project. Regarding shareholder distributions, we increased our cash dividends 4% in the first quarter of this year to $0.25 per common share. This follows increases of over 20% in both 2018 and 2019, the Board also authorized an additional $500 million for stock repurchases in February of this year. We repurchased $170 million of our common stock during the first quarter and 444 million remains available under the new authorization. In 2016 we have invested $1.3 billion in our common stock representing over 15% of our outstanding shares. These actions reflect the strength of our capital foundation, consistent cash flow capability and strong liquidity profile, demonstrating our confidence in our sustainable through cycle strong cash generation. Part of that confidence is based on the high variability of our cost structure within our operating platforms. During market weakness, working capital becomes a funding source. 2015 is a great example. Working capital provided over $500 million to cash flow that year. For the coming months, we expect working capital to also be a source of cash flow for us. For the remainder of the year, we currently are planning the capital investments to be roughly $1.2 billion of which the New Sinton, Texas Steel Mill represents $1 billion. This spending percent is heavily weighted to the second half of 2020 over $700 million of that $1 billion spend is actually meant to be in the second half of this year. As we gain more visibility and see extent of the disruption in 2020 related to the Corona virus, we could shift some of the 2020 investment into 2021 if we believed it was necessary. Based on current timeline, we estimate capital investments for 2021 to be in the range of 700 million to 750 million of which Sinton represents 600 million. We entered the Corona virus crisis in a position of strength with a strong cash position and liquidity profile. Entering 2020 we had over $1.6 billion of cash in short-term investments. At the end of the first quarter, we have almost $1.5 billion. Combined with a $1.2 billion undrawn unsecured revolving credit facility. We have available liquidity of over $2.6 billion. One can’t look historically our financial performance to determine either a trough or a peak future performance. We have grown significantly transformed or Columbus Flat-rolled division, further diversified our steel product offerings and incorporated even more levers to increase our through cycle financial performance. Since 2015 we have increased our total shipping capacity from 11 million tons to over 13 million tons, while increasing our value-added revenues from just over 55% in 2015 to almost 70% last year. Since 2015 we have transformed Columbus’s through cycle earnings capability by reducing their operating costs, dramatically increasing their value-added product capabilities and diversifying our customer base and end market factors. We have expanded our structural in Rail and Roanoke Bar steel divisions to include reinforcing bar production capabilities. Further diversifying the locations product offerings in order to sustain higher through cycle utilization. We have also added new manufacturing businesses to our portfolio that use steel as a raw material providing additional opportunities to sustain our own steel mills utilization throughout market cycles. Since 2015 we have increased the possible internal volume by over 1.5 million tons through acquisitions and growing our steel fabrication platform. This is an incredibly powerful tool during weak demand environments. In addition, collectively, our primary recent and planed strategic growth investments provide an estimated incremental annual future EBITDA of over $425 million on a through cycle historical spread basis. This estimate includes our Sinton Steel Mill and third Columbus galvanizing lines as well as our two operational reinforcing bar expansions. We are simply even more agile today than ever before. We are also dedicated to preserving our investment grade credit rating. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes responsible strategic growth with appropriate shareholder distributions, comprised of a base positive dividend profile that is complimented with a variable share repurchase program during periods of excess cash generation. We are squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable, optimized long-term value creation. And on a personal note, I want to take just a moment. I want to wish my dad a very happy birthday. He has not listened to one of these calls in 25 years and he is listening this morning and I also want to thank our teams truly for their passion and generosity and the care that they are showing for each other’s health and safety. God bless. Mark?\nMark Millett: Well, thank you Theresa. As I stated, safety is and always will be our number one value on priority. Nothing is more important. During the first quarter of this year, our safety performance improved from the previous quarter than it comes with a meaningful improvement in the severity of incidents. Our safety performance continues to be significantly better than industry averages. As I said many times before, it is not enough. It will never be enough until we reach our goal of zero. We all need to be continuously aware about surroundings and our fellow team members, I challenge all of us to be focused both as we think traditionally of safety, but even more so now as it relates to keeping each other in good health. The steel fabrication platform delivered a strong first quarter performance, construction is also deemed an essential business and as such, almost all the States below construction projects to remain open. We have some jobs delayed or postponed, but at this time it is not being widespread or meaningful. This should be expected as in previous market downturns construction lag the rest of the market by four to six months to pre-funded ongoing projects. We experienced the record number of inquiries and bookings in the first quarter. Our fabrication order backlog remains very strong, but with 15% higher than at this time last year. Our metals recycling team perform well in the quarter returning to profitability. During the first quarter, prime scrap appreciated about $25 or $30 per gross ton probably with lower domestic steel production, April prime scrap prices were tracked at about $30 and shredded $45 per gross ton. Lower industrial prime scrap flow related to the temporary idling of the automotive sector in April was offset by reduced demand due to lower steel mill utilization, maintaining sufficient prime scrap availability. As the announced staggered automotive plant restarts beginning later April and throughout May, we expect to see prime scraps will return to good levels prior to a ramp up in steel mill utilization and thus in turn stable scrap prices. In general, the steel teams had a phenomenal performance in the quarter hitting record volumes in a tough environment. We saw underlying steel demand strength and increased steel - values in those flat-rolled and long steel products through substantially all the first quarter, before the Russia, Saudi Arabia oil price war, as state COVID 19 stay at home directives. Since mid-March the landscape has shifted rapidly. A superior decline in energy prices related to oversupply has significantly reduced steel demand from the pipe and tube manufacturers and the temporary closure of automotive production and the related supply chain closures will meaningfully impact flat-rolled steel demand for this upcoming second quarter. Since mid-March hot rolled coil index pricing has declined over a $100 to about $485 per ton according to plants. As a result of reduced flat-rolled demand and reduced pricing, a considerable number of higher costs flat-rolled steel operations have been indefinitely idled. Since the end of 2019 we believe it represents a reduction of between 12 million to 14 million tons of annual flat-rolled sheets steel capacity, approaching some 20%, 30% of total domestic capability. In contrast the construction sector continues to be steady, which as mentioned is a critical steel consuming representing 40% to 45% of total domestic consumption in normal markets. The order activity from our construction related to customers in addition to the current strength in our steel fabrication and order backlog supports the sentiment. We believe that coming months will be difficult, within these environments the strength of our people and our differentiated business model becomes even more evident and more impactful. As demonstrated historically during times and market inflection, we will likely gain market share based on our uninterrupted low cost operations providing the greatest customer optionality, product end market diversification, the value-added marketing measures and additional internal steel sourcing form our captive manufacturing businesses. To put that in perspective, our still fabrication platform, the Tex, Holland and Vulcan, purchased 2.3 million tons of steel in 2019 and only sourced about a half that from SDI owned steel mills. This provides additional opportunity for internal purchasing to keep our steel mills running at higher utilization rates even in a weaker demand environment. U.S. Administration’s recent guidance for States to begin a staged reopening is positive. As they begin this critical process, improved steel demand will follow some pent up demand from already low steel inventories. We have provided a summary of our recent growth investments on a slide in our invested deck posted on the website. In the last 12 to 18 months we have executed several strategic investments that will benefit our through cycle and earnings and cash flow position. We expanded two steel mills by the combined addition of the 440,000 tons of steel rebar production capability providing product diversification and a differentiated supply chain for the customer. Our model provides meaningful customer optionality and flexibility, the significant logistics yield and working capital benefits. This end market diversification provides a high through cycle utilization for our structural and Roanoke steel divisions. Heartland Steel 800,000 ton value-add flat-rolled steel processor that sells primarily cold roll and galvanized products has been ramping up nicely. Providing additional support and operational flexibility for our Butler Flat-rolled division. This increased the through cycle utilization of our steel assets and broaden our value-added product mix. The acquisition of 75% of the United Steel Supply has been another excellent investment. This flat-rolled, galvanized and pre-painted steel distribution company has provided a meaningful distribution channel to new customers. As a consumer of our internal steel products, they also increase the power of our through cycles steel utilization. Since our acquisition of Columbus Flat-rolled division, the transformation of its product portfolio through the expansion of its value-added steel capability, diversification of its customer base and the addition of the paint line has meaningfully increased its through cycle and its capability which will be clearly demonstrated this downturn. We are now close to completing $140 million, 400,000 ton of value-added fluid galvanizing line which we expect to begin operating mid-2020. The value-added products increase will decrease Columbus’ hot roll coil exposure and provide a ready and waiting hot bank customer base in the side for our new Texas Steel Mill. As symptom, we continue to be excited about the material growth for construction of our new next generation flat-rolled steel mill will deliver. As Theresa explained, our financial strategy focused on entering 2020 providing of the required investment associated with this transformational project. Our team has an incredible depth of experience in the construction, startup and operation of large steel manufacturing assets. Collectively, we believe they have more experience than any company in the industry and their performance and momentum has been remarkable. In January, we received the required environmental permitting to allow for full construction efforts and we currently anticipate the mid-2021 startup. That said, as Theresa mentioned, we will be reassessing our timeline throughout the second quarter as we gain more visibility into the impact of COVID 19. Additionally, even though we intentionally did not purchase equipment from China, some of our equipment is being manufactured in other countries where the Corona virus is also active. We are having weekly conversations with these manufacturers and we currently do not believe our plan schedule has been meaningfully impacted. The new state of the art Three million ton steel mill will include a value-added coating line comprised of 550,000 ton galvanizing line, and a 250,000 ton paint line with Galvalume capability. We will follow the same stringent sustainability model as our other steel making facilities with state of the art environmental processes. Our existing steel mills and a fraction of the greenhouse gas emission intensity actually by 12% of average world’s steel making technology, with an 94 inch coil width, one inch thick, 100 KSI product capability. The Texas mill will have capabilities beyond existing electric-arc furnace flat-rolled steel reduces, competing even more effectively with the integrated steel model with foreign competition. As you know the steel mill is strategically located in Sinton, Texas near Corpus Christi. We have targeted three regional sales markets for the mill representing over 27 million tons of relevant flat-rolled steel consumption in the Southern and West coast, United States and Mexico. We also plan to effectively compete with heavy imports in Houston and the West coast. Our customers are excited to have the regional flat-rolled steel supplier. There is several customers in discussions with one already committed to locate on site with us, and a second close behind, these two customers alone will represent over 800,000 tons of local steel processing and consumption capability. The Sinton location provides a significant freight benefit to most of our intended customers relative to their current supply chain options. We believe the potential customer savings related to freight alone are a minimum of $20 to $30 per ton, and for some much higher. This freight advantage along with much shorter lead times provides a differentiated supply chain solution, allowing us to not only be the preferred domestic steel supplier in Southern and Western U.S., but also to effectively compete with imports, which inherently have long lead times and speculative pricing risk. From a raw material perspective, our metals recycling operations already control significant and growing scrap volume in Mexico through scrap management agreements, much of which is prime. As I mentioned in March, we are also planning to acquire a Mexican scrap company as part of our raw material strategy for Sinton. Their primary operations are strategically located near high volume industrial scrap sources through Central and Northern Mexico. The company currently ships approximately 500,000 gross tons of scrap annually, but as an estimated annual processing capability of about two million tons. After closing, we plan to ramp up volume fairly quickly. We are currently waiting for Mexican regulatory approval, as well as other closing requirements that are expected to close in the coming months. We believe our unique operating culture, coupled with our considerable experience in successfully constructing and operating cost effective and highly profitable EAF steel mills positions us incredibly well to successfully execute the Sinton project. As I said before, we are not simply adding flat-rolled production capability. We have a differentiated product offering a significant geographic freight and lead time advantage and an import alternative to region in need of options. Our unique culture and the execution of the long-term strategy continues to strengthen our financial position through consistent, strong cash flow generation and a long-term value creation, differentiating us from our competition and demonstrating our sustainability. Again, our commitment is the health and safety of our people, our families and our communities, all while supporting our vendors, serving our customers, and sustaining our value creation journey. Our team is simply incredible. I would like to thank each of them for their patience, resilience and commitment during these tough times. They have an indomitable spirit that drives us to excel and also a very special thank you to the healthcare providers and their families within steel dynamics, and those serving individuals across the globe. Thank you. Be safe be well. And Michelle, please open the call for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Terry: Hi Mark and Theresa and thanks for the comments. Just interested in the outlook side or what you have seen so far in April, obviously the chart you provided, your presentation had utilizations in 80%. Mark, you are above the average that fall into the mid-50s in the last couple of weeks. Just wanted if you could comment on how steel days going so far in April and maybe based on your order book, what you might expect that to be during 2Q, I know it is a difficult question, but just wondering if you can provide some color on the ground.\nMark Millett: Well, certainly. I think as you said, it is an incredibly difficult question. Not so sure our crystal ball is clearer than others, but I will say that it is positive looking through the lens of our order book and our order input right. I read this morning in American Metal, individuals saying, well, nobody is buying, I guess perhaps they are not buying from other people, but they are buying from us. I believe that obviously energy is going to be very stagnant for the rest of this year into next year. Automotive is going to come back again, one doesn’t necessarily know exactly when, but the expectation is late this month and through May, but the bright spot is certainly is construction. As I mentioned earlier construction tends to lag market downturn, you know we saw it in 2015, we saw it in 2008, 2009. It tends to lag the downturn in the market by about four to six months, because operations or projects tend to be pre-funded and we are seeing that in our new millennium building fabrication business and our structure mill. As I said, new millennium extremely strong backlog despite some project push backs. But there is nothing real meaningful change yet and we are very, very strong, have a large market share in the distribution warehouse market that obviously given people staying at home and the expansion of Amazons and they alike that remains a growth area in all honesty. Structural rail division, backlog is currently solid certainly through May. Did see a $25 price decrease just recently, but I do believe that people will recognize that we are toughing out of the bottom of the market, the scrap is going to be somewhat stable here in the next month or two. So those that have been hanging on the sidelines not buying will likely come to market. In that arena, in the beam arena heavy structural’s distribution is certainly slowed as they whittled down their inventories, they are now prism tight and we are starting to see them come back and buy as they need. The fabricators, that business is still strong as they supply the ongoing construction projects. The rail is actually very, very strong for us at the - rail division and rebar is an addition for us. Compared to past downturns, the product portfolio of structural rail division is much more diverse today and we won’t see the debt of low utilization rate. And if you remember back in 2009, 2010 that business went to 30%, 35% utilization, still remaining somewhat profitable. But that is not going to happen this time. It is a much more diversified product one can make and so that should whether this along very, very well. Engineered bar that is seeing a little softness right there. Obviously automotive is down, energy too is down there and so that is one arena that is probably as soft as anything going on in our product portfolio.  Flat-rolled remains relatively robust, is probably too strong word. But, would tug in those operations to run around about 80%. utilization. That for us seems to be a good balance between fixed costs absorption and pricing. And it appears that we should be able to sustain that targeted output certainly for April, certainly for May, and we were confident that we can do that in June as well. So generally, I think it is obviously quarter-over-quarter. It is going to be a tough couple of months for us. But we are positive.\nChris Terry: Okay, thanks. Thanks for call Mark. I will leave it there.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Gagliano: Hi thanks for taking my questions and congrats on a solid start to obviously a challenging year. I just want to follow-up on the prior question. If we look at, Slide 11, 94% utilization rates in the first quarter. What is that number today?\nTheresa Wagler: Dave, I think that is what Mark just really tried to address. So we have not - there are a couple of things that I think differentiates us. One is that we continue to operate 24x7. And so with that, we get the orders and we gain market share during environment like this, especially as others, higher cost production is being shut down. Right now, we are still operating at a very good utilization rate across the platform. The most challenged division frankly is our engineered bar division. And that is because they are tied to both the energy market and to just general industrial. Once automotive comes back and more specifically for engineered bar, in Caterpillar, John deere, et cetera, start to operating again and I think that scheduled, the last chart sizing was toward the mid the end of May, you just start to see that crack. But that being said, it is a very difficult environment. It is just we are able to gain market share. And we are very nimble in order entry and working with the customers and that tends to make it lot in very difficult environments, our utilization stays higher. The other point is the internal volume that is not to be overlooked. So fabrication is still incredibly strong with a record backlog. They need steel, they will be buying that steel from our own steel mills. The same thing with regarding to our internal processing divisions, so Heartland, United Steel Supply, et cetera. They need steel, they will be buying that from our internal steel mills. So that helps our utilization profile and not - most of our - if any of our competitors have that same lever to pull. So we can’t give you an exact percentage number today. Frankly, I don’t know what the exact percentage would be overall, but I know that we feel good about where we are and that the teams are doing a great job.\nDavid Gagliano: Okay, thanks for the additional color. The commentary was targeting 80% on the flat side, how about - you know is there a target for the remainder of the year in the product mix?\nMark Millett: Well, I think structural should remain in that sort of 75% to 80% range. Again, the merchant shapes, probably less than that. Again, merchant shapes around tend not to be a massive part of our earnings profile anyway, but three out of four of our principal mills Butler, Columbus and Structural Rail Division are targeting that 75% to 80% utilization rate. As Theresa said, engineered bar right now looks pretty softer than that.\nTheresa Wagler: So Dave just as an example, if you go back to 2015, which I would suggest is last week on steel environment, that we have seen the overall, generally our operations even at that time we are operating at over 70%, on the flat-rolled side they were actually operating closer to 90%. It is always more challenging in the long product side, because there is just extra capacity out in the system as it relates to long products and because they are all electric-arc furnace based. But today we would suggest that we just have more internal levers to pull. And so we wouldn’t think that necessarily overall when you grew both flat and long has as much impact as it might have at one point in time.\nDavid Gagliano: Okay, I will leave it at that. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Seth Rosenfeld with Exane BNP Paribas. Please proceed with your question.\nSeth Rosenfeld: Good morning Mark and Theresa, thanks for taking my question. With regards to the cost performance that we have seen in the business, as you continued to grow your processing volumes, utilizing some internal and some third-party substrate, can you give us a sense of how that’s impacting your overall fixed cost base for the business? Again, if we think about how you are positioned in 2020 compared to past downturns, should we consider the growth and processing is essentially more verbalizing your cost base versus history or should we think about this in a different way perhaps. And then secondly, just one more follow-up with regards to Sinton, I wonder if you can please give a little bit of color with regards to decision to continue with the same three million ton target, given the weakness in oil and gas yourself, how did that being weak trough 2021, and plan for one million times going into energy. How do we think about that three million ton target in the current market environment versus the dynamics. Thank you.\nTheresa Wagler: Okay. Seth, good morning. I think I have all the questions written down. So the first question is about the adding of the manufacturing businesses or the processing businesses, there is two points that you should keep in mind. One is, you are correct, it is encrypting the variability of our cost structures, but again, as a reminder, each of our operating platforms is already over 85% variable cost, but this helps that as well. The other component to recognize is that because they are buying steel and using steel as a substrate that is impacting our cost of goods sold by having steel run through cost of goods sold, which is higher priced. And so just anecdotally, in the first quarter, we had about 15% of our cost of goods sold was associated with those steel purchases from the converting companies. From a Sinton perspective Mark, I will let you handle the, the energy question.\nMark Millett: Yes, for sure. I think that the mill is structured or designed for three million tons is not like a conventional since based EAF where you have two casters, this has one caster with a three million ton capability. And as such it is not a matter of doing half the plant or anything like that. Nor do we would be defensive about doing so. Obviously the export would be adjusted somewhat to demand, but again the energy market are pretty tougher at this time. But as one - for those that have been in the industry for a significant amount of time things do cycle, that their market will come back. But the advantage of the Sinton facility is its geographic location, we are not dependent on one single market product. We have got around about 27 million tons of market capability. When you look at the Southwest. You look at the West Coast and you look at Mexico. And we can ship that product between energy and automotive and construction. And we feel that the investment premise remains totally, totally intact.\nTheresa Wagler: And as just a quick point on that, from an energy perspective last year, I think there are other shipments, about 7% was related to energy. But that was primarily at our engineered bar division at Columbus. So within that number, we also shipped quite a bit of volume from our steel, West Virginia facility into solar. So our energy number also includes solar and solar is still something that is actually increasing in demand during this time as well.\nSeth Rosenfeld: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.\nTimna Tanners: Hey, good morning, and hope everyone is healthy and safe.\nMark Millett: Likewise, Timna.\nTheresa Wagler: Thank you.\nTimna Tanners: Thank you. I wanted to just drill down a little bit into your cash flow philosophy. So I heard you - maybe Theresa, I misheard. Can you clarify you said for the remainder of the year CapEx is 1.2 billion which sounds like your CapEx forecast is intact at 1.4 billion or did I hear that wrong. If and you also went on to say that you could adjust it if needed, but you are not adjusting it. And you also said that you just authorized further buybacks and just completed what is it 170 million buybacks in the quarter. So I kind of get the impression that now Steel Dynamics is operating as if the impact of reduced demand and COVID-19 impact is a shorter term phenomenon and kind of getting back to normal later in the year? That is what I’m piecing together from your comments on the CapEx and then the buybacks. But I just wanted a little bit more thought on how you are thinking philosophically about the rest of the year and CapEx and buyback? Thanks.\nTheresa Wagler: Great. So let me clarify, you are right concerning the capital expenditures currently for 2020. We started the year saying, we expect you to spend about 1.4, we spent a little over 200 million in the first quarter. So for the remainder of the year, there is 1.2 billion mark, of that 1.2 billion, over 700 million of that is actually late in the second half of the year and it is related to Sinton. As we progress Timna through the second quarter, we believe we are going to gain a lot of visibility as a state, for lack of a better word reopen on what that means for steel consumption and on our own operations for the remainder of 2020. As we progress to the second quarter, should we think that we want to potentially take some of that capital and push it into 2021. We can make that decision to do that at that time. But right now, from what we are seeing, as Mark mentioned, how the mills are operating and the market share and the activity that we are seeing, we don’t believe that that decision is something that we are making today. As it relates to our share repurchases. We repurchased 107 million in the first quarter. Most of that was purchased within January and February timeframe, but you should expect to see from us in the second quarter, is that we will be watching the markets, watching the impact of the Corona virus and you will see us heavily into the share buyback market at that point in time and then we will reassess for the second half of the year. The reason the Board authorized an additional 500 million in February of this year is simply because we think share repurchases during periods of excess cash flow is an important tool to have and so we wanted to have that tool, because we actually only had I think about $40 million to $50 million left on a previous program. Does that help clarify how we are thinking about things?\nTimna Tanners: Yes, absolutely. Because I was having a difficult time squaring some of those comments with the market environment. Okay. So I guess just as a follow-up if I could, can you just talk a little bit about when you think you will have more visibility on construction? So like you said, construction is late cycle. You wouldn’t see cancellations yet on that, but it sounds like that could start to flow through later in a year. I just wanted to get a little bit more thought on when you would start to see any impact on your backlog or any commentary from what you are seeing on the ground level because we are hearing that private sector activity is kind of drying up. So I’m just wondering if that is in-line with what you are hearing as well. Thanks.\nMark Millett: Well, Timna I have seen the same commentary and it seems to be a little disconnected to higher actual order book and what we have seen, and as I have said quite consistently, our real lens for SDI is through that order book and through the inquiry, right. And all that remains quite strong. The analogy, if you look at the 2008, 2009 downturn, which was pretty significant onto itself, we saw the structural rail division offering pretty consistently into the summer of 2009. That was a good four, five, six months of strong sort of continuation from pre-funded projects and we are seeing as I said - a large part of our business is in the distribution warehouse arena and that is, I would say is expanding more than contracting. So I think we see things optimistically. We were also very, very realistic and I just want to go back to what you are saying about is there a dichotomy between the markets and what was saying relative to a strategy. But I’m going to ramble a little bit, I think, but you know, probably some of the members of the SDI team been in the business probably longer than anyone on the call and probably mostly leadership in steel companies. And we have seen the 80, 81, we lived through and managed through 2001, 2002, when 45% of the industry was in insolvency through 2008, 2009. We lived through 2015. So we are very realistic and recognize the impact in the market change and manage to that. And I think we have demonstrated through our 25, 26 year history, that we are very intentional, we are very disciplined, and we are actually conservative. At that same time and in periods like this, leaders and you have got one of the best leadership teams in the world here. They need to lead, they shouldn’t be seeking cover, we need to be seeking opportunity. And that is where we think Sinton is a very, very good investment, a very good opportunity, and we will continue to go down that path. That being said, just to reemphasize what Theresa said, we are continuing to reassess our order books, the market, cash flow generation, and we will adjust as we see fit. But I think it is very, very important to recognize that. Again, a lot of the CapEx for Sinton is through the back end toward the end of the year here. And it is a huge lever that we can pull if necessary.\nTimna Tanners: Okay. And by lever you mean to delay right? I don’t envision you are talking about, like you pulling it per say, right?\nTheresa Wagler: No, what we are just talking about delaying it Timna.\nTimna Tanners: Right.\nTheresa Wagler: And one other point, and - you really can’t forget the strength of the working capital for us. And the funding sources it can be if necessary.\nTimna Tanners: Okay. Really helpful, guys. Thank you.\nTheresa Wagler: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from our line of Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nPhil Gibbs: Hey. Good morning.\nMark Millett: Good morning.\nTheresa Wagler: Good morning.\nPhil Gibbs: Mark, can you talk a little bit about the onsite customers that you are going to have on Sinton, I think it was part of your script on Sinton, but I just wanted to be sure because I think you have said over 800,000 tons of local are onsite processing and obviously that is a big chunk of the three million tons that you are looking to get? So one, I just want to make sure I heard that correctly and two where do you think that can go as this project evolves?\nMark Millett: Well, I think we have got one sign and a second very, very, very close to signing. There is a preference on their part not to submit names at this moment in time. But you are right, the two of them would amount to about 800,000 tons of consumption and processing capability. We probably have another - not probably, we do have four other interested customers that have been given full packages, lease packages and those sorts of things. They just slowed a little bit because of the situation we are in. But we are confident that we are going to get those folks to. But it is a very I think important part of the overall strategy at that note.\nTheresa Wagler: Collectively, it is likely to be somewhere over a one million tons of onsite capability.\nPhil Gibbs: Okay. Well that is helpful. So talking, basically a third kind of built in onsite there. I think that there are tax benefits or deferrals or accelerated depreciation on years where new assets go into service. Let us just say 2021 is intact for Sinton at least as it is today. What should we be thinking about the size of just the accelerated depreciation, you know benefits in terms of tax avoidance in the year, it goes into service, because obviously with two billion of spending it could be pretty meaningful.\nTheresa Wagler: You know, so we don’t have exact numbers, but I would estimate that of the $1.9 billion, you are likely to have accelerated depreciation on at least 80% to 85% of that number.\nPhil Gibbs: Okay. Would you take that all in year one? I guess all the assets go into service in 2021?\nTheresa Wagler: Yes. So that would all be recorded in 2021 year sort of.\nPhil Gibbs: Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andreas Bokkenheuser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nAndreas Bokkenheuser: Well thank you very much and good morning. I hope you guys all well. Just two quick questions from me, first of all on oil, obviously this week’s oil volatility, how do you guys think about that? Just aside from what it could do to investment in the energy sector on tubular steel and so on and so forth. You know when you kind of saw what happened yesterday to price is what kind of went through your mind in terms of are there any opportunities for steel dynamics that we should be thinking about and what are the less obvious challenges as well? So maybe just give a little framework, if you will, around how you are kind of thinking about the oil price move yesterday. And I guess the second question is more on construction. Can you give a little bit more granularity there? When we look at the residential and non-residential construction numbers, there seems to be as much weakness as the restraints and has been for the last year also. You guys seems to be exposed to the strength of it. So could you give a little bit more granularities where are you seeing that strength in any particular areas? Is it res or non-res, you know, geographically more South than North and so on. That would be very helpful. Thank you very much.\nMark Millett: Well, certainly well regarding the energy markets. I think yesterday it was quite incredible and I’m not so sure we have had time to digest. But just in general, obviously the immediate impact is on the energy markets, pipe and tube. And that was, that is not just a COVID thing, that obviously is Russia and Saudi Arabia doing that thing. And the low energy prices will expand the downturn there that is 8% to 10%, I guess of the steel market in normal times. But we looked at that as a pretty stagnant market rest of the year going into this year and next year, first half of next year anyway. I guess the positive, well one is scrap tends to move down with oil, not for sure that the physical markets would allow that to occur in May, we are looking - perhaps shouldn’t move down in May, but we think given the physical market, it is probably a sideways market moving forward, but that may change here in the next week or two. What I do think is that the pressure on the energy market is going on in turn put pressure on the integrated mills. And I think that you have seen a pretty dramatic idling of integrated capacity, last one is capacity here over the last four or five, six weeks. And if you look back over a longer period, you know the last couple of years, there has been a much more frequent turn-on, turn-off of some of that capacity as they suffer pretty strong economic pressure. And I think a sustained downturn in the energy markets will make some of those assets - it is going to be a tough decision that ever bring them back. But I think it may as a positive may help rationalize the industry to some small degree. Sorry. And then you had the second question on construction granularity. Again, there certainly has been weakness in the northeast, but that has tended to be more projects or construction locations actually being shut down by the states. We certainly see strength in fact. We certainly, as I said see strength in that distribution warehouse arena.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gordon Johnson with GLJ Research. Please proceed with your question.\nGordon Johnson: Hey, guys, thanks for taking the questions. This question may have been asked, but I was wondering if I could get a little bit more color on your shipments expected across some of the different lines, know you said your utilization had dropped to 75%, 80%, can we get maybe a little more color on kind of what you see in Q2, and maybe some of the green shoots you see in a second half?\nTheresa Wagler: No we are not going to get too specific for two different reasons. One is that we generally don’t give that type of guidance. And the second reason is especially going into the environment that we are in right now, there is not a lot of visibility. And so we want to make sure that we are being appropriate. But I think what Mark was suggesting is that we intend to see utilization, or at least we are planning for utilization, higher flat-rolled operations, somewhere in that 75% to 80% range and traditionally even in 2015, we were actually operated about 90%. So, we generally gain market share in flat-rolled during periods of weakness. And we are seeing that today as well. And we don’t see a driver for that to change throughout the quarter. Along product side is more difficult. So in the structural and rail arena, we expect to maintain higher utilization in that 75% to 80% range because of the order backlog as it sits today, and because construction is continuing for us in that arena, and with the addition of rail, and rebar that product diversification helps our facility. Across the other long product mill, it is more difficult. So you are going to see the most weakness in our mind and the special bar quality or the SBQ arena. And then, that is distributed throughout. So that is probably about as much clarity or granularities we can provide the volumes at this point.\nGordon Johnson: Okay, that is helpful. And then one last one, in the checks we have done, it seems like you guys are doing quite well in the construction space, particularly against the integrated mills. Is there any I guess approach you guys have or color you can provide on I guess incremental attempts to share that space? Is that accurate that you guys are doing quite well in the construction space against your integrated peers and thanks for the question.\nTheresa Wagler: Yes. No that is absolutely correct especially - I don’t know if it wasn’t just impurities like this in the first quarter, our structural rail team did a fantastic job on the construction side and pulling in volume. And if you are speaking more specifically about our fabrication business, we have been gaining market share in that arena as well and the team is doing incredibly well. And Mark point out is more specifically in that warehouse arena, but we have been taking market share and we would expect to continue to do that.\nGordon Johnson: Thanks again.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sean Wondrack with Deutsche Bank.  Please proceed with your question.\nSean Wondrack: Hi, Mark and Theresa, and thank you very much for all the information today. Just to look at the auto market, you know I think you had mentioned that some of the auto manufacturers are looking to come back online in the next few weeks. Can you talk about like are you starting to hear from them more like more order inquiry and also sort of for the industry I realize you guys are a great operator and you are going to have the ability to potentially take share this year. What is sort of your baseline, if you have one yet, a baseline forecast for auto production do you assume 10% this year, curious about that. Thank you.\nTheresa Wagler: The question relates to automotive and it relates to the perspective of as they start to roll on and we have been taking market share specifically with the European auto makers, et cetera, would we expect to continue to take that market share and what are we thinking about from a volume perspective? So how much will fuel consumption volumes or auto builds from another perspective and how much will that be down if they get to one million to 1.5 million is what I’m seeing. And then the perspective just around what do we feel about continuing to take that market share related to automotive.\nMark Millett: Got it okay. Well I would suggest that as I said earlier, my crystal ball is probably no better than anyone else’s on the call and not the whole recovery is subject to when folks get back into the marketplace and at what speed do they ramp up. From present information it appears that automotive will stop rolling back during the end of the mid to end of next week and all the way through May depending on which company, there is a backlog of vehicles, right the second so how quick recovery is difficult to gauge. You look at a past troughs it tends to replenish - they have been in position to replenish inventory and pent up demand. I’m not so sure we will see that this time around. To qualify our gain in market share is relative to time is a tough thing, but all I can say is the facilities are sort of armed and ready to go. And it is our flexibility across all markets. It is not just the auto, but all markets that allows us to take off opportunistic gains. It is going to be a while before the integrated mills just saw turning on all their idled capacity. One would imagine that they need to see some visibility and transparency for a market that is only has got positive momentum, and their pricing also has positive momentum. And that is not going to happen just because the automotive - one or two [indiscernible] brought up. So there is that time period and it is a matter of months and maybe longer at this time around, who knows, but it is a matter of months where the flexibility of electric-arc-furnace operations can take advantage of the marketplace.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Tumazos : Thank you very much. How much of the Butler and Columbus mill tonnage used to be scalp for welded to for energy exploration and in the plan for Sinton? And should we just assume that those volumes become construction steels given the short-term crude oil outlook?\nMark Millett: Well John, I would say Butler, the energy scalp is not a massive part of their portfolio. And so we tend to see hot roll coil dependence fully is not really related to the oil and gas and given the value-add diversification there, we don’t really have a massive amount of hotline to sell to be honest. Columbus, certainly has greater exposure. And if you remember when we purchased the mill in 2014 that was a dominantly an energy pipe supplier, and I think back then it was 30% maybe 40% of its output.\nTheresa Wagler: It was over 40% energy.\nMark Millett: Since then the team really catalyzed by the downturn in energy in 2015. The team has done a phenomenal job diversifying that asset, adding greater towing capabilities, adding paint line, adding a variety of high strength type of great steel there, getting into automotive, getting into Mexico. So, both the product and the market diversification there has totally transformed the entity. And so it is through sight learning today, there is nothing like that 2015 as much higher. That being said, it is probably 10%, maybe 15% energy related.\nTheresa Wagler: So John, just overall, to put a point on it. Last year our shipments we only had 7% that were related across the company that were related to energy. And some of that included solar. So that was a high premium grade in OCTG that sort of thing. So it is not that much of our business, either last year or today at this point. And then as it relates to Sinton, we will also be competing we think very effectively with imports and I think that is something that people should recognize as well.\nJohn Tumazos : Thank you. Congratulations on being the old man in the call Mark, I can simply tie wherever you want.\nMark Millett: I will be respectful, but you and I both know.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gibbs with KeyBank Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nPhil Gibbs: Hey Theresa, could you provide the mix of sheet products as typical?\nTheresa Wagler: I apologize, Phil. I didn’t. I have it here though. So for flat-rolled shipment, I know a lot of you use it for your models, our hot-rolled coil and our pickled in oil shipments were 891,000 tons, our cold rolled shipments where 151,000 tons and our coated shipments were 948,000 tons for a total of 1,990,000 tons. Apologies.\nPhil Gibbs: No worries. That is all. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Bradford with Bradford Research. Please proceed with your question. \nCharles Bradford: Good morning and I have got both of you guys beat on age, but the question goes down to a little bit coming maybe out of your bailiwick, but apparently U.S. deal has dropped out of membership of the AISI that may impact the quality of the industry data that we get. Have you seen any change in the quality? I’m thinking especially of the usually pretty bad operating rate figures.\nMark Millett: Chuck, I would say we have not seen any change that nor have we analyzed it to be honest.\nCharles Bradford: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Kenyon with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nTyler Kenyon: Hey, good morning Mark and Theresa, I hope you are both doing well. Theresa, just a quick one for me, do you anticipate any relief in 2020 from the recently passed Cares Act, payroll tax deferrals, enhanced deductibility of interest expense, et cetera. In any way to bracket what kind of cash when relief they could provide in 2020.\nTheresa Wagler: Yes. Given the analysis that we have done, I really can’t put a great bracket around it, but at this point in time, Tyler it is not something that we are viewing as will be significant for us. There is definitely the payroll tax relief would have an impact, but apart from that given our expectations on operating in the different areas they are helping either smaller companies or companies that are not doing as well as we are. I don’t think it is going to be something that is meaningful at this point. If that changes, we will be sure to let you know.\nTyler Kenyon: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for any closing remarks.\nMark Millett : Well, thank you Michelle and thank you everyone on the call. I just would like to emphasize, I’m a pretty optimistic guy and if you were surrounded by the team we have at SDI, you would have that same optimism. And it is really based on SDI’s position. And I suggest even in these tough times, and the SDI team shines in moments of challenge and we are in a position of strength. Our business model is built to be resilient in tough markets. We have a high variable cost structure, 85% of our cost structure is variable. We got a broad value-added product portfolio, and we have strong pull through volume, as we have suggested from our internal downstream operations. All that builds a high utilization rate we have demonstrated in every trough higher utilization rates than our competition. And when you have capital intense deal assets, volume is absolutely critical. And that translates into better financial metrics that to cycle. So we are still confident in our cash generation capability. We are still confident in our financial foundation and we are battling each and every day, but our orders continue to flow in. So we do remain positive. That being said, we are incredibly intentional. And we recognize that we need to be assessing markets and our position almost each and every day. We have demonstrated that in the past and we will demonstrate that going forward. So for all of you. Thank you for being on the call. Customers and employees seriously, thank you, you make SDI who we are today, and everyone be healthy, be safe. Bye, bye.\nOperator: Thank you. Once again, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s call. Thank you for your participation and have a great and safe day.",

            "name": "Mark Millett",
            "content": "Thank you, Tricia. Good morning everybody. Welcome to our first quarter of 2020 earnings call. We certainly appreciate and value your time at these unprecedented circumstances. Steel making is designated a critical infrastructure industry by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, but deemed essential to the nation's defense, infrastructure, transportation and overall economy. As such all our operations have been operating. Protecting the health and wellbeing of the teams is on this critical priority. We are closely monitoring the COVID 19 situation and have implemented numerous additional practices throughout the Company to protect each of us. I want to thank our more than 8,400 team members for remaining steadfast and passionate. We continue to operate safely with a spirit of excellence. I'm incredibly proud to work alongside each of them during this unparallel time. We are committed to the health and safety of our people, the families and our communities, all while supporting our suppliers and meeting the needs of our customers. But before I continue, Theresa, will you please provide insights on the team's recent incredible performance during the first quarter that should not go unstated, despite these present environmental issues along with our strong financial foundation. Well, thank you Theresa. As I stated, safety is and always will be our number one value on priority. Nothing is more important. During the first quarter of this year, our safety performance improved from the previous quarter than it comes with a meaningful improvement in the severity of incidents. Our safety performance continues to be significantly better than industry averages. As I said many times before, it is not enough. It will never be enough until we reach our goal of zero. We all need to be continuously aware about surroundings and our fellow team members, I challenge all of us to be focused both as we think traditionally of safety, but even more so now as it relates to keeping each other in good health. The steel fabrication platform delivered a strong first quarter performance, construction is also deemed an essential business and as such, almost all the States below construction projects to remain open. We have some jobs delayed or postponed, but at this time it is not being widespread or meaningful. This should be expected as in previous market downturns construction lag the rest of the market by four to six months to pre-funded ongoing projects. We experienced the record number of inquiries and bookings in the first quarter. Our fabrication order backlog remains very strong, but with 15% higher than at this time last year. Our metals recycling team perform well in the quarter returning to profitability. During the first quarter, prime scrap appreciated about $25 or $30 per gross ton probably with lower domestic steel production, April prime scrap prices were tracked at about $30 and shredded $45 per gross ton. Lower industrial prime scrap flow related to the temporary idling of the automotive sector in April was offset by reduced demand due to lower steel mill utilization, maintaining sufficient prime scrap availability. As the announced staggered automotive plant restarts beginning later April and throughout May, we expect to see prime scraps will return to good levels prior to a ramp up in steel mill utilization and thus in turn stable scrap prices. In general, the steel teams had a phenomenal performance in the quarter hitting record volumes in a tough environment. We saw underlying steel demand strength and increased steel - values in those flat-rolled and long steel products through substantially all the first quarter, before the Russia, Saudi Arabia oil price war, as state COVID 19 stay at home directives. Since mid-March the landscape has shifted rapidly. A superior decline in energy prices related to oversupply has significantly reduced steel demand from the pipe and tube manufacturers and the temporary closure of automotive production and the related supply chain closures will meaningfully impact flat-rolled steel demand for this upcoming second quarter. Since mid-March hot rolled coil index pricing has declined over a $100 to about $485 per ton according to plants. As a result of reduced flat-rolled demand and reduced pricing, a considerable number of higher costs flat-rolled steel operations have been indefinitely idled. Since the end of 2019 we believe it represents a reduction of between 12 million to 14 million tons of annual flat-rolled sheets steel capacity, approaching some 20%, 30% of total domestic capability. In contrast the construction sector continues to be steady, which as mentioned is a critical steel consuming representing 40% to 45% of total domestic consumption in normal markets. The order activity from our construction related to customers in addition to the current strength in our steel fabrication and order backlog supports the sentiment. We believe that coming months will be difficult, within these environments the strength of our people and our differentiated business model becomes even more evident and more impactful. As demonstrated historically during times and market inflection, we will likely gain market share based on our uninterrupted low cost operations providing the greatest customer optionality, product end market diversification, the value-added marketing measures and additional internal steel sourcing form our captive manufacturing businesses. To put that in perspective, our still fabrication platform, the Tex, Holland and Vulcan, purchased 2.3 million tons of steel in 2019 and only sourced about a half that from SDI owned steel mills. This provides additional opportunity for internal purchasing to keep our steel mills running at higher utilization rates even in a weaker demand environment. U.S. Administration's recent guidance for States to begin a staged reopening is positive. As they begin this critical process, improved steel demand will follow some pent up demand from already low steel inventories. We have provided a summary of our recent growth investments on a slide in our invested deck posted on the website. In the last 12 to 18 months we have executed several strategic investments that will benefit our through cycle and earnings and cash flow position. We expanded two steel mills by the combined addition of the 440,000 tons of steel rebar production capability providing product diversification and a differentiated supply chain for the customer. Our model provides meaningful customer optionality and flexibility, the significant logistics yield and working capital benefits. This end market diversification provides a high through cycle utilization for our structural and Roanoke steel divisions. Heartland Steel 800,000 ton value-add flat-rolled steel processor that sells primarily cold roll and galvanized products has been ramping up nicely. Providing additional support and operational flexibility for our Butler Flat-rolled division. This increased the through cycle utilization of our steel assets and broaden our value-added product mix. The acquisition of 75% of the United Steel Supply has been another excellent investment. This flat-rolled, galvanized and pre-painted steel distribution company has provided a meaningful distribution channel to new customers. As a consumer of our internal steel products, they also increase the power of our through cycles steel utilization. Since our acquisition of Columbus Flat-rolled division, the transformation of its product portfolio through the expansion of its value-added steel capability, diversification of its customer base and the addition of the paint line has meaningfully increased its through cycle and its capability which will be clearly demonstrated this downturn. We are now close to completing $140 million, 400,000 ton of value-added fluid galvanizing line which we expect to begin operating mid-2020. The value-added products increase will decrease Columbus' hot roll coil exposure and provide a ready and waiting hot bank customer base in the side for our new Texas Steel Mill. As symptom, we continue to be excited about the material growth for construction of our new next generation flat-rolled steel mill will deliver. As Theresa explained, our financial strategy focused on entering 2020 providing of the required investment associated with this transformational project. Our team has an incredible depth of experience in the construction, startup and operation of large steel manufacturing assets. Collectively, we believe they have more experience than any company in the industry and their performance and momentum has been remarkable. In January, we received the required environmental permitting to allow for full construction efforts and we currently anticipate the mid-2021 startup. That said, as Theresa mentioned, we will be reassessing our timeline throughout the second quarter as we gain more visibility into the impact of COVID 19. Additionally, even though we intentionally did not purchase equipment from China, some of our equipment is being manufactured in other countries where the Corona virus is also active. We are having weekly conversations with these manufacturers and we currently do not believe our plan schedule has been meaningfully impacted. The new state of the art Three million ton steel mill will include a value-added coating line comprised of 550,000 ton galvanizing line, and a 250,000 ton paint line with Galvalume capability. We will follow the same stringent sustainability model as our other steel making facilities with state of the art environmental processes. Our existing steel mills and a fraction of the greenhouse gas emission intensity actually by 12% of average world's steel making technology, with an 94 inch coil width, one inch thick, 100 KSI product capability. The Texas mill will have capabilities beyond existing electric-arc furnace flat-rolled steel reduces, competing even more effectively with the integrated steel model with foreign competition. As you know the steel mill is strategically located in Sinton, Texas near Corpus Christi. We have targeted three regional sales markets for the mill representing over 27 million tons of relevant flat-rolled steel consumption in the Southern and West coast, United States and Mexico. We also plan to effectively compete with heavy imports in Houston and the West coast. Our customers are excited to have the regional flat-rolled steel supplier. There is several customers in discussions with one already committed to locate on site with us, and a second close behind, these two customers alone will represent over 800,000 tons of local steel processing and consumption capability. The Sinton location provides a significant freight benefit to most of our intended customers relative to their current supply chain options. We believe the potential customer savings related to freight alone are a minimum of $20 to $30 per ton, and for some much higher. This freight advantage along with much shorter lead times provides a differentiated supply chain solution, allowing us to not only be the preferred domestic steel supplier in Southern and Western U.S., but also to effectively compete with imports, which inherently have long lead times and speculative pricing risk. From a raw material perspective, our metals recycling operations already control significant and growing scrap volume in Mexico through scrap management agreements, much of which is prime. As I mentioned in March, we are also planning to acquire a Mexican scrap company as part of our raw material strategy for Sinton. Their primary operations are strategically located near high volume industrial scrap sources through Central and Northern Mexico. The company currently ships approximately 500,000 gross tons of scrap annually, but as an estimated annual processing capability of about two million tons. After closing, we plan to ramp up volume fairly quickly. We are currently waiting for Mexican regulatory approval, as well as other closing requirements that are expected to close in the coming months. We believe our unique operating culture, coupled with our considerable experience in successfully constructing and operating cost effective and highly profitable EAF steel mills positions us incredibly well to successfully execute the Sinton project. As I said before, we are not simply adding flat-rolled production capability. We have a differentiated product offering a significant geographic freight and lead time advantage and an import alternative to region in need of options. Our unique culture and the execution of the long-term strategy continues to strengthen our financial position through consistent, strong cash flow generation and a long-term value creation, differentiating us from our competition and demonstrating our sustainability. Again, our commitment is the health and safety of our people, our families and our communities, all while supporting our vendors, serving our customers, and sustaining our value creation journey. Our team is simply incredible. I would like to thank each of them for their patience, resilience and commitment during these tough times. They have an indomitable spirit that drives us to excel and also a very special thank you to the healthcare providers and their families within steel dynamics, and those serving individuals across the globe. Thank you. Be safe be well. And Michelle, please open the call for questions. Thank you. Well, certainly. I think as you said, it is an incredibly difficult question. Not so sure our crystal ball is clearer than others, but I will say that it is positive looking through the lens of our order book and our order input right. I read this morning in American Metal, individuals saying, well, nobody is buying, I guess perhaps they are not buying from other people, but they are buying from us. I believe that obviously energy is going to be very stagnant for the rest of this year into next year. Automotive is going to come back again, one doesn't necessarily know exactly when, but the expectation is late this month and through May, but the bright spot is certainly is construction. As I mentioned earlier construction tends to lag market downturn, you know we saw it in 2015, we saw it in 2008, 2009. It tends to lag the downturn in the market by about four to six months, because operations or projects tend to be pre-funded and we are seeing that in our new millennium building fabrication business and our structure mill. As I said, new millennium extremely strong backlog despite some project push backs. But there is nothing real meaningful change yet and we are very, very strong, have a large market share in the distribution warehouse market that obviously given people staying at home and the expansion of Amazons and they alike that remains a growth area in all honesty. Structural rail division, backlog is currently solid certainly through May. Did see a $25 price decrease just recently, but I do believe that people will recognize that we are toughing out of the bottom of the market, the scrap is going to be somewhat stable here in the next month or two. So those that have been hanging on the sidelines not buying will likely come to market. In that arena, in the beam arena heavy structural's distribution is certainly slowed as they whittled down their inventories, they are now prism tight and we are starting to see them come back and buy as they need. The fabricators, that business is still strong as they supply the ongoing construction projects. The rail is actually very, very strong for us at the - rail division and rebar is an addition for us. Compared to past downturns, the product portfolio of structural rail division is much more diverse today and we won't see the debt of low utilization rate. And if you remember back in 2009, 2010 that business went to 30%, 35% utilization, still remaining somewhat profitable. But that is not going to happen this time. It is a much more diversified product one can make and so that should whether this along very, very well. Engineered bar that is seeing a little softness right there. Obviously automotive is down, energy too is down there and so that is one arena that is probably as soft as anything going on in our product portfolio.  Flat-rolled remains relatively robust, is probably too strong word. But, would tug in those operations to run around about 80%. utilization. That for us seems to be a good balance between fixed costs absorption and pricing. And it appears that we should be able to sustain that targeted output certainly for April, certainly for May, and we were confident that we can do that in June as well. So generally, I think it is obviously quarter-over-quarter. It is going to be a tough couple of months for us. But we are positive. Well, I think structural should remain in that sort of 75% to 80% range. Again, the merchant shapes, probably less than that. Again, merchant shapes around tend not to be a massive part of our earnings profile anyway, but three out of four of our principal mills Butler, Columbus and Structural Rail Division are targeting that 75% to 80% utilization rate. As Theresa said, engineered bar right now looks pretty softer than that. Yes, for sure. I think that the mill is structured or designed for three million tons is not like a conventional since based EAF where you have two casters, this has one caster with a three million ton capability. And as such it is not a matter of doing half the plant or anything like that. Nor do we would be defensive about doing so. Obviously the export would be adjusted somewhat to demand, but again the energy market are pretty tougher at this time. But as one - for those that have been in the industry for a significant amount of time things do cycle, that their market will come back. But the advantage of the Sinton facility is its geographic location, we are not dependent on one single market product. We have got around about 27 million tons of market capability. When you look at the Southwest. You look at the West Coast and you look at Mexico. And we can ship that product between energy and automotive and construction. And we feel that the investment premise remains totally, totally intact. Likewise, Timna. Well, Timna I have seen the same commentary and it seems to be a little disconnected to higher actual order book and what we have seen, and as I have said quite consistently, our real lens for SDI is through that order book and through the inquiry, right. And all that remains quite strong. The analogy, if you look at the 2008, 2009 downturn, which was pretty significant onto itself, we saw the structural rail division offering pretty consistently into the summer of 2009. That was a good four, five, six months of strong sort of continuation from pre-funded projects and we are seeing as I said - a large part of our business is in the distribution warehouse arena and that is, I would say is expanding more than contracting. So I think we see things optimistically. We were also very, very realistic and I just want to go back to what you are saying about is there a dichotomy between the markets and what was saying relative to a strategy. But I'm going to ramble a little bit, I think, but you know, probably some of the members of the SDI team been in the business probably longer than anyone on the call and probably mostly leadership in steel companies. And we have seen the 80, 81, we lived through and managed through 2001, 2002, when 45% of the industry was in insolvency through 2008, 2009. We lived through 2015. So we are very realistic and recognize the impact in the market change and manage to that. And I think we have demonstrated through our 25, 26 year history, that we are very intentional, we are very disciplined, and we are actually conservative. At that same time and in periods like this, leaders and you have got one of the best leadership teams in the world here. They need to lead, they shouldn't be seeking cover, we need to be seeking opportunity. And that is where we think Sinton is a very, very good investment, a very good opportunity, and we will continue to go down that path. That being said, just to reemphasize what Theresa said, we are continuing to reassess our order books, the market, cash flow generation, and we will adjust as we see fit. But I think it is very, very important to recognize that. Again, a lot of the CapEx for Sinton is through the back end toward the end of the year here. And it is a huge lever that we can pull if necessary. Good morning. Well, I think we have got one sign and a second very, very, very close to signing. There is a preference on their part not to submit names at this moment in time. But you are right, the two of them would amount to about 800,000 tons of consumption and processing capability. We probably have another - not probably, we do have four other interested customers that have been given full packages, lease packages and those sorts of things. They just slowed a little bit because of the situation we are in. But we are confident that we are going to get those folks to. But it is a very I think important part of the overall strategy at that note. Well, certainly well regarding the energy markets. I think yesterday it was quite incredible and I'm not so sure we have had time to digest. But just in general, obviously the immediate impact is on the energy markets, pipe and tube. And that was, that is not just a COVID thing, that obviously is Russia and Saudi Arabia doing that thing. And the low energy prices will expand the downturn there that is 8% to 10%, I guess of the steel market in normal times. But we looked at that as a pretty stagnant market rest of the year going into this year and next year, first half of next year anyway. I guess the positive, well one is scrap tends to move down with oil, not for sure that the physical markets would allow that to occur in May, we are looking - perhaps shouldn't move down in May, but we think given the physical market, it is probably a sideways market moving forward, but that may change here in the next week or two. What I do think is that the pressure on the energy market is going on in turn put pressure on the integrated mills. And I think that you have seen a pretty dramatic idling of integrated capacity, last one is capacity here over the last four or five, six weeks. And if you look back over a longer period, you know the last couple of years, there has been a much more frequent turn-on, turn-off of some of that capacity as they suffer pretty strong economic pressure. And I think a sustained downturn in the energy markets will make some of those assets - it is going to be a tough decision that ever bring them back. But I think it may as a positive may help rationalize the industry to some small degree. Sorry. And then you had the second question on construction granularity. Again, there certainly has been weakness in the northeast, but that has tended to be more projects or construction locations actually being shut down by the states. We certainly see strength in fact. We certainly, as I said see strength in that distribution warehouse arena. Got it okay. Well I would suggest that as I said earlier, my crystal ball is probably no better than anyone else's on the call and not the whole recovery is subject to when folks get back into the marketplace and at what speed do they ramp up. From present information it appears that automotive will stop rolling back during the end of the mid to end of next week and all the way through May depending on which company, there is a backlog of vehicles, right the second so how quick recovery is difficult to gauge. You look at a past troughs it tends to replenish - they have been in position to replenish inventory and pent up demand. I'm not so sure we will see that this time around. To qualify our gain in market share is relative to time is a tough thing, but all I can say is the facilities are sort of armed and ready to go. And it is our flexibility across all markets. It is not just the auto, but all markets that allows us to take off opportunistic gains. It is going to be a while before the integrated mills just saw turning on all their idled capacity. One would imagine that they need to see some visibility and transparency for a market that is only has got positive momentum, and their pricing also has positive momentum. And that is not going to happen just because the automotive - one or two [indiscernible] brought up. So there is that time period and it is a matter of months and maybe longer at this time around, who knows, but it is a matter of months where the flexibility of electric-arc-furnace operations can take advantage of the marketplace. Well John, I would say Butler, the energy scalp is not a massive part of their portfolio. And so we tend to see hot roll coil dependence fully is not really related to the oil and gas and given the value-add diversification there, we don't really have a massive amount of hotline to sell to be honest. Columbus, certainly has greater exposure. And if you remember when we purchased the mill in 2014 that was a dominantly an energy pipe supplier, and I think back then it was 30% maybe 40% of its output. Since then the team really catalyzed by the downturn in energy in 2015. The team has done a phenomenal job diversifying that asset, adding greater towing capabilities, adding paint line, adding a variety of high strength type of great steel there, getting into automotive, getting into Mexico. So, both the product and the market diversification there has totally transformed the entity. And so it is through sight learning today, there is nothing like that 2015 as much higher. That being said, it is probably 10%, maybe 15% energy related. I will be respectful, but you and I both know. Chuck, I would say we have not seen any change that nor have we analyzed it to be honest. Well, thank you Michelle and thank you everyone on the call. I just would like to emphasize, I'm a pretty optimistic guy and if you were surrounded by the team we have at SDI, you would have that same optimism. And it is really based on SDI's position. And I suggest even in these tough times, and the SDI team shines in moments of challenge and we are in a position of strength. Our business model is built to be resilient in tough markets. We have a high variable cost structure, 85% of our cost structure is variable. We got a broad value-added product portfolio, and we have strong pull through volume, as we have suggested from our internal downstream operations. All that builds a high utilization rate we have demonstrated in every trough higher utilization rates than our competition. And when you have capital intense deal assets, volume is absolutely critical. And that translates into better financial metrics that to cycle.

            "name": "Theresa Wagler",
            "content": "Thank you. Good morning everyone. Our first quarter 2020 net income was $187 million or $0.88 per diluted share. Above our guidance of $0.83 to $0.87 due to stronger than anticipated March flat-rolled steel shipments. First quarter 2020 revenues were $2.6 billion somewhat lower than prior year's first quarter sales, 10% higher than fourth quarter sequential results driven by improved steel pricing and shipment. Our first quarter, 2020 operating income was $274 million, $18 million lower than prior year, first quarter, but notably 50% higher than sequential fourth quarter results due to record steel shipments driven by solid first quarter underlying demand. From a platform perspective our steel operation's first quarter shipments increased 7% sequentially to a record, 2.8 million tons with increased volumes experienced across the platform. Our average quarterly realized sales price increased $10 per ton $774 in the first quarter and average scrap cost increased $24 per ton, profiting steel metal margin compression. The result with first quarter steel operating income of $293 million, 45% higher than the sequential fourth quarter results. For our metals recycling platform first quarter operating income was $8 million compared to a loss of $5 million sequentially. A result of higher ferrous to non-ferrous selling values and shipment with prime scrap industries writing almost $30 per gross ton during the first quarter. About 65% of our mills recycling ferrous shipment served by all the steel mills, increasing our scrap quality, our melting efficiency and reducing our Companywide working capital requirements. Our vertically connected operating model benefits both the platforms. For our steel fabrication business, first quarter of 2020 operating income remains strong at $29 million compared to near record sequential results of $33 million. Primarily due to seasonally lower first quarter shipments, we experienced record order inquiry and bookings in the first quarter and demarche with a record backlog. We are still experiencing strong order inquiry and are entering the traditional construction season on a good footing. Our cash generation continues to be strong. During the first quarter of 2020 we generated $211 million of cash flow from operations offset by operational working capital growth related to higher steel selling values and the $74 million distribution of our annual companywide profit sharing to our teams. We spent $218 million in fixed asset investments during the first quarter of which 130 million related to our New Sinton, Texas Flat-rolled Steel Mill investment. To-date we have funded $335 million of the $1.9 billion project. Regarding shareholder distributions, we increased our cash dividends 4% in the first quarter of this year to $0.25 per common share. This follows increases of over 20% in both 2018 and 2019, the Board also authorized an additional $500 million for stock repurchases in February of this year. We repurchased $170 million of our common stock during the first quarter and 444 million remains available under the new authorization. In 2016 we have invested $1.3 billion in our common stock representing over 15% of our outstanding shares. These actions reflect the strength of our capital foundation, consistent cash flow capability and strong liquidity profile, demonstrating our confidence in our sustainable through cycle strong cash generation. Part of that confidence is based on the high variability of our cost structure within our operating platforms. During market weakness, working capital becomes a funding source. 2015 is a great example. Working capital provided over $500 million to cash flow that year. For the coming months, we expect working capital to also be a source of cash flow for us. For the remainder of the year, we currently are planning the capital investments to be roughly $1.2 billion of which the New Sinton, Texas Steel Mill represents $1 billion. This spending percent is heavily weighted to the second half of 2020 over $700 million of that $1 billion spend is actually meant to be in the second half of this year. As we gain more visibility and see extent of the disruption in 2020 related to the Corona virus, we could shift some of the 2020 investment into 2021 if we believed it was necessary. Based on current timeline, we estimate capital investments for 2021 to be in the range of 700 million to 750 million of which Sinton represents 600 million. We entered the Corona virus crisis in a position of strength with a strong cash position and liquidity profile. Entering 2020 we had over $1.6 billion of cash in short-term investments. At the end of the first quarter, we have almost $1.5 billion. Combined with a $1.2 billion undrawn unsecured revolving credit facility. We have available liquidity of over $2.6 billion. One can't look historically our financial performance to determine either a trough or a peak future performance. We have grown significantly transformed or Columbus Flat-rolled division, further diversified our steel product offerings and incorporated even more levers to increase our through cycle financial performance. Since 2015 we have increased our total shipping capacity from 11 million tons to over 13 million tons, while increasing our value-added revenues from just over 55% in 2015 to almost 70% last year. Since 2015 we have transformed Columbus's through cycle earnings capability by reducing their operating costs, dramatically increasing their value-added product capabilities and diversifying our customer base and end market factors. We have expanded our structural in Rail and Roanoke Bar steel divisions to include reinforcing bar production capabilities. Further diversifying the locations product offerings in order to sustain higher through cycle utilization. We have also added new manufacturing businesses to our portfolio that use steel as a raw material providing additional opportunities to sustain our own steel mills utilization throughout market cycles. Since 2015 we have increased the possible internal volume by over 1.5 million tons through acquisitions and growing our steel fabrication platform. This is an incredibly powerful tool during weak demand environments. In addition, collectively, our primary recent and planed strategic growth investments provide an estimated incremental annual future EBITDA of over $425 million on a through cycle historical spread basis. This estimate includes our Sinton Steel Mill and third Columbus galvanizing lines as well as our two operational reinforcing bar expansions. We are simply even more agile today than ever before. We are also dedicated to preserving our investment grade credit rating. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes responsible strategic growth with appropriate shareholder distributions, comprised of a base positive dividend profile that is complimented with a variable share repurchase program during periods of excess cash generation. We are squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable, optimized long-term value creation. And on a personal note, I want to take just a moment. I want to wish my dad a very happy birthday. He has not listened to one of these calls in 25 years and he is listening this morning and I also want to thank our teams truly for their passion and generosity and the care that they are showing for each other's health and safety. God bless. Mark? Dave, I think that is what Mark just really tried to address. So we have not - there are a couple of things that I think differentiates us. One is that we continue to operate 24x7. And so with that, we get the orders and we gain market share during environment like this, especially as others, higher cost production is being shut down. Right now, we are still operating at a very good utilization rate across the platform. The most challenged division frankly is our engineered bar division. And that is because they are tied to both the energy market and to just general industrial. Once automotive comes back and more specifically for engineered bar, in Caterpillar, John deere, et cetera, start to operating again and I think that scheduled, the last chart sizing was toward the mid the end of May, you just start to see that crack. But that being said, it is a very difficult environment. It is just we are able to gain market share. And we are very nimble in order entry and working with the customers and that tends to make it lot in very difficult environments, our utilization stays higher. The other point is the internal volume that is not to be overlooked. So fabrication is still incredibly strong with a record backlog. They need steel, they will be buying that steel from our own steel mills. The same thing with regarding to our internal processing divisions, so Heartland, United Steel Supply, et cetera. They need steel, they will be buying that from our internal steel mills. So that helps our utilization profile and not - most of our - if any of our competitors have that same lever to pull. So we can't give you an exact percentage number today. Frankly, I don't know what the exact percentage would be overall, but I know that we feel good about where we are and that the teams are doing a great job. So Dave just as an example, if you go back to 2015, which I would suggest is last week on steel environment, that we have seen the overall, generally our operations even at that time we are operating at over 70%, on the flat-rolled side they were actually operating closer to 90%. It is always more challenging in the long product side, because there is just extra capacity out in the system as it relates to long products and because they are all electric-arc furnace based. But today we would suggest that we just have more internal levers to pull. And so we wouldn't think that necessarily overall when you grew both flat and long has as much impact as it might have at one point in time. Okay. Seth, good morning. I think I have all the questions written down. So the first question is about the adding of the manufacturing businesses or the processing businesses, there is two points that you should keep in mind. One is, you are correct, it is encrypting the variability of our cost structures, but again, as a reminder, each of our operating platforms is already over 85% variable cost, but this helps that as well. The other component to recognize is that because they are buying steel and using steel as a substrate that is impacting our cost of goods sold by having steel run through cost of goods sold, which is higher priced. And so just anecdotally, in the first quarter, we had about 15% of our cost of goods sold was associated with those steel purchases from the converting companies. From a Sinton perspective Mark, I will let you handle the, the energy question. And as just a quick point on that, from an energy perspective last year, I think there are other shipments, about 7% was related to energy. But that was primarily at our engineered bar division at Columbus. So within that number, we also shipped quite a bit of volume from our steel, West Virginia facility into solar. So our energy number also includes solar and solar is still something that is actually increasing in demand during this time as well. Thank you. Great. So let me clarify, you are right concerning the capital expenditures currently for 2020. We started the year saying, we expect you to spend about 1.4, we spent a little over 200 million in the first quarter. So for the remainder of the year, there is 1.2 billion mark, of that 1.2 billion, over 700 million of that is actually late in the second half of the year and it is related to Sinton. As we progress Timna through the second quarter, we believe we are going to gain a lot of visibility as a state, for lack of a better word reopen on what that means for steel consumption and on our own operations for the remainder of 2020. As we progress to the second quarter, should we think that we want to potentially take some of that capital and push it into 2021. We can make that decision to do that at that time. But right now, from what we are seeing, as Mark mentioned, how the mills are operating and the market share and the activity that we are seeing, we don't believe that that decision is something that we are making today. As it relates to our share repurchases. We repurchased 107 million in the first quarter. Most of that was purchased within January and February timeframe, but you should expect to see from us in the second quarter, is that we will be watching the markets, watching the impact of the Corona virus and you will see us heavily into the share buyback market at that point in time and then we will reassess for the second half of the year. The reason the Board authorized an additional 500 million in February of this year is simply because we think share repurchases during periods of excess cash flow is an important tool to have and so we wanted to have that tool, because we actually only had I think about $40 million to $50 million left on a previous program. Does that help clarify how we are thinking about things? No, what we are just talking about delaying it Timna. And one other point, and - you really can't forget the strength of the working capital for us. And the funding sources it can be if necessary. Thank you. Good morning. Collectively, it is likely to be somewhere over a one million tons of onsite capability. You know, so we don't have exact numbers, but I would estimate that of the $1.9 billion, you are likely to have accelerated depreciation on at least 80% to 85% of that number. Yes. So that would all be recorded in 2021 year sort of. No we are not going to get too specific for two different reasons. One is that we generally don't give that type of guidance. And the second reason is especially going into the environment that we are in right now, there is not a lot of visibility. And so we want to make sure that we are being appropriate. But I think what Mark was suggesting is that we intend to see utilization, or at least we are planning for utilization, higher flat-rolled operations, somewhere in that 75% to 80% range and traditionally even in 2015, we were actually operated about 90%. So, we generally gain market share in flat-rolled during periods of weakness. And we are seeing that today as well. And we don't see a driver for that to change throughout the quarter. Along product side is more difficult. So in the structural and rail arena, we expect to maintain higher utilization in that 75% to 80% range because of the order backlog as it sits today, and because construction is continuing for us in that arena, and with the addition of rail, and rebar that product diversification helps our facility. Across the other long product mill, it is more difficult. So you are going to see the most weakness in our mind and the special bar quality or the SBQ arena. And then, that is distributed throughout. So that is probably about as much clarity or granularities we can provide the volumes at this point. Yes. No that is absolutely correct especially - I don't know if it wasn't just impurities like this in the first quarter, our structural rail team did a fantastic job on the construction side and pulling in volume. And if you are speaking more specifically about our fabrication business, we have been gaining market share in that arena as well and the team is doing incredibly well. And Mark point out is more specifically in that warehouse arena, but we have been taking market share and we would expect to continue to do that. The question relates to automotive and it relates to the perspective of as they start to roll on and we have been taking market share specifically with the European auto makers, et cetera, would we expect to continue to take that market share and what are we thinking about from a volume perspective? So how much will fuel consumption volumes or auto builds from another perspective and how much will that be down if they get to one million to 1.5 million is what I'm seeing. And then the perspective just around what do we feel about continuing to take that market share related to automotive. It was over 40% energy. So John, just overall, to put a point on it. Last year our shipments we only had 7% that were related across the company that were related to energy. And some of that included solar. So that was a high premium grade in OCTG that sort of thing. So it is not that much of our business, either last year or today at this point. And then as it relates to Sinton, we will also be competing we think very effectively with imports and I think that is something that people should recognize as well. I apologize, Phil. I didn't. I have it here though. So for flat-rolled shipment, I know a lot of you use it for your models, our hot-rolled coil and our pickled in oil shipments were 891,000 tons, our cold rolled shipments where 151,000 tons and our coated shipments were 948,000 tons for a total of 1,990,000 tons. Apologies. Yes. Given the analysis that we have done, I really can't put a great bracket around it, but at this point in time, Tyler it is not something that we are viewing as will be significant for us. There is definitely the payroll tax relief would have an impact, but apart from that given our expectations on operating in the different areas they are helping either smaller companies or companies that are not doing as well as we are. I don't think it is going to be something that is meaningful at this point. If that changes, we will be sure to let you know."

Now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mark.\nMark Millett: Thank you, David, and good morning, everybody. Happy 2022. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings call. We all appreciate your time and thank you for joining us today. The entire Steel Dynamics team delivered an exceptional performance in 2021 with record sales, earnings, and cash flow generation. The team totally shared the previous full year records. It was a tremendous achievement certainly supported by a strong market, but driven by the commitment and passion of our teams executing on our long-term strategies that continue to grow on through cycle and the capability. Thank you, team, for your dedication to excellence in every pursuit. I'm proud to work alongside you. Due to the steadfast commitment, our people helped to one another and their families to our communities and to our customers, we are operating safely amidst the extended pandemic. The health and welfare of our teams remain paramount. Record financial results are no important while teams did not remain safe. Although our safety performance continues to be better than industry averages, our safety performance deteriorated year-over-year. This is an unacceptable trend that we're working diligently to resolve as our intent will always to have zero incidents. Since our founding over 25 years ago, we've been intentional in managing our resources sustainably for the benefit of all of our stakeholders. We are steel industry leader in sustainability, operating exclusively with electric arc furnace technology with a differentiated circular manufacturing business model. As our journey continues, we are committed to the reduction of our climate footprint, including a practical and achievable goal for our steel mills to be carbon neutral by 2050. We're starting from a position of strength, yet plan to do more. We're competitively positioned and focused towards generating long-term sustainable growth. But before I continue with additional market commentary, I'd like Theresa to share insights into our recent performance.\nTheresa Wagler: Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Good to be with you. I'd like to add my sincere appreciation and congratulate the entire team. We continue to achieve new milestones throughout the business, attaining record annual performance, with record revenues of $18.4 million derived from strong product pricing and volumes across all of our operating platforms. Record operating income of $4.3 billion and net income of $3.2 billion or $15.56 per diluted share and record cash flow from operations of $2.2 billion and adjusted EBITDA of over $4.6 billion, truly an exceptional performance. Regarding our fourth quarter 2021 results, net income was $1.09 billion or $5.49 per diluted share, which includes additional performance-based company-wide special compensation of approximately $21 million or $0.08 per diluted share, which was awarded to all non-executive eligible team members in recognition of their extraordinary performance. Our fourth quarter contribution to the company’s charitable foundation is $10 million or $0.04 per diluted share and costs of approximately $52 million or $0.18 per diluted share associated with the construction and startup of our Sinton, Texas flat roll steel mill. Excluding these items, fourth quarter 2021 adjusted net income was over $1.15 billion or $5.78 per diluted share. Our fourth quarter 2021 record revenues of $5.3 billion were 4% higher than sequential third quarter results, driven by higher realized selling values in our steel fabrication business and our flat rolled steel operations. Our fourth quarter 2021 record operating income of $1.4 billion was 8% higher than sequential results, driven by the continued demand trends at our steel fabrication operations. As we discuss our business this morning, we see positive industry fundamentals for 2022, and we're focused toward our continued transformational growth initiatives. Our steel operations generated record operating income of $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter, as increased realized selling values expanded margins across the steel platform, offsetting seasonally lower volumes. Our lagging flat rolled contract business represented approximately 80% to 85% of our total flat roll volume in the quarter. We had quarterly steel shipments of 2.7 million tons, with our steel mill operating at 88% of their capability. For the full year 2021, our steel operations achieved numerous financial and operational milestones. The platform's full year operating income was a record $4.4 billion, with record shipments of 11.2 million tons, a truly phenomenal performance. Now to remind you, we still have additional market opportunity, mostly within our long products group and in line with the startup of our Sinton, Texas mill. Because based on our existing annual steel shipping capability, we have over 13 million tons of shipping capability on the steel side and with Sinton fully ramped, it will be over 16 million tons. Operating income from our metals recycling operations for the fourth quarter remained strong at $44 million, based on the improved metal margins offsetting lower share of shipments. Many domestic steel mills have planned maintenance outages throughout the fourth quarter, lowering various scrap metals. For the full year 2021, operating income for metals recycling operations was a record $195 million driven by uniquely higher volume and average selling value for both ferrous and non-ferrous recycling. The team continues to effectively lever the strength of our circular manufacturing and operating model, benefiting both our steel and metals recycling operations by providing higher quality scrap, which improves furnace efficiency and reduces company-wide working capital requirements Our steel fabrication operations also achieved record operating income in the quarter of $238 million, 2.5 times record third quarter results, driven by materially higher realized selling value, which more than offset escalated average steel – steel input costs. For the full year 2021, our steel fabrication platform achieved another record year with operating income of $365 million and record volumes of 789,000 tons, both steel sheets [ph]. Congratulations to the team. Steel joist and deck demand remains very strong as evidenced by continued robust order activity, resulting in another record order backlog in the quarter, extending throughout 2022. Based on our backlog and customer sentiment, we expect steel fabrication earnings to continue to increase into 2022. Our cash generation continues to be strong based on our differentiated circular business model and highly durable cost structure. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had liquidity of $2.4 billion comprised of cash of $1.2 billion and are fully available and secure revolver of $1.2 billion. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we generated record cash flow from operations of $724 million and $2.2 billion for the full year, also a reference. Working capital grew $1.7 billion during the year due to higher selling values resulting in increased customer account and inventory value. During 2021, we invested $1 billion in capital investments, of which $831 million was invested in our new Texas flat rolled steel mill. During 2022, we believe capital investments will be in the range of $750 million, the majority of which relates to four new flat-rolled coating mines to be placed in Sinton and Heartland. Regarding shareholder distributions, we maintained our quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per common share after increasing at 4% in the first quarter of 2021. We also repurchased $330 million of our common stock in the fourth quarter, representing 3% of outstanding shares. At December 31, we had $383 million remaining on the price for repurchase under that program. In the past five years, we've increased our cash dividend per share of about 86%, and we repurchased $2.3 billion of our common stock, representing 23% of outstanding shares. While during the same timeframe, we achieved an investment-grade credit rating and maintained our growth company profile by investing $3.1 million in organic capital investments and funding [indiscernible]. These actions reflect the strength of our capital foundation and consistently strong cash flow generation and the continued optimism and confidence in our future. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes strategic growth, with shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that is complemented with a variable share repurchase program, while also dedicated to preserving our investment-grade credit designation. We are squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable, optimized long-term value creation. Sustainability is a part of this strategy, and we're dedicated to our people, our communities and our environment. We're committed to operating our business with the highest level of integrity. Further committing to this path, in 2021, we announced greenhouse gas reduction and renewable energy goals, including a goal for our steel mills to be carbon neutral by 2050. To increase transparency and accountability, we also have interim milestones for 2025 and 2030. We've led the steel industry with an exclusive use of electric arc furnace steelmaking technology, circular manufacturing model and innovative solutions to increase efficiency, reduce raw material usage, reuse secondary materials and promote material conservation and recycling. We plan to sustain our leadership position by executing our climate goals through, among other avenues, implementing emission reduction projects, improving energy management, increasing the use of renewable energy and developing and supporting new innovative technologies. We have an actionable path that is more manageable and we believe, considerably less expensive than what may lay ahead for our traditional blast furnace industry peers. Our sustainability and climate strategy is an ongoing journey and we're moving forward with the intention to make a positive difference. We play an industry leadership role moving forward. Thank you, Mark.\nMark Millett: Super. Thank you, Theresa. And as you said, our steel fabrication operations performed exceptionally well throughout 2021, achieving record volume and earnings. The earnings power of this platform in a strong construction environment is yet to be completely displayed. At the end of the year, our steel joist and deck order backlog was at a record level for both volume and forward pricing, extending through March of 2022. The nonresidential construction market remains sound, especially in areas that support online retail, data centers, schools and health care, specifically represented by construction of distribution warehouse facility. Our steel fabrication operations provide a powerful natural hedge to our steel production operations in a steady or softening steel price environment. Our metals recycling operations also performed well this year, achieving record annual earnings and strong volume growth. The acquisition of a Mexican metals recycling company in August of 2020 has proven to be both strategic supply and an excellent investment, combining a great financial result with the additional benefit of growing access to prime scrap at North Central Mexico in support of our southern electric arc furnace at flat roll steel mill. The metals recycling footprint provides a strategic competitive advantage for our steel mills and our scrap-generating steel customers. We have ample access to ferrous scrap supply, including prime scrap and believe this will remain the case in the future. The steel team had an incredible year, achieving record volume and also record earnings of $4.4 billion, which eclipsed previous peaks. During 2021, the domestic steel industry operated at a production utilization rate of 81%, while our steel mills operated at a rate of 91%. We consistently operate at a higher utilization due to our value-add steel diversification, our differentiated customer supply chain solutions and the support of our internal manufacturing businesses. As we suggested during our last earnings call, new capacity and moderate import growth is pressured to hot-rolled coil price. Supply side issues have largely been resolved and lead times are back to manageable levels after ballooning post COVID as manufacturing steel demand recovered much more fruitfully than expected by the industry. Hot-rolled coil pricing has moderated. But contrary to recent alarmist commentary, the magnitude of the price correction is in no way connected to any material in overall demand. Inventory levels have certainly normalized the pre-COVID levels but are more than appropriate for the present demand environment. December MSCI shipments dropped to approximately 2.4 million tons, but this is consistent with typical seasonality, not an abnormality. Monthly import levels have undergone controlled growth in recent months as the arbitrage expanded. But as anticipated, there's been no surge. The recent hot-rolled coil price declines should effectively eradicate import volume growth in the months ahead. These are natural market adjustments and are not structural changes. Hot-rolled transactions are currently consistent with published index numbers in the range of $1,300 to $1,400 per ton. There are a limited number of large volume spot hot band offerings that can be procured at lower numbers, but these are not prevalent or reflective of the market in general. One must recognize that the spot comp and market has diminished in size over recent years as contract businesses increased across the industry. Therefore, it's not necessarily a true indicator of the whole market. Current hot-band spot offers are based on import values today, which are quickly drying up as the arbitrage strengths. Traders are reportedly finding it difficult to execute any business for second quarter delivery. Throughout our history, we have intentionally grown our value-added steel product portfolio and create valuable customer supply chain solutions to mitigate the impact of price volatility. Today, over 70% [ph] of our steel sales are considered value-add. This differentiated business model will continue to provide best-in-class financial metrics and through-cycle cash generation. Looking forward, we remain steadfast in our optimism for 2022. After a short period of seasonally lower steel demand in November and December, our flat-rolled order input rate in January was one of the best months ever. And backlogs are very healthy. Automotive sector steel consumption should grow year-over-year as the chip shortage eases, fueled by an extreme lack of dealer inventory, which is 60% lower than normal, and strong pent-up demand. The automotive sector operated at production rates lower than normalized levels in 2020 and 2021, around about 13 million units and is expected to grow to 15 million units this year and 17 million units in 2023. Nonresidential construction sector is strong as evidenced by the strength of shipments and backlogs at our structural and rail division and steel fabrication businesses. Residential construction has also been reversed, resulting in high demand for HVAC material, appliance and other related products. Stronger energy prices are now pushing up the rig count and associated under new pipe production. In aggregate, our steel backlogs and our order input strength, coupled with broad optimistic customer commentary and general market momentum, drive us to conclude that steel market dynamics will remain strong through 2022. We anticipate steel demand increasing year-over-year and with a likely retraction of import volumes possibly a moderate rebound in pricing. Steel Dynamics is a dynamic growth company, increasing through-cycle earnings and cash flow to support continuous value creation. Our new Sinton, Texas flat roll steel mill represents our most significant investment to date, providing the avenue for transformational growth and opportunity for ourselves and our customers. This differentiated investment facilitates significant through-cycle operational and financial growth for all of our stakeholders, from our teams and customers, to our vendors and shareholders. This EAF steel mill represents next-generation lower carbon emitting steel production capabilities, providing differentiated products and supply chain solutions. The 3 million tons state-of-the-art facility is designed to have product capabilities beyond that of any existing electric arc furnace flat-rolled steel producer, competing even more effectively with higher carbon emitting integrated steel facilities and high carbon from our competition. It provides us with a more diverse steel product portfolio and benefits our customers with an even broader climate-conscious supply option. The Sinton construction team has experienced numerous challenges related to supply chain disruptions and COVID impacts. These challenges resulted in hot-side production shifting from the end of 2021 to a class start before the end of February 2022. The Sinton group navigated through the challenges as well and we are on the verge of seeing the significant benefits this facility will generate. Sinton's strategic location is centralized in an underserved steel consumer region and represents over 27 million tons of relevant flat-rolled steel consumption in the US and Mexico. These customers are excited to have a freight advantage regional flat-rolled steel supplier. We have six customers committed to locate on our site, representing up to 1.8 million tons of annual flat-rolled steel processing and consumption capability. Five of these customers have already broke ground. We can offer shorter delivery times, providing a superior customer supply chain solution to the region. We will also effectively compete with steel imports arriving in Houston and the West Coast, benefiting our customers in these areas with lower logistics costs, removing risks associated with ocean transit, quality, and delivery. We have also made considerable progress in setting our raw material procurement strategy to the mill. As I mentioned, the acquisition of a Mexican metals recycling company is a critical source of prime scrap supply. They are strategically located near high-volume industrial scrap sources throughout Central and Northern Mexico and have already done a great job growing volume with a lot more to come. Sinton is not simply adding flat-rolled steel production capacity. We have a differentiated product offering, a unique regional supply chain solution, a significant geographic freight and lead-time advantage, and offer a sustainable alternative to imports in a region in need of options. We're also going to build four additional value-added flat-rolled coating lines comprised of two new paint lines and two new galvanizing in lines with Galvalume coating capability. Our unique value-added coating supply chain strategy has resulted in our existing lines consistently running at or near full capacity. Our existing customers are anxiously awaiting the volume from these new lines. One galvanizing line and one paint line will be located on site at Sinton, while the other two lines will be placed at our Heartland Flat Roll division located in Terrault, Indiana. Each site will increase flat-tolled capacity by 540,000 tons to further support our regional flat-rolled steel operations, providing them with more value-added product diversification to serve our customers. We expect these lines will begin operating in mid-2023. In closing, our unique culture and the execution of our long-term growth and capital allocation strategy continues to strengthen our financial position through strong cash flow generation and long-term value creation. Our sustainable, symbiotic operating platforms and customer-centric supply solutions demonstrate our financial and operating stability, differentiating us from any competition. We're excited to continue our growth with new value-creating opportunities. Our people and the spirit of excellence provides the foundation for our success. I thank each of you for your passion and dedication and remind you that safety is always our most critical priority. So, everyone, thank you for joining us today and, Kate, will you please open the line for questions?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Also, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question to facilitate time for everyone. Any additional questions can be addressed upon reentering the queue. Our first question today is coming from Michael Glick at JPMorgan Securities. Your line is live, you may begin.\nMichael Glick: Good morning. In your fabrication segment, could you give us a bit more color about how we should think about the trajectories of both pricing and margins moving through the year? Any ranges there would be helpful. Thank you.\nTheresa Wagler: Good morning, Michael. So I think on the last quarter call, we mentioned that we have firm expectations that the fabrication business is going to earn more earnings in the first half of 2022 than in the second half of 2021. We believe we’ll invest firmly in that. So as I mentioned in my remarks, there is an expectation that we see another improvement in the first quarter and in the second quarter as well based on the backlog. So there's more visibility in fabrication, because the backlog is still lengthy, but also because of the pricing that we're seeing that we're able to achieve, as demand remains incredibly strong. So as far as specifics, it's hard to give specifics. I will just tell you that first quarter will definitely be, I think, meaningfully higher than what we saw in the fourth quarter and, again, another step function increase in the second quarter as well.\nMichael Glick: Got it. That’s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Emily Chieng at Goldman Sachs. Your line is live.\nEmily Chieng: Good morning, Mark and Theresa and thank you for the update today. My question is just around growth. Now that Sinton is coming towards the end there, and you've got a couple of coating lines and galv lines in the hopper, how do you think about other greenfield growth potential in your portfolio, particularly as it relates to the rebar segment? Do you have a view as to whether or not you need to see further capacity growth in the long product side from Steel Dynamics? Thank you.\nMark Millett: Well, thank you, Emily for your question. I think, the -- we will continue to, I think, demonstrate our sort of organic growth opportunities. In all honestly, rebar is not a focus of ours. It certainly has given us diversification in our structure and rail division and Roanoke Bar division, and we'll flex that as markets go up and down. But that rebar is not a target, so to speak, of any major growth. We will continue to grow in the value-added business. Obviously, I think, we've demonstrated that the strategic path has been very intentional and very, very profitable for us. And more importantly, it allows us that diversity of product mix to sustain higher utilization levels through the cycle. So I think that there's still opportunity to further value-add processing on the flat rolled side of things. Additionally, though, it's an intriguing marketplace out there, and we're seeing a pipeline that is full of transactional opportunities today as well.\nEmily Chieng: Great. That’s very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Timna Tanners at Wolfe Research. Your line is live.\nTimna Tanners: Hey, good morning and Happy New Year.\nMark Millett: Happy New Year\nTimna Tanners: Thanks. Happy New Year. I want to ask a little bit more about what you're seeing in the first quarter in terms of volumes. Clearly, the softer spot market that prevailed as you mentioned in the fourth quarter with some of the lighter volumes has spilled over a bit to the first quarter. And wondering any early thoughts about what that could mean for shipments quarter-over-quarter. Any thoughts on what's driving that and what might cause that to stabilize? Thanks.\nMark Millett: Well, I think we certainly saw the seasonality. And as I said earlier, there is one headline that MSCI shows that 17% compared to August and December. Well, if you look at it each year in history, it always does that. And it's just -- the seasonal adjustment is going to sort of disappear in the fourth quarter -- I mean first quarter of the year. The shipping volumes we would anticipate will increase accordingly.\nTimna Tanners: Do you expect normal increase from the fourth quarter to the first quarter in your shipping volumes across the board?\nMark Millett: Pretty much, yes.\nTimna Tanners: Okay. Interesting. Thanks.\nMark Millett: Again, we're not seeing -- people, I think, are relating a little bit of pricing softness here with demand. And as I said earlier, demand through our lens is incredibly strong and will remain so throughout the year.\nTheresa Wagler: The only thing I would add just to that, Timna, that we actually experienced at the end of the fourth quarter some logistics issues as well like I'm sure people are experiencing outside the steel industry as well as trucking and rail, and things have been disrupted. So there were shipments that we expected to actually deliver in December that we're not able to be delivered. So it's more of a timing issue. So that's going to benefit the first quarter as well.\nTimna Tanners: Okay. I’ll get back in the queue. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Seth Rosenfeld at Exane BNP Paribas. Your line is live.\nSeth Rosenfeld: Good afternoon. If I can follow-up, please, with the outlook for free cash flow and in particular the role of working capital. Obviously, the last year, in particular, Q4, saw a lot of investment in working capital. There were some delays of Sinton ramp-up. Wondering if that was one reason particularly elevated investments in Q4. And with that in mind, can you give us a bit of color on expectations, both outcome in Q1 and for the year ahead? Is it reasonable to assume that with Sinton ramp-up a slightly decline in ASPs for sheet, we could expect a meaningful working capital release? Thank you.\nTheresa Wagler: Good morning, Seth, thanks for the question. So yes, working capital, we did see significant growth during 2021, most of which is associated with the value growth in our steel products and in the increased volume and product pricing growth in our fabrications business. Sinton, at the end of the year, had about $150 million of working capital and we would expect to see that grow by probably end of the year $50 million during 2022. So in the first half of the year, there's still some structural growth attached to that. But otherwise, as we see product pricing fees and we see the strength in volume, so we would expect to see valuations come down, which should have a pretty significant working capital release during the entirety of the year. You might not see as much of it in the first half, but definitely in the second half of the year.\nSeth Rosenfeld: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Andreas Bokkenheuser at UBS. Your line is live.\nAndreas Bokkenheuser: Thank you. Just a question on inflation. I mean, obviously, it's a bit of an inflationary environment. How are you kind of thinking about inflation this year? Is there anything you kind of got on the table that can kind of mitigate inflation and looking at energy, even scrap? I mean, you've already integrated some scrap yards. Is there room for more scrap yard integration and acquisition there? That's the question on inflation. Thank you very much.\nMark Millett: Well, I think the -- we can't speak to the overall impact of inflation on the domestic economy. But relative to SDI, I think we're not impacted dramatically. Obviously, scrap will ramp to the marketplace. But from a cost of sort of conversion, we're relatively under control. We have been impacted a little by our cost and we've been impacted by the zinc cost over the last 12, 18 months moving up, but most of which is passed through -- the hourly cost, which sell is higher at our engineered bar division than any other mill, again, that tends to be passed to the customers. So we're not seeing a massive inflationary impact to our cost structure.\nTheresa Wagler: I would add -- and Andreas, I know you know this. As it relates to wages where a lot of people are seeing a really significant increase because we have so much of our compensation across the entire team that's performance-based, and it naturally fluctuates. So, we're not seeing the same pressure from a wage perspective because there's so much of the performance bonus compensation that's structurally in place. So I think Mark said, it perfectly that we're not seeing a lot of pressure with items that are passed through to the customer.\nMark Millett: And then one additional comment. I think we may have made this same comment in the last call. But as you reflect on our results, it's amazing to hire the teams throughout our organization just continue to break productivity records. And as such, over the years, we've found our conversion costs are actually incredibly stable or consistent given that the additional volume reduces our fixed cost, our overhead costs, which sort of absorbs any additional sort of inflationary pricing on alloys and those sorts of things. So through -- it's amazing, we just did the study, to be honest, with our Board last November. It's absolutely amazing, how our conversion costs remain very, very, very stable through the cycle.\nAndreas Bokkenheuser: So your performance-based structure is a good point. Thank you very much. I appreciate the insight.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Curt Woodworth at Credit Suisse. Your line is live.\nCurt Woodworth: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning Mark and Theresa. First question is just with regards to the Sinton ramp-up. I was wondering if you could help us understand the cadence of volume growth in the next couple of quarters and what level of start-up costs we should expect. And then you noted, I think, $1.8 million of on-site captive supply. When would you expect that to be fully functional?\nMark Millett: Well, obviously, we are anticipating the final piece of the jigsaw to be put in place here in the next few days, if not the next week or so, so that the actual specific ramp over the next three months is difficult to predict. But we feel we should demonstrate our performance no less than others signing up the mills here in the last five, 10 years. So we would anticipate at least two million tons of shipments this year, reaching capacity -- essential capacity in the late third quarter or fourth -- probably fourth quarter.\nCurt Woodworth: Okay. And then in terms of the on-site supply, when would you expect that to be at that consumption rate?\nMark Millett: Well, I think the -- it will come on in concert with our mill, in all honesty. We have one facility that's actually operating currently. There is one very large facility that will be operational in the next couple of months, but it's -- I'm not saying it was totally intentional. But by -- look, if nothing else, those facilities are going to ramp up nicely in concert with the steel mill. On the value-add side, we -- I think we've suggested in the past, the paint line, coating line is doing extremely well. The Galvalume capability comes online here, I think, in a couple of weeks. The finishing facilities performed extremely well. The hot strip mill is essentially commissioned. We bought slabs from third parties, and we also transferred intermediate slabs from our own facilities, took them that sort of preheated them in the tunnel furnace and have driven them through the mill quite successfully. So a lot of the parts are in great, great shape, but just waiting on the cash flow.\nCurt Woodworth: Okay. And then my follow-up is just maybe get a little bit more color on market dynamics last few months. I mean, it seems like between COVID, seasonality, destocking, rising supply, there's a lot of moving pieces here. And it seems like you're indicating that your January order book definitely strengthened relative to November and December. I think you had a comment that you said that inventories were normal, but some service centers saying they've got way too much, others don't. So I'm just curious, is your sense that the inventory level in the industry is generally getting rightsized pretty quickly at this point? And then in terms of the volume trends you saw in the fourth quarter, was it more concentrated on, say, the service center side of your business or on the OEM side? Thank you.\nMark Millett: I think when I say inventories have normalized, I'm just going by history. I mean, it's quite simple, if you look at the last five or six years for sure, but you go back in time longer than that, levels are appropriate. And have they grown? Absolutely. So, they grew from an absolute historic low. And as I indicated, our belief is that they are appropriate for the sort of demand cycle that we're going through. The -- so a little bit of a lull, I do believe. And you've got to live through a few of these cycles in the past, and our team is fortunate to have that experience. But you hit COVID, the whole industry grown to a halt. Things started up much more rapidly. And there's chaos there, absolutely, in the industry, including ourselves, to some degree to catch up. And then when you catch up, what happens? Well, our industry is not perfect. And in general, it overshoots a little bit. And in November, December, you saw things catching up. And all of a sudden, people are getting their supply simultaneously from two to three mills. So, you get that little overshoot, which I think was seen in November to December. Those in the automotive space probably saw it more than most. And so you had that softness particularly in hot band. That will resolve itself. As I said earlier, we don't see any change in the underlying consumption of that steel. Currently, -- and nor do we see that happening over the months and quarters ahead. You just have a little kind of a spike of supply that came through given the seasonality. But again, we're incredibly optimistic for 2022.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Carlos De Alba at Morgan Stanley. Your line is live.\nCarlos De Alba: Yes, thank you very much. And just I guess following up on the last point. So, how should we reconcile then, Mark, that the fact that the lead-times in the industry, the information that is product available have continued to come down? But you -- as you said, you are extremely constructive on how your order book is looking like and demand expectations. Is it -- is this just a supply that you mentioned that picked up in recent months and is going to now be absorbed by demand, or is it Steel Dynamics is gaining market share versus competitors, and therefore, what you're seeing may be different to what the industry statistics that we have access to?\nMark Millett: Well, I think we're certainly seeing market share in certain markets. We've certainly gained a dramatic traction in the automotive sphere, for instance. Unfortunately, that traction was with the automotive producers that weren't as impacted by the chip shortage is maybe the US domestic producers. So, yes, we are gaining sort of incremental market share there. Again, we have phenomenally sort of supportive loyal customers that in -- whether times like this, will support us and then bring their orders to us. Our overall business model, though, again, with a diverse product portfolio that we have, that we have differentiated supply chain solutions in our coated and prepaint business is just different, and it provides phenomenal value for the customer. And those businesses remain strong. And we think that the coated value-add market in general is going to remain very, very, very solid going forward. All you have is a little bit of seasonality, sort of, catch-up moment in hot band, which pressured spot price. If you can envision and I envision that the import volumes that picked up in the last three or four months because of a massive arbitrage growth, if you envision that, that can moderate, which I think is the arbitrage is shrinking. And as we listen to traders out there, having difficulty sustaining business for late second quarter of this year, if the imports do fall off a little, you're going to get demand pressure again. And it wouldn’t be unexpected on our part if you saw a little rebound in pricing.\nCarlos De Alba: All right. Excellent. Thank you very much, Mark.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from David Gagliano at BMO Capital Markets. Your line is live, you may begin.\nDavid Gagliano: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I'll just ask a couple of quick ones here. Just on the commentary around 85% of flat roll lagged pricing in the fourth quarter. Can you just give us a sense so we can tighten up the models a little bit for first quarter? What was that average lag duration wise? And is that -- are those reasonable proxies for the first quarter as well?\nTheresa Wagler: Yes. The contract business, David, in the fourth quarter was at 80% to 85%, and it's likely to stay in that range at least through the first half of the year, as we're servicing our contract customers. And then, as Sinton comes online more strongly in the second half of the year, that's naturally going to decline to a certain degree, just because of the shift in mix. But we're expecting that to be maintained. As it relates to the lag, it's really about, on average, a two-month lag on the flat roll pricing, and it's generally tied to the CRU index.\nDavid Gagliano: Okay. And that's a reasonable proxy for the first quarter as well, two months lag?\nTheresa Wagler: Yes. Correct.\nDavid Gagliano: Okay. Perfect. Thanks. And then just last question for me. The CapEx, it went up a little bit, 700 prior guide to 750, what was the reason behind that?\nTheresa Wagler: Well, it is simply that we went through the extensive study that we do every year, and that generally takes place in the November time frame. So we proved additional projects and those projects, as kind of attested to by our return on invested capital metrics, are really efficiency and growth-oriented, but they're just smaller in nature. So there's nothing individually to call out for the reasons we increase. They're just some really nice projects came to light.\nDavid Gagliano: Okay. Perfect. It’s helpful. Thanks.\nTheresa Wagler: You’re welcome.\nMark Millett: Thanks, David.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Phil Gibbs at KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is live.\nPhil Gibbs: Yes. Thanks very much. Good morning.\nMark Millett: Good morning, Phil.\nPhil Gibbs: Hi, Theresa, can you provide the sheet shipments by product grade?\nTheresa Wagler: I apologize. I'm smiling because I did miss that. The hot mill and P&O shipments for the fourth quarter were 693,000 tons. Cold rolled was 136,000 tons. And finally, the coated products were 994,000 tons.\nPhil Gibbs: Perfect. And then I remember last quarter, you had -- and Mark, I think you had talked about yellow goods having a decent outlook, and we obviously know your feelings on automotive. What's the future look like in your opinion for SBQ this year and engineered bar?\nMark Millett: I think for Engineered Bar is relatively steady. I think we'll gain some volume as automotive picks up is again 15%, 20% for auto with Engineered Bar, I do believe. So they're going to gain on the automotive side. They are going to lose a bit of volume, not much. As hot band has come off, folks are switching from seamless pipe over to ERW pipe. And so there was a little bit of volume there. For us, though, generally, that's going to benefit. We're already seeing the benefit then in Columbus, to be honest, as we're picking up energy orders there in one large mill – pipe mill is starting back up.\nPhil Gibbs: Can you talk about those dynamics a little bit more on the energy side in terms of the switch that it have to do with the trade case that was filed?\nMark Millett: It's -- from our understanding, it's more just a cost issue, taking a slug -- Engineered Bar slug and piecing it and producing seamless pipe is more expensive today now that hot band has come off. And so people are switching to the ERW.\nPhil Gibbs: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Andrew Cosgrove at Bloomberg Intelligence. Your line is live.\nAndrew Cosgrove: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I know you said conversion costs have been kept in check and the team has done a pretty good job. I was just a little bit curious as to if you take the raw material spread and then the excess on top of that. It looks like it ticked up 10% to 15% quarter-on-quarter. I was just curious if that anything to do with having to buy more hot band because Sinton was not up and running and the finishing lines were or anything else that you could add on that particular front?\nMark Millett: Great question. And yes, the conversion -- as I indicated earlier, the conversion costs under control is actually through our lines specifically. But as our conversion businesses -- and today, one has to remember, we're purchasing – 1.7 million, 1.8 million tons of substring from others to support our -- the tax in Pittsburgh. We buy some third parties for our New Millennium fabrication business. You've got U.S. steel supply. You have Heartland facility. So yes, the added substrate or the substrate costs moving through does impact the perceived conversion.\nAndrew Cosgrove: Right. Okay. And then just lastly, could you just give us a little bit of an idea how much it costs to move things geographically, say from the Gulf up to the Midwest or from where you guys are situated at in the middle of the country to the western part? And then, I guess, along the same lines would be, are you still planning on sending 30% of Sinton's shipments to Mexico?\nMark Millett: Well, several questions there, I guess, well several answers to give. From the Midwest – you mentioned Midwest, the West Coast, very little material moves from Midwest or East through the Rockies to the West Coast. It's quite an exorbitant freight rate. That's why one of the many advantages of Sinton is actually the freight rate, believe it or not, all the way to the West Coast to compete with the inflow market there. I think the freight rate there is $55 a ton or thereabouts. That the cheapest freight rate of any mill to the West Coast to sort of calibrate freights, Northern freight folks in Northern Indiana are shipping down to Mexico. And that's in the order of, I do believe, $95 to $110 a ton or as -- from Sinton into Mexico into Monterrey is going to be likely $37-ish a ton. So, the Sinton facility itself is a phenomenal sort of geographic advantage there to move that material into Mexico. And you're right, 30% or so, a million tons or thereabouts should flow into Mexico from the Sinton facility.\nAndrew Cosgrove: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from John Tumazos at John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Your line is live.\nJohn Tumazos: Congratulations on all the customers on your campus at Sinton. With prime metals and the coating lines and then those customers, it's, I guess, close to 4 million tons of potential demand, do you expect to have the 6 more vacant lots for new customers filled? Does it make sense to build a second mill next to the first one if the demand is this good? Is it possible from an engineering standpoint to add another caster to increase the capacity at Sinton above 3 million tons given how much the customers seem to love it?\nMark Millett: Well, John, your independent research is on target as always. So thank you, and thank you for the kind words on the team's performance because they did a phenomenal job last year. I would suggest that Sinton is jewel. The reception we've had there thus far for those six -- to come and be building even before the plant is running, I think, is testament to the vacuum of -- or the impact of the vacuum of steel primary steel production down then. So Sinton is a much needed asset for our industry, and it's definitely differentiated. The addition of a second caster likely is unlikely, but we have designed that facility to add somewhere between one million to 1.5 million tons of additional capacity. So expansion of that facility -- the capability is definitely there. I think we will also…\nJohn Tumazos: Mark, what is the limiting factor to the capacity of the plant? Is it the caster or the surrounding infrastructure?\nMark Millett: The caster. The hot strip mill, like our other mills has the ability, given the -- width gauge combination that we can produce there, has 4.5 million tons of capacity.\nJohn Tumazos: Thank you. My son went on a Sinton tour in November. He joined the American AIST, American Iron Steel Technology Group, and he was telling me how great it was and sent me along his notes. So I'm not all that insightful, Mark. I learned from the younger generation.\nMark Millett: Yeah. I know, John. I don't know how that happened, but we were glad that he was there, I guess.\nJohn Tumazos: …leadership conference in September of AIST and six -- nine other trade associations in Pittsburgh and has his own friends and the engineering departments of all these steel companies now.\nMark Millett: Yeah. Well, that's good. But no, thanks for your continued support of us, John. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is a follow-up from Timna Tanners. Your line is live.\nTimna Tanners: Hey, guys thanks for squeezing me in. I just think there's a lot of question about the fabricating business. And if you look historically the profitability in that division for EBITDA per ton has been pretty consistently $50 to $200 for -- just to give you a broad range, of course. Prices went up $1,000 a ton, EBITDA per ton exploded, and you say it's going to be sustained there. So just like to understand a little bit, is this a new normal in terms of earnings, is this out earning? What's driving that? Are customers not pushing back at all on the big increases in light of falling underlying steel prices? Just any further color would be really helpful.\nMark Millett: Well, it depends on what time period you're calibrating to, Timna, I guess. That industry since last peak has changed and consolidated to large degree. And at the same time, currently, the actual market demand is at a historical high.\nTheresa Wagler: So Timna, the visibility that we have isn't predicated upon falling steel prices. Its predicated upon the forward pricing that we know we have in the order book for steel joist index. The team has done a really good job of managing the steel raw material inputs. So that's why we have more certainty. I would not say this is a new normal, no. This is an extraordinary time for them. But to Mark's point, we're gaining market share as well as the team has been doing some really interesting things on the operational side. We've added ship. Unique thing about our fabrication business is we can really achieve whatever volume demand will allow us to have just by adding people rather than adding assets, which is a very powerful tool. As we add volume, it really drops the bottom-line. And so that's why, again, we feel really confident about 2022 for the fabrication, but it shouldn't be our expectation that this is something that is the new normal.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question for today is a follow-up from Seth Rosenfeld. Your line is live.\nSeth Rosenfeld: Thank you again for taking our questions. One final one of mine for shareholder returns. In the past, you've talked about the completion of Sinton as a potential catalyst to increase the base dividend. Can you talk us through the time line in terms of the de-risking of Sinton that you would want to secure before making that step? When we think about the scale of any potential increase, how do we consider that versus historical strategy? Thank you.\nTheresa Wagler: So, I think we mentioned it on the last quarter conference call as well as there is definitely the emphasis from the Board and from the senior leadership team to increase the dividend when we have through-cycle cash earnings that are increasing. And so that definitely is Sinton. We generally have our increases in the first quarter. I can't tell you what that will look like. I would expect to see it sometime in the first half of the year. But again, that's a Board decision to make. They're very supportive of this substantial increase. We have a target of a net income payout ratio of at least 35%. So, that's something that we'll take into consideration as we look at the through-cycle earnings for Sinton and what that dividend increase will look like. But in the meantime, we're using the share buyback program as a complement. That's something that we believe is very powerful for shareholder insurance as well.\nOperator: Thank you. That was our final question for today. That concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for any closing remarks.\nMark Millett: Thanks Kate. Just quite simply, for those on the line for us, thank you for that support, for sure. Any customers, again, my heartfelt thanks to you. You make us who we are, in all honesty. And to our team, guys and girls, you absolutely shattered any previous performance by a long margin. And yes, the market helped, but what you do each and every day makes us different and proud to be part of you. But lastly, though, phenomenal performance from a volume and from a profitability standpoint. But we need to buckle down -- double back down on our safety and get that trend going back in that with the trajectory as we have in the past. But again, thank you, each and every one of you. Make it a great day. Bye, bye.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation and have a great and safe day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mark Millett",
            "content": "Thank you, David, and good morning, everybody. Happy 2022. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings call. We all appreciate your time and thank you for joining us today. The entire Steel Dynamics team delivered an exceptional performance in 2021 with record sales, earnings, and cash flow generation. The team totally shared the previous full year records. It was a tremendous achievement certainly supported by a strong market, but driven by the commitment and passion of our teams executing on our long-term strategies that continue to grow on through cycle and the capability. Thank you, team, for your dedication to excellence in every pursuit. I'm proud to work alongside you. Due to the steadfast commitment, our people helped to one another and their families to our communities and to our customers, we are operating safely amidst the extended pandemic. The health and welfare of our teams remain paramount. Record financial results are no important while teams did not remain safe. Although our safety performance continues to be better than industry averages, our safety performance deteriorated year-over-year. This is an unacceptable trend that we're working diligently to resolve as our intent will always to have zero incidents. Since our founding over 25 years ago, we've been intentional in managing our resources sustainably for the benefit of all of our stakeholders. We are steel industry leader in sustainability, operating exclusively with electric arc furnace technology with a differentiated circular manufacturing business model. As our journey continues, we are committed to the reduction of our climate footprint, including a practical and achievable goal for our steel mills to be carbon neutral by 2050. We're starting from a position of strength, yet plan to do more. We're competitively positioned and focused towards generating long-term sustainable growth. But before I continue with additional market commentary, I'd like Theresa to share insights into our recent performance. Super. Thank you, Theresa. And as you said, our steel fabrication operations performed exceptionally well throughout 2021, achieving record volume and earnings. The earnings power of this platform in a strong construction environment is yet to be completely displayed. At the end of the year, our steel joist and deck order backlog was at a record level for both volume and forward pricing, extending through March of 2022. The nonresidential construction market remains sound, especially in areas that support online retail, data centers, schools and health care, specifically represented by construction of distribution warehouse facility. Our steel fabrication operations provide a powerful natural hedge to our steel production operations in a steady or softening steel price environment. Our metals recycling operations also performed well this year, achieving record annual earnings and strong volume growth. The acquisition of a Mexican metals recycling company in August of 2020 has proven to be both strategic supply and an excellent investment, combining a great financial result with the additional benefit of growing access to prime scrap at North Central Mexico in support of our southern electric arc furnace at flat roll steel mill. The metals recycling footprint provides a strategic competitive advantage for our steel mills and our scrap-generating steel customers. We have ample access to ferrous scrap supply, including prime scrap and believe this will remain the case in the future. The steel team had an incredible year, achieving record volume and also record earnings of $4.4 billion, which eclipsed previous peaks. During 2021, the domestic steel industry operated at a production utilization rate of 81%, while our steel mills operated at a rate of 91%. We consistently operate at a higher utilization due to our value-add steel diversification, our differentiated customer supply chain solutions and the support of our internal manufacturing businesses. As we suggested during our last earnings call, new capacity and moderate import growth is pressured to hot-rolled coil price. Supply side issues have largely been resolved and lead times are back to manageable levels after ballooning post COVID as manufacturing steel demand recovered much more fruitfully than expected by the industry. Hot-rolled coil pricing has moderated. But contrary to recent alarmist commentary, the magnitude of the price correction is in no way connected to any material in overall demand. Inventory levels have certainly normalized the pre-COVID levels but are more than appropriate for the present demand environment. December MSCI shipments dropped to approximately 2.4 million tons, but this is consistent with typical seasonality, not an abnormality. Monthly import levels have undergone controlled growth in recent months as the arbitrage expanded. But as anticipated, there's been no surge. The recent hot-rolled coil price declines should effectively eradicate import volume growth in the months ahead. These are natural market adjustments and are not structural changes. Hot-rolled transactions are currently consistent with published index numbers in the range of $1,300 to $1,400 per ton. There are a limited number of large volume spot hot band offerings that can be procured at lower numbers, but these are not prevalent or reflective of the market in general. One must recognize that the spot comp and market has diminished in size over recent years as contract businesses increased across the industry. Therefore, it's not necessarily a true indicator of the whole market. Current hot-band spot offers are based on import values today, which are quickly drying up as the arbitrage strengths. Traders are reportedly finding it difficult to execute any business for second quarter delivery. Throughout our history, we have intentionally grown our value-added steel product portfolio and create valuable customer supply chain solutions to mitigate the impact of price volatility. Today, over 70% [ph] of our steel sales are considered value-add. This differentiated business model will continue to provide best-in-class financial metrics and through-cycle cash generation. Looking forward, we remain steadfast in our optimism for 2022. After a short period of seasonally lower steel demand in November and December, our flat-rolled order input rate in January was one of the best months ever. And backlogs are very healthy. Automotive sector steel consumption should grow year-over-year as the chip shortage eases, fueled by an extreme lack of dealer inventory, which is 60% lower than normal, and strong pent-up demand. The automotive sector operated at production rates lower than normalized levels in 2020 and 2021, around about 13 million units and is expected to grow to 15 million units this year and 17 million units in 2023. Nonresidential construction sector is strong as evidenced by the strength of shipments and backlogs at our structural and rail division and steel fabrication businesses. Residential construction has also been reversed, resulting in high demand for HVAC material, appliance and other related products. Stronger energy prices are now pushing up the rig count and associated under new pipe production. In aggregate, our steel backlogs and our order input strength, coupled with broad optimistic customer commentary and general market momentum, drive us to conclude that steel market dynamics will remain strong through 2022. We anticipate steel demand increasing year-over-year and with a likely retraction of import volumes possibly a moderate rebound in pricing. Steel Dynamics is a dynamic growth company, increasing through-cycle earnings and cash flow to support continuous value creation. Our new Sinton, Texas flat roll steel mill represents our most significant investment to date, providing the avenue for transformational growth and opportunity for ourselves and our customers. This differentiated investment facilitates significant through-cycle operational and financial growth for all of our stakeholders, from our teams and customers, to our vendors and shareholders. This EAF steel mill represents next-generation lower carbon emitting steel production capabilities, providing differentiated products and supply chain solutions. The 3 million tons state-of-the-art facility is designed to have product capabilities beyond that of any existing electric arc furnace flat-rolled steel producer, competing even more effectively with higher carbon emitting integrated steel facilities and high carbon from our competition. It provides us with a more diverse steel product portfolio and benefits our customers with an even broader climate-conscious supply option. The Sinton construction team has experienced numerous challenges related to supply chain disruptions and COVID impacts. These challenges resulted in hot-side production shifting from the end of 2021 to a class start before the end of February 2022. The Sinton group navigated through the challenges as well and we are on the verge of seeing the significant benefits this facility will generate. Sinton's strategic location is centralized in an underserved steel consumer region and represents over 27 million tons of relevant flat-rolled steel consumption in the US and Mexico. These customers are excited to have a freight advantage regional flat-rolled steel supplier. We have six customers committed to locate on our site, representing up to 1.8 million tons of annual flat-rolled steel processing and consumption capability. Five of these customers have already broke ground. We can offer shorter delivery times, providing a superior customer supply chain solution to the region. We will also effectively compete with steel imports arriving in Houston and the West Coast, benefiting our customers in these areas with lower logistics costs, removing risks associated with ocean transit, quality, and delivery. We have also made considerable progress in setting our raw material procurement strategy to the mill. As I mentioned, the acquisition of a Mexican metals recycling company is a critical source of prime scrap supply. They are strategically located near high-volume industrial scrap sources throughout Central and Northern Mexico and have already done a great job growing volume with a lot more to come. Sinton is not simply adding flat-rolled steel production capacity. We have a differentiated product offering, a unique regional supply chain solution, a significant geographic freight and lead-time advantage, and offer a sustainable alternative to imports in a region in need of options. We're also going to build four additional value-added flat-rolled coating lines comprised of two new paint lines and two new galvanizing in lines with Galvalume coating capability. Our unique value-added coating supply chain strategy has resulted in our existing lines consistently running at or near full capacity. Our existing customers are anxiously awaiting the volume from these new lines. One galvanizing line and one paint line will be located on site at Sinton, while the other two lines will be placed at our Heartland Flat Roll division located in Terrault, Indiana. Each site will increase flat-tolled capacity by 540,000 tons to further support our regional flat-rolled steel operations, providing them with more value-added product diversification to serve our customers. We expect these lines will begin operating in mid-2023. In closing, our unique culture and the execution of our long-term growth and capital allocation strategy continues to strengthen our financial position through strong cash flow generation and long-term value creation. Our sustainable, symbiotic operating platforms and customer-centric supply solutions demonstrate our financial and operating stability, differentiating us from any competition. We're excited to continue our growth with new value-creating opportunities. Our people and the spirit of excellence provides the foundation for our success. I thank each of you for your passion and dedication and remind you that safety is always our most critical priority. So, everyone, thank you for joining us today and, Kate, will you please open the line for questions? Well, thank you, Emily for your question. I think, the -- we will continue to, I think, demonstrate our sort of organic growth opportunities. In all honestly, rebar is not a focus of ours. It certainly has given us diversification in our structure and rail division and Roanoke Bar division, and we'll flex that as markets go up and down. But that rebar is not a target, so to speak, of any major growth. We will continue to grow in the value-added business. Obviously, I think, we've demonstrated that the strategic path has been very intentional and very, very profitable for us. And more importantly, it allows us that diversity of product mix to sustain higher utilization levels through the cycle. So I think that there's still opportunity to further value-add processing on the flat rolled side of things. Additionally, though, it's an intriguing marketplace out there, and we're seeing a pipeline that is full of transactional opportunities today as well. Happy New Year Well, I think we certainly saw the seasonality. And as I said earlier, there is one headline that MSCI shows that 17% compared to August and December. Well, if you look at it each year in history, it always does that. And it's just -- the seasonal adjustment is going to sort of disappear in the fourth quarter -- I mean first quarter of the year. The shipping volumes we would anticipate will increase accordingly. Pretty much, yes. Again, we're not seeing -- people, I think, are relating a little bit of pricing softness here with demand. And as I said earlier, demand through our lens is incredibly strong and will remain so throughout the year. Well, I think the -- we can't speak to the overall impact of inflation on the domestic economy. But relative to SDI, I think we're not impacted dramatically. Obviously, scrap will ramp to the marketplace. But from a cost of sort of conversion, we're relatively under control. We have been impacted a little by our cost and we've been impacted by the zinc cost over the last 12, 18 months moving up, but most of which is passed through -- the hourly cost, which sell is higher at our engineered bar division than any other mill, again, that tends to be passed to the customers. So we're not seeing a massive inflationary impact to our cost structure. And then one additional comment. I think we may have made this same comment in the last call. But as you reflect on our results, it's amazing to hire the teams throughout our organization just continue to break productivity records. And as such, over the years, we've found our conversion costs are actually incredibly stable or consistent given that the additional volume reduces our fixed cost, our overhead costs, which sort of absorbs any additional sort of inflationary pricing on alloys and those sorts of things. So through -- it's amazing, we just did the study, to be honest, with our Board last November. It's absolutely amazing, how our conversion costs remain very, very, very stable through the cycle. Well, obviously, we are anticipating the final piece of the jigsaw to be put in place here in the next few days, if not the next week or so, so that the actual specific ramp over the next three months is difficult to predict. But we feel we should demonstrate our performance no less than others signing up the mills here in the last five, 10 years. So we would anticipate at least two million tons of shipments this year, reaching capacity -- essential capacity in the late third quarter or fourth -- probably fourth quarter. Well, I think the -- it will come on in concert with our mill, in all honesty. We have one facility that's actually operating currently. There is one very large facility that will be operational in the next couple of months, but it's -- I'm not saying it was totally intentional. But by -- look, if nothing else, those facilities are going to ramp up nicely in concert with the steel mill. On the value-add side, we -- I think we've suggested in the past, the paint line, coating line is doing extremely well. The Galvalume capability comes online here, I think, in a couple of weeks. The finishing facilities performed extremely well. The hot strip mill is essentially commissioned. We bought slabs from third parties, and we also transferred intermediate slabs from our own facilities, took them that sort of preheated them in the tunnel furnace and have driven them through the mill quite successfully. So a lot of the parts are in great, great shape, but just waiting on the cash flow. I think when I say inventories have normalized, I'm just going by history. I mean, it's quite simple, if you look at the last five or six years for sure, but you go back in time longer than that, levels are appropriate. And have they grown? Absolutely. So, they grew from an absolute historic low. And as I indicated, our belief is that they are appropriate for the sort of demand cycle that we're going through. The -- so a little bit of a lull, I do believe. And you've got to live through a few of these cycles in the past, and our team is fortunate to have that experience. But you hit COVID, the whole industry grown to a halt. Things started up much more rapidly. And there's chaos there, absolutely, in the industry, including ourselves, to some degree to catch up. And then when you catch up, what happens? Well, our industry is not perfect. And in general, it overshoots a little bit. And in November, December, you saw things catching up. And all of a sudden, people are getting their supply simultaneously from two to three mills. So, you get that little overshoot, which I think was seen in November to December. Those in the automotive space probably saw it more than most. And so you had that softness particularly in hot band. That will resolve itself. As I said earlier, we don't see any change in the underlying consumption of that steel. Currently, -- and nor do we see that happening over the months and quarters ahead. You just have a little kind of a spike of supply that came through given the seasonality. But again, we're incredibly optimistic for 2022. Well, I think we're certainly seeing market share in certain markets. We've certainly gained a dramatic traction in the automotive sphere, for instance. Unfortunately, that traction was with the automotive producers that weren't as impacted by the chip shortage is maybe the US domestic producers. So, yes, we are gaining sort of incremental market share there. Again, we have phenomenally sort of supportive loyal customers that in -- whether times like this, will support us and then bring their orders to us. Our overall business model, though, again, with a diverse product portfolio that we have, that we have differentiated supply chain solutions in our coated and prepaint business is just different, and it provides phenomenal value for the customer. And those businesses remain strong. And we think that the coated value-add market in general is going to remain very, very, very solid going forward. All you have is a little bit of seasonality, sort of, catch-up moment in hot band, which pressured spot price. If you can envision and I envision that the import volumes that picked up in the last three or four months because of a massive arbitrage growth, if you envision that, that can moderate, which I think is the arbitrage is shrinking. And as we listen to traders out there, having difficulty sustaining business for late second quarter of this year, if the imports do fall off a little, you're going to get demand pressure again. And it wouldn't be unexpected on our part if you saw a little rebound in pricing. Thanks, David. Good morning, Phil. I think for Engineered Bar is relatively steady. I think we'll gain some volume as automotive picks up is again 15%, 20% for auto with Engineered Bar, I do believe. So they're going to gain on the automotive side. They are going to lose a bit of volume, not much. As hot band has come off, folks are switching from seamless pipe over to ERW pipe. And so there was a little bit of volume there. For us, though, generally, that's going to benefit. We're already seeing the benefit then in Columbus, to be honest, as we're picking up energy orders there in one large mill – pipe mill is starting back up. It's -- from our understanding, it's more just a cost issue, taking a slug -- Engineered Bar slug and piecing it and producing seamless pipe is more expensive today now that hot band has come off. And so people are switching to the ERW. Great question. And yes, the conversion -- as I indicated earlier, the conversion costs under control is actually through our lines specifically. But as our conversion businesses -- and today, one has to remember, we're purchasing – 1.7 million, 1.8 million tons of substring from others to support our -- the tax in Pittsburgh. We buy some third parties for our New Millennium fabrication business. You've got U.S. steel supply. You have Heartland facility. So yes, the added substrate or the substrate costs moving through does impact the perceived conversion. Well, several questions there, I guess, well several answers to give. From the Midwest – you mentioned Midwest, the West Coast, very little material moves from Midwest or East through the Rockies to the West Coast. It's quite an exorbitant freight rate. That's why one of the many advantages of Sinton is actually the freight rate, believe it or not, all the way to the West Coast to compete with the inflow market there. I think the freight rate there is $55 a ton or thereabouts. That the cheapest freight rate of any mill to the West Coast to sort of calibrate freights, Northern freight folks in Northern Indiana are shipping down to Mexico. And that's in the order of, I do believe, $95 to $110 a ton or as -- from Sinton into Mexico into Monterrey is going to be likely $37-ish a ton. So, the Sinton facility itself is a phenomenal sort of geographic advantage there to move that material into Mexico. And you're right, 30% or so, a million tons or thereabouts should flow into Mexico from the Sinton facility. Well, John, your independent research is on target as always. So thank you, and thank you for the kind words on the team's performance because they did a phenomenal job last year. I would suggest that Sinton is jewel. The reception we've had there thus far for those six -- to come and be building even before the plant is running, I think, is testament to the vacuum of -- or the impact of the vacuum of steel primary steel production down then. So Sinton is a much needed asset for our industry, and it's definitely differentiated. The addition of a second caster likely is unlikely, but we have designed that facility to add somewhere between one million to 1.5 million tons of additional capacity. So expansion of that facility -- the capability is definitely there. I think we will also... The caster. The hot strip mill, like our other mills has the ability, given the -- width gauge combination that we can produce there, has 4.5 million tons of capacity. Yeah. I know, John. I don't know how that happened, but we were glad that he was there, I guess. Yeah. Well, that's good. But no, thanks for your continued support of us, John. I appreciate it. Well, it depends on what time period you're calibrating to, Timna, I guess. That industry since last peak has changed and consolidated to large degree. And at the same time, currently, the actual market demand is at a historical high. Thanks Kate. Just quite simply, for those on the line for us, thank you for that support, for sure. Any customers, again, my heartfelt thanks to you. You make us who we are, in all honesty. And to our team, guys and girls, you absolutely shattered any previous performance by a long margin. And yes, the market helped, but what you do each and every day makes us different and proud to be part of you. But lastly, though, phenomenal performance from a volume and from a profitability standpoint. But we need to buckle down -- double back down on our safety and get that trend going back in that with the trajectory as we have in the past. But again, thank you, each and every one of you. Make it a great day. Bye, bye."

            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Good to be with you. I'd like to add my sincere appreciation and congratulate the entire team. We continue to achieve new milestones throughout the business, attaining record annual performance, with record revenues of $18.4 million derived from strong product pricing and volumes across all of our operating platforms. Record operating income of $4.3 billion and net income of $3.2 billion or $15.56 per diluted share and record cash flow from operations of $2.2 billion and adjusted EBITDA of over $4.6 billion, truly an exceptional performance. Regarding our fourth quarter 2021 results, net income was $1.09 billion or $5.49 per diluted share, which includes additional performance-based company-wide special compensation of approximately $21 million or $0.08 per diluted share, which was awarded to all non-executive eligible team members in recognition of their extraordinary performance. Our fourth quarter contribution to the company's charitable foundation is $10 million or $0.04 per diluted share and costs of approximately $52 million or $0.18 per diluted share associated with the construction and startup of our Sinton, Texas flat roll steel mill. Excluding these items, fourth quarter 2021 adjusted net income was over $1.15 billion or $5.78 per diluted share. Our fourth quarter 2021 record revenues of $5.3 billion were 4% higher than sequential third quarter results, driven by higher realized selling values in our steel fabrication business and our flat rolled steel operations. Our fourth quarter 2021 record operating income of $1.4 billion was 8% higher than sequential results, driven by the continued demand trends at our steel fabrication operations. As we discuss our business this morning, we see positive industry fundamentals for 2022, and we're focused toward our continued transformational growth initiatives. Our steel operations generated record operating income of $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter, as increased realized selling values expanded margins across the steel platform, offsetting seasonally lower volumes. Our lagging flat rolled contract business represented approximately 80% to 85% of our total flat roll volume in the quarter. We had quarterly steel shipments of 2.7 million tons, with our steel mill operating at 88% of their capability. For the full year 2021, our steel operations achieved numerous financial and operational milestones. The platform's full year operating income was a record $4.4 billion, with record shipments of 11.2 million tons, a truly phenomenal performance. Now to remind you, we still have additional market opportunity, mostly within our long products group and in line with the startup of our Sinton, Texas mill. Because based on our existing annual steel shipping capability, we have over 13 million tons of shipping capability on the steel side and with Sinton fully ramped, it will be over 16 million tons. Operating income from our metals recycling operations for the fourth quarter remained strong at $44 million, based on the improved metal margins offsetting lower share of shipments. Many domestic steel mills have planned maintenance outages throughout the fourth quarter, lowering various scrap metals. For the full year 2021, operating income for metals recycling operations was a record $195 million driven by uniquely higher volume and average selling value for both ferrous and non-ferrous recycling. The team continues to effectively lever the strength of our circular manufacturing and operating model, benefiting both our steel and metals recycling operations by providing higher quality scrap, which improves furnace efficiency and reduces company-wide working capital requirements Our steel fabrication operations also achieved record operating income in the quarter of $238 million, 2.5 times record third quarter results, driven by materially higher realized selling value, which more than offset escalated average steel – steel input costs. For the full year 2021, our steel fabrication platform achieved another record year with operating income of $365 million and record volumes of 789,000 tons, both steel sheets [ph]. Congratulations to the team. Steel joist and deck demand remains very strong as evidenced by continued robust order activity, resulting in another record order backlog in the quarter, extending throughout 2022. Based on our backlog and customer sentiment, we expect steel fabrication earnings to continue to increase into 2022. Our cash generation continues to be strong based on our differentiated circular business model and highly durable cost structure. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had liquidity of $2.4 billion comprised of cash of $1.2 billion and are fully available and secure revolver of $1.2 billion. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we generated record cash flow from operations of $724 million and $2.2 billion for the full year, also a reference. Working capital grew $1.7 billion during the year due to higher selling values resulting in increased customer account and inventory value. During 2021, we invested $1 billion in capital investments, of which $831 million was invested in our new Texas flat rolled steel mill. During 2022, we believe capital investments will be in the range of $750 million, the majority of which relates to four new flat-rolled coating mines to be placed in Sinton and Heartland. Regarding shareholder distributions, we maintained our quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per common share after increasing at 4% in the first quarter of 2021. We also repurchased $330 million of our common stock in the fourth quarter, representing 3% of outstanding shares. At December 31, we had $383 million remaining on the price for repurchase under that program. In the past five years, we've increased our cash dividend per share of about 86%, and we repurchased $2.3 billion of our common stock, representing 23% of outstanding shares. While during the same timeframe, we achieved an investment-grade credit rating and maintained our growth company profile by investing $3.1 million in organic capital investments and funding [indiscernible]. These actions reflect the strength of our capital foundation and consistently strong cash flow generation and the continued optimism and confidence in our future. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes strategic growth, with shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that is complemented with a variable share repurchase program, while also dedicated to preserving our investment-grade credit designation. We are squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable, optimized long-term value creation. Sustainability is a part of this strategy, and we're dedicated to our people, our communities and our environment. We're committed to operating our business with the highest level of integrity. Further committing to this path, in 2021, we announced greenhouse gas reduction and renewable energy goals, including a goal for our steel mills to be carbon neutral by 2050. To increase transparency and accountability, we also have interim milestones for 2025 and 2030. We've led the steel industry with an exclusive use of electric arc furnace steelmaking technology, circular manufacturing model and innovative solutions to increase efficiency, reduce raw material usage, reuse secondary materials and promote material conservation and recycling. We plan to sustain our leadership position by executing our climate goals through, among other avenues, implementing emission reduction projects, improving energy management, increasing the use of renewable energy and developing and supporting new innovative technologies. We have an actionable path that is more manageable and we believe, considerably less expensive than what may lay ahead for our traditional blast furnace industry peers. Our sustainability and climate strategy is an ongoing journey and we're moving forward with the intention to make a positive difference. We play an industry leadership role moving forward. Thank you, Mark. Good morning, Michael. So I think on the last quarter call, we mentioned that we have firm expectations that the fabrication business is going to earn more earnings in the first half of 2022 than in the second half of 2021. We believe we'll invest firmly in that. So as I mentioned in my remarks, there is an expectation that we see another improvement in the first quarter and in the second quarter as well based on the backlog. So there's more visibility in fabrication, because the backlog is still lengthy, but also because of the pricing that we're seeing that we're able to achieve, as demand remains incredibly strong. So as far as specifics, it's hard to give specifics. I will just tell you that first quarter will definitely be, I think, meaningfully higher than what we saw in the fourth quarter and, again, another step function increase in the second quarter as well. The only thing I would add just to that, Timna, that we actually experienced at the end of the fourth quarter some logistics issues as well like I'm sure people are experiencing outside the steel industry as well as trucking and rail, and things have been disrupted. So there were shipments that we expected to actually deliver in December that we're not able to be delivered. So it's more of a timing issue. So that's going to benefit the first quarter as well. Good morning, Seth, thanks for the question. So yes, working capital, we did see significant growth during 2021, most of which is associated with the value growth in our steel products and in the increased volume and product pricing growth in our fabrications business. Sinton, at the end of the year, had about $150 million of working capital and we would expect to see that grow by probably end of the year $50 million during 2022. So in the first half of the year, there's still some structural growth attached to that. But otherwise, as we see product pricing fees and we see the strength in volume, so we would expect to see valuations come down, which should have a pretty significant working capital release during the entirety of the year. You might not see as much of it in the first half, but definitely in the second half of the year. I would add -- and Andreas, I know you know this. As it relates to wages where a lot of people are seeing a really significant increase because we have so much of our compensation across the entire team that's performance-based, and it naturally fluctuates. So, we're not seeing the same pressure from a wage perspective because there's so much of the performance bonus compensation that's structurally in place. So I think Mark said, it perfectly that we're not seeing a lot of pressure with items that are passed through to the customer. Yes. The contract business, David, in the fourth quarter was at 80% to 85%, and it's likely to stay in that range at least through the first half of the year, as we're servicing our contract customers. And then, as Sinton comes online more strongly in the second half of the year, that's naturally going to decline to a certain degree, just because of the shift in mix. But we're expecting that to be maintained. As it relates to the lag, it's really about, on average, a two-month lag on the flat roll pricing, and it's generally tied to the CRU index. Yes. Correct. Well, it is simply that we went through the extensive study that we do every year, and that generally takes place in the November time frame. So we proved additional projects and those projects, as kind of attested to by our return on invested capital metrics, are really efficiency and growth-oriented, but they're just smaller in nature. So there's nothing individually to call out for the reasons we increase. They're just some really nice projects came to light. You're welcome. I apologize. I'm smiling because I did miss that. The hot mill and P&O shipments for the fourth quarter were 693,000 tons. Cold rolled was 136,000 tons. And finally, the coated products were 994,000 tons. So Timna, the visibility that we have isn't predicated upon falling steel prices. Its predicated upon the forward pricing that we know we have in the order book for steel joist index. The team has done a really good job of managing the steel raw material inputs. So that's why we have more certainty. I would not say this is a new normal, no. This is an extraordinary time for them. But to Mark's point, we're gaining market share as well as the team has been doing some really interesting things on the operational side. We've added ship. Unique thing about our fabrication business is we can really achieve whatever volume demand will allow us to have just by adding people rather than adding assets, which is a very powerful tool. As we add volume, it really drops the bottom-line. And so that's why, again, we feel really confident about 2022 for the fabrication, but it shouldn't be our expectation that this is something that is the new normal. So, I think we mentioned it on the last quarter conference call as well as there is definitely the emphasis from the Board and from the senior leadership team to increase the dividend when we have through-cycle cash earnings that are increasing. And so that definitely is Sinton. We generally have our increases in the first quarter. I can't tell you what that will look like. I would expect to see it sometime in the first half of the year. But again, that's a Board decision to make. They're very supportive of this substantial increase. We have a target of a net income payout ratio of at least 35%. So, that's something that we'll take into consideration as we look at the through-cycle earnings for Sinton and what that dividend increase will look like. But in the meantime, we're using the share buyback program as a complement. That's something that we believe is very powerful for shareholder insurance as well."

And now I'm pleased to turn over the call to Mark.\nOperator: This is the operator. Mark, are you still with us?\nMark Millett: I’m sorry. Let me repeat. I was on mute. They were keeping me quiet, but no, seriously. Good morning, everybody. Welcome to our third quarter '21 earnings call. We appreciate your time today. And as I was saying, the entire Steel Dynamics team delivered another exceptional financial and operating performance, including record sales, operating income, cash flow and adjusted EBITDA. Aided by the market tailwind, it was a tremendous accomplishment, driven by the commitment and passion of our teams executing on our long-term strategies that continue to drive higher through cycle earnings. The team is truly delivering exceptional results and I'm proud to be among them. Due to the steadfast commitment of our teams to one another, our families and our customers, we continue to operate safely amidst COVID. The health and welfare of our teams is paramount, and I thank each of them for being their brothers and sisters’ keeper. Record financial results are no important if our teams do not remain safe. Our safety performance continues to be significantly better than industry averages, but our intent will always be to have zero incidents. Since our founding over 25 years ago, Steel Dynamics has been intentional in managing our resources sustainably for the benefit of our teams, communities and our environment. We are steel industry leader in sustainability, operating exclusively with electric arc furnace technology with a differentiated circular manufacturing business model. As our journey continues, we are committed to the reduction of our climate footprint, including a practical and achievable goal for our steel mills to be carbon neutral by 2050. We're starting from a position of strength, yet plan to do more. We're competitively positioned and focused towards generating long-term sustainable growth for our stakeholders. But before I continue, Theresa will share some insights into our recent performance. Theresa?\nTheresa Wagler: Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to add my sincere appreciation and congratulations to the team. We continue to achieve new milestones throughout the business, attaining record third quarter performance with record revenues of $5.1 billion derived from strong product pricing and volumes across all of our operating platforms. Record quarterly operating income of $1.3 billion and net income of $991 million or $4.85 per diluted share and record cash flow from operations of $631 million and adjusted EBITDA of over $1.4 billion, a truly extraordinary performance. Our third quarter 2021 results included costs of $30 million or $0.11 per diluted share associated with the continued construction of our Sinton, Texas flat rolled steel mill. Excluding these costs, third quarter 2021 adjusted net income was $1 billion or $4.96 per diluted share, above our guidance due to stronger than forecast September steel and fabrication earnings. Our third quarter 2021 revenues of $5.1 billion were 14% higher than sequential record second quarter results with improvements in all of our operating platforms, but most significantly from our steel operations based on increased flat rolled steel selling values and strong shipments. Our third quarter 2021 operating income of $1.3 billion was 38% higher than second quarter results, also driven by increased flat rolled steel pricing and continued strong demand, more than offsetting increased raw material ferrous scrap costs. As we discuss our business this morning, we continue to see positive industry fundamentals for the fourth quarter and 2022 and we are focused toward our continued transformational steel growth initiatives. Our steel operations generated record operating income of $1.4 billion in the third quarter, 33% greater than second quarter sequential earnings as flat rolled steel selling values strengthened and our lagging contract business represented over 80% of our flat roll volume in the quarter. We also saw expanded margins throughout our long product steel operations due to improved pricing. We achieved strong quarterly steel shipments of 2.8 million tons, with our steel mills operating at 93% of their capability. We have additional volume opportunity based on our existing annual steel shipping capacity of over 13 million tons. And when our new Texas steel mill is fully online, we will have over 16 million tons available. Our mills recycling business had operating income in the quarter of $47 million, aligned with strong second quarter performance as higher average pricing resulted in improved ferrous margins. The team continues to effectively lever the strength of our circular manufacturing operating model, benefiting both our steel and metals recycling operations by providing higher quality scrap, which improves furnace efficiency and reducing company-wide working capital requirements. Our steel fabrication operations once again achieved record shipments and significantly expanded margins in the quarter as realized selling values more than offset continued higher steel input costs. Operating income was a record $89 million, more than triple our second quarter earnings of $28 million. Steel joist and deck demand remains very strong as evidenced by continued robust order activity, resulting in another record order backlog at the end of the quarter. Based on our backlog and customer sentiment, we expect steel fabrication earnings to continue to increase even further in the fourth quarter and into 2022. Our cash generation continues to be strong based on our differentiated business model and highly variable cost structure. At the end of the third quarter, we had liquidity of $2.3 billion. During the third quarter of 2021, we generated record cash flow from operations of $631 million and $1.5 billion during the first nine months of the year, also a record. Working capital has grown $1.2 billion in the first nine months of 2021 due to higher selling values, resulting in increased customer account and inventory values. During the first nine months of 2021, we have invested $802 million in capital investments, of which $666 million was invested in our new Texas flat rolled steel mill. For the fourth quarter, we estimate capital investments will be roughly $220 million. Based on early forecast, capital investments for the full year 2022 could be in the range of $700 million inclusive of a significant portion of investment for the four new flat rolled coating lines to be placed in Sinton and Heartland. Regarding shareholder distributions, we maintained our quarterly cash dividend at $0.26 per common share after increasing at 4% in the first quarter of this year. We also repurchased $338 million of our common stock, representing 3% of our outstanding shares. Since 2016, we've increased our cash dividend per share over 85% and we've repurchased almost $2 billion of our common stock, representing 21% of our outstanding shares. While during the same timeframe, we achieved an investment-grade credit rating and maintained our growth company profile by investing over $3 billion in organic capital investments and funding $720 million in acquisitions. These actions reflect the strength of our capital foundation and consistently strong cash flow generation capability and the continued optimism and confidence in our future. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes strategic growth with shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that's complemented with a variable share repurchase program, while also dedicated to preserving our investment grade credit rating. We are squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable optimized long term value creation. Sustainability is a part of our long term value creation strategy, and we are dedicated to our people, our communities and our environment. We are committed to operating our business with the highest integrity. Further committing to this path, we recently announced greenhouse gas reduction and renewable energy goals, including a goal for our steel mills to be carbon neutral by 2050. To increase transparency and accountability, we have also set interim milestones for 2025 and 2030. We have led the steel industry with our exclusive use of electric arc furnace steelmaking technology, our circular manufacturing model and innovative solutions to increase its efficiency, reduce raw material usage, reuse secondary materials and promote material conservation and recycling. We plan to sustain our leadership position by executing our climate goals through, among other avenues, implementing emission reduction projects, improving energy management, increasing the use of renewable energy and developing and supporting new innovative technologies. We have an actionable plan that is more manageable and we believe considerably less expensive than what may lay ahead for our traditional blast furnace industry peers. Our sustainability and climate strategy is an ongoing journey and we're moving forward with the intention to make a positive difference. We plan to continue to address these matters and to play a leadership role moving forward. And for those of you that track more individually our flat rolled shipments, for the third quarter of 2021, we had hot rolled coil and P&O shipments of 676,000 tons, cold rolled shipments of 145,000 tons and finally, coated shipments of 1,037,000 tons. Mark?\nMark Millett: Thank you, Theresa. Well, the steel fabrication platform delivered a tremendous performance, achieving another quarter of record shipments and more than tripling sequential operating income. Based on the strength of steel joist and deck demand, increased product pricing is more than offsetting the continued rise in steel input costs. Quoting and order activity remains extremely strong, resulting in another record order backlog at levels considerably higher than historical peaks. The nonresidential construction market is strong, especially in areas that support online retail, computing activities and pharmaceuticals, specifically represented by construction of distribution and warehouse facilities. We believe this will continue for the foreseeable future due to permanent changes in consumer behavior. Our metals recycling operations had a strong quarter with sequentially higher ferrous metal margins somewhat offsetting marginally lower volume. As we suggested on our second quarter call, prices moderated in August and September after rising throughout the first half of the year. Export prices may support pricing near term but auto recovery will ease prime scrap pressure and compress prime obsolete spreads to more normal levels in the near future, I do believe. The steel team had another outstanding quarter, achieving record operating income of $1.4 billion. During the third quarter, the domestic steel industry operated at a production utilization rate of 85% while our steel mills operated at 93% due to our product diversification, high proportion of value added mix and supply chain differentiation. From a steel end market perspective, the automotive sector is operating at production rates lower than normalized levels due to the continued electronic chip shortage. Fortunately, our specific auto model awards have not been materially affected and we have not yet experienced any significant impact to orders related to the chip shortage. The longer term outlook for the auto industry is positive. Automotive build rate forecast for '22 and '23 continued to be solid at over 15 million and 17 million units respectively. Vehicle inventories continue to be at historically low levels, approximately 70% below the five year average and at the lowest level in over 35 years. The nonresidential construction sector remains strong as evidenced by the strength of shipments and order backlogs at our Structural and Rail and steel fabrication businesses. We expect this strength to continue well into next year. Residential construction has also been strong, resulting in high demand for HVAC, for appliances and other related products. We're also seeing healthy demand from mining on yellow goods customers and our Engineered Bar Products Division. And as oil and gas prices increased, we are seeing improved energy sector demand. These positive market dynamics are driving strong steel demand across the platform. The steady demand, coupled with continued historically low absolute inventory levels throughout the supply chain, continue to support strong steel selling values, especially within the flat rolled steel market. We also believe current legislative steel trade policies, including the Section 201 flat roll cases launched in 2015 and 2016 with the subsequent circumvention restrictions will continue to keep steel imports at moderated levels. The current US administration has also committed constructively concerning trade parameters and the issues created by China's steel making overcapacity. Regarding the ongoing negotiations between the US and the EU on revoking 232 tariffs, we expect the final agreement will include a steel quota mechanism to protect US national security goals and eliminate import surge risks. Aside from Turkey, Europe has not been a significant steel input source. We strongly believe that collaborating with our European allies against the real perpetrators of global overcapacity in the steel industry, represented by China and other Asian export based economies, is the most effective path to free trade. Steel Dynamics is a dynamic growth company, increasing through cycle earnings and cash flow to support continuous value creation. The most significant growth initiative to date is at the cusp of unleashing transformational change for us and our customers. It's our new Texas electric arc furnace steel mill starting production before the end of this year. The excitement generated by this project from our teams and customers continues to grow. This investment represents competitively advantaged strategic growth for Steel Dynamics and our teams with associated long term value creation for all our stakeholders. This growth initiative represents lower carbon emitting next generation electric arc furnace steel production capability, providing differentiated products and supply chain solutions for existing and for new customers. 3 million ton state of the art facility is designed to have product capabilities beyond that of any existing electric arc furnace flat rolled steel producer, competing even more effectively with higher carbon emitting integrated steel facilities and high carbon foreign competition. It provides us with a more diverse steel product portfolio and [benefits] our customers with an even broader climate conscious supply option. The team shipped their first painted coils in September. We anticipate shipping galvanized products early in November and commencing hot-rolled coil production before the end of the year. The Sinton team is doing a terrific job. It is truly a transformational project and we are on the verge of seeing the significant benefits it will bring to our company, our teams, our customers and our other stakeholders. Vitana Sinton provides a strategic location near Corpus Christi with underserved regional commercial markets representing over 27 million tons of relevant flat rolled steel consumption in the US and Mexico. Our customers are excited to have freight advantaged regional flat roll supplier. We have six customers committed to locate on site, representing 1.8 million tons of annual processing and consumption capability, five of these customers have already broken ground. Based on this geographic location, we can offer shorter delivery lead times, providing a superior customer supply chain solution. We will also effectively compete with steel imports arriving in Houston and the West Coast, benefiting consumers in these areas with lower logistics costs while removing the ocean transit price, quality and delivery risks. We've also made considerable progress concerning our raw material procurement strategy for Sinton. We completed the acquisition of a Mexican metals recycling company in August 2020, a critical step. The recycling operations are strategically located near high-volume industrial scrap sources throughout Central and Northern Mexico. We also recently acquired three strategic recycling locations in the Houston and Corpus Christi area, further supporting raw material supply for Sinton. Our performance-based operating culture, coupled with a considerable experience in successfully constructing and operating highly profitable steel assets, positions us incredibly well to successfully execute this transformational growth. As I've said before, we're not simply adding flat rolled steel production capacity. We have a differentiated product offering, a unique regional supply chain solution, a significant geographic freight and lead time advantage and offer sustainable alternative to imports in a region in need of options. We also plan to construct four additional value-added flat-rolled coating lines, comprised of two new paint lines and two new galvanizing lines with Galvalume coating capability. Our unique value-added coating supply chain strategy has resulted in our existing lines consistently running at or near full capacity. Our existing customers are anxiously awaiting the volume from these new lines. The galvanizing line and prepaint line will be located on site to benefit our new Sinton steel mill, while the other two lines will be placed at our Heartland Flat Roll division located in Terrault, Indiana. Each site will thus increase coating capacity by 540,000 tons to further support our regional flat-rolled steel operations, providing them with more value-added product diversification to serve our customers' needs. We expect these lines will begin operating in mid-2023. New Process steel has been a significant customer for these value-added products. In fact, they have grown to be our single largest flat-rolled steel customer in recent years. And importantly, the majority of their business relates to high-margin coated flat-rolled products, which are further manufactured for HVAC, appliance store and automotive applications. Our plans to purchase a 45% minority interest in new process provides us security and supply in these OEM customers. More importantly, the partnership provides Steel Dynamics more exposure to nonautomotive value-added manufacturing in Mexico, a key strategic objective to develop additional downstream pull-through volume, which will help support our new Sinton steel mill. As the majority owner and operator, New Process' CEO, Richard and his management team, will continue to control day-to-day operations, including all decisions concerning steel purchases and product sales. In closing, our culture and the execution of our long-term growth strategy continues to strengthen our financial position through strong cash flow generation, demonstrating our sustainability and differentiating us from our competition. We are a growth company. The team will continue to identify and execute high-return, organic and transactional growth opportunities while providing attractive shareholder returns. Our people and the spirit of excellence provide the foundation for our success and I thank each of you for your passion and dedication to each other, our customers and our communities. And to our teams, remember that your health and safety are the most important issue at hand, and thank you for the exceptional job you do. So everyone, thank you for joining us today. And Kate, will you please open the line for questions?\nOperator: Certainly. Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Sathish Kasinathan at Deutsche Bank. Your line is live.\nSathish Kasinathan: Yes. Hi. Good morning, Mark and Theresa. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question is on growth strategy. In the last call, you mentioned that you don't see any Sinton type greenfield projects on your horizon. Since then, we have seen a couple of new greenfield projects announced by your peers, a few more acquisitions on the raw material side. So just curious on what's your latest thinking regarding organic growth and M&A?\nTheresa Wagler: Yes. So Satish, I'm not sure that our strategy has necessarily changed because of recent announcements from competitors, I would say that. We're very focused on high-margin organic investments where we can be differentiated through value add or a supply chain or both solution. And so that's what the four coating lines provide from the flat roll side of the business. From an acquisition perspective, we're still very focused and we believe there's a lot of options available now and likely into next year as it relates to both mainly high-end manufacturing businesses that help us with our pull-through volume for our steel mills as well as there might possibly be some tuck-in scrap acquisitions as it relates to building out areas around our steel mills from a strategic perspective and the geographic supply of scrap as well as potentially their steel assets as well, but we're very busy from a growth perspective. Mark, do you have anything to add?\nMark Millett: Not really. I think that our strategic path as demonstrated over the years and continues to demonstrate that we always grow in a differentiated way. And so the new projects that are coming online, the changes in the scrap market don't change that outlook.\nSathish Kasinathan: Okay. Yes, thanks for the additional color. And my second question is on Sinton. Can you talk about the ramp-up profile in detail? It seems you have trimmed your volume guidance for 2022 by 200,000 tons. When do you expect Sinton to achieve full run rate? Thank you.\nTheresa Wagler: Yes. We did, Sathish, based on the delay in the start-up, which Mark can talk about, they're still doing incredibly well given the circumstances. But we decided that we would probably pull back our estimate from 2.2 million to 2.4 million tons next year to the 2 million to 2.2 million tons. So it's not a huge reduction, but it's a reduction taking into consideration the ramp will start a little bit later in 2021 than we expected. But Mark, maybe you can give some details on when Sinton will be fully operational.\nMark Millett: Yes, the actual trajectory of the ramp remains unchanged. It's just the starting point has been delayed a little bit. I would emphasize and echo Theresa, the team continues to do an absolutely phenomenal job in bringing such a huge scale project online. We have had a couple of issues just recently that has delayed it into late November, early December. We have a crane delivery issue that slipped just literally last week by a couple of weeks. The recent COVID wave in Texas impacted the number of contractors available on site each day. And to be honest, as areas have opened up just recently on the electrical side, we've had a tough time getting night shift electricians on board to complete it in mid-November. So it has slid here another two or three weeks. We're still confident for an end of year start-up. The paint line has been running, running quality product that shipped coil in September. We expect the galvanizing line to -- it's up going through final commissioning, and should be shipping coils here early November.\nTheresa Wagler: And Sathish, to answer your last question, we would expect that they would be at a full run rate likely by midyear 2022.\nSathish Kasinathan: Okay, great. Thank you.\nTheresa Wagler: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, everyone. Our next question today is coming from Martin Englert at Seaport Research Partners. Your line is live.\nMartin Englert: Hi. Good morning, everyone.\nMark Millett: Good morning.\nTheresa Wagler: Good morning.\nMartin Englert: Do you expect the lag in flat-rolled contracts will remain around 80% of your flat order book into 4Q and then moving into next year? And then maybe if you can also touch on the contract dynamics, specifically the potential elimination of discounts on the lagging contracts for next year.\nMark Millett: We'll likely finish the year ahead around a bit on flat roll, around about 80% -- 75%, 80% on the contract side. As Sinton picks up steam next year that would probably slide to around about 70% of the flat roll base. Relative to sort of terms of contracts, obviously, those are discussions that are ongoing. We have finalized a few and contract terms are somewhat advantaged over previous past periods. Principally on the range, the volume ranges are contracting, so that we have a greater control of the order book as the market fluctuates.\nMartin Englert: Okay. Thanks for that color there. And some of this you touched on in your prepared remarks, but can you kind of discuss your metallic strategy, if that's changing heading into next year, specifically, there's three flat-rolled EAF mills that are ramping capacity near-term, all of which are going to require prime scrap and/or substitutes. And do you feel that there is ample North American supply of primes or will more imports of substitutes be required or some other strategy?\nMark Millett: Well, I've been in the business for 40 years now. And every year, people are worried about whether you can get scrap next year as the EAF industry is continue to grow. And today, the EAF industry is around about 70%, growing to 75% or thereabouts. I do believe some of the recent alternative iron units, almost 1.8 million tons or whatever from Cleveland-Cliffs certainly helps. And I would imagine that over time, we'll see more investment in those products going forward. I think you're also going to see a reduction of prime scrap required by the electric arc furnace community. We've been very successful over the last – well, since last March, reducing our prime scrap, our busheling and bundle requirements from 60% of the mix down to 40% of the mix through better processing at our scrap facilities. So that will certainly ease the - any volume demand there. So we think it will grow or the scrap volume, which is grow in lockstep with increased capacity. It may take a few more dollars to draw out the obsolete grades, that's historically been very elastic. And as you saw recently with the higher pricing, obsolete grades flowed very, very well.\nMartin Englert: What specifically changed with your scrap processing that dropped it from 60% to 40% of primes?\nMark Millett: Well, I'd be giving away trade secrets, if I told you the detail there, but obviously, just better separating techniques.\nMartin Englert: Okay, appreciate the color there. And congratulations on the results and the positive outlook.\nMark Millett: Super, thank you very much. Team did a great job.\nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Emily Chieng at Goldman Sachs.\nEmily Chieng: My first question is around capital allocation. I believe in the past, you've mentioned that you'd be looking at increasing the dividend once Sinton comes online. Can you perhaps give us a sense of the magnitude of that bump and perhaps when we should be expecting that to take place?\nTheresa Wagler: Well, from a magnitude perspective, that's difficult, Emma, and I appreciate the question, but that's a board decision. I would tell you, if you looked at history, when we've had transformational growth that we believed provided sustainable through-cycle cash flow increase, such as when we purchased the Columbus Flat Roll division and we were finished transforming that early in the kind of 2016 time frame, you would have seen several 20% increases in our dividend profile at that point in time. I don't think that that is unreasonable at all. As far as the timing, I would fully expect to see something happen in the early part of 2022. But again, that's a board decision and so I guess more to come on that.\nEmily Chieng: And then a follow-up just around sort of the acquisition there. Can you perhaps talk around the rationale around the acquisition of 45% minority ownership of New Process steel rather than perhaps a full 100% ownership there? I'll leave it at that.\nMark Millett: Again, as we mentioned, New Process has grown to be our largest customer. It has a particular concentration of value-add prepaint to OEM customers and we wanted to ensure security in that supply chain going forward. But as importantly, if not more importantly, they have a strong focus on downstream manufacturing, particularly in Mexico. And that is aligned with our strategic desires and objectives to increase pull-through volume. And so that would add support to our Sinton facility.\nTheresa Wagler: The minority position really, Emma, allows that management team and Richard Fant to continue to run the business, basically unchanged. And that's something that was attractive to us at this point in time.\nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Michael Glick at JPMorgan.\nMichael Glick: Costs are obviously top of mind for the market right now. You've already hit on scrap. But could you talk a bit about what you're seeing on the cost side outside of scrap, including energy and raw materials and any supply chain issues you're monitoring or working to mitigate?\nMark Millett: Well, I think the energy pricing here has risen to some degree. But again, natural gas cost is a very, very small percentage of our overall cost structure. On the raw material side, probably ferrosilicon is the only item that we're actually watching and taking steps to ensure a secure supply there.\nTheresa Wagler: Actually, throughout the supply chain, especially on the steel side but in the other operating platforms as well with the supply disruptions that everyone is experiencing across any industry at this point in time, whether it relates to logistics or just lack of supply chain stability, we actually have been doing a very deep dive into looking at the relationships we have with suppliers and to have redundancy in suppliers, et cetera. That's something that we do regularly but we're refocused on it as well. And at this point in time, we feel very good about, I'll call them, consumables, the supply of consumables. Obviously, natural gas is very highly priced and going into the winter months, I think a lot of people are expecting that natural gas might continue to rise. Obviously, it is in rest of the world but possibly in the US as well. But that means that, as Mark mentioned, being 100% electric arc furnace is only a couple of percentages of our cost profile. So we're feeling pretty good heading into 2022 at this point.\nMichael Glick: And then on the fabrication business, I mean, you talked about the record backlog and pricing. But curious what sort of order of magnitude you're seeing in pricing versus what you posted this quarter just given the lead times associated with that business. And really just trying to get a handle on the staying power of the earnings in that segment.\nMark Millett: Well, I guess the stain power or the health of that industry is, in my mind, phenomenal. Number one, as said in my earlier remarks, there certainly has been a permanent change in consumer sort of mindset. And so the online retail purchasing is just driving massive distribution warehouse type construction, cloud computing activity likewise. And we're seeing projects and honestly being pushed out 10 months. Our backlog is even longer than 10 months. And you might say people are concerned about the labor shortage and those sorts of things, but in a strange way, that's actually helping extend this whole economic cycle and pushing those projects out. So we are very, very, very bullish in that arena for 2022.\nTheresa Wagler: You asked the question about how much further pricing could move. So we can't give you specifics but it's a meaningful increase, because as they have the backlog that Mark mentioned that's almost a year out, you already have that product pricing substantiated. And so that's why in my opening remarks people may not have picked it up, but I may mention the fact that we do expect to have increased fabrication earnings in the fourth quarter as well as into 2022 and that's based off of the record comparison of the third quarter. So there's substantial earnings uplift that we're expecting from the steel fabrication segment.\nMark Millett: And I would just add -- I think I saw one comment this morning, but maybe there was a change in tone of our press release. I would just want to emphasize that we're as bullish, if not more bullish for the fourth quarter and going into next year as we ever have been.\nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Carlos De Alba at Morgan Stanley.\nCarlos De Alba: So I wonder if you could comment or elaborate a little bit more on your growth strategy. And how would you either rank or prioritize potentially investments in additional capacity above and beyond potentially further investments are sized the quarter lines that you have already announced and the scrap processors and locations that you have acquired recently. Is it another greenfield, something that you would prioritize over more targeted acquisitions and/or further downstream investments?\nMark Millett: We had a tough time understanding the whole question there. So if I don't answer it, just come back and hit me again. But on the recycling side, I think you were suggesting or asking whether or not we have major plans in transactions or growing that business. I would say, again, we've said this in the past, we're not interested in growing our recycling platform for the sake of just growth. We will continue to identify regional assets that complement our steel mills, such as we did in the Southwest about purchasing those three yards and then also the Zimmer acquisition in Mexico. But there's not a wholesale change in our recycling strategy whatsoever. We will continue…\nCarlos De Alba: And what about further investments after Sinton including steel capacity?\nTheresa Wagler: So what Carlos is asking is after Sinton is complete and after we have the four value-added lines that are processing, what greenfield might come after that?\nMark Millett: Well, I do believe we will continue to focus on value-add opportunities downstream, more so in processing. The greenfield project of Sinton was a very unique opportunity, at least in my eyes. It was a combination of differentiating ourselves relative to product, bringing new supply chain solutions to our customer base and having a very, very unique sort of geographic location to serve those customers. We wouldn't build another greenfield facility unless it had truly differentiating characteristics. And it's difficult to see that, that will avail itself in the US today. And then the other sort of strategic path we've continued to chase is downstream sort of fabrication, manufacturing and we would be looking to do that both in the U.S. and in Mexico.\nCarlos De Alba: And Theresa, if I may ask you, how do you see working capital in the fourth quarter? Clearly, prices are still very high, raw materials are increasing your [forecast] for the fourth quarter for another record result. So is it fair to assume mostly higher working capital levels. But do you have a sense of the magnitude of how much cash that would consume in the last quarter of the year?\nTheresa Wagler: There's a few things happening at the same time in the fourth quarter. So we will have higher average steel selling values simply because of the carryover in the lagging contract business that we mentioned from the Flat Roll Group. And in addition to that, we'll be ramping up Sinton. And so we'll be putting additional working capital both through steel substrate and through scrap on the ground as they begin to produce. So I would expect to see a continued use of cash in working capital. I don't expect it to be close to the same magnitude that we saw in the third quarter. We also in the third quarter had some building at Sinton as well. So I would expect maybe a couple of hundred million dollar build but nothing beyond that. Again, it's a very difficult thing to monitor when prices continue to rise but I think that's probably a good estimate at this point.\nOperator: Our next question today is coming from David Gagliano at BMO.\nDavid Gagliano: I just have actually a few numbers related questions. I think in the Q&A last quarter, you indicated preliminary 2022 CapEx of $550 million to $600 million. And I thought I heard you say on this call earlier that you ex CapEx to be $750 million for 2022. And I also noticed that the rolling mill start-up looks like it's been pushed out to 2023 versus what I thought was mid-2022 previously. So my first questions are A, what is the driver for the higher 2022 CapEx, if that's correct and B, what is the driver for pushing the rolling mill start-ups to mid-2023 versus 2022 previously?\nTheresa Wagler: So to address your last question first, if you're speaking about the rolling mill, David, are you talking about the Sinton rolling mill?\nDavid Gagliano: I thought effectively, there was commentary back in April, I think it was. And then again, in the last quarter that that just in general, the four rolling mills would be starting up by mid-2022. Perhaps I got that wrong.\nTheresa Wagler: The value-added lines, no. So the value-add lines we had hoped to be in the second half of 2022. But given the engineering of the lines and just the delivery of equipment at this point in time, it's pushing us back to now, we think those lines will be operational in the first half of 2023. So you're correct, that is a change but that has to do with the engineering and the equipment delivery time line. As it relates to capital spending for 2022, you're correct. On the last quarter call, we would have given something closer to the $600 million range, but that's prior to us doing the deep dive that we do every fall into capital projects. And as you'll remember, there's so much of all of our team members' compensation at risk to performance and high return investments, they always put together to wish list of very good investment opportunities that would result in higher compensation for them if they have high returns. So we went through that process. And at this point in time, that's added probably about $100 million to the capital that we expect to spend next year and that would be projects that we believe will have a very good return profile to it. Some of them will start next year. Some of them will just have the money spent and then kind of roll into 2023. But there's no one significant project that's adding to that. Most of that $700 million is actually tied to the four value-added flat roll lines.\nDavid Gagliano: The four value-added flat roll lines that were pushed to 2023, and I apologize I called rolling mill, I apologize. You're right. Before value-add flat-rolled lines that were pushed, I think to 2023, but then there's other projects in there that raised the total from $550 million to $600 million to $750 million. So $150 million to $200 million higher versus last quarter on some other projects. Is that right?\nTheresa Wagler: So they're high return projects and there are spreads throughout fabrication, the steel mills, we're adding some inspection lines likely down at our SBQ facility. So there's just a lot of individual projects like that, David, that aren't significant individually. But as they added together, it's a higher number.\nDavid Gagliano: And then just one other one for me. Operationally, shipments overall were down 5% in the third quarter. Obviously, production was great. Shipments were down 5% in the third quarter on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Can you just talk about what was the main driver for the quarter-over-quarter decline? And what's a reasonable assumption for shipments in terms of quarter-over-quarter change in the typically seasonally weak fourth quarter?\nMark Millett: I don't think we typically will project future shipments. But you're right, shipments in the third quarter were off a little. We build inventory and principally as amount of transportation, just getting rail and trucks to move that material. We would expect, for sure, though, to move that in the fourth quarter.\nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Curt Woodworth at Credit Suisse.\nCurt Woodworth: Mark, I wanted to get your thoughts on some of the different demand verticals. Obviously, we're hearing a lot of issues with respect to the supply chain chip shortages in auto, very long lead times in appliance, HVAC. And you kind of made the point that you felt the labor shortages, to some degree, we're actually bullish for fabrication just because it's kind of elongating maybe the pace at which these projects are going to get completed. So the market, it seems like it softened a little bit here with lead times coming in. There could be some seasonality. So I was just wondering if you could maybe briefly walk us through what you're seeing on some of your key demand verticals.\nMark Millett: And again, we are bullish, especially, we're not bullish across all our sectors. As you said and as I said, construction, that cycle has been extended, I do believe, incredibly healthy. And in part because those projects are just getting pushed out because of a shortage of labor and with the contractors and the builders I talked to across the country that they're all experiencing the same thing and they're all seeing long-term strength. So that's on the nonres construction side, we think it's very, very, very strong. In a way, in the automotive arena, you've seen a similar thing except it's the chip shortage that is slowing things down and we'll, in my humble opinion, extend that cycle dramatically. COVID itself cost us about 4.5 million units, and that has to get caught up. The pent-up demand out there, if you listen to the dealers is absolutely phenomenal. I was just -- to one deal last week, typically would have 1,600 vehicles in inventory right now, and you can only manage to get 100. And that experience is being shared with other dealers across the country. And the desire, the pent-up demand is absolutely there. And so that will maintain strength in the automotive arena. And in my humble opinion, when the chip shortage relieves itself, all they're going to do is just ramp up and maximize the output for the next couple of years because there's that much demand out there in my mind. And then across other areas, residential was strong, HVAC appliance is strong. We're seeing a little more strength in the energy sector, more downhole kind of with the drilling rig as opposed to distribution pipe, that's still soft and it'll be soft for another year probably. Yellow goods is pretty strong. And just Engineering Bar, in general. Their customer base is expecting a 20% increase year-over-year. So that tends to give us some positive support too. So it's just generally a very, very, very strong demand scenario.\nCurt Woodworth: And then a quick follow-up. With respect to the buyback, when you look at the free cash flow profile and the balance sheet, I mean, you have very significant capability to continue to buy back stock here and your stock, at least on my numbers trading at the cheapest level I think it's ever traded. So just curious to kind of get your thoughts on maybe how you see the buyback going forward, will be opportunistic or more steady? And I'll leave it there.\nTheresa Wagler: Yes, we feel very good about the capital structure and the foundation that the teams have been able to put into place. And so you've seen us be, we think, very active with the buyback program in the second quarter with very similar activity in the third quarter. I think one should expect to see us continue to have a very steady pace unless we were to come up onto a time frame where we believe that there might be a better use for those funds through strategic growth of either organic or inorganic opportunities. So at this point in time, we believe we will be very active in the buyback program.\nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Andreas Bokkenheuser at UBS.\nAndreas Bokkenheuser: Just a quick follow-up on the auto demand. So your auto volumes or steel volumes are pretty solid. Obviously, chip shortage is weighing on production. There's been some talk about the EAFs in the US capturing market share from [integrated]. Is that partly what's happening here? Are you seeing yourself capturing auto steel market share here from the integrators at this point in time?\nMark Millett: Well, we've over the last couple of years, have steadily grown market share, particularly out of our Columbus facility. Butler has always been around 28%, 30% automotive. Columbus, when we purchased it in 2015, had just incremental amount and that's grown to probably 300,000, 400,000 tons today. And I think we've got some unique products that bring value to the automotive supply chain. But probably as importantly today is the sustainability story, particularly with the European auto maintenance. We've had a lot of traction with BMW, with VW, with Mercedes, in particular. And they view our sustainability model and our carbon footprint as being among the best in the world. And so that has sort of earned considerable business. And we're also benefiting and honestly from the USMCA. That increase in domestic content from 50% to 70% has necessitated those European manufacturers to source internal to the US, and that's driven a lot of our success as well.\nAndreas Bokkenheuser: And maybe as a follow-up, I mean, obviously, the auto contract negotiations going on. I'm not going to ask about pricing, but just in terms of timing. I mean, to what extent are you involved in all of this and when do you usually see these things ramping up?\nMark Millett: Typically or historically, automotive was the purview of the bastion of the integrated mills because they necessitate or mandated sort of an annual fixed price contract scenario. And with the variability in the scrap markets or the volatility of scrap markets, it's something the electric arc furnace producer can stand. But given the volatility in 2015 and 2016 in pricing, the automotive folks saw that they left a lot of money on the table. And so they hedge between integrated and electric-arc-furnace supply chains today. The propensity of the automotive contract negotiations in the fall with the integrated producers not necessarily the electric arc furnace producers.\nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Tristan Gresser at Exane BNP Paribas.\nTristan Gresser: And maybe following up on the previous one, you obviously have near term targets to cut your emissions, carbon emission and some peers in Europe have tied their decarbonization savings to create new commercial offering of low carbon steel products that sell premium with good demand from companies to keep looking to cut their Scope 3 emission. Is that also something you would consider? And do you see a similar market emerging for low carbon steel products in the US?\nMark Millett: Well, you've seen just recently folks pursuing that direction. I would say for SDI to date, we've been the beneficiary of, again, capturing greater market share and haven't necessarily leveraged that to higher pricing as of this moment in time. I would imagine, though, over time, you could see a differentiation there.\nTristan Gresser: And maybe just one question on market conditions and the pricing outlook. You have imports surging in the US, inventories building and of course, this new capacity is going to ramp up. The forward curve in US HRC is around 1,300 by March next year. I think in previous call, you were a bit more probably bullish on the near term. Has anything changed to your view in the supply and demand dynamics at the moment that could warrant this drop in steel prices?\nMark Millett: Well, there's absolutely no doubt that demand is there. I wouldn't necessarily characterize the imports as surging necessarily. Certainly, Galvalume, prepaint Galvalume is very, very strong, I'll give you that. But today, we saw some offers from Vietnam for April, May delivery. So the way, way, way out at around $1,500. So I would imagine pricing will turn over to some degree or I use the word erode, but it's not going to be a massive reduction. The market cynics out there that are suggesting that average pricing for the year is $740 a ton or $750. I just can't see that happening with the demand picture the way it is today.\nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Timna Tanners at Wolfe Research.\nTimna Tanners: I just wanted to follow up on new process. I'll just ask one question with two parts, if I could. New Process is a big -- I guess, a bit of a deviation. It's acquiring one of your customers or at least partly. And I know in the past, there's been some trepidation over that, partly because you kind of compete with your other customers. So I just wanted your thoughts on that. And on the one hand, if you're concerned about the message it sends to other customers. And second, I wanted to ask if this is a new opportunity for Steel Dynamics to continue to move downstream into kind of more of the processing going forward with further capital allocation in that regard?\nMark Millett: Well, I'd want to emphasize that I wouldn't necessarily look at the acquisition as a change in strategy for us. We certainly don't want to get into the service center business per se. We would be probably lousy in the service center business, to be honest. As I said earlier, there are two principal objectives. One, New Process grew to a very large customer in the value-add prepaint sort of supply chain and just wanted to secure that supply chain or that outlet to OEMs way into the future. And then secondly, we were looking for sort of a platform of growth for manufacturing, downstream manufacturing and that aligns -- New Process aligns well with that strategy, particularly in Mexico.\nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Andrew Keches at Barclays.\nAndrew Keches: Just one to put a finer point on the capital allocation priorities here. But Theresa, you've gradually been refinancing the old [Technical Difficulty] bonds and you have one left that's callable here in the fourth quarter. Should we expect that refinancing trend to continue or I guess, considering the outlook for cash flow, is there any consideration to possibly just paying that down to get yourselves to an even stronger balance position going forward?\nTheresa Wagler: So it's a great question. You're right that it's a $400 million tranche and it has, I think, a 5% rate attached to it. The investment grade market has been very supportive of Steel Dynamics and we're very excited to be in that market today. So we are very comfortable, I guess, the first point with the debt structure that we have. We really manage to a through-cycle basis at a leverage of 2 times or less. So obviously, we're much less than that today but we're managing to through cycles. I can't give you specifics because I would get in trouble if I did but there is an opportunity to either repay or refinance and we'll be making that decision here in the near term.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for any closing remarks.\nMark Millett: Well, thank you, Kate. And I just would like to emphasize to everyone on the call, our customers, our service providers and particularly our team, thank you for your support. It was an absolutely phenomenal quarter. We're going to see another one in the fourth quarter and it's only driven by, again, each and every one of you is supporting our company, Steel Dynamics. We will endeavor to continue our growth trajectory going forward and creating even greater shareholder value and well. So thank you, and everyone out there, be safe.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's event. You may disconnect at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Mark Millett",
            "content": "I'm sorry. Let me repeat. I was on mute. They were keeping me quiet, but no, seriously. Good morning, everybody. Welcome to our third quarter '21 earnings call. We appreciate your time today. And as I was saying, the entire Steel Dynamics team delivered another exceptional financial and operating performance, including record sales, operating income, cash flow and adjusted EBITDA. Aided by the market tailwind, it was a tremendous accomplishment, driven by the commitment and passion of our teams executing on our long-term strategies that continue to drive higher through cycle earnings. The team is truly delivering exceptional results and I'm proud to be among them. Due to the steadfast commitment of our teams to one another, our families and our customers, we continue to operate safely amidst COVID. The health and welfare of our teams is paramount, and I thank each of them for being their brothers and sisters' keeper. Record financial results are no important if our teams do not remain safe. Our safety performance continues to be significantly better than industry averages, but our intent will always be to have zero incidents. Since our founding over 25 years ago, Steel Dynamics has been intentional in managing our resources sustainably for the benefit of our teams, communities and our environment. We are steel industry leader in sustainability, operating exclusively with electric arc furnace technology with a differentiated circular manufacturing business model. As our journey continues, we are committed to the reduction of our climate footprint, including a practical and achievable goal for our steel mills to be carbon neutral by 2050. We're starting from a position of strength, yet plan to do more. We're competitively positioned and focused towards generating long-term sustainable growth for our stakeholders. But before I continue, Theresa will share some insights into our recent performance. Theresa? Thank you, Theresa. Well, the steel fabrication platform delivered a tremendous performance, achieving another quarter of record shipments and more than tripling sequential operating income. Based on the strength of steel joist and deck demand, increased product pricing is more than offsetting the continued rise in steel input costs. Quoting and order activity remains extremely strong, resulting in another record order backlog at levels considerably higher than historical peaks. The nonresidential construction market is strong, especially in areas that support online retail, computing activities and pharmaceuticals, specifically represented by construction of distribution and warehouse facilities. We believe this will continue for the foreseeable future due to permanent changes in consumer behavior. Our metals recycling operations had a strong quarter with sequentially higher ferrous metal margins somewhat offsetting marginally lower volume. As we suggested on our second quarter call, prices moderated in August and September after rising throughout the first half of the year. Export prices may support pricing near term but auto recovery will ease prime scrap pressure and compress prime obsolete spreads to more normal levels in the near future, I do believe. The steel team had another outstanding quarter, achieving record operating income of $1.4 billion. During the third quarter, the domestic steel industry operated at a production utilization rate of 85% while our steel mills operated at 93% due to our product diversification, high proportion of value added mix and supply chain differentiation. From a steel end market perspective, the automotive sector is operating at production rates lower than normalized levels due to the continued electronic chip shortage. Fortunately, our specific auto model awards have not been materially affected and we have not yet experienced any significant impact to orders related to the chip shortage. The longer term outlook for the auto industry is positive. Automotive build rate forecast for '22 and '23 continued to be solid at over 15 million and 17 million units respectively. Vehicle inventories continue to be at historically low levels, approximately 70% below the five year average and at the lowest level in over 35 years. The nonresidential construction sector remains strong as evidenced by the strength of shipments and order backlogs at our Structural and Rail and steel fabrication businesses. We expect this strength to continue well into next year. Residential construction has also been strong, resulting in high demand for HVAC, for appliances and other related products. We're also seeing healthy demand from mining on yellow goods customers and our Engineered Bar Products Division. And as oil and gas prices increased, we are seeing improved energy sector demand. These positive market dynamics are driving strong steel demand across the platform. The steady demand, coupled with continued historically low absolute inventory levels throughout the supply chain, continue to support strong steel selling values, especially within the flat rolled steel market. We also believe current legislative steel trade policies, including the Section 201 flat roll cases launched in 2015 and 2016 with the subsequent circumvention restrictions will continue to keep steel imports at moderated levels. The current US administration has also committed constructively concerning trade parameters and the issues created by China's steel making overcapacity. Regarding the ongoing negotiations between the US and the EU on revoking 232 tariffs, we expect the final agreement will include a steel quota mechanism to protect US national security goals and eliminate import surge risks. Aside from Turkey, Europe has not been a significant steel input source. We strongly believe that collaborating with our European allies against the real perpetrators of global overcapacity in the steel industry, represented by China and other Asian export based economies, is the most effective path to free trade. Steel Dynamics is a dynamic growth company, increasing through cycle earnings and cash flow to support continuous value creation. The most significant growth initiative to date is at the cusp of unleashing transformational change for us and our customers. It's our new Texas electric arc furnace steel mill starting production before the end of this year. The excitement generated by this project from our teams and customers continues to grow. This investment represents competitively advantaged strategic growth for Steel Dynamics and our teams with associated long term value creation for all our stakeholders. This growth initiative represents lower carbon emitting next generation electric arc furnace steel production capability, providing differentiated products and supply chain solutions for existing and for new customers. 3 million ton state of the art facility is designed to have product capabilities beyond that of any existing electric arc furnace flat rolled steel producer, competing even more effectively with higher carbon emitting integrated steel facilities and high carbon foreign competition. It provides us with a more diverse steel product portfolio and [benefits] our customers with an even broader climate conscious supply option. The team shipped their first painted coils in September. We anticipate shipping galvanized products early in November and commencing hot-rolled coil production before the end of the year. The Sinton team is doing a terrific job. It is truly a transformational project and we are on the verge of seeing the significant benefits it will bring to our company, our teams, our customers and our other stakeholders. Vitana Sinton provides a strategic location near Corpus Christi with underserved regional commercial markets representing over 27 million tons of relevant flat rolled steel consumption in the US and Mexico. Our customers are excited to have freight advantaged regional flat roll supplier. We have six customers committed to locate on site, representing 1.8 million tons of annual processing and consumption capability, five of these customers have already broken ground. Based on this geographic location, we can offer shorter delivery lead times, providing a superior customer supply chain solution. We will also effectively compete with steel imports arriving in Houston and the West Coast, benefiting consumers in these areas with lower logistics costs while removing the ocean transit price, quality and delivery risks. We've also made considerable progress concerning our raw material procurement strategy for Sinton. We completed the acquisition of a Mexican metals recycling company in August 2020, a critical step. The recycling operations are strategically located near high-volume industrial scrap sources throughout Central and Northern Mexico. We also recently acquired three strategic recycling locations in the Houston and Corpus Christi area, further supporting raw material supply for Sinton. Our performance-based operating culture, coupled with a considerable experience in successfully constructing and operating highly profitable steel assets, positions us incredibly well to successfully execute this transformational growth. As I've said before, we're not simply adding flat rolled steel production capacity. We have a differentiated product offering, a unique regional supply chain solution, a significant geographic freight and lead time advantage and offer sustainable alternative to imports in a region in need of options. We also plan to construct four additional value-added flat-rolled coating lines, comprised of two new paint lines and two new galvanizing lines with Galvalume coating capability. Our unique value-added coating supply chain strategy has resulted in our existing lines consistently running at or near full capacity. Our existing customers are anxiously awaiting the volume from these new lines. The galvanizing line and prepaint line will be located on site to benefit our new Sinton steel mill, while the other two lines will be placed at our Heartland Flat Roll division located in Terrault, Indiana. Each site will thus increase coating capacity by 540,000 tons to further support our regional flat-rolled steel operations, providing them with more value-added product diversification to serve our customers' needs. We expect these lines will begin operating in mid-2023. New Process steel has been a significant customer for these value-added products. In fact, they have grown to be our single largest flat-rolled steel customer in recent years. And importantly, the majority of their business relates to high-margin coated flat-rolled products, which are further manufactured for HVAC, appliance store and automotive applications. Our plans to purchase a 45% minority interest in new process provides us security and supply in these OEM customers. More importantly, the partnership provides Steel Dynamics more exposure to nonautomotive value-added manufacturing in Mexico, a key strategic objective to develop additional downstream pull-through volume, which will help support our new Sinton steel mill. As the majority owner and operator, New Process' CEO, Richard and his management team, will continue to control day-to-day operations, including all decisions concerning steel purchases and product sales. In closing, our culture and the execution of our long-term growth strategy continues to strengthen our financial position through strong cash flow generation, demonstrating our sustainability and differentiating us from our competition. We are a growth company. The team will continue to identify and execute high-return, organic and transactional growth opportunities while providing attractive shareholder returns. Our people and the spirit of excellence provide the foundation for our success and I thank each of you for your passion and dedication to each other, our customers and our communities. And to our teams, remember that your health and safety are the most important issue at hand, and thank you for the exceptional job you do. So everyone, thank you for joining us today. And Kate, will you please open the line for questions? Not really. I think that our strategic path as demonstrated over the years and continues to demonstrate that we always grow in a differentiated way. And so the new projects that are coming online, the changes in the scrap market don't change that outlook. Yes, the actual trajectory of the ramp remains unchanged. It's just the starting point has been delayed a little bit. I would emphasize and echo Theresa, the team continues to do an absolutely phenomenal job in bringing such a huge scale project online. We have had a couple of issues just recently that has delayed it into late November, early December. We have a crane delivery issue that slipped just literally last week by a couple of weeks. The recent COVID wave in Texas impacted the number of contractors available on site each day. And to be honest, as areas have opened up just recently on the electrical side, we've had a tough time getting night shift electricians on board to complete it in mid-November. So it has slid here another two or three weeks. We're still confident for an end of year start-up. The paint line has been running, running quality product that shipped coil in September. We expect the galvanizing line to -- it's up going through final commissioning, and should be shipping coils here early November. Good morning. We'll likely finish the year ahead around a bit on flat roll, around about 80% -- 75%, 80% on the contract side. As Sinton picks up steam next year that would probably slide to around about 70% of the flat roll base. Relative to sort of terms of contracts, obviously, those are discussions that are ongoing. We have finalized a few and contract terms are somewhat advantaged over previous past periods. Principally on the range, the volume ranges are contracting, so that we have a greater control of the order book as the market fluctuates. Well, I've been in the business for 40 years now. And every year, people are worried about whether you can get scrap next year as the EAF industry is continue to grow. And today, the EAF industry is around about 70%, growing to 75% or thereabouts. I do believe some of the recent alternative iron units, almost 1.8 million tons or whatever from Cleveland-Cliffs certainly helps. And I would imagine that over time, we'll see more investment in those products going forward. I think you're also going to see a reduction of prime scrap required by the electric arc furnace community. We've been very successful over the last – well, since last March, reducing our prime scrap, our busheling and bundle requirements from 60% of the mix down to 40% of the mix through better processing at our scrap facilities. So that will certainly ease the - any volume demand there. So we think it will grow or the scrap volume, which is grow in lockstep with increased capacity. It may take a few more dollars to draw out the obsolete grades, that's historically been very elastic. And as you saw recently with the higher pricing, obsolete grades flowed very, very well. Well, I'd be giving away trade secrets, if I told you the detail there, but obviously, just better separating techniques. Super, thank you very much. Team did a great job. Again, as we mentioned, New Process has grown to be our largest customer. It has a particular concentration of value-add prepaint to OEM customers and we wanted to ensure security in that supply chain going forward. But as importantly, if not more importantly, they have a strong focus on downstream manufacturing, particularly in Mexico. And that is aligned with our strategic desires and objectives to increase pull-through volume. And so that would add support to our Sinton facility. Well, I think the energy pricing here has risen to some degree. But again, natural gas cost is a very, very small percentage of our overall cost structure. On the raw material side, probably ferrosilicon is the only item that we're actually watching and taking steps to ensure a secure supply there. Well, I guess the stain power or the health of that industry is, in my mind, phenomenal. Number one, as said in my earlier remarks, there certainly has been a permanent change in consumer sort of mindset. And so the online retail purchasing is just driving massive distribution warehouse type construction, cloud computing activity likewise. And we're seeing projects and honestly being pushed out 10 months. Our backlog is even longer than 10 months. And you might say people are concerned about the labor shortage and those sorts of things, but in a strange way, that's actually helping extend this whole economic cycle and pushing those projects out. So we are very, very, very bullish in that arena for 2022. And I would just add -- I think I saw one comment this morning, but maybe there was a change in tone of our press release. I would just want to emphasize that we're as bullish, if not more bullish for the fourth quarter and going into next year as we ever have been. We had a tough time understanding the whole question there. So if I don't answer it, just come back and hit me again. But on the recycling side, I think you were suggesting or asking whether or not we have major plans in transactions or growing that business. I would say, again, we've said this in the past, we're not interested in growing our recycling platform for the sake of just growth. We will continue to identify regional assets that complement our steel mills, such as we did in the Southwest about purchasing those three yards and then also the Zimmer acquisition in Mexico. But there's not a wholesale change in our recycling strategy whatsoever. We will continue... Well, I do believe we will continue to focus on value-add opportunities downstream, more so in processing. The greenfield project of Sinton was a very unique opportunity, at least in my eyes. It was a combination of differentiating ourselves relative to product, bringing new supply chain solutions to our customer base and having a very, very unique sort of geographic location to serve those customers. We wouldn't build another greenfield facility unless it had truly differentiating characteristics. And it's difficult to see that, that will avail itself in the US today. And then the other sort of strategic path we've continued to chase is downstream sort of fabrication, manufacturing and we would be looking to do that both in the U.S. and in Mexico. I don't think we typically will project future shipments. But you're right, shipments in the third quarter were off a little. We build inventory and principally as amount of transportation, just getting rail and trucks to move that material. We would expect, for sure, though, to move that in the fourth quarter. And again, we are bullish, especially, we're not bullish across all our sectors. As you said and as I said, construction, that cycle has been extended, I do believe, incredibly healthy. And in part because those projects are just getting pushed out because of a shortage of labor and with the contractors and the builders I talked to across the country that they're all experiencing the same thing and they're all seeing long-term strength. So that's on the nonres construction side, we think it's very, very, very strong. In a way, in the automotive arena, you've seen a similar thing except it's the chip shortage that is slowing things down and we'll, in my humble opinion, extend that cycle dramatically. COVID itself cost us about 4.5 million units, and that has to get caught up. The pent-up demand out there, if you listen to the dealers is absolutely phenomenal. I was just -- to one deal last week, typically would have 1,600 vehicles in inventory right now, and you can only manage to get 100. And that experience is being shared with other dealers across the country. And the desire, the pent-up demand is absolutely there. And so that will maintain strength in the automotive arena. And in my humble opinion, when the chip shortage relieves itself, all they're going to do is just ramp up and maximize the output for the next couple of years because there's that much demand out there in my mind. And then across other areas, residential was strong, HVAC appliance is strong. We're seeing a little more strength in the energy sector, more downhole kind of with the drilling rig as opposed to distribution pipe, that's still soft and it'll be soft for another year probably. Yellow goods is pretty strong. And just Engineering Bar, in general. Their customer base is expecting a 20% increase year-over-year. So that tends to give us some positive support too. So it's just generally a very, very, very strong demand scenario. Well, we've over the last couple of years, have steadily grown market share, particularly out of our Columbus facility. Butler has always been around 28%, 30% automotive. Columbus, when we purchased it in 2015, had just incremental amount and that's grown to probably 300,000, 400,000 tons today. And I think we've got some unique products that bring value to the automotive supply chain. But probably as importantly today is the sustainability story, particularly with the European auto maintenance. We've had a lot of traction with BMW, with VW, with Mercedes, in particular. And they view our sustainability model and our carbon footprint as being among the best in the world. And so that has sort of earned considerable business.

            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to add my sincere appreciation and congratulations to the team. We continue to achieve new milestones throughout the business, attaining record third quarter performance with record revenues of $5.1 billion derived from strong product pricing and volumes across all of our operating platforms. Record quarterly operating income of $1.3 billion and net income of $991 million or $4.85 per diluted share and record cash flow from operations of $631 million and adjusted EBITDA of over $1.4 billion, a truly extraordinary performance. Our third quarter 2021 results included costs of $30 million or $0.11 per diluted share associated with the continued construction of our Sinton, Texas flat rolled steel mill. Excluding these costs, third quarter 2021 adjusted net income was $1 billion or $4.96 per diluted share, above our guidance due to stronger than forecast September steel and fabrication earnings. Our third quarter 2021 revenues of $5.1 billion were 14% higher than sequential record second quarter results with improvements in all of our operating platforms, but most significantly from our steel operations based on increased flat rolled steel selling values and strong shipments. Our third quarter 2021 operating income of $1.3 billion was 38% higher than second quarter results, also driven by increased flat rolled steel pricing and continued strong demand, more than offsetting increased raw material ferrous scrap costs. As we discuss our business this morning, we continue to see positive industry fundamentals for the fourth quarter and 2022 and we are focused toward our continued transformational steel growth initiatives. Our steel operations generated record operating income of $1.4 billion in the third quarter, 33% greater than second quarter sequential earnings as flat rolled steel selling values strengthened and our lagging contract business represented over 80% of our flat roll volume in the quarter. We also saw expanded margins throughout our long product steel operations due to improved pricing. We achieved strong quarterly steel shipments of 2.8 million tons, with our steel mills operating at 93% of their capability. We have additional volume opportunity based on our existing annual steel shipping capacity of over 13 million tons. And when our new Texas steel mill is fully online, we will have over 16 million tons available. Our mills recycling business had operating income in the quarter of $47 million, aligned with strong second quarter performance as higher average pricing resulted in improved ferrous margins. The team continues to effectively lever the strength of our circular manufacturing operating model, benefiting both our steel and metals recycling operations by providing higher quality scrap, which improves furnace efficiency and reducing company-wide working capital requirements. Our steel fabrication operations once again achieved record shipments and significantly expanded margins in the quarter as realized selling values more than offset continued higher steel input costs. Operating income was a record $89 million, more than triple our second quarter earnings of $28 million. Steel joist and deck demand remains very strong as evidenced by continued robust order activity, resulting in another record order backlog at the end of the quarter. Based on our backlog and customer sentiment, we expect steel fabrication earnings to continue to increase even further in the fourth quarter and into 2022. Our cash generation continues to be strong based on our differentiated business model and highly variable cost structure. At the end of the third quarter, we had liquidity of $2.3 billion. During the third quarter of 2021, we generated record cash flow from operations of $631 million and $1.5 billion during the first nine months of the year, also a record. Working capital has grown $1.2 billion in the first nine months of 2021 due to higher selling values, resulting in increased customer account and inventory values. During the first nine months of 2021, we have invested $802 million in capital investments, of which $666 million was invested in our new Texas flat rolled steel mill. For the fourth quarter, we estimate capital investments will be roughly $220 million. Based on early forecast, capital investments for the full year 2022 could be in the range of $700 million inclusive of a significant portion of investment for the four new flat rolled coating lines to be placed in Sinton and Heartland. Regarding shareholder distributions, we maintained our quarterly cash dividend at $0.26 per common share after increasing at 4% in the first quarter of this year. We also repurchased $338 million of our common stock, representing 3% of our outstanding shares. Since 2016, we've increased our cash dividend per share over 85% and we've repurchased almost $2 billion of our common stock, representing 21% of our outstanding shares. While during the same timeframe, we achieved an investment-grade credit rating and maintained our growth company profile by investing over $3 billion in organic capital investments and funding $720 million in acquisitions. These actions reflect the strength of our capital foundation and consistently strong cash flow generation capability and the continued optimism and confidence in our future. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes strategic growth with shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that's complemented with a variable share repurchase program, while also dedicated to preserving our investment grade credit rating. We are squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable optimized long term value creation. Sustainability is a part of our long term value creation strategy, and we are dedicated to our people, our communities and our environment. We are committed to operating our business with the highest integrity. Further committing to this path, we recently announced greenhouse gas reduction and renewable energy goals, including a goal for our steel mills to be carbon neutral by 2050. To increase transparency and accountability, we have also set interim milestones for 2025 and 2030. We have led the steel industry with our exclusive use of electric arc furnace steelmaking technology, our circular manufacturing model and innovative solutions to increase its efficiency, reduce raw material usage, reuse secondary materials and promote material conservation and recycling. We plan to sustain our leadership position by executing our climate goals through, among other avenues, implementing emission reduction projects, improving energy management, increasing the use of renewable energy and developing and supporting new innovative technologies. We have an actionable plan that is more manageable and we believe considerably less expensive than what may lay ahead for our traditional blast furnace industry peers. Our sustainability and climate strategy is an ongoing journey and we're moving forward with the intention to make a positive difference. We plan to continue to address these matters and to play a leadership role moving forward. And for those of you that track more individually our flat rolled shipments, for the third quarter of 2021, we had hot rolled coil and P&O shipments of 676,000 tons, cold rolled shipments of 145,000 tons and finally, coated shipments of 1,037,000 tons. Mark? Yes. So Satish, I'm not sure that our strategy has necessarily changed because of recent announcements from competitors, I would say that. We're very focused on high-margin organic investments where we can be differentiated through value add or a supply chain or both solution. And so that's what the four coating lines provide from the flat roll side of the business. From an acquisition perspective, we're still very focused and we believe there's a lot of options available now and likely into next year as it relates to both mainly high-end manufacturing businesses that help us with our pull-through volume for our steel mills as well as there might possibly be some tuck-in scrap acquisitions as it relates to building out areas around our steel mills from a strategic perspective and the geographic supply of scrap as well as potentially their steel assets as well, but we're very busy from a growth perspective. Mark, do you have anything to add? Yes. We did, Sathish, based on the delay in the start-up, which Mark can talk about, they're still doing incredibly well given the circumstances. But we decided that we would probably pull back our estimate from 2.2 million to 2.4 million tons next year to the 2 million to 2.2 million tons. So it's not a huge reduction, but it's a reduction taking into consideration the ramp will start a little bit later in 2021 than we expected. But Mark, maybe you can give some details on when Sinton will be fully operational. And Sathish, to answer your last question, we would expect that they would be at a full run rate likely by midyear 2022. Thank you. Good morning. Well, from a magnitude perspective, that's difficult, Emma, and I appreciate the question, but that's a board decision. I would tell you, if you looked at history, when we've had transformational growth that we believed provided sustainable through-cycle cash flow increase, such as when we purchased the Columbus Flat Roll division and we were finished transforming that early in the kind of 2016 time frame, you would have seen several 20% increases in our dividend profile at that point in time. I don't think that that is unreasonable at all. As far as the timing, I would fully expect to see something happen in the early part of 2022. But again, that's a board decision and so I guess more to come on that. The minority position really, Emma, allows that management team and Richard Fant to continue to run the business, basically unchanged. And that's something that was attractive to us at this point in time. Actually, throughout the supply chain, especially on the steel side but in the other operating platforms as well with the supply disruptions that everyone is experiencing across any industry at this point in time, whether it relates to logistics or just lack of supply chain stability, we actually have been doing a very deep dive into looking at the relationships we have with suppliers and to have redundancy in suppliers, et cetera. That's something that we do regularly but we're refocused on it as well. And at this point in time, we feel very good about, I'll call them, consumables, the supply of consumables. Obviously, natural gas is very highly priced and going into the winter months, I think a lot of people are expecting that natural gas might continue to rise. Obviously, it is in rest of the world but possibly in the US as well. But that means that, as Mark mentioned, being 100% electric arc furnace is only a couple of percentages of our cost profile. So we're feeling pretty good heading into 2022 at this point. You asked the question about how much further pricing could move. So we can't give you specifics but it's a meaningful increase, because as they have the backlog that Mark mentioned that's almost a year out, you already have that product pricing substantiated. And so that's why in my opening remarks people may not have picked it up, but I may mention the fact that we do expect to have increased fabrication earnings in the fourth quarter as well as into 2022 and that's based off of the record comparison of the third quarter. So there's substantial earnings uplift that we're expecting from the steel fabrication segment. So what Carlos is asking is after Sinton is complete and after we have the four value-added lines that are processing, what greenfield might come after that? There's a few things happening at the same time in the fourth quarter. So we will have higher average steel selling values simply because of the carryover in the lagging contract business that we mentioned from the Flat Roll Group. And in addition to that, we'll be ramping up Sinton. And so we'll be putting additional working capital both through steel substrate and through scrap on the ground as they begin to produce. So I would expect to see a continued use of cash in working capital. I don't expect it to be close to the same magnitude that we saw in the third quarter. We also in the third quarter had some building at Sinton as well. So I would expect maybe a couple of hundred million dollar build but nothing beyond that. Again, it's a very difficult thing to monitor when prices continue to rise but I think that's probably a good estimate at this point. So to address your last question first, if you're speaking about the rolling mill, David, are you talking about the Sinton rolling mill? The value-added lines, no. So the value-add lines we had hoped to be in the second half of 2022. But given the engineering of the lines and just the delivery of equipment at this point in time, it's pushing us back to now, we think those lines will be operational in the first half of 2023. So you're correct, that is a change but that has to do with the engineering and the equipment delivery time line. As it relates to capital spending for 2022, you're correct. On the last quarter call, we would have given something closer to the $600 million range, but that's prior to us doing the deep dive that we do every fall into capital projects. And as you'll remember, there's so much of all of our team members' compensation at risk to performance and high return investments, they always put together to wish list of very good investment opportunities that would result in higher compensation for them if they have high returns. So we went through that process. And at this point in time, that's added probably about $100 million to the capital that we expect to spend next year and that would be projects that we believe will have a very good return profile to it. Some of them will start next year. Some of them will just have the money spent and then kind of roll into 2023. But there's no one significant project that's adding to that. Most of that $700 million is actually tied to the four value-added flat roll lines. So they're high return projects and there are spreads throughout fabrication, the steel mills, we're adding some inspection lines likely down at our SBQ facility. So there's just a lot of individual projects like that, David, that aren't significant individually. But as they added together, it's a higher number. Yes, we feel very good about the capital structure and the foundation that the teams have been able to put into place. And so you've seen us be, we think, very active with the buyback program in the second quarter with very similar activity in the third quarter. I think one should expect to see us continue to have a very steady pace unless we were to come up onto a time frame where we believe that there might be a better use for those funds through strategic growth of either organic or inorganic opportunities. So at this point in time, we believe we will be very active in the buyback program. So it's a great question. You're right that it's a $400 million tranche and it has, I think, a 5% rate attached to it. The investment grade market has been very supportive of Steel Dynamics and we're very excited to be in that market today. So we are very comfortable, I guess, the first point with the debt structure that we have. We really manage to a through-cycle basis at a leverage of 2 times or less. So obviously, we're much less than that today but we're managing to through cycles. I can't give you specifics because I would get in trouble if I did but there is an opportunity to either repay or refinance and we'll be making that decision here in the near term."

We appreciate your time and thank you for joining us today. The entire Steel Dynamics team delivered yet another phenomenal performance filled [ph] with operating and financial records, including record sales, operating income, cash flow, and adjusted EBITDA, a tremendous performance driven by the dedication and passion of our teams executing on our long-term strategies that will continue to drive higher through cycle earnings. The team is delivering exceptional results and I'm very proud to be among them. Due to the continued commitment of our teams to one another, our families, and our customers, we continue to operate safely amidst COVID. The health and welfare of our teams is paramount and I thank each of them for their continued commitment to safety. Record financial results are a little important unless everyone goes home safely at the end of each day. The number of injuries and associated severity improved in the first half of '21 compared to last year. The teams have focused on reducing hazards and practices that could result in significant injury. Nothing is more important than the health and safety of our people, it is our number one value. Our safety performance continues to be significantly better than industry averages, but our intent will always be to have zero incidents. To achieve this, we must all be continuously aware of our surroundings and our fellow team members, keeping safety top of mind in order to take control of safety. Our commitment to all aspects of sustainability is embedded in our founding principles woven into the fabric of our Company, valuing the health and safety of our teams, partnering with our customers, supporting our communities, and minimizing our environmental footprint. An extension of this commitment is evidenced in our recent announcement concerning goals for greenhouse gas emissions reduction, and renewable energy milestones, including a goal for our steel mills to be carbon-neutral by 2050. We've been a leader in the area of sustainability for more than 25 years and we plan to stay right in that position. We are starting from a place of strength with already industry-low Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions, yet, we plan to do more. As we progress on this strategic path, we will plan to share our outcomes with you. But now, Theresa will share insights into our recent performance.\nTheresa Wagler: Good morning, everyone. I'd like to add my sincere appreciation and congratulations to our entire Steel Dynamics team. As Mark said, we achieved numerous milestones, attained record second quarter performance with record revenues of $4.5 billion derived from record quarterly steel shipments, record fabrication shipments, and strong product pricing across all of our operating platforms. We achieved record quarterly operating income of $956 million and net income of $702 million, or $3.32 per diluted share and record cash flow from operations of $587 million, with record quarterly adjusted EBITDA of over $1 billion, a truly extraordinary performance. Our second quarter 2021 results included costs of approximately $23 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, associated with the construction of our Sinton, Texas flat rolled steel mill. Excluding these costs, second quarter 2021 adjusted net income was $719 million, or $3.40 per diluted share. Our second quarter revenues of $4.5 billion were 26% higher than sequential first quarter results with growth from all of our operating platforms, but most significantly from our steel operations based on record shipments and continued strong flat rolled steel selling values. Our second quarter 2021 operating income was $956 million, 61% higher than the first quarter results also driven by strong flat rolled steel pricing and robust demand more than offsetting increased scrap costs. As we discuss our business this morning, we continue to see positive industry fundamentals for 2021 and 2022, and we're confident in our forthcoming unique earnings catalysts. Our steel operations generated over $1 billion of operating income in the second quarter, 59% greater than first quarter sequential earnings as flat roll steel selling values continued to strengthen. We also saw expanded margins throughout our long product steel operations due to improved pricing and volume. We achieved record quarterly steel shipments of 2.9 million tons and our steel mills operated at 91% of their capability. We still have additional steel-market opportunity based on our existing annual steel shipping capability of over 13 million tons and when our new Texas steel mill is fully online, we will have over 6 million tons of availability. Operating income from our metals recycling operations with $51 million aligned with strong first quarter performance as domestic steel production improved further supporting ferrous scrap demand and pricing. The team continues to effectively lever the strength of our circular manufacturing operating model, benefiting both our steel and metals recycling operations by providing higher-quality scrap, which improves furnace efficiency, and by reducing Company-wide working capital requirements. Our fabrication operations once again achieved record shipments and expanded margins in the quarter as realized selling values more than offset continued higher steel input costs. Operating income was $28 million versus first quarter earnings of $10 million. Steel joists and deck demand remains very strong, as evidenced by our record customer order backlog and continued robust order activity. We expect steel fabrication earnings to continue to increase through the remainder of the year. Our cash generation continues to be strong based on our differentiated business model and highly variable-cost structure. At the end of the second quarter, we had liquidity of $2.3 billion comprised of cash of $1.1 billion, and our fully available unsecured revolver of $1.2 billion. During the second quarter of 2021, we generated record cash flow from operations of $587 million and $849 million during the first six months of the year, also a record. Working capital grew over $700 million in the first half of 2021 due to higher prices resulting in increased customer count and inventory values. During the first half of 2021, we've invested $587 million in capital investments, of which $489 million was invested in our new Texas flat roll steel mill. For the second half of 2021, we estimate capital investments will be roughly between $350 million and $400 million, of which, the Texas steel mill represents an estimated $300 million. Regarding shareholder distributions, we maintained our quarterly cash dividend at $0.26 per common share after increasing it 4% in the first quarter of this year. We also repurchased $393 million of our common stock representing 3% of outstanding shares. In July, we announced the Board's approval of an additional $1 billion share repurchase authorization demonstrating our confidence in Steel Dynamics' future cash flow generation. Since 2016, we've increased our cash dividend per share over 85% and we've repurchased over $1.6 billion of common stock representing 19% of our outstanding shares, while during the same timeframe we achieved an investment grade credit rating and maintained our growth Company profile by investing $2.8 billion in organic capital investments and funding $720 million in acquisitions. These actions reflect the strength of our capital foundation and consistently strong cash flow generation capability and the continued optimism and confidence in our future. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes strategic growth with shareholder distributions comprised of a base-positive dividend that's complemented with a variable share-repurchase program. We are squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable optimized long-term value creation. Sustainability is a part of our long-term value creation strategy and we are dedicated to our people, our communities, and our environment. We are committed to operating our business with the highest integrity and have been since our founding. Further committing to this path, we recently announced greenhouse gas reduction and renewable energy goals, including a goal for our steel mills to be carbon-neutral by 2050. To increase transparency, we have set interim milestones for 2025 and 2030. As Mark said, we've led the steel industry with our exclusive use of EAF technology, circular manufacturing model, and innovative solutions to increase efficiencies, reduce raw material usage, reuse secondary materials, and promote material conservation and recycling. We plan to sustain our leadership position by executing our sustainability goals through among other avenues, implementing emission reduction projects, improving energy management, increasing the use of renewable energy, and developing and supporting new innovative technologies. We have an actionable path that is more manageable and we believe considerably less expensive than what may lay ahead for the traditional blast furnace industry. Our sustainability and environmental impact strategy is an ongoing journey and we are moving forward with the intention to make a positive difference. We plan to continue to address these matters and to play a leadership role in developing innovative ways to reduce our impact on the environment. Additionally, for those that track our individual flat roll steel shipments, in the second quarter, our hot roll and our P&O sales -- or shipments, excuse me, were 719,000 tons. Our cold-rolled shipments were 150,000 tons and our coated shipments were 1,055,000 tons. With that, Mark?\nMark Millett: Super. Thanks, Theresa. I would just add a little more color to each operating platform. The steel-fabrication platform delivered a strong performance again, achieving record quarterly shipments and almost tripling sequential operating income. Based on the strength of steel joists and decking demand, increased product pricing is more than offsetting the continued rise in steel input costs. Order activity continues to be extremely strong. We again ended the quarter with a record fabrication order backlog at levels considerably higher than historical peaks. The non-residential construction market is strong, especially in areas that support online, retail, computing activities, and pharmaceuticals, specifically represented by construction of distribution and warehouse facilities. We believe this dynamic will continue for the next several years as we see long-lasting changes in consumer behavior. As we mentioned last quarter, we've hired additional people and expanding operating hours at our several steel and fabrication locations in order to meet increased customer demand. These changes should increase annual production capability by well over 100,000 tons. Our metals recycling operations had an extremely strong quarter with quarterly operating income of $51 million. Strong ferrous demand and increased pricing related to higher domestic steel production drove strong performance. Prime scrap index pricing average increased $60 to $70 per gross ton during the quarter. Prime scrap generation has been solid based on strong North American manufacturing. We expect US scrap generation and alternative iron unit production to keep pace with the increased demand from steel-making in the coming years. Additionally, we believe China's scrap reservoir will grow considerably over the next three to five years, offsetting their expanding EAF capability, while providing additional global raw material supply. We believe metallics pricing in general has peaked and scrap will remain flat in the coming quarter. The steel team had an outstanding quarter, continuing to achieve numerous operating and financial records, including record shipments of 2.9 million tons and record operating income of over $1 billion. While the domestic steel industry operated at the utilization rate of 81%, our steel mills operated at 91% during the second quarter, slightly lower than our first quarter rate of 93%. In June, we experienced the burn-through in one of our furnaces at our Columbus flat-roll steel mill. Importantly, no one on the team was injured. The resulting outage though lasted about 10 days impacting second quarter production and shipments by about 60,000 tons and 30,000 tons, respectively. Columbus is now again fully operational. Steel demand is strong across our entire steel platform. Our long product steel operations achieved increased shipments at all of their locations with the structural and rail division achieving record quarterly volume. The flat-roll steel markets remain especially tight. Strong demand, coupled with extremely low customer inventory levels across the supply chain continue to support flat-roll steel prices above historical peaks. Customers are placing orders for immediate demand requirements and have not had the ability to rebuild inventory. Additionally, the speculative risk associated with the accumulation of higher-priced inventory is also a significant deterrent to procuring imports. We believe current legislated steel trade policies, such as the Section 201 cases imposed in 2015, 2016, and subsequent anti-circumvention restrictions, will continue to keep steel imports at moderated levels. The current US administration has also commented constructively concerning trade parameters and the issues created by China's steel making overcapacity. Regarding the ongoing negotiations between the US and the EU on revoking 232 tariffs, we expect the final agreement will include import surge protections to protect US national security goals. Aside from Turkey, Europe has never been a significant import source and we have long thought collaborating with them against China and other Asian export-based economies that are the greatest contributors to global overcapacity is the most effective path to fair trade. From an end-market perspective, the automotive sector is operating at solid production levels due to low inventories coupled with strong consumer demand. Current build rate forecasts for '22 and '23 are at 17 million units, representing a very strong outlook. Auto inventories are 55% below the five-year average and at the lowest supply level in over 35 years. And additionally, at this point, we've been fortunate that our automotive order book has not seen any significant impact from the ongoing electronic chip shortage. The non-residential construction sector remains strong, as evidenced by our record structural and tail division shipments, record steel fabrication shipments, and strong long-product steel order backlogs. We expect this strength to continue through the rest of this year and into next. Residential construction has also been strong resulting in high demand for HVAC, appliances, and other related products. We're also seeing healthy demand from mining and yellow goods customers at our engineered bar products division. And more recently, we're finally seeing some indications of an improved energy sector as global energy prices have improved. We've executed numerous strategic investments across the Company in the last several years and we continue to position Steel Dynamics for the future. We and our customers continue to be extremely excited about our Sinton, Texas electric arc furnace flat roll steel mill investment. It represents transformational, competitively advantaged strategic growth with associated long-term value creation for all of our stakeholders. It provides lower carbon-emitting, next-generation EAF steel production capabilities, new products, and new customers. The 3 million ton state-of-the-art facility is designed to have product capabilities beyond that of existing electric arc furnace flat roll steel producers, competing even more effectively with higher carbon-emitting integrated steel facilities and high-carbon foreign competition. It provides us with broader steel portfolio while providing our customers with an even larger climate-conscious supply option. The electric arc furnace production route is by far the most sustainable, environmentally-friendly supply chain, and the lowest carbon footprint. We are currently hot commissioning the 250,000-ton paint line and we expect the 550,000-ton galvanizing line with Galvalume coating capability to be operational next month. The entire Sinton team is doing a tremendous job, but due to excessive heavy rains experienced in Texas over the last several months, actual steel production at Sinton is not likely to begin until mid-fourth quarter of this year. Theresa shared our views concerning shipments and through cycle earnings capability of this new steel mill. It's is truly a transformational project and we are just at the edge of seeing the tremendous benefits it will bring to us, our teams, our customers, and our stakeholders. The Town of Sinton provides a strategic location near Corpus Christi with regional commercial markets representing over 27 million tons of relevant flat roll steel consumption in the US and Mexico as customers are excited to have freight advantaged regional flat roll steel supplier. We currently have five customers committed to locate on-site representing over 1.5 million tons of annual processing and consumption capability. Based on our location with much shorter lead times, we can provide a superior customer supply chain solution. It also allows us to effectively compete with imports coming into Houston and the West Coast, which inherently have long lead times and speculative price risk. We've also made considerable progress concerning our raw material procurement strategy for Sinton. We completed the acquisition of a Mexican scrap company last August, a critical step. The operations are strategically located near high-volume industrial scrap sources throughout Central and Northern Mexico. They have an estimated annual scrap processing capability of almost 2 million gross tons, and we also acquired three smaller scrap locations in the Houston and Corpus Christi area, which we did the last quarter. Our performance-based operating culture, coupled with our considerable experience in successfully constructing and operating highly profitable steel mills positions us incredibly well to successfully execute this transformational growth. We're not simply adding flat roll steel production capacity, we have a differentiated product offering, a unique regional supply chain solution, a significant geographic freight, and lead time advantage, and offer an import alternative to a region in need of options. We also recently announced plans to add four additional value-add flat roll coating lines comprised of two new paint lines and two new galvanizing lines with Galvalume coating capability. Our preferred supply chain has resulted in our existing lines consistently running at full capacity through both increased consumption and market share gain. Two of the new lines will be in the Southern US region to support Sinton. The other two lines will be in the Midwest and will also be comprised of a new paint line and galvanizing line with a combined annual capacity of 540,000 tons. These lines will support our regional flat roll steel operations, providing them with more value-added product diversification to serve our customer needs. We currently believe these lines will begin operations in the second half of 2022. Our strategy consistently places value-added products and supply chain differentiation on the fore and has benefit us well. In closing, our business model and execution of our long-term strategy continues to strengthen our financial position through strong cash flow generation, demonstrating our sustainability and differentiating us from our competition.

So, thanks to all for you being on the call today. I appreciate your listening and now, Daryl, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first questions come from the line of Emily Chieng with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions.\nEmily Chieng: Good morning, Mark and Theresa, and thanks for the update here. My first question is around the four value-add coating lines. I thought last quarter that the expected CapEx for these value-add lines ranged between $400 million and $425 million, but I think you've outlined a budget of $450 million to $500 million today. So would be curious as to what has changed around the scope of the project or the timeline that has may be driven this increase here?\nMark Millett: I think two things as we delved into it, we got a clearer picture, firstly, of the cost structure, but I think more importantly, it's just the expansion of line capability that added a little bit more.\nTheresa Wagler: It also is being priced on current steel values and so that appreciates the total project cost as well.\nEmily Chieng: That's clear. And maybe just to further this sort of line of questioning around growth, it sounds like you've got a pretty constructive view of the US steel industry, clearly providing some further opportunities for growth in the coming years. What else do you think there could be planned for Steel Dynamics longer-term beyond these four coating lines as it relates to growth within your capital allocation budget? Should it be further organic growth in the downstream, additional capacity, how should we think about how you could be allocating capital here?\nMark Millett: Sure. I think you will see going forward a continued plan to invest downstream and value-added downstream processing. That has been a key part of our strategy to date and will continue to do so. And as one looks across our operating platform on the steel side, we see continued organic growth capability there. I do believe also we have an incredibly strong balance sheet, strong liquidity, our cash flow generation capability continues to improve through cycle and there will be, I think, a good balanced cash allocation strategy. Transactional growth will certainly be part of that. There appears to be a strong pipeline of opportunity in both pull-through manufacturing type operations on the market today along with steel assets.\nEmily Chieng: Great. That's helpful color. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Carlos de Alba with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nCarlos de Alba: Thank you very much, everyone. Mark, perhaps for you, you mentioned that you expect metallics prices to have peaked already. Any views on the steel prices given what you said about metallics?\nMark Millett: No, I think, Carlos, we remain incredibly bullish of the market for the rest of this year and into next year. On the demand side, it's just incredibly strong. You have a tight supply side right now. Inventories are at record low levels, I think MSCI data is 1.8 months, incredibly, incredibly low and there is no restocking capability there currently because there's just lack of availability to meet present demand. Mill lead times are stretched. You have -- imports have ticked up a little, but they're still moderated, and in all honestly, despite the large arbitrage availability, near-term availability for imports is still very, very, tight. So I don't see there being any ability for a surge there to take things over the top. And if you look at the second half of this year, there are a myriad of mill outages, both for just regular maintenance outages, but also for installation of new equipment [indiscernible] and those mills as they plan on their future expansion. So there's going to be a lot of steel actually coming offline in the second half, which is going to just tighten the supply/demand balance even more. So, I think for the rest of this year, it's a bullish market for us.\nCarlos de Alba: All right. Thanks for that. So, basically, you expect increasing margins perhaps as scrap prices go down and the steel prices remain high. What are the implications maybe there for working capital given that it was -- the cash generation was very solid, but working capital obviously -- for obvious reasons, the consumer -- cash during the first half. Do you continue to see that basically at the same level in terms of days of working capital, maybe accounts receivables and inventories in terms of days of sales and cost at similar levels than what we experienced in the second quarter?\nTheresa Wagler: I think we should see that moderating because from the perspective of pricing, Mark's correct, we've had very strong steel pricing and volumes have increased, but now that we're at this level, I don't see there being significant draws for the second half of the year, although, we will be increasing working capital as Sinton ramps up. So Sinton could be as much as $150 million to $200 million of working capital in the next, call it, six to nine months. But I don't think that you're going to see as significant of a draw in working capital in the second half of the year as we experienced in the first half of the year.\nCarlos de Alba: All right. Excellent. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Sathish Kasinathan with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nSathish Kasinathan: Yes, hi. Good morning, Mark and Theresa. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question is on the steel fabrication segment. The second quarter '21 shipments were at record levels, but if you look at on a quarter-on-quarter basis, the shipments were only up 3% despite the record backlogs and your guidance in April on adding more crews. So just wanted to get a sense of what was there, any weather-related impact in 2Q and how should we look at the shipment progression for the rest of the year?\nMark Millett: Well, as you point out, it did increase albeit incrementally quarter-over-quarter, but the additional folks that we've brought on board, obviously, they've been ramping up and they need to be trained, and you won't see or wouldn't have seen a massive increase second quarter, but you will see that ramping up third and fourth quarter.\nSathish Kasinathan: Okay. Thank you for that. And you mentioned about planned outages at some of your peers. I just wanted to get a sense of if you have any outages planned within your system for the second half of 2021?\nMark Millett: Both, I believe Columbus and Butler will take their normal kind of full-day outages in the third, fourth quarter.\nSathish Kasinathan: Third and fourth quarter, okay. Thank you for that and good luck for the next quarter.\nMark Millett: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Gagliano: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just on the capital allocation side of it, first of all, historically, the mix over the last five years has been kind of 65, 35 between growth versus shareholder returns. Should we expect that mix to change meaningfully in the out years? And a related question, I noticed long product utilization rates are now creeping up close to 90%, which is pretty amazing, and I'm just wondering if you can speak to, as you think about capital allocation plans, are you interested in expanding in your long-products capacity given the utilization rates at this point and the positive outlook? And if so, would that more likely be organic or inorganic opportunities? That's my first question. Thanks.\nTheresa Wagler: Good morning, Dave. From a shareholder distributions and capital allocation, so first and foremost, we definitely are a growth-oriented Company, and we intend to stay that way. But we believe, it's important during these periods of excess cash flow generation to provide increased distributions to shareholders. And as we've said in the past, we like to keep our dividend in a very manageable level. When Sinton is up and operational, you will see a significant increase in the dividend at that point, because we're going to have significantly higher through cycle cash flow. But until that time, and as we're generating excess cash, we will be utilizing the share buyback program as well. We think that's an important tool. However, we are very much focused on growth. As Mark mentioned, there are transaction opportunities today. There is quite an extensive pipeline, the teams are very busy, again, focused on manufacturing businesses, as well as potentially steel production assets as well. You're correct, the long-products utilization has improved nicely and we're seeing a lot of both good demand, and then also the commercial teams have been doing a good job of cross-selling those products and we've gotten some market share gains out of that as well. Mark, would you like to address the question, whether or not we want to grow in long products?\nMark Millett: Yes. But just to touch on, David, you're right, the long-products markets have got incredibly hot here off late. Certainly, you're seeing that in the margin expansion. There has been a change there, whereby pricing tended to be adjusted in lockstep with any change in scrap, but as you've seen over the last few months, it's become a market-based, demand-based pricing scenario and margins have increased 150%, sometimes 200% on some products. So it is a very, very strong market for us today for sure across the space, merchants, beams, rail is stellar and engineered bar and honestly, I think we're pretty well closed there from an order book perspective for the rest of the year and going into next year; so a great market. That said, if you look at the kind of capacity in merchant shapes and beams in particular relative to through cycle consumption, that's one area, that is -- it's a kind of an overcapacity situation through the cycle. And therefore, I wouldn't envision us having any meaningful increase in hot side production of shapes. I think you will see us utilize excess hot metal capability that we've got in a couple of our mills on the long-product side, but again, it won't be a massive increase in capacity.\nDavid Gagliano: Okay, that's helpful. Thanks. And then just my second or -- yes, my second question on -- switching gears a little bit, on the cost side. If we kind of try to back into conversion cost and obviously, there's different moving parts there, but it does look like they've crept fairly meaningfully higher. I was wondering if you just speak to the cost creep there, was that mix driven, or are there underlying cost pressures? And how should we be modeling conversion costs relative to what we just saw this quarter on a forward-looking basis? Thanks.\nTheresa Wagler: So David, I know how you try to back into conversion costs and in the world where now we have a lot more processing versus just steel production, it's going to be harder and harder for you back into that number that way. So we had a considerable amount of more substrate coming into the system and having it coated versus directly from the steel production itself. And so where in as that makes it look like there is an increased conversion cost, there's actually not. It's just that we are processing more outside tons because there's such strong demand. And we can maybe try to unpack that a little bit better from quarter to quarter, but there were no significant increases in conversion costs.\nDavid Gagliano: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Gordon Johnson with GLJ Research. Please proceed with your questions.\nGordon Johnson: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to get your thoughts on comments made by the President yesterday that the economy is booming. And looking at some of the survey data that came out of Michigan last week with respect to home buying trends and car buying trends, home buying trends being the worst based on the survey since the '90s, same for cars. Clearly, things are great right now, but do you guys see any potential for some pullback in the second half? And then I have a follow-up.\nMark Millett: Well, the simple answer to that is, no. The demand is incredibly strong across all our sectors. We can't make enough steel. There's massive pent-up demand, particularly on the automotive side. And as I said earlier, if you look at inventories right now, they're at very, very, very low levels on a historic basis and there is a pent-up demand. And if you talk to the large dealers out there, they just cannot get enough product and they would suggest there's going to be a couple of years before they actually catch up. So, we remain incredibly bullish for the rest of this year and going into next year. There is absolutely no doubt about it. There's a lot -- there seems to be this cloud over people's minds or heads, but we are in the trenches, we're talking to customers each and every day. I'm talking to customers each and every day. I think we have a good finger on the pulse and it's got legs, there's no doubt about it.\nGordon Johnson: Okay, that's helpful. And then, on the flip side, there's been fears around and this is in my turn, but I think we all know it well, Steelmageddon and a lot of the incremental capacity that a lot of people expect to come online, but based on our estimates, a lot of that capacity is either redundant or has been pushed out. Do you guys share that view? And on the positive side, do you see the potential for maintenance, Cliffs has taken a mill down here pretty soon, it's going be down for a while. There are some other mills coming down. Do you guys not see the potential for prices to move even higher from here? Thank you for the questions.\nMark Millett: Well, we've had a -- as many of you on the call know, I've had a very long-standing contrasting view to the overcapacity issue or situation. And what people have not been able to figure out or understand is that the US is one of the few if not the only countries that is steel short. Additional capacity is not our problem. In fact, our industry is doing the right thing. It needs to reinvest, it needs to get state-of-the-art equipment on board, both from a global competitive perspective because if you look at China, 85% of Chinese capacity today is less than 15 years old, it's modern. So our industry needs to invest and it needs to continue to invest in electric arc furnace-type production routes from a sustainability standpoint. So, in my humble opinion, when you have an industry that arguably has somewhere 95 million tons to 100 million tons of production capability, and a need in a normal market of at least 120 million tons, production capability is not the issue, imports are the issue and controlling them. And I think as I said earlier, we do believe the tools are in place. Section 201 will maintain a sort of barrier, even if the 232 tariffs get eroded. So I am not concerned about overcapacity one little bit. Some of the older antiquated high-cost integrated capabilities will remain offline and I think will offset the somewhat 6 million tons or so of new flat roll coming into our marketplace.\nGordon Johnson: Thanks, again for the questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nPhil Gibbs: Hey. Good morning. Congrats on all the progress.\nMark Millett: Thanks, Phil.\nPhil Gibbs: Mark, I just have first question just on the demand side with automotive and oil and gas. I know auto has been a strong, kind of the first to lead us out of the whole last year, but recently, IHS has kind of taking down their forecast on demand and the semi-chip issues. Wondering just what you're seeing there in terms of pull from your customers? And then, secondarily, you did mention oil and gas getting better at the margin. Maybe just expand upon what you're seeing there and if your customers are trying to prepare you for a strong bounce back in '22?\nMark Millett: So again, Phil, from our intelligence, people are looking at a 17 million ton build rate this year and next year -- next year, sorry. That's an incredibly strong number. And I think as I suggested, when we talk to the dealers out there, when we look at the inventories, that is going to be -- the demand or the -- it's a pent-up demand there that's going to sustain things. The chip shortage for some maybe sort of hindering shipping capability. As I said earlier, very few of our auto platforms have been affected to date. So we've been fortunate, but if you think about it, okay, so chip shortages slow things down a little bit, the demand is still pent up, is still there, and it's just going to help expand this incredible cycle that we're on or in.\nPhil Gibbs: And then, on the oil and gas side, Mark?\nMark Millett: Yes. Theresa whispered that across, sorry.\nPhil Gibbs: No worries, not in hurry.\nMark Millett: On the energy side, it's a little bit of a mixed bag. Obviously, global pricing, energy prices have come up a little, rig counts are coming up a little. We're seeing improved kind of downhole OCTG requirements, so engineered bar, for instance, we supply rolled bar into the seamless tube market, that has been picking up, a little slower though on the kind of the infrastructure. The distribution pipeline is still very, very soft and the cancellation of a couple of pipelines here over the last few months have left inventory in the supply chain that's trying to get sort of reallocated across the country. So, OCTG, downhole strengthening, infrastructure, distribution line pipe is going to be a little soft for probably at least another 12 months.\nPhil Gibbs: Okay, I appreciate that. And then just a follow-up here on the CapEx side. I think Theresa you said CapEx of $350 million to $400 million in the second half. Was there something pushed out into next year because I thought last time you had talked about making some pre-stage investments for your tandem lines?\nTheresa Wagler: Yes. Based on engineering and some of the more detailed plans that we've received on the four lines, some of that's likely to be pushed from the fourth quarter into the first quarter. So next year without doing our detailed planning, you're likely to see capital expenditures of probably somewhere between $550 million and $600 million.\nPhil Gibbs: Terrific. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Tristan Gresser with Exane BNP. Please proceed with your questions.\nTristan Gresser: Yes. Hi, good morning and thank you for taking my question. Regarding the new environmental targets, is there any CapEx associated to those targets, and what's the timeline, if you have already identified new initiatives to cut emissions by 2025 and 2030? And if you can, what is roughly the contribution from each focus area? I mean, I think you talk about new technology, efficiency, but also renewable, if you have that split that would be helpful as well. Thank you.\nTheresa Wagler: Good morning. Thanks for the question. That was a very detailed question, I'm not sure I might be able to go into all of it at this point in time. We do have some things that we can't discuss yet. They're very exciting on the renewable energy side of the equation. There will be some capital dollars, obviously, spent as we look at efficiency projects and as we move toward more renewable energy and the carbon reduction itself. We really don't have estimates to be able to discuss this morning because there's still a lot of projects that are being vetted. We will be disclosing those items as we move forward but we have a very -- and this is the thing that we want everybody to understand how we're trying to differentiate ourselves in our carbon goals and in our renewable energy goals, is that, we are being very transparent. There is a clear path on how we're going to achieve 2025 and 2030, and as we're able to disclose some of these projects, we absolutely, Tristan, will be sharing these projects, but at this point in time it's just too early to do so.\nTristan Gresser: All right, no problem. And maybe a follow-up on raw material. Can you talk a bit about how your raw material strategy will evolve in both the context of capacity expansion, but also decarbonization as it has an impact on, for instance, Scope 3? How do you think your raw material mix will evolve in coming years? Thank you.\nTheresa Wagler: Well, the raw material strategy really is consistent from the perspective at least of what we're looking at today and that's we use really only about 20% to 25% pig iron in our flat roll mills, and so it's not as much as being advertised by maybe some of our peers today and that is being sourced obviously internationally. So, today, we use a mix of HPI as well and we'll continue to do that moving forward, but I don't see this strategy at this point in time or at least over the next near term changing dramatically. Mark?\nMark Millett: No, I think, again, we're executing on our plan that we've had in place for some time. Fortunately, we have a very, very good foundation through our omni-source recycling platform that has the capability of some 6 million tons, 7 million tons of capability. So supply of scrap is not going to be an issue for us for sure. And we're adding to that capability, as I said, in Mexico and some of those tons will flow up to Sinton and to our Columbus mill. So, I think we're in good shape on the scrap side of things. As Theresa suggested, we are using HPI and have been using a little bit more of that of late. We have IDI that people seem to forget. That's a very, very effective use for our Butler mill in particular, it's making about 260,000 tons of liquid iron that we put into our electric arc furnace each year. And just to emphasize, if you look across our steel platform, in total, pig iron is only -- I think, it's less than 8% of the total input. So yes, it's an impact, but not a massive one.\nTristan Gresser: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of John Tumazos with Very Independent Research. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Tumazos: Congratulations on $0.7 billion in a quarter. Looking at your CapEx strategy for the next two years, it looks like the focus is to maximize Sinton, complete the painting lines, the Galvalume galvanizing, get all the squeal out of the pig. Is it fair for us to expect your next big capital expenditure initiatives to be 2024, 2025 completion, maybe the outlays begin a little sooner, but where you are focused right now is making hay while the sun shines and getting everything out of the 3 million ton new mill?\nMark Millett: Thank you, John. It's good to hear from you. There is absolutely no doubt that the team's focus has been the execution of Sinton and it's a very large-scale facility. Actually, if you jump on our website, we have a drone video that gets updated I think once a month and it's a colossal, phenomenal facility that's being built by the team down there. And so, the focus for sure has been execution, execution, execution. Nonetheless, we have other folks on our team that continue to look at transactional activity, and also, the individual mills, we have very talented teams that continue to look at areas of organic growth. So I think you'll certainly see just a continuation of that organic growth that you've seen in the last 25 years or so. From a Sinton standpoint, the new lines that you mentioned that parallels or just supports our long-term strategy of fully utilizing or building high levels of through cycle utilization. And so not only are those four new lines very effective uses of CapEx with very, very, very good returns, it allows those capital intense steel mill assets to run at a high utilization, as I said, through the cycle. And I think we've demonstrated clearly that that strategy allows us to have superior shipments, production capabilities in any market environment.\nJohn Tumazos: So, there could be a big project before '24, '25, or a transaction?\nMark Millett: We would imagine -- I think I've said it in the past, we don't see a Sintonasc greenfield project on our horizon. Transactional activity, there could be something meaningful there.\nJohn Tumazos: Thank you very much and congratulations $3 billion annual rates, amazing for profits.\nMark Millett: Thank you, John. We've got a great team. A little bit of a market tailwind is not hurting either, but…\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Michael Glick with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions.\nMichael Glick: Thanks for sneaking me in. You mentioned talking to customers and auto customers in particular but inventories across or beyond auto are also pretty low. Any sense as to what the game plan is for your non-auto customers in terms of rebuilding those inventories once they have access to more supply?\nMark Millett: Well, I don't think there's really any desire right now to rebuild. Firstly, people just can't get enough steel to satisfy their immediate needs, number one, domestically. And number two, the speculative risk associated with accumulating inventory in today's market environment is a -- it'd be a pretty gutsy call. Imports, as I said, despite the high arbitrage, there is very little available currently. The global markets are very, very strong and most of the material is being consumed within those markets. So there is not much available even if they wanted to. That said, the speculative risk of material flowing in and import delivery times are November, December, January, today. You don't want to take that risk. So, I don't see any rebuild in the near term and again, that's just another factor that's going to extend this cycle.\nMichael Glick: Understood. And then, I think you noted $475 million to $500 million of incremental through cycle EBITDA once the value-add lines are complete. Could you walk us through some of these spread assumptions there so we can understand the moving parts a bit better?\nTheresa Wagler: Michael, we won't go through the details spreads themselves. We will tell you that the spreads are based on mid-cycle spreads, so definitely not what we're experiencing today. And we're starting with a base hot roll to prime scrap kind of mix spread and then we build the value-added product mix off of that. And we are using what we've experienced historically, and then also looking forward at what the expectations are in those individual markets on a mid-cycle basis. So I'm sorry, we can't give you specific spreads, but it is showing that certain -- our expectations are that the volume operates very much like our Columbus and Butler facilities operate, that means that production and shipments tend to be at or near capacity on a mid-cycle basis.\nMichael Glick: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Sean Wondrack with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.\nSean Wondrack: Hi, Mark and Theresa, and congratulations on another great quarter here. Just a couple of housekeeping items and I apologize if you've mentioned these, but taxes, I recognize you had a shield related to Sinton. I think it's supposed to continue to work in your favor. Can you maybe touch on that and sort of expectations for working capital for the year, please?\nTheresa Wagler: Yes, absolutely. So, yes Sinton will -- still expected to provide a tax shield this year as we're able to -- of the year of operations, be able to expense that successive investment. It likely will shield upwards of $350 plus million. However, our earnings are so strong, that we're still having tax payments that are required, this year. And I think we're estimating our effective tax rate to be about 15%. From the perspective of working capital, Sinton is likely to build working capital as it starts operations in the next six to nine months of somewhere between $150 million and $200 million. Outside of that, I would expect the rest of our operations working capital to remain fairly steady just given that our volumes have already picked up and pricing has been really strong as well. So, I don't see a lot of additional movement in working capital.\nSean Wondrack: Great, thank you. That's helpful. And then, just in terms of opportunistic use of cash flow, you have $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet. You're going to continue to generate cash going forward. You've, obviously, done a nice job outlining the various ways you can use that cash, but I guess my question is, do you think it's prudent to keep a solid cash balance there should an opportunity arise, or should the market turn at some point just so that you have the ability to go out and make these transactions?\nTheresa Wagler: It's a good question. Our balance sheet is extraordinarily strong. So even if you look at our net leverage or our gross leverage, either metric is solidly in the investment-grade arena. We have significant additional debt capacity and the capital structure, and so where in as, yes, it makes sense to keep some cash on the balance sheet, we also have things that we can spend that money on whether it's additional share repurchases as we expect to make in the second half of the year and it still won't hinder all of the growth expectations or projects that we think are available to us on the transaction side. So yes, we do keep dry powder at the same token, and there's still debt capacity as well.\nMark Millett: And I would just add, if you look -- hopefully, when you look at our experience of growth over the years, it's always been very, very intentional I would say. I would say, it's also very disciplined, and we won't do a transaction at ludicrous numbers. We always look at through-cycle. So if we were to do a transaction today, it will be a good investment through the cycle not just based on today's crazy profitability that some may have.\nSean Wondrack: Right. No, that makes sense. I feel like you've demonstrated that over time as you've scaled this business up, it's not always easy to do that. I guess just my last question, just touching on something you said earlier, Mark. When you think about the US market sort of being in a deficit -- deficit for years, I guess philosophically do you believe that eventually domestic producers will evolve to fill that demand gap, or do you think we will always have a component of imports coming into this country?\nMark Millett: I think there will always be some element of imports for sure. It has been a long, long, long time. I think I don't know, mid-'70s or '80s or whenever, when imports were de minimis. We're not going to be a country that self-satisfies its demand in total. So imports are always going to be there. Today, we typically need -- 20% of demand is an import need. We just don't need 30 million tons or 30% imports. But I think if you -- all the discussion has been relatively near term, when I say near term six, nine months into next year. But people are not, I don't believe anyway, recognizing that the industry is in transition. And I think there is some paradigm shifts occurring that are going to retain a lot higher sort of health -- market health in our industry and a much higher margins going forward. You look at the leadership mindset today and the consolidation, the integrated industry is really focused on returning shareholder value. They are totally focused on consolidating and rationalizing their assets to make good business sense. And that's going to bring I think market health and market strength long term. USMCA has, I think, certainly for us been a market change in dynamic, where you see particularly the European automakers, a shift in their supply chain from imports to domestic sourcing. Again, we've been a very, very large beneficiary of that. So the market is changing for sure in this country, and as I said earlier, it needs more capacity, it needs state-of-the-art technological capability, low cost, sustainable low carbon footprint production routes. And so I am not fearful for a second about the capacity coming online, it's needed and it will benefit the North American manufacturer base in spades going forward.\nSean Wondrack: I appreciate that. It's a very thoughtful answer to a pretty difficult question, but thank you very much and good luck going forward.\nMark Millett: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude our question and answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for any closing remarks.\nMark Millett: Thank you, Daryl. I would just emphasize, well, firstly, thank you for those that are still on the call. Thank you for listening today to our thoughts and opinions anyway. It was an incredible quarter. We believe next quarter is going to be better even so. And that is driven certainly by the market tailwinds that we're experiencing, but it's also more importantly driven by the most phenomenal steel metals team in the world. They are an incredible bunch of individuals. We number 10,000 there. If you include their wives and partners and kids, we've got, I don't know, 25,000 people in the SDI family today. They all contribute to our success. So thank you to each and every one of them. Thank you to our customers. We can't do what we do without you. We've had some incredibly loyal support and I wish we could support them even more today because they are -- we are struggling to meet all their needs. So, thank you, everyone. Make it a great day, and be safe. Take care.\nOperator: Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation and have a great and safe day.",

The entire Steel Dynamics team delivered yet another phenomenal performance filled [ph] with operating and financial records, including record sales, operating income, cash flow, and adjusted EBITDA, a tremendous performance driven by the dedication and passion of our teams executing on our long-term strategies that will continue to drive higher through cycle earnings. The team is delivering exceptional results and I'm very proud to be among them. Due to the continued commitment of our teams to one another, our families, and our customers, we continue to operate safely amidst COVID. The health and welfare of our teams is paramount and I thank each of them for their continued commitment to safety. Record financial results are a little important unless everyone goes home safely at the end of each day. The number of injuries and associated severity improved in the first half of '21 compared to last year. The teams have focused on reducing hazards and practices that could result in significant injury. Nothing is more important than the health and safety of our people, it is our number one value. Our safety performance continues to be significantly better than industry averages, but our intent will always be to have zero incidents. To achieve this, we must all be continuously aware of our surroundings and our fellow team members, keeping safety top of mind in order to take control of safety. Our commitment to all aspects of sustainability is embedded in our founding principles woven into the fabric of our Company, valuing the health and safety of our teams, partnering with our customers, supporting our communities, and minimizing our environmental footprint. An extension of this commitment is evidenced in our recent announcement concerning goals for greenhouse gas emissions reduction, and renewable energy milestones, including a goal for our steel mills to be carbon-neutral by 2050. We've been a leader in the area of sustainability for more than 25 years and we plan to stay right in that position. We are starting from a place of strength with already industry-low Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions, yet, we plan to do more. As we progress on this strategic path, we will plan to share our outcomes with you. But now, Theresa will share insights into our recent performance. Super. Thanks, Theresa. I would just add a little more color to each operating platform. The steel-fabrication platform delivered a strong performance again, achieving record quarterly shipments and almost tripling sequential operating income. Based on the strength of steel joists and decking demand, increased product pricing is more than offsetting the continued rise in steel input costs. Order activity continues to be extremely strong. We again ended the quarter with a record fabrication order backlog at levels considerably higher than historical peaks. The non-residential construction market is strong, especially in areas that support online, retail, computing activities, and pharmaceuticals, specifically represented by construction of distribution and warehouse facilities. We believe this dynamic will continue for the next several years as we see long-lasting changes in consumer behavior. As we mentioned last quarter, we've hired additional people and expanding operating hours at our several steel and fabrication locations in order to meet increased customer demand. These changes should increase annual production capability by well over 100,000 tons. Our metals recycling operations had an extremely strong quarter with quarterly operating income of $51 million. Strong ferrous demand and increased pricing related to higher domestic steel production drove strong performance. Prime scrap index pricing average increased $60 to $70 per gross ton during the quarter. Prime scrap generation has been solid based on strong North American manufacturing. We expect US scrap generation and alternative iron unit production to keep pace with the increased demand from steel-making in the coming years. Additionally, we believe China's scrap reservoir will grow considerably over the next three to five years, offsetting their expanding EAF capability, while providing additional global raw material supply. We believe metallics pricing in general has peaked and scrap will remain flat in the coming quarter. The steel team had an outstanding quarter, continuing to achieve numerous operating and financial records, including record shipments of 2.9 million tons and record operating income of over $1 billion. While the domestic steel industry operated at the utilization rate of 81%, our steel mills operated at 91% during the second quarter, slightly lower than our first quarter rate of 93%. In June, we experienced the burn-through in one of our furnaces at our Columbus flat-roll steel mill. Importantly, no one on the team was injured. The resulting outage though lasted about 10 days impacting second quarter production and shipments by about 60,000 tons and 30,000 tons, respectively. Columbus is now again fully operational. Steel demand is strong across our entire steel platform. Our long product steel operations achieved increased shipments at all of their locations with the structural and rail division achieving record quarterly volume. The flat-roll steel markets remain especially tight. Strong demand, coupled with extremely low customer inventory levels across the supply chain continue to support flat-roll steel prices above historical peaks. Customers are placing orders for immediate demand requirements and have not had the ability to rebuild inventory. Additionally, the speculative risk associated with the accumulation of higher-priced inventory is also a significant deterrent to procuring imports. We believe current legislated steel trade policies, such as the Section 201 cases imposed in 2015, 2016, and subsequent anti-circumvention restrictions, will continue to keep steel imports at moderated levels. The current US administration has also commented constructively concerning trade parameters and the issues created by China's steel making overcapacity. Regarding the ongoing negotiations between the US and the EU on revoking 232 tariffs, we expect the final agreement will include import surge protections to protect US national security goals. Aside from Turkey, Europe has never been a significant import source and we have long thought collaborating with them against China and other Asian export-based economies that are the greatest contributors to global overcapacity is the most effective path to fair trade. From an end-market perspective, the automotive sector is operating at solid production levels due to low inventories coupled with strong consumer demand. Current build rate forecasts for '22 and '23 are at 17 million units, representing a very strong outlook. Auto inventories are 55% below the five-year average and at the lowest supply level in over 35 years. And additionally, at this point, we've been fortunate that our automotive order book has not seen any significant impact from the ongoing electronic chip shortage. The non-residential construction sector remains strong, as evidenced by our record structural and tail division shipments, record steel fabrication shipments, and strong long-product steel order backlogs. We expect this strength to continue through the rest of this year and into next. Residential construction has also been strong resulting in high demand for HVAC, appliances, and other related products. We're also seeing healthy demand from mining and yellow goods customers at our engineered bar products division. And more recently, we're finally seeing some indications of an improved energy sector as global energy prices have improved. We've executed numerous strategic investments across the Company in the last several years and we continue to position Steel Dynamics for the future. We and our customers continue to be extremely excited about our Sinton, Texas electric arc furnace flat roll steel mill investment. It represents transformational, competitively advantaged strategic growth with associated long-term value creation for all of our stakeholders. It provides lower carbon-emitting, next-generation EAF steel production capabilities, new products, and new customers. The 3 million ton state-of-the-art facility is designed to have product capabilities beyond that of existing electric arc furnace flat roll steel producers, competing even more effectively with higher carbon-emitting integrated steel facilities and high-carbon foreign competition. It provides us with broader steel portfolio while providing our customers with an even larger climate-conscious supply option. The electric arc furnace production route is by far the most sustainable, environmentally-friendly supply chain, and the lowest carbon footprint. We are currently hot commissioning the 250,000-ton paint line and we expect the 550,000-ton galvanizing line with Galvalume coating capability to be operational next month. The entire Sinton team is doing a tremendous job, but due to excessive heavy rains experienced in Texas over the last several months, actual steel production at Sinton is not likely to begin until mid-fourth quarter of this year. Theresa shared our views concerning shipments and through cycle earnings capability of this new steel mill. It's is truly a transformational project and we are just at the edge of seeing the tremendous benefits it will bring to us, our teams, our customers, and our stakeholders. The Town of Sinton provides a strategic location near Corpus Christi with regional commercial markets representing over 27 million tons of relevant flat roll steel consumption in the US and Mexico as customers are excited to have freight advantaged regional flat roll steel supplier. We currently have five customers committed to locate on-site representing over 1.5 million tons of annual processing and consumption capability. Based on our location with much shorter lead times, we can provide a superior customer supply chain solution. It also allows us to effectively compete with imports coming into Houston and the West Coast, which inherently have long lead times and speculative price risk. We've also made considerable progress concerning our raw material procurement strategy for Sinton. We completed the acquisition of a Mexican scrap company last August, a critical step. The operations are strategically located near high-volume industrial scrap sources throughout Central and Northern Mexico. They have an estimated annual scrap processing capability of almost 2 million gross tons, and we also acquired three smaller scrap locations in the Houston and Corpus Christi area, which we did the last quarter. Our performance-based operating culture, coupled with our considerable experience in successfully constructing and operating highly profitable steel mills positions us incredibly well to successfully execute this transformational growth. We're not simply adding flat roll steel production capacity, we have a differentiated product offering, a unique regional supply chain solution, a significant geographic freight, and lead time advantage, and offer an import alternative to a region in need of options. We also recently announced plans to add four additional value-add flat roll coating lines comprised of two new paint lines and two new galvanizing lines with Galvalume coating capability. Our preferred supply chain has resulted in our existing lines consistently running at full capacity through both increased consumption and market share gain. Two of the new lines will be in the Southern US region to support Sinton. The other two lines will be in the Midwest and will also be comprised of a new paint line and galvanizing line with a combined annual capacity of 540,000 tons. These lines will support our regional flat roll steel operations, providing them with more value-added product diversification to serve our customer needs. We currently believe these lines will begin operations in the second half of 2022. Our strategy consistently places value-added products and supply chain differentiation on the fore and has benefit us well. In closing, our business model and execution of our long-term strategy continues to strengthen our financial position through strong cash flow generation, demonstrating our sustainability and differentiating us from our competition. Additionally, our customer focus coupled with market diversification and low-cost operating platforms, support our ability to maintain our best-in-class financial performance. Our amazing teams and the spirit of excellence are the foundation of that success. I thank each of them for their passion and dedication to one another and remember that your health and safety are always the most important issue at hand. So, thanks to all for you being on the call today. I appreciate your listening and now, Daryl, please open the line for questions. I think two things as we delved into it, we got a clearer picture, firstly, of the cost structure, but I think more importantly, it's just the expansion of line capability that added a little bit more. Sure. I think you will see going forward a continued plan to invest downstream and value-added downstream processing. That has been a key part of our strategy to date and will continue to do so. And as one looks across our operating platform on the steel side, we see continued organic growth capability there. I do believe also we have an incredibly strong balance sheet, strong liquidity, our cash flow generation capability continues to improve through cycle and there will be, I think, a good balanced cash allocation strategy. Transactional growth will certainly be part of that. There appears to be a strong pipeline of opportunity in both pull-through manufacturing type operations on the market today along with steel assets. No, I think, Carlos, we remain incredibly bullish of the market for the rest of this year and into next year. On the demand side, it's just incredibly strong. You have a tight supply side right now. Inventories are at record low levels, I think MSCI data is 1.8 months, incredibly, incredibly low and there is no restocking capability there currently because there's just lack of availability to meet present demand. Mill lead times are stretched. You have -- imports have ticked up a little, but they're still moderated, and in all honestly, despite the large arbitrage availability, near-term availability for imports is still very, very, tight. So I don't see there being any ability for a surge there to take things over the top. And if you look at the second half of this year, there are a myriad of mill outages, both for just regular maintenance outages, but also for installation of new equipment [indiscernible] and those mills as they plan on their future expansion. So there's going to be a lot of steel actually coming offline in the second half, which is going to just tighten the supply/demand balance even more. So, I think for the rest of this year, it's a bullish market for us. Well, as you point out, it did increase albeit incrementally quarter-over-quarter, but the additional folks that we've brought on board, obviously, they've been ramping up and they need to be trained, and you won't see or wouldn't have seen a massive increase second quarter, but you will see that ramping up third and fourth quarter. Both, I believe Columbus and Butler will take their normal kind of full-day outages in the third, fourth quarter. Thank you. Yes. But just to touch on, David, you're right, the long-products markets have got incredibly hot here off late. Certainly, you're seeing that in the margin expansion. There has been a change there, whereby pricing tended to be adjusted in lockstep with any change in scrap, but as you've seen over the last few months, it's become a market-based, demand-based pricing scenario and margins have increased 150%, sometimes 200% on some products. So it is a very, very strong market for us today for sure across the space, merchants, beams, rail is stellar and engineered bar and honestly, I think we're pretty well closed there from an order book perspective for the rest of the year and going into next year; so a great market. That said, if you look at the kind of capacity in merchant shapes and beams in particular relative to through cycle consumption, that's one area, that is -- it's a kind of an overcapacity situation through the cycle. And therefore, I wouldn't envision us having any meaningful increase in hot side production of shapes. I think you will see us utilize excess hot metal capability that we've got in a couple of our mills on the long-product side, but again, it won't be a massive increase in capacity. Well, the simple answer to that is, no. The demand is incredibly strong across all our sectors. We can't make enough steel. There's massive pent-up demand, particularly on the automotive side. And as I said earlier, if you look at inventories right now, they're at very, very, very low levels on a historic basis and there is a pent-up demand. And if you talk to the large dealers out there, they just cannot get enough product and they would suggest there's going to be a couple of years before they actually catch up. So, we remain incredibly bullish for the rest of this year and going into next year. There is absolutely no doubt about it. There's a lot -- there seems to be this cloud over people's minds or heads, but we are in the trenches, we're talking to customers each and every day. I'm talking to customers each and every day. I think we have a good finger on the pulse and it's got legs, there's no doubt about it. Well, we've had a -- as many of you on the call know, I've had a very long-standing contrasting view to the overcapacity issue or situation. And what people have not been able to figure out or understand is that the US is one of the few if not the only countries that is steel short. Additional capacity is not our problem. In fact, our industry is doing the right thing. It needs to reinvest, it needs to get state-of-the-art equipment on board, both from a global competitive perspective because if you look at China, 85% of Chinese capacity today is less than 15 years old, it's modern. So our industry needs to invest and it needs to continue to invest in electric arc furnace-type production routes from a sustainability standpoint. So, in my humble opinion, when you have an industry that arguably has somewhere 95 million tons to 100 million tons of production capability, and a need in a normal market of at least 120 million tons, production capability is not the issue, imports are the issue and controlling them. And I think as I said earlier, we do believe the tools are in place. Section 201 will maintain a sort of barrier, even if the 232 tariffs get eroded. So I am not concerned about overcapacity one little bit. Some of the older antiquated high-cost integrated capabilities will remain offline and I think will offset the somewhat 6 million tons or so of new flat roll coming into our marketplace. Thanks, Phil. So again, Phil, from our intelligence, people are looking at a 17 million ton build rate this year and next year -- next year, sorry. That's an incredibly strong number. And I think as I suggested, when we talk to the dealers out there, when we look at the inventories, that is going to be -- the demand or the -- it's a pent-up demand there that's going to sustain things. The chip shortage for some maybe sort of hindering shipping capability. As I said earlier, very few of our auto platforms have been affected to date. So we've been fortunate, but if you think about it, okay, so chip shortages slow things down a little bit, the demand is still pent up, is still there, and it's just going to help expand this incredible cycle that we're on or in. Yes. Theresa whispered that across, sorry. On the energy side, it's a little bit of a mixed bag. Obviously, global pricing, energy prices have come up a little, rig counts are coming up a little. We're seeing improved kind of downhole OCTG requirements, so engineered bar, for instance, we supply rolled bar into the seamless tube market, that has been picking up, a little slower though on the kind of the infrastructure. The distribution pipeline is still very, very soft and the cancellation of a couple of pipelines here over the last few months have left inventory in the supply chain that's trying to get sort of reallocated across the country. So, OCTG, downhole strengthening, infrastructure, distribution line pipe is going to be a little soft for probably at least another 12 months. No, I think, again, we're executing on our plan that we've had in place for some time. Fortunately, we have a very, very good foundation through our omni-source recycling platform that has the capability of some 6 million tons, 7 million tons of capability. So supply of scrap is not going to be an issue for us for sure. And we're adding to that capability, as I said, in Mexico and some of those tons will flow up to Sinton and to our Columbus mill. So, I think we're in good shape on the scrap side of things. As Theresa suggested, we are using HPI and have been using a little bit more of that of late. We have IDI that people seem to forget. That's a very, very effective use for our Butler mill in particular, it's making about 260,000 tons of liquid iron that we put into our electric arc furnace each year. And just to emphasize, if you look across our steel platform, in total, pig iron is only -- I think, it's less than 8% of the total input. So yes, it's an impact, but not a massive one. Thank you, John. It's good to hear from you. There is absolutely no doubt that the team's focus has been the execution of Sinton and it's a very large-scale facility. Actually, if you jump on our website, we have a drone video that gets updated I think once a month and it's a colossal, phenomenal facility that's being built by the team down there. And so, the focus for sure has been execution, execution, execution. Nonetheless, we have other folks on our team that continue to look at transactional activity, and also, the individual mills, we have very talented teams that continue to look at areas of organic growth. So I think you'll certainly see just a continuation of that organic growth that you've seen in the last 25 years or so. From a Sinton standpoint, the new lines that you mentioned that parallels or just supports our long-term strategy of fully utilizing or building high levels of through cycle utilization. And so not only are those four new lines very effective uses of CapEx with very, very, very good returns, it allows those capital intense steel mill assets to run at a high utilization, as I said, through the cycle. And I think we've demonstrated clearly that that strategy allows us to have superior shipments, production capabilities in any market environment. We would imagine -- I think I've said it in the past, we don't see a Sintonasc greenfield project on our horizon. Transactional activity, there could be something meaningful there. Thank you, John. We've got a great team. A little bit of a market tailwind is not hurting either, but... Well, I don't think there's really any desire right now to rebuild. Firstly, people just can't get enough steel to satisfy their immediate needs, number one, domestically. And number two, the speculative risk associated with accumulating inventory in today's market environment is a -- it'd be a pretty gutsy call. Imports, as I said, despite the high arbitrage, there is very little available currently. The global markets are very, very strong and most of the material is being consumed within those markets. So there is not much available even if they wanted to. That said, the speculative risk of material flowing in and import delivery times are November, December, January, today. You don't want to take that risk. So, I don't see any rebuild in the near term and again, that's just another factor that's going to extend this cycle. And I would just add, if you look -- hopefully, when you look at our experience of growth over the years, it's always been very, very intentional I would say. I would say, it's also very disciplined, and we won't do a transaction at ludicrous numbers. We always look at through-cycle. So if we were to do a transaction today, it will be a good investment through the cycle not just based on today's crazy profitability that some may have. I think there will always be some element of imports for sure. It has been a long, long, long time. I think I don't know, mid-'70s or '80s or whenever, when imports were de minimis. We're not going to be a country that self-satisfies its demand in total. So imports are always going to be there. Today, we typically need -- 20% of demand is an import need. We just don't need 30 million tons or 30% imports. But I think if you -- all the discussion has been relatively near term, when I say near term six, nine months into next year. But people are not, I don't believe anyway, recognizing that the industry is in transition. And I think there is some paradigm shifts occurring that are going to retain a lot higher sort of health -- market health in our industry and a much higher margins going forward. You look at the leadership mindset today and the consolidation, the integrated industry is really focused on returning shareholder value. They are totally focused on consolidating and rationalizing their assets to make good business sense. And that's going to bring I think market health and market strength long term. USMCA has, I think, certainly for us been a market change in dynamic, where you see particularly the European automakers, a shift in their supply chain from imports to domestic sourcing. Again, we've been a very, very large beneficiary of that. So the market is changing for sure in this country, and as I said earlier, it needs more capacity, it needs state-of-the-art technological capability, low cost, sustainable low carbon footprint production routes. And so I am not fearful for a second about the capacity coming online, it's needed and it will benefit the North American manufacturer base in spades going forward. Thank you. Thank you, Daryl. I would just emphasize, well, firstly, thank you for those that are still on the call. Thank you for listening today to our thoughts and opinions anyway. It was an incredible quarter. We believe next quarter is going to be better even so. And that is driven certainly by the market tailwinds that we're experiencing, but it's also more importantly driven by the most phenomenal steel metals team in the world. They are an incredible bunch of individuals. We number 10,000 there. If you include their wives and partners and kids, we've got, I don't know, 25,000 people in the SDI family today. They all contribute to our success. So thank you to each and every one of them. Thank you to our customers. We can't do what we do without you. We've had some incredibly loyal support and I wish we could support them even more today because they are -- we are struggling to meet all their needs. So, thank you, everyone. Make it a great day, and be safe. Take care."

            "name": "Theresa Wagler",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. I'd like to add my sincere appreciation and congratulations to our entire Steel Dynamics team. As Mark said, we achieved numerous milestones, attained record second quarter performance with record revenues of $4.5 billion derived from record quarterly steel shipments, record fabrication shipments, and strong product pricing across all of our operating platforms. We achieved record quarterly operating income of $956 million and net income of $702 million, or $3.32 per diluted share and record cash flow from operations of $587 million, with record quarterly adjusted EBITDA of over $1 billion, a truly extraordinary performance. Our second quarter 2021 results included costs of approximately $23 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, associated with the construction of our Sinton, Texas flat rolled steel mill. Excluding these costs, second quarter 2021 adjusted net income was $719 million, or $3.40 per diluted share. Our second quarter revenues of $4.5 billion were 26% higher than sequential first quarter results with growth from all of our operating platforms, but most significantly from our steel operations based on record shipments and continued strong flat rolled steel selling values. Our second quarter 2021 operating income was $956 million, 61% higher than the first quarter results also driven by strong flat rolled steel pricing and robust demand more than offsetting increased scrap costs. As we discuss our business this morning, we continue to see positive industry fundamentals for 2021 and 2022, and we're confident in our forthcoming unique earnings catalysts. Our steel operations generated over $1 billion of operating income in the second quarter, 59% greater than first quarter sequential earnings as flat roll steel selling values continued to strengthen. We also saw expanded margins throughout our long product steel operations due to improved pricing and volume. We achieved record quarterly steel shipments of 2.9 million tons and our steel mills operated at 91% of their capability. We still have additional steel-market opportunity based on our existing annual steel shipping capability of over 13 million tons and when our new Texas steel mill is fully online, we will have over 6 million tons of availability. Operating income from our metals recycling operations with $51 million aligned with strong first quarter performance as domestic steel production improved further supporting ferrous scrap demand and pricing. The team continues to effectively lever the strength of our circular manufacturing operating model, benefiting both our steel and metals recycling operations by providing higher-quality scrap, which improves furnace efficiency, and by reducing Company-wide working capital requirements. Our fabrication operations once again achieved record shipments and expanded margins in the quarter as realized selling values more than offset continued higher steel input costs. Operating income was $28 million versus first quarter earnings of $10 million. Steel joists and deck demand remains very strong, as evidenced by our record customer order backlog and continued robust order activity. We expect steel fabrication earnings to continue to increase through the remainder of the year. Our cash generation continues to be strong based on our differentiated business model and highly variable-cost structure. At the end of the second quarter, we had liquidity of $2.3 billion comprised of cash of $1.1 billion, and our fully available unsecured revolver of $1.2 billion. During the second quarter of 2021, we generated record cash flow from operations of $587 million and $849 million during the first six months of the year, also a record. Working capital grew over $700 million in the first half of 2021 due to higher prices resulting in increased customer count and inventory values. During the first half of 2021, we've invested $587 million in capital investments, of which $489 million was invested in our new Texas flat roll steel mill. For the second half of 2021, we estimate capital investments will be roughly between $350 million and $400 million, of which, the Texas steel mill represents an estimated $300 million. Regarding shareholder distributions, we maintained our quarterly cash dividend at $0.26 per common share after increasing it 4% in the first quarter of this year. We also repurchased $393 million of our common stock representing 3% of outstanding shares. In July, we announced the Board's approval of an additional $1 billion share repurchase authorization demonstrating our confidence in Steel Dynamics' future cash flow generation. Since 2016, we've increased our cash dividend per share over 85% and we've repurchased over $1.6 billion of common stock representing 19% of our outstanding shares, while during the same timeframe we achieved an investment grade credit rating and maintained our growth Company profile by investing $2.8 billion in organic capital investments and funding $720 million in acquisitions. These actions reflect the strength of our capital foundation and consistently strong cash flow generation capability and the continued optimism and confidence in our future. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes strategic growth with shareholder distributions comprised of a base-positive dividend that's complemented with a variable share-repurchase program. We are squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable optimized long-term value creation. Sustainability is a part of our long-term value creation strategy and we are dedicated to our people, our communities, and our environment. We are committed to operating our business with the highest integrity and have been since our founding. Further committing to this path, we recently announced greenhouse gas reduction and renewable energy goals, including a goal for our steel mills to be carbon-neutral by 2050. To increase transparency, we have set interim milestones for 2025 and 2030. As Mark said, we've led the steel industry with our exclusive use of EAF technology, circular manufacturing model, and innovative solutions to increase efficiencies, reduce raw material usage, reuse secondary materials, and promote material conservation and recycling. We plan to sustain our leadership position by executing our sustainability goals through among other avenues, implementing emission reduction projects, improving energy management, increasing the use of renewable energy, and developing and supporting new innovative technologies. We have an actionable path that is more manageable and we believe considerably less expensive than what may lay ahead for the traditional blast furnace industry. Our sustainability and environmental impact strategy is an ongoing journey and we are moving forward with the intention to make a positive difference. We plan to continue to address these matters and to play a leadership role in developing innovative ways to reduce our impact on the environment. Additionally, for those that track our individual flat roll steel shipments, in the second quarter, our hot roll and our P&O sales -- or shipments, excuse me, were 719,000 tons. Our cold-rolled shipments were 150,000 tons and our coated shipments were 1,055,000 tons. With that, Mark? It also is being priced on current steel values and so that appreciates the total project cost as well. I think we should see that moderating because from the perspective of pricing, Mark's correct, we've had very strong steel pricing and volumes have increased, but now that we're at this level, I don't see there being significant draws for the second half of the year, although, we will be increasing working capital as Sinton ramps up. So Sinton could be as much as $150 million to $200 million of working capital in the next, call it, six to nine months. But I don't think that you're going to see as significant of a draw in working capital in the second half of the year as we experienced in the first half of the year. Good morning, Dave. From a shareholder distributions and capital allocation, so first and foremost, we definitely are a growth-oriented Company, and we intend to stay that way. But we believe, it's important during these periods of excess cash flow generation to provide increased distributions to shareholders. And as we've said in the past, we like to keep our dividend in a very manageable level. When Sinton is up and operational, you will see a significant increase in the dividend at that point, because we're going to have significantly higher through cycle cash flow. But until that time, and as we're generating excess cash, we will be utilizing the share buyback program as well. We think that's an important tool. However, we are very much focused on growth. As Mark mentioned, there are transaction opportunities today. There is quite an extensive pipeline, the teams are very busy, again, focused on manufacturing businesses, as well as potentially steel production assets as well. You're correct, the long-products utilization has improved nicely and we're seeing a lot of both good demand, and then also the commercial teams have been doing a good job of cross-selling those products and we've gotten some market share gains out of that as well. Mark, would you like to address the question, whether or not we want to grow in long products? So David, I know how you try to back into conversion costs and in the world where now we have a lot more processing versus just steel production, it's going to be harder and harder for you back into that number that way. So we had a considerable amount of more substrate coming into the system and having it coated versus directly from the steel production itself. And so where in as that makes it look like there is an increased conversion cost, there's actually not. It's just that we are processing more outside tons because there's such strong demand. And we can maybe try to unpack that a little bit better from quarter to quarter, but there were no significant increases in conversion costs. Yes. Based on engineering and some of the more detailed plans that we've received on the four lines, some of that's likely to be pushed from the fourth quarter into the first quarter. So next year without doing our detailed planning, you're likely to see capital expenditures of probably somewhere between $550 million and $600 million. Good morning. Thanks for the question. That was a very detailed question, I'm not sure I might be able to go into all of it at this point in time. We do have some things that we can't discuss yet. They're very exciting on the renewable energy side of the equation. There will be some capital dollars, obviously, spent as we look at efficiency projects and as we move toward more renewable energy and the carbon reduction itself. We really don't have estimates to be able to discuss this morning because there's still a lot of projects that are being vetted. We will be disclosing those items as we move forward but we have a very -- and this is the thing that we want everybody to understand how we're trying to differentiate ourselves in our carbon goals and in our renewable energy goals, is that, we are being very transparent. There is a clear path on how we're going to achieve 2025 and 2030, and as we're able to disclose some of these projects, we absolutely, Tristan, will be sharing these projects, but at this point in time it's just too early to do so. Well, the raw material strategy really is consistent from the perspective at least of what we're looking at today and that's we use really only about 20% to 25% pig iron in our flat roll mills, and so it's not as much as being advertised by maybe some of our peers today and that is being sourced obviously internationally. So, today, we use a mix of HPI as well and we'll continue to do that moving forward, but I don't see this strategy at this point in time or at least over the next near term changing dramatically. Mark? Michael, we won't go through the details spreads themselves. We will tell you that the spreads are based on mid-cycle spreads, so definitely not what we're experiencing today. And we're starting with a base hot roll to prime scrap kind of mix spread and then we build the value-added product mix off of that. And we are using what we've experienced historically, and then also looking forward at what the expectations are in those individual markets on a mid-cycle basis. So I'm sorry, we can't give you specific spreads, but it is showing that certain -- our expectations are that the volume operates very much like our Columbus and Butler facilities operate, that means that production and shipments tend to be at or near capacity on a mid-cycle basis. Yes, absolutely. So, yes Sinton will -- still expected to provide a tax shield this year as we're able to -- of the year of operations, be able to expense that successive investment. It likely will shield upwards of $350 plus million. However, our earnings are so strong, that we're still having tax payments that are required, this year. And I think we're estimating our effective tax rate to be about 15%. From the perspective of working capital, Sinton is likely to build working capital as it starts operations in the next six to nine months of somewhere between $150 million and $200 million. Outside of that, I would expect the rest of our operations working capital to remain fairly steady just given that our volumes have already picked up and pricing has been really strong as well. So, I don't see a lot of additional movement in working capital. It's a good question. Our balance sheet is extraordinarily strong. So even if you look at our net leverage or our gross leverage, either metric is solidly in the investment-grade arena. We have significant additional debt capacity and the capital structure, and so where in as, yes, it makes sense to keep some cash on the balance sheet, we also have things that we can spend that money on whether it's additional share repurchases as we expect to make in the second half of the year and it still won't hinder all of the growth expectations or projects that we think are available to us on the transaction side. So yes, we do keep dry powder at the same token, and there's still debt capacity as well."

And now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mark.\nMark Millett: Well, thank you, Tricia. Good morning, everybody. Hey, I had you folks on mute, but welcome to our first quarter '21 earnings call. We certainly appreciate you joining us today. I believe the entire Steel Dynamics team delivered a tremendous first quarter performance. It was filled with operating and financial records, including record net sales, operating income and adjusted EBITDA. It was an extraordinary performance yet again, driven by the dedication and passion of our teams. I'm incredibly proud to work with each of them. They're a special group, accomplishing exceptional things. Due to the continued commitment of our teams to one another, our families and our customers, we continue to operate safely amidst COVID-19. Operations have continued essentially unabated. We continue to closely monitor the situation and adapt as necessary to ensure our teams' health. The health and welfare of our teams is the highest priority. And I think each of them for their continued commitment to our safety. Because record results don't matter unless everyone goes home safely at the end of each day. The number of injuries and their severity improved in the first quarter '21 compared to last year. The teams are focused on reducing hazards and practices that could result in significant injury. Nothing is more important than the health and safety of our people. Safety is and always will be our number one value. Our safety performance continues to be significantly better than industry statistics. But our intent will always be the drive towards zero incident work environments. To achieve this, we must all continuously be aware of our surroundings and our fellow team members, keeping safety top of mind to control safety, both in the traditional sense as it relates to keeping one another in good health. Before I continue further, Theresa will provide insights into our recent performance. So Theresa?\nTheresa Wagler: Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. I want to add my sincere appreciation and congratulations to the entire Steel Dynamics team. As Mark said we achieved numerous milestones and delivered a record first quarter performance. We achieved record revenues of $3.5 billion derived from near record quarterly steel shipments, record fabrication shipments and strong product pricing across all of our operating platforms. We achieved record quarterly operating income of $594 million and net income of $431 million or $2.03 per diluted share. And we had strong cash flow from operations of $262 million with a record quarterly adjusted EBITDA of $664 million, truly an extraordinary performance. Our first quarter 2021 results included costs of approximately $20 million or $0.07 per diluted share associated with the construction of our Sinton Texas Flat Roll Steel Mill. Excluding these costs, first quarter 2021 adjusted net income was $445 million or $2.10 per diluted share above our guidance of $1.94 to $1.98 due to stronger than anticipated March steel shipments as order activity remains very strong. Our first quarter 2021 revenues of $3.5 billion were 36% higher than sequential fourth quarter results, with growth from all of our operating platforms, and most significantly from our steel and metal recycling operations based on record flat roll steel selling values and strong shipments. Our first quarter 2021 operating income was $594 million, $335 million, or 130% higher than sequential fourth quarter results due to higher real life flat roll steel pricing more than offsetting increased scrap costs. As we discuss our business this morning, you'll find we continue to see positive industry fundamentals for the remainder of 2021. And we are confident in our fourth coming unique earnings catalysts. For steel operations we generated $641 million of operating income in the first quarter more than double fourth quarter sequential earnings as flat roll steel selling values increased significantly to record levels throughout the first quarter, driving expanded metal margins. We also saw expanded margins within our long products operations based on higher prices. First quarter steel shipments of 2.8 million tons were 6% above our sequential fourth quarter volume and only 25,000 tons less than our quarterly record set in the first quarter of 2020. Our steel mills operated at 93% of their capability during the quarter well above the industry average of 77%. As a reminder, we still have additional market share opportunity based on our existing annual steel shipping capability of over 13 million tons and when we finish our new Texas steel mill and it's fully online, we'll have over 16 million tons. As domestic steel production increased scrap demand strengthened in the first quarter, resulting in significantly higher scrap prices and resulting metal spread expansion. Operating income from our mills recycling operations was $54 million, nearly 100% improvement sequentially. The team continues to effectively lever the strength of our vertically connected operating model benefiting both our steel and metals recycling operations by providing higher quality scrap, which improves furnace efficiency and by reducing companywide working capital requirements. Despite record first quarter 2021 shipments for our steel fabrication segment, first quarter operating income was $10 million, compared to sequential fourth quarter earnings of $25 million. Lower earnings were the result of metal spread compression, as higher average selling values were offset by significantly higher steel input costs. As evidenced through our record shipments, record order backlog and extremely strong continued order activity, lower first quarter earnings is not reflective of a weaker demand environment. It is a matter of timing, as higher steel costs are being matched with a six-month order backlog in which joist and deck prices were lower. This will begin to reverse in the coming months as current steel joist and deck prices have increased considerably. Our cash generation continues to be strong based on our differentiated business model and highly variable cost structure. During the first quarter of 2021, we generated cash flow from operations of $262 million. Operational working capital grew $411 million during the quarter driven by higher customer account and inventory values due to increased pricing in shipments. During the quarter we also invested $310 million in capital investments, of which $254 million was invested in our new Texas flat roll steel mill. For the remainder of 2021, we estimate capital investments will be roughly $650 million to $700 million, with the Texas steel mill representing about $535 million of that amount. This estimate does not include spending for construction or the recently announced four flat roll steel coating lines. We believe the lines will cost between $400 million and $425 million combined, and we will likely fund between $50 million to $75 million for engineering and down payments late this year. The lines are currently planned to begin operating sometime in the second half of 2022. In February, we also increased our cash dividend 4% to $0.26 per common share based on our ability to consistently generate strong cash. Since 2016, we've increased our cash dividend over 85% and invested $1.3 billion in our common stock, representing over 15% of our outstanding shares. We have $444 million that remain authorized for share repurchases. These actions reflect the strength of our capital foundation, consistent cash flow generation, strong liquidity profile and the continued optimism and confidence in our future. We're in a position of strength, with liquidity over $2.4 billion at the end of the quarter, comprised of cash of $1.2 billion and our fully available unsecured revolver of $1.2 billion. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes responsible strategic growth with shareholder distributions comprised of the base positive dividend profile that is complemented with a variable share repurchase program, while also being dedicated to preserving our investment grade credit rating. We're squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable optimized long-term value creation. And we believe sustainability is a part of our long-term value creation. And we're dedicated to our people, our communities and our environment. We're committed to operating our business with the highest integrity and have been since our founding. We produce steel using only Electric Arc Furnace technology with recycled ferrous scrap as the primary raw material. EAS steel production technology currently has the least environmental impact, is the most cost effective and provides the most operational flexibility. With the addition of our mills recycling and fabrication platforms, we intentionally developed a vertically connected operating model crane and almost closed loop manufacturing business, which both benefits us financially and reduces our environmental impact. In 2020, we shared our qualitative climate related goals and our most recent sustainability report. This summer, we also plan to adopt quantitative goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, participate in greater renewable energy use and continue to invest in energy efficiency opportunities. We're currently in the process of assessing the use of renewable energy alternatives at our steel mills. Our sustainability and environmental impact strategy is an ongoing journey. And we're moving forward with the intention to make a positive difference. We plan to continue to address these matters and to play a leadership role in developing innovative ways to reduce our impact on the environment. For those of you that use our detailed shipments for the flat roll product for your models, in the first quarter of 2021, we have hot-rolled P&O shipments of 774,000 tons, cold-rolled of 149,000 tons and coated of 996,000 tons. On a personal note, I just want to continue to thank the teams for operating safely and for taking care of one another from a health perspective as well. Mark?\nMark Millett: Thanks Theresa. Taking on operating platforms in turn, the steel fabrication platform delivered a strong performance, achieving record quality shipments while navigating rapidly escalating steel input costs, higher steel costs compressed first quarter steel fabrication earnings due to a matching six-month order backlog to more current steel prices. However, based on the strength of steel joist and deck and demand we're currently placing orders at record prices. Our order activity is extremely strong. We ended March with a record fabrication order backlog that is over 50% higher than our previous peak. The non-residential construction market remains strong especially in areas that support online retail, computing activities and healthcare, specifically represented by construction of large distribution and warehouse facilities. Driven large part to changes in consumer behavior, we believe this dynamic will continue for the next several years. We already have steel fabrication facilities located throughout the US and in Mexico, providing us with an advantaged broad based customer supply chain. In order to serve increased customer demand, we will be expanding our production capability. For us it is not necessary to add physical assets, we simply will be providing jobs to additional team members to support increased operating hours, thereby further improving asset utilization. These new crews will be trained and become active between now and late summer '21, increasing our annual production capability by as much as 25% to 30% or over 100,000 tons. Our metals recycling operations had an extremely strong quarter with quarterly operating income of $54 million, nearly doubling sequential fourth quarter earnings and over five times higher than prior year first quarter earnings. Strong ferrous demand and increased pricing related to higher domestic steel production drove strong performance. Prime scrap index pricing increased over $170 per gross ton during the first quarter. Prime scrap generation is strong based on North American manufacturing. We expect North American scrap generation to outpace increased demand from steelmaking in 2021. Obsolete scrap generation has also been strong post the extreme February weather conditions. Based on continued solid scrap generation, we believe scrap pricing will remain somewhat steady during the rest of the year. As Theresa mentioned, the steel team had an outstanding quarter, achieving numerous operating and financial records. We achieved near record shipments, just 1% less than our first quarter 2020 record, and up 6% sequentially. We achieved record quarterly operating income of $641 million, over 10% higher than our previous peak. So many contributed to these incredible achievements, including our commercial teams, our other operating platforms, suppliers and especially our loyal customers. While the domestic steel industry operated at an increased utilization rate of 77% during the first quarter, the strength of our differentiated business model, combined with a passion of our people drove our steel production utilization to 93%. Steel demand is strong across the steel platform, including both flat and long steel products. However, the flat roll steel markets remain especially tight. Underlying demand for flat roll steel products recovered much more quickly than expected in the second half of last year and gained further momentum in this recent first quarter. When coupled with historically low customer inventory levels across the supply chain, flat roll steel prices have been supported at historically high levels and customers are placing orders for immediate demand requirements. They have not rebuilt inventories since the speculative risk associated with the accumulation of higher priced inventory is a significant deterrent, even if it was available. Additionally, we believe current legislative steel trade policies will continue to moderate steel imports. The current US administration has also commented constructively concerning trade parameters and the issues with China. From an end market perspective, the automotive sector has experienced the strongest recovery operating at very high production levels due to low inventories coupled with strong consumer demand. March's seasonally adjusted production represented almost 18 million units and inventories were close to 30% below the five-year average. We've been fortunate that our automotive order book has not seen any significant impact from the current electronic chip shortens. The non-residential construction sector remains strong with continued positive momentum, as evidenced by record structural and rail division shipments, record steel fabrication shipments and strong customer backlogs. We expect this strength to continue through the rest of this year and certainly into next year. Residential construction has also been strong, producing high demand for related HVAC and appliance products. In addition to supporting high non-residential construction demand, the growing online retail shift is supporting steel demand strength throughout the supply chain service providers such as truck trailer and material handling. We're also seeing healthy demand from mining and yellow goods customers that are engineered by our products division. In the energy sector, solar is a substantially growing market. And we're also seeing some indications of improved oil and gas activity. We continue on our successful track record and margin enhancing differentiated growth. We have executed numerous strategic investments across the company in the last several years. And we continue to position Steel Dynamics for the future. Our teams and our customers are extremely excited about our Sinton Texas Electric Arc Furnace Flat Roll Steel Mill investment. It represents a transformational step function increase in Steel Dynamics through cycle cash flow generation capability. It provides next generation electric arc furnace steel production capabilities, new products and new customers. The facility is designed to have product capabilities beyond that of existing electric arc furnace flat roll steel producers competing even more effectively with a higher carbon emitting integrated steel model and foreign competition. It provides us with a broader steel portfolio and provides our customers with an even larger climate conscious supply option. The team's momentum is unbelievable and to be admired. We have an incredible depth of experience in the construction, startup and operation of large steel manufacturing assets. Collectively, we likely have more relevant experience than any other company in the industry. And construction is going extremely well. The new 3-million-ton state of the art flat roll steel mill will include two value added coating lines comprise the 550,000 ton galvanizing line with Galvalume capability and a 250,000 paint line. We plan for these two value-added coating lines to begin operating by the end of the second quarter '21 using flat roll substrate that had full operations. Our Sinton Electric Arc Furnace Steel Mill is adhering to the same stringent sustainability model as our other steelmaking facilities, utilizing state of the art environmental controls and processes to produce high quality sustainable lower carbon steel. Our steel mills have a fraction of the greenhouse gas emission and energy intensity of average traditional steelmaking technology. The Sinton provides a strategic location near Corpus Christi. We have three targeted regional commercial markets for unused steel mill which represents over 27 million tons of relevant flat roll steel consumption in the southern and western United States and Mexico. We also plan to effectively compete with steel imports. Our customers are excited to have a regional flat roll steel supplier. We have four customers committed to locate on site representing over 1.3 million tons of annual processing and consumption capability. We're still speaking with several other potential on site customers, as well as those that are building facilities off site yet near our campus. Our location provides a significant free benefit to most of our intended flat roll customers. Compared to the current domestic supply options, we believe that potential customer savings would be at least $20 to $30 per ton and some would be much higher. Coupled with much shorter lead times we can provide a superior customer supply chain solution. It also allows us to effectively compete with imports, which inherently have long lead times and speckled that price risk. We've also made considerable progress concerning our raw material procurement strategy. We completed the acquisition of a Mexican scrap company last August, which was a critical step for us. The acquisition complements our current metals recycling business in both the US and Mexico. The operations are strategically located near high volume industrial scrap sources throughout Central and Northern Mexico. They have an estimated annual scrap processing capability of almost 2 million gross tons. We also acquired three small scrap locations in the Houston and Corpus Christi area to help serve Sinton's raw material needs. Our performance based operating culture, coupled with our considerable experience in successfully constructing and operating highly profitable steel assets, positions us incredibly well to successfully execute this transformational growth. As we've said before, we're not simply adding a flat roll steel production capacity. We have a differentiated product offering a unique regional supply chain solution, a significant geographic freight and lead time advantage and offer an import sustainable alternative to a regional in need of options. We've also recently announced plans to add four additional value-added flat roll coating lines, comprised with two new paint lines and two new galvanizing lines with Galvalume coating capability. Galvalume products represent the fastest growing flat roll steel market in the United States, primarily serving the metal building industry. This market is historically sourced as much as 45% of the needs from foreign imports. Our preferred cost effective supply chain has resulted in our existing lines consistently running at full capacity through both increased consumption and market share again. Two of these lines will be located in the southern US region to be comprised of a new paint line, and a galvanizing slash Galvalume line, with a combined annual coating capacity of 540,000 tons, requiring an estimated investment of $225 million. These lines will provide Sinton with similar diversification and higher margin product capabilities as our Butler in Columbus flat roll steel divisions. The remaining two lines will be located in the Midwest, and will also be comprised of a paint line and galvanizing line with Galvalume capability with a combined annual coating capacity of 540,000 tons and will require an investment of between $175 million and $200 million. These lines will support our regional flat roll steel operations, providing them with more value-added product diversification to serve our customer needs. We currently believe these lines will begin operating in the second half of '22. Our strategy consistently places value added products and supply chain differentiation of the four and has benefit us well, both through good and poor markets. In closing, our culture and the execution of a long-term strategy continues to strengthen our financial position through consistent strong cash flow generation and long-term value creation, clearly demonstrating our sustainability and differentiating us from our competition. Our amazing teams provide the foundation for success. I thank each of them for their passion and dedication to each other and our other stakeholders. To each of you, please remember that your health and safety is always the most important issue at hand. I thank you for all you do. Your spirit of excellence drives us to success. With that said Darrell, would you please open the floor for questions?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first questions come from the line of Sathish Kasinathan of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.\nSathish Kasinathan: Yeah, hi, good morning, Mark and Teresa. Thanks for taking my questions. So my question is on the flat roll steel pricing. In the past you have indicated that the flat rolled steel pricing typically lags by two months based on your mix of spot or index-based contracts. Given the external lead times, delivery delays and maybe changes to the contract mix, what would the lag be in terms of today's market?\nTheresa Wagler: That's a great question Sathish. So in the first quarter generally, we're somewhere between probably 55% to 60% contract business in any given quarter related to just our flat roll operations. But because of the way that contracts have minimum and maximum volumes, in the first quarter, we actually had probably a little over 70% of our mix was contract related. So it was more than we typically would have. However, going into the second quarter, you're likely to see that moderate back to a 60% to 65%. And so we think it'll get closer to what we normally see. And the lag is generally around two months.\nSathish Kasinathan: Okay. Sorry. Just one follow up question if I may. At Sinton do you have like a target base load for the mill? And in terms of ongoing discussions with other customers, could you be able to quantify what the potential incremental volumes could be compared to the 1.3 million tons already committed?\nTheresa Wagler: We had the update - the customers that have committed to be on site. There's four in place today that represent just over 1.3 million tons. We're currently having discussions with at least two others. Mark, I don't know if you want to comment on the additional volume that may come with that or not?\nMark Millett: Well, we would anticipate, I think, at the end of the day, with seven customers on site, it's been absolutely incredible, the excitement that we've seen, and we've been very, very intentional as to the type of customers such that we have a broad spectrum of processing capability. So light gauge processing capability, heavy gauge, hot band, automotive, and also pipe consumers and other fabricators. So I would imagine at the end of the day, again, that 1.3 million tons will grow. Again, that's not all consumption. A lot of it is processing capability. But it should end up being perhaps 1.4 million tons by the time we're done.\nTheresa Wagler: And just to add to that Sathish, we've actually had several customers that were not able to locate with us on site because of area constraints, et cetera. But there are those that are moving contingent or contiguous to the site. So there is a lot of excitement among the customer group.\nSathish Kasinathan: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Seth Rosenfeld with Exane BNP Paribas. Please proceed with your question.\nSeth Rosenfeld: Good morning, I guess the follow up please with regard to Sinton, can you provide any update or more details on the ramp up schedule for the facility, and when exactly you would expect to reach full utilization of 3 million tons? I think last quarter you noted downstream lines began ramp in late Q2 up in early Q3. Any update on those figures, please?\nMark Millett: Certainly, I think the downstream lines, as we've said in the past will come up before the hot side, but the paint line, the galv line and pickle line, we believe will stop commissioning in June, with some limited shipments beginning in July. I think generally, volumes will be a little constrained through those three lines due to the strong SDI backlog right now and a limited availability of third-party volume. It was our anticipation some time ago that we will be transferring tons down there. But again, it's a good and a bad situation. Our mills are absolutely jam packed with orders. And again, it's tough to get third party supply. But those will be commissioned on time and we'll start to see incremental shipments in the third and fourth quarter. The hot strip mill obviously is of prime importance to get that up and running. That it will be commissioned in September. And I would expect the shipments to commence in Q4 and one has to recognize that as we start the mill up, we'll be also hiring to build working process inventory. So not every ton produced will be shipped. But I would imagine volume to be around 150,000 to 200,000 tons for the fourth quarter. For 2022, the expectation is still to ship around about 80% of eventual capability, so somewhere between 2.2 million to 2.4 million tons.\nTheresa Wagler: And that's from a full utilization as we run Columbus and Butler, basically at full or over full capacity. We don't see any reason why could achieve that in the 2023 timeframe.\nSeth Rosenfeld: Thank you, just a follow up with regards to the 2022 guidance, is the view that you'd be at the 80% run rate on an annual basis by the end of '22, or calendar '22, you expect that 2.2 million to 2.4 million ton out the door?\nMark Millett: No, we would expect 2.2 million to 2.4 million tons of actual shipments.\nSeth Rosenfeld: Wonderful, thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Emily Chang with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions.\nEmily Chang: Good morning, Mark and Teresa. My first question is just around sort of the capital allocation strategy. As you have the startup of Sinton quickly approaching and coupled with what looks like a phenomenal year for steel prices, how should we be thinking about longer term capital allocation policy? Should we be expecting more growth spend above and beyond the cutting line investments that you've recently announced? Or will there be maybe a more meaningful pivot to shareholder returns?\nMark Millett: Well, I think generally our cash allocation strategy has been pretty consistent over time, and will continue to be so. We'll still be focused on retaining a conservative perspective regarding balance sheet structure and liquidity to fully support our investment grade profile. Our through cycle cash generation capability will remain strong, and obviously, with Sinton and with the additional projects will increase dramatically. And I think the exciting thing is, as you point out, we're going to have a lot of cash to allocate. We'll continue growth. We've announced our four new lines, again, a little sort of head of our own personal - sort of timeframe, to help diversify that mill dramatically along the lines of Butler and Columbus. But there will be significant cash remaining after that growth. We'll continue to have a positive dividend profile, cash dividend profile. And as you've seen in the past, when we have a step function increase in through cycle cash generation capability, we do quite a meaningful bump. So I would expect that to happen in the future the next year. And obviously, to supplement that that shareholder return was continuing to look at share buybacks.\nTheresa Wagler: I would just add, so there are transactional opportunities as well. And so we are a growth company. And so there is the organic side, which I think Sinton represents the largest project, and that we've had. But as you think about transaction opportunities, whether it's in manufacturing businesses that utilize our steel as raw material input, or whether it even the steel production assets perhaps that's something definitely we can differentiate the business and improve the business and add a lot of value. We're still very interested in things like that as well.\nEmily Chang: That's very helpful. And if I can squeeze in a quick follow up just on the infrastructure plan that's being floated right now. Any sort of early thoughts on what that could mean for steel demand longer term and your views as to whether or not there's sufficient capacity to meet this longer term?\nMark Millett: Well, it's difficult to tell exactly what that sort of incremental volume is. You see 3 million, 4 million tons being bantered around. I can't say that we've fully analyzed that. But obviously, there will be improved demand. There's obviously a major sort of clean energy aspect to it. So solar, I think will help steel consumption demand and certainly our activities at Steel of West Virginia are already benefiting from that. I think beyond the actual sort of steel consumption perspective just the overall economic benefit from that and from other stimuli the economy is going great guns today and it's just going to keep it going. So it's an exciting time.\nEmily Chang: And I think that's really helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Gagliano: Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wonder if we could switch gears to kind of current market conditions and looking ahead a bit here. Obviously, we've got this extremely tight market, record high prices, lead times still extended and we've seen a lot of I think low hanging fruit on the capacity side now restarted and everything still very tight. So typically, one of the ways you saw for this is imports. And I'm wondering if you could just comment on why this time should be different with regards to import flows being somewhat constrained. Given that we're at record high regional premiums, I think there's very good reasons for it. I was just wondering if you could share your thoughts. Thanks.\nMark Millett: Well, again from our perspective, and there are those - I saw some commentary sort of questioning demand. Demand out there is absolutely phenomenal, across almost every sector. Very, very strong and it would appear to be there for the rest of this year going into next. As you mentioned, most of the - if not all, the reasonable production capability in the US has returned. I think any further additions will be limited. There are sort of additions coming in later this year. Ours will start shipments in the fourth quarter, as I said, but nothing major on the plus side. And it's going to be offset in all honesty, if you look at the maintenance outages in the integrated industry and some shutdowns on the minimal side of things, supply side will absolutely remain tight. So as a great balance will support the market. The issue in the past has been import increases. And I don't think you'll see - you're going to see material increase. It is picking up, there's no doubt about that. But you've got a world economy. Europe is strong, China is strong, most markets are in great shape and so the import availability today is not there. You may get the arbitrage to become more attractive perhaps on the surface. But the availability and the lead times are stretched out. And very few people are going to want to take that speculative risk buying whatever 1,400 bucks today, just taking that risk for that to tumble later in the year. We don't see that though. So we see strong demand, tight supply, record low supply chain inventories across the space. And I think imports - moderate levels of imports that will be continued to be supported by the administration. Actually, I think the commentary relative to trade is very, very positive. Today they recognize that we've been at a kind of a financial war with China for a long time. And they recognize the issues there and I don't think that the 232 tariffs will be unwound in totality. They may take a slightly different shape, but trade constraint will remain in the years ahead. So I think it's a remarkable environment that we're in today. And I think it's just wherever you look anecdotally - housing, there are no houses to be bought today. Or you saw a pickup in the residential markets in March. And that will continue and as playing strength in HVAC and appliance. If you go try and buy a refrigerator today or washing machine, you're probably going to have to wait four or five months for one that you actually want. So just everywhere you look in the supply chain things are stretched and will kind of prolong these cycles. So we're incredibly bullish, I mean it's - we had a phenomenal first quarter. I think the second quarter is going to be multiples of phenomenal and is going to be a great year.\nDavid Gagliano: Alright, that's helpful. Thanks for the additional color there. If I could just squeeze one more in as well, just switching back to what Teresa said earlier about use of cash down the road and transactional opportunities. I think you mentioned manufacturing business and/or still production assets. I'm not going to put you on the spot-on assets or anything like that. Just the question I'm really wondering is - you didn't mention organic steel production, so is it reasonable to assume that organic steel production, incremental organic steel production is off the table for now?\nMark Millett: I would say on the hot side for sure. Downstream, coating, value-add there's still I think, a myriad of opportunities for us. But if you look at Sinton for - that investment, that project is very, very, very unique both from a product standpoint, but also sort of a market or regional market standpoint. And that's what persuaded us to move forward there. I don't believe there are those types of opportunities available today. Yeah, if there's - there may be incremental where we'll take existing hot metal capability and add assets to use that existing capability. But I don't believe you'll see us - I'm pretty sure you won't see us building green - any more greenfield hot sites.\nDavid Gagliano: Okay, that's helpful. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andreas Bokkenheuser with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.\nAndreas Bokkenheuser: Thank you very much. Just a couple of questions from me and following up on the last comments. We obviously saw flat roll steel shipments declined a little bit year-on-year. I think you've hit 1.9, not significantly below, but is that because production constraints that shipments actually fell year-on-year? That's the first question.\nTheresa Wagler: Andreas, are you talking specifically about Steel Dynamics and our first quarter shipments?\nAndreas Bokkenheuser: Yeah.\nTheresa Wagler: Yeah. So it was a direct result of two of our steel divisions. We actually had improvement over all of our operations, except for Roanoke Bar Division and the Steel of West Virginia Division. And there have been some good improvements made there commercially and the team is doing incredibly well. And they think you're going to see a big shift and change in that. But that specifically, it wasn't anything that was noteworthy, and it was only about 25,000 tons difference, I think.\nAndreas Bokkenheuser: Yeah. No, that's what I figured. Okay, that's very clear. And the second question, I mean, obviously, there's been a lot of talk in the market in recent quarters about the tightness of prime scrap and how the prime scrap market is going to grow even tighter with the EAF capacitors coming online, and so on so forth. And I'm sure you've seen some commentary, some people saying that EAFs are going to be the next high cost producers in the market and scrap prices are going to keep rolling and so on so forth. Where do you guys come down on all of this? I mean, effectively, is this just a question about you go a little bit further on the radius and basically collect a bit more prime scrap from other manufacturers and then there's sufficient supply of prime scrap for anybody who's willing to go a little bit further or do you see an actual amount of tightness in the market just given that manufacturing especially auto production is under pressure in the years to come?\nMark Millett: Firstly, I would suggest that scrap is an incredibly efficient market. It's probably the most effective commodity. I do believe that yes, there's additional capacity electrical arc furnace capacity come online. But if you do the math, you may need to find about - somewhere around 4 million tons of additional prime scrap. You also have to offset that a little bit because people forget the integrated mills use scrap, they use prime scrap and so with the reduced capacity there, there's a little less consumed on the integrated side of things. But I think if you look at the scrap market in general, we - even in these recent times we're exporting in around 12 million, 15 million tons a year. There have been times when we've exported 20 million tons a year. So scrap is certainly available. It may appreciate in price to some degree, but I don't believe you're going to see any significant issues from a profitability or a cost perspective for the electric arc furnace community.\nTheresa Wagler: Andreas, as we look at -\nAndreas Bokkenheuser: That is very clear. Sorry, go ahead.\nTheresa Wagler: We pull together what we believe to be scrap generation over the coming years, and we added in new capacity related to electric arc furnaces. The scrap generation, both including prime scrap as well as prime scrap substitutes with a lot of the additional projects coming on line, we believe will outpace the increased demand. Though I know there's different philosophies being touted about out there right now. But that was our original promise and we still believe in that.\nAndreas Bokkenheuser: Yeah. No, that makes a lot of sense. And I think your 4 million ton estimate is very much also in line with our own. So thank you very much for your comments.\nMark Millett: I think actually one more thing because, as they say, necessity is the mother of invention. And given the remarkable spread between prime scrap and obsolete today, our mills and I'm sure all of our competition is doing the same thing. But they are creating new mixes. And we've actually reduced our prime scrap requirements probably by over 10%, maybe more at our flat roll facilities. If the whole industry, electric arc furnace flat roll producing industry would to do that obviously, that's a meaningful reduction as well.\nAndreas Bokkenheuser: Thank you for the -\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is comfortable a line of Carlos de Alba with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nCarlos de Alba: Yeah, thank you very much. Just on the fabrication business. I think last quarter it was mentioned that the first quarter would be the bottom of the profitability cycle there. If I understood correctly, you said that this month probably - from this month on probably you start to see a margin expansion. So in fact can you elaborate a little bit more so that we fully understand where are we in the fabrication business profitability cycle? Yeah.\nTheresa Wagler: Yeah. Absolutely. Good morning. So from the steel fabrication, we're likely to see March and April be the drought months as we are working through or have worked through the order backlog. Today, steel and steel deck - steel joist and steel deck prices are actually at all-time record highs and demand is extraordinary. So one should see that starts to develop, it's already into a record backlog that's reaching into the fourth quarter of 2021. And you're likely to see a better second quarter, but in the second half of the year, it could be quite powerful from an earnings perspective.\nCarlos de Alba: Perfect. And if I made just a clarification on the CapEx, it is not much, but the Midwest. Two new coated lines are expected to cost a little bit more than those in the south. What is the reason for that if I may ask?\nTheresa Wagler: Yeah. Carlos, it's actually opposite. And we may have said it wrong. The $225 million lines are likely to be in the south. And the $175 million to $200 million lines are likely to be in the Midwest. Mark, do you want to talk about the technical differences between the sets of lines, why one might be higher than the other?\nMark Millett: Well, quite simply one has a slightly higher product capability. The ones in the south tend to have some automotive capability. Whereas the one in the Midwest will be more building product targeted.\nTheresa Wagler: I think has a little to do with the infrastructure that's possibly required as well.\nCarlos de Alba: All right, thank you very much. Good luck in the quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Timna Tanners with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.\nTimna Tanners: Hey, guys, good morning. Wanted to ask just really about production to follow up, so two things. One is your first quarter production, flat rolled products were down year-over-year and I thought I heard you say that it was a result of Roanoke and West Virginia which are long product. So I was kind of confused. I would assume and I think the big question for a lot of people in the industry is why are the mills not running full out given record prices? And yet you guys were down year-over-year and down from third quarter in flat roll. So just wondering what to think about that and how to model volumes going forward?\nTheresa Wagler: Well, first of all, I'll just jump in. I thought Andreas was talking about shipments not production. So if I got that wrong that was my fault. Mark, you want to talk about the production side of things. We suffice it to say, Timna that we are running as hard as we can at both Butler and at Columbus. We aren't without some of our hiccups along the way as well. But we've rectified those and yeah.\nMark Millett: I think there's also an impact a little bit on the product mix and also on shipments from a standpoint of transportation. Logistics is a little tough right now. And we have greater opportunity for shipments than we actually ended up.\nTimna Tanners: Okay, so upside from Q1 it sounds like. Thank you for that. And then Sinton, I was looking through my notes and I have a couple years ago, so maybe it's dated, but if you had said pretty clearly and talked about being able to ramp up quickly. So we had modeled a little more aggressive ramp up to be honest on Sinton, I have in my notes that you said within six months, you'd be at 80% of that. So I'm just wondering is there any reason for kind of the push out in timing and also just in the 2022 forecast you touted in the past inability to ramp up quickly and talked about your track record doing so. But so I was surprised that to 2.2 out of 3 million tons next year, thanks.\nMark Millett: Well, 2.2 million, 2.4 million tons is 80% of 3 million tons capability, Timna. And I think the team hitting that will be a remarkable feat.\nTimna Tanners: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nPhil Gibbs: Thanks. Good morning.\nMark Millett: Good morning.\nPhil Gibbs: And Mark, can you talk a little bit about automotive? I mean, there's a lot swirling given the chip shortages and the downtime at the - at some of the domestic and after producers. Even globally, you said your shipments remain strong. Obviously, the demand side of equation is very strong to your point. So I'm just trying to understand how this ultimately all plays out. Do you think the OEs despite all this were short on inventory, that's why they continue to take volume, maybe just help us think through this?\nMark Millett: I think the sort of end demand for vehicles today is incredibly strong. And the few dealers that I talked to are struggling to get inventory and feel that it's - that that strength is going to remain for some time. I think they were generally projecting somewhere between 17 million and 18 million units for the year. And the best prognostications are that the chip shortage may impact that by a million and a half. I'm not sure. All I can say is through our lens, and it's quite fortuitous, I guess. But the plants that are down are not ones that we supply. So we have not seen any material impact from a shipping standpoint. We have seen a slight impact on the scrap side. So I think you're going to see - whereas we anticipated that softening a little bit in the last month - for this month. I think prime scrap is probably going to be firm, maybe up a little. But then again, it's too early to tell the buy is still a couple of weeks ahead. But no major impact for us so far.\nPhil Gibbs: Thanks Mark. And then on the engineered bar side you had a nice pickup in volume, very strong sequentially and up nicely year-on-year. Yeah, how much of that do you think is driven by automotive? I can't remember how much of your mix there is in that silo and yeah, how much is that - you think is related to the yellow good commentary you made?\nMark Millett: Well, I think there's a general impact across the space. We've seen a little greater activity sort of seams pipe for the for the energy markets, yellow goods is stronger, manufacturing is strong. But I would say the principal growth and target for that growth there has been automotive. I think we're around about 20% of the mix there right now. And if you remember some years ago, we installed a smaller diameter mill and that utilization is picking up quite dramatically.\nPhil Gibbs: Thanks Mark. And if I could squeeze in one more here, lumber prices have been obviously astronomically high the last six to nine months. Steel prices have followed the trend, obviously. How much in some cases are you seeing substitution into steel, particularly as it relates to your fabrication book? And maybe some other things as competing products become more expensive as well? Thanks very much.\nMark Millett: Well, we've not seen any - at least I don't - I'm not aware of seeing any substitution threat right now. Obviously, all materials have come up together. But then again steel products are quite unique to replace - in the steel warehouse space where they want large spans, you obviously can't do that with lumber. You may see lumber substitution in high rise buildings in the past, but not in the growth area of distribution warehouses and that sort of thing.\nPhil Gibbs: Thanks Mark.\nOperator: Back concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Miller for any closing remarks.\nMark Millett: Well, super. For those that remain on the call, we certainly appreciate your time today and you're support of our company. For our employees, again, hats off to you, it was an absolutely phenomenal quarter and ask you to look after each other out there and be safe. And again, we wouldn't be able to have a phenomenal quarter without our customer base. We got some loyal phenomenal people that we worked with, that we partnered with over the years. So thank you, each and every one of you. With that said, make it a great day and be safe.\nOperator: Once again ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation. Have a great and safe day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mark Millett",
            "content": "Well, thank you, Tricia. Good morning, everybody. Hey, I had you folks on mute, but welcome to our first quarter '21 earnings call. We certainly appreciate you joining us today. I believe the entire Steel Dynamics team delivered a tremendous first quarter performance. It was filled with operating and financial records, including record net sales, operating income and adjusted EBITDA. It was an extraordinary performance yet again, driven by the dedication and passion of our teams. I'm incredibly proud to work with each of them. They're a special group, accomplishing exceptional things. Due to the continued commitment of our teams to one another, our families and our customers, we continue to operate safely amidst COVID-19. Operations have continued essentially unabated. We continue to closely monitor the situation and adapt as necessary to ensure our teams' health. The health and welfare of our teams is the highest priority. And I think each of them for their continued commitment to our safety. Because record results don't matter unless everyone goes home safely at the end of each day. The number of injuries and their severity improved in the first quarter '21 compared to last year. The teams are focused on reducing hazards and practices that could result in significant injury. Nothing is more important than the health and safety of our people. Safety is and always will be our number one value. Our safety performance continues to be significantly better than industry statistics. But our intent will always be the drive towards zero incident work environments. To achieve this, we must all continuously be aware of our surroundings and our fellow team members, keeping safety top of mind to control safety, both in the traditional sense as it relates to keeping one another in good health. Before I continue further, Theresa will provide insights into our recent performance. So Theresa? Thanks Theresa. Taking on operating platforms in turn, the steel fabrication platform delivered a strong performance, achieving record quality shipments while navigating rapidly escalating steel input costs, higher steel costs compressed first quarter steel fabrication earnings due to a matching six-month order backlog to more current steel prices. However, based on the strength of steel joist and deck and demand we're currently placing orders at record prices. Our order activity is extremely strong. We ended March with a record fabrication order backlog that is over 50% higher than our previous peak. The non-residential construction market remains strong especially in areas that support online retail, computing activities and healthcare, specifically represented by construction of large distribution and warehouse facilities. Driven large part to changes in consumer behavior, we believe this dynamic will continue for the next several years. We already have steel fabrication facilities located throughout the US and in Mexico, providing us with an advantaged broad based customer supply chain. In order to serve increased customer demand, we will be expanding our production capability. For us it is not necessary to add physical assets, we simply will be providing jobs to additional team members to support increased operating hours, thereby further improving asset utilization. These new crews will be trained and become active between now and late summer '21, increasing our annual production capability by as much as 25% to 30% or over 100,000 tons. Our metals recycling operations had an extremely strong quarter with quarterly operating income of $54 million, nearly doubling sequential fourth quarter earnings and over five times higher than prior year first quarter earnings. Strong ferrous demand and increased pricing related to higher domestic steel production drove strong performance. Prime scrap index pricing increased over $170 per gross ton during the first quarter. Prime scrap generation is strong based on North American manufacturing. We expect North American scrap generation to outpace increased demand from steelmaking in 2021. Obsolete scrap generation has also been strong post the extreme February weather conditions. Based on continued solid scrap generation, we believe scrap pricing will remain somewhat steady during the rest of the year. As Theresa mentioned, the steel team had an outstanding quarter, achieving numerous operating and financial records. We achieved near record shipments, just 1% less than our first quarter 2020 record, and up 6% sequentially. We achieved record quarterly operating income of $641 million, over 10% higher than our previous peak. So many contributed to these incredible achievements, including our commercial teams, our other operating platforms, suppliers and especially our loyal customers. While the domestic steel industry operated at an increased utilization rate of 77% during the first quarter, the strength of our differentiated business model, combined with a passion of our people drove our steel production utilization to 93%. Steel demand is strong across the steel platform, including both flat and long steel products. However, the flat roll steel markets remain especially tight. Underlying demand for flat roll steel products recovered much more quickly than expected in the second half of last year and gained further momentum in this recent first quarter. When coupled with historically low customer inventory levels across the supply chain, flat roll steel prices have been supported at historically high levels and customers are placing orders for immediate demand requirements. They have not rebuilt inventories since the speculative risk associated with the accumulation of higher priced inventory is a significant deterrent, even if it was available. Additionally, we believe current legislative steel trade policies will continue to moderate steel imports. The current US administration has also commented constructively concerning trade parameters and the issues with China. From an end market perspective, the automotive sector has experienced the strongest recovery operating at very high production levels due to low inventories coupled with strong consumer demand. March's seasonally adjusted production represented almost 18 million units and inventories were close to 30% below the five-year average. We've been fortunate that our automotive order book has not seen any significant impact from the current electronic chip shortens. The non-residential construction sector remains strong with continued positive momentum, as evidenced by record structural and rail division shipments, record steel fabrication shipments and strong customer backlogs. We expect this strength to continue through the rest of this year and certainly into next year. Residential construction has also been strong, producing high demand for related HVAC and appliance products. In addition to supporting high non-residential construction demand, the growing online retail shift is supporting steel demand strength throughout the supply chain service providers such as truck trailer and material handling. We're also seeing healthy demand from mining and yellow goods customers that are engineered by our products division. In the energy sector, solar is a substantially growing market. And we're also seeing some indications of improved oil and gas activity. We continue on our successful track record and margin enhancing differentiated growth. We have executed numerous strategic investments across the company in the last several years. And we continue to position Steel Dynamics for the future. Our teams and our customers are extremely excited about our Sinton Texas Electric Arc Furnace Flat Roll Steel Mill investment. It represents a transformational step function increase in Steel Dynamics through cycle cash flow generation capability. It provides next generation electric arc furnace steel production capabilities, new products and new customers. The facility is designed to have product capabilities beyond that of existing electric arc furnace flat roll steel producers competing even more effectively with a higher carbon emitting integrated steel model and foreign competition. It provides us with a broader steel portfolio and provides our customers with an even larger climate conscious supply option. The team's momentum is unbelievable and to be admired. We have an incredible depth of experience in the construction, startup and operation of large steel manufacturing assets. Collectively, we likely have more relevant experience than any other company in the industry. And construction is going extremely well. The new 3-million-ton state of the art flat roll steel mill will include two value added coating lines comprise the 550,000 ton galvanizing line with Galvalume capability and a 250,000 paint line. We plan for these two value-added coating lines to begin operating by the end of the second quarter '21 using flat roll substrate that had full operations. Our Sinton Electric Arc Furnace Steel Mill is adhering to the same stringent sustainability model as our other steelmaking facilities, utilizing state of the art environmental controls and processes to produce high quality sustainable lower carbon steel. Our steel mills have a fraction of the greenhouse gas emission and energy intensity of average traditional steelmaking technology. The Sinton provides a strategic location near Corpus Christi. We have three targeted regional commercial markets for unused steel mill which represents over 27 million tons of relevant flat roll steel consumption in the southern and western United States and Mexico. We also plan to effectively compete with steel imports. Our customers are excited to have a regional flat roll steel supplier. We have four customers committed to locate on site representing over 1.3 million tons of annual processing and consumption capability. We're still speaking with several other potential on site customers, as well as those that are building facilities off site yet near our campus. Our location provides a significant free benefit to most of our intended flat roll customers. Compared to the current domestic supply options, we believe that potential customer savings would be at least $20 to $30 per ton and some would be much higher. Coupled with much shorter lead times we can provide a superior customer supply chain solution. It also allows us to effectively compete with imports, which inherently have long lead times and speckled that price risk. We've also made considerable progress concerning our raw material procurement strategy. We completed the acquisition of a Mexican scrap company last August, which was a critical step for us. The acquisition complements our current metals recycling business in both the US and Mexico. The operations are strategically located near high volume industrial scrap sources throughout Central and Northern Mexico. They have an estimated annual scrap processing capability of almost 2 million gross tons. We also acquired three small scrap locations in the Houston and Corpus Christi area to help serve Sinton's raw material needs. Our performance based operating culture, coupled with our considerable experience in successfully constructing and operating highly profitable steel assets, positions us incredibly well to successfully execute this transformational growth. As we've said before, we're not simply adding a flat roll steel production capacity. We have a differentiated product offering a unique regional supply chain solution, a significant geographic freight and lead time advantage and offer an import sustainable alternative to a regional in need of options. We've also recently announced plans to add four additional value-added flat roll coating lines, comprised with two new paint lines and two new galvanizing lines with Galvalume coating capability. Galvalume products represent the fastest growing flat roll steel market in the United States, primarily serving the metal building industry. This market is historically sourced as much as 45% of the needs from foreign imports. Our preferred cost effective supply chain has resulted in our existing lines consistently running at full capacity through both increased consumption and market share again. Two of these lines will be located in the southern US region to be comprised of a new paint line, and a galvanizing slash Galvalume line, with a combined annual coating capacity of 540,000 tons, requiring an estimated investment of $225 million. These lines will provide Sinton with similar diversification and higher margin product capabilities as our Butler in Columbus flat roll steel divisions. The remaining two lines will be located in the Midwest, and will also be comprised of a paint line and galvanizing line with Galvalume capability with a combined annual coating capacity of 540,000 tons and will require an investment of between $175 million and $200 million. These lines will support our regional flat roll steel operations, providing them with more value-added product diversification to serve our customer needs. We currently believe these lines will begin operating in the second half of '22. Our strategy consistently places value added products and supply chain differentiation of the four and has benefit us well, both through good and poor markets. In closing, our culture and the execution of a long-term strategy continues to strengthen our financial position through consistent strong cash flow generation and long-term value creation, clearly demonstrating our sustainability and differentiating us from our competition. Our amazing teams provide the foundation for success. I thank each of them for their passion and dedication to each other and our other stakeholders. To each of you, please remember that your health and safety is always the most important issue at hand. I thank you for all you do. Your spirit of excellence drives us to success. With that said Darrell, would you please open the floor for questions? Well, we would anticipate, I think, at the end of the day, with seven customers on site, it's been absolutely incredible, the excitement that we've seen, and we've been very, very intentional as to the type of customers such that we have a broad spectrum of processing capability. So light gauge processing capability, heavy gauge, hot band, automotive, and also pipe consumers and other fabricators. So I would imagine at the end of the day, again, that 1.3 million tons will grow. Again, that's not all consumption. A lot of it is processing capability. But it should end up being perhaps 1.4 million tons by the time we're done. Certainly, I think the downstream lines, as we've said in the past will come up before the hot side, but the paint line, the galv line and pickle line, we believe will stop commissioning in June, with some limited shipments beginning in July. I think generally, volumes will be a little constrained through those three lines due to the strong SDI backlog right now and a limited availability of third-party volume. It was our anticipation some time ago that we will be transferring tons down there. But again, it's a good and a bad situation. Our mills are absolutely jam packed with orders. And again, it's tough to get third party supply. But those will be commissioned on time and we'll start to see incremental shipments in the third and fourth quarter. The hot strip mill obviously is of prime importance to get that up and running. That it will be commissioned in September. And I would expect the shipments to commence in Q4 and one has to recognize that as we start the mill up, we'll be also hiring to build working process inventory. So not every ton produced will be shipped. But I would imagine volume to be around 150,000 to 200,000 tons for the fourth quarter. For 2022, the expectation is still to ship around about 80% of eventual capability, so somewhere between 2.2 million to 2.4 million tons. No, we would expect 2.2 million to 2.4 million tons of actual shipments. Well, I think generally our cash allocation strategy has been pretty consistent over time, and will continue to be so. We'll still be focused on retaining a conservative perspective regarding balance sheet structure and liquidity to fully support our investment grade profile. Our through cycle cash generation capability will remain strong, and obviously, with Sinton and with the additional projects will increase dramatically. And I think the exciting thing is, as you point out, we're going to have a lot of cash to allocate. We'll continue growth. We've announced our four new lines, again, a little sort of head of our own personal - sort of timeframe, to help diversify that mill dramatically along the lines of Butler and Columbus. But there will be significant cash remaining after that growth. We'll continue to have a positive dividend profile, cash dividend profile. And as you've seen in the past, when we have a step function increase in through cycle cash generation capability, we do quite a meaningful bump. So I would expect that to happen in the future the next year. And obviously, to supplement that that shareholder return was continuing to look at share buybacks. Well, it's difficult to tell exactly what that sort of incremental volume is. You see 3 million, 4 million tons being bantered around. I can't say that we've fully analyzed that. But obviously, there will be improved demand. There's obviously a major sort of clean energy aspect to it. So solar, I think will help steel consumption demand and certainly our activities at Steel of West Virginia are already benefiting from that. I think beyond the actual sort of steel consumption perspective just the overall economic benefit from that and from other stimuli the economy is going great guns today and it's just going to keep it going. So it's an exciting time. Well, again from our perspective, and there are those - I saw some commentary sort of questioning demand. Demand out there is absolutely phenomenal, across almost every sector. Very, very strong and it would appear to be there for the rest of this year going into next. As you mentioned, most of the - if not all, the reasonable production capability in the US has returned. I think any further additions will be limited. There are sort of additions coming in later this year. Ours will start shipments in the fourth quarter, as I said, but nothing major on the plus side. And it's going to be offset in all honesty, if you look at the maintenance outages in the integrated industry and some shutdowns on the minimal side of things, supply side will absolutely remain tight. So as a great balance will support the market. The issue in the past has been import increases. And I don't think you'll see - you're going to see material increase. It is picking up, there's no doubt about that. But you've got a world economy. Europe is strong, China is strong, most markets are in great shape and so the import availability today is not there. You may get the arbitrage to become more attractive perhaps on the surface. But the availability and the lead times are stretched out. And very few people are going to want to take that speculative risk buying whatever 1,400 bucks today, just taking that risk for that to tumble later in the year. We don't see that though. So we see strong demand, tight supply, record low supply chain inventories across the space. And I think imports - moderate levels of imports that will be continued to be supported by the administration. Actually, I think the commentary relative to trade is very, very positive. Today they recognize that we've been at a kind of a financial war with China for a long time. And they recognize the issues there and I don't think that the 232 tariffs will be unwound in totality. They may take a slightly different shape, but trade constraint will remain in the years ahead. So I think it's a remarkable environment that we're in today. And I think it's just wherever you look anecdotally - housing, there are no houses to be bought today. Or you saw a pickup in the residential markets in March. And that will continue and as playing strength in HVAC and appliance. If you go try and buy a refrigerator today or washing machine, you're probably going to have to wait four or five months for one that you actually want. So just everywhere you look in the supply chain things are stretched and will kind of prolong these cycles. So we're incredibly bullish, I mean it's - we had a phenomenal first quarter. I think the second quarter is going to be multiples of phenomenal and is going to be a great year. I would say on the hot side for sure. Downstream, coating, value-add there's still I think, a myriad of opportunities for us. But if you look at Sinton for - that investment, that project is very, very, very unique both from a product standpoint, but also sort of a market or regional market standpoint. And that's what persuaded us to move forward there. I don't believe there are those types of opportunities available today. Yeah, if there's - there may be incremental where we'll take existing hot metal capability and add assets to use that existing capability. But I don't believe you'll see us - I'm pretty sure you won't see us building green - any more greenfield hot sites. Firstly, I would suggest that scrap is an incredibly efficient market. It's probably the most effective commodity. I do believe that yes, there's additional capacity electrical arc furnace capacity come online. But if you do the math, you may need to find about - somewhere around 4 million tons of additional prime scrap. You also have to offset that a little bit because people forget the integrated mills use scrap, they use prime scrap and so with the reduced capacity there, there's a little less consumed on the integrated side of things. But I think if you look at the scrap market in general, we - even in these recent times we're exporting in around 12 million, 15 million tons a year. There have been times when we've exported 20 million tons a year. So scrap is certainly available. It may appreciate in price to some degree, but I don't believe you're going to see any significant issues from a profitability or a cost perspective for the electric arc furnace community. I think actually one more thing because, as they say, necessity is the mother of invention. And given the remarkable spread between prime scrap and obsolete today, our mills and I'm sure all of our competition is doing the same thing. But they are creating new mixes. And we've actually reduced our prime scrap requirements probably by over 10%, maybe more at our flat roll facilities. If the whole industry, electric arc furnace flat roll producing industry would to do that obviously, that's a meaningful reduction as well. Well, quite simply one has a slightly higher product capability. The ones in the south tend to have some automotive capability. Whereas the one in the Midwest will be more building product targeted. I think there's also an impact a little bit on the product mix and also on shipments from a standpoint of transportation. Logistics is a little tough right now. And we have greater opportunity for shipments than we actually ended up. Well, 2.2 million, 2.4 million tons is 80% of 3 million tons capability, Timna. And I think the team hitting that will be a remarkable feat. Good morning. I think the sort of end demand for vehicles today is incredibly strong. And the few dealers that I talked to are struggling to get inventory and feel that it's - that that strength is going to remain for some time. I think they were generally projecting somewhere between 17 million and 18 million units for the year. And the best prognostications are that the chip shortage may impact that by a million and a half. I'm not sure. All I can say is through our lens, and it's quite fortuitous, I guess. But the plants that are down are not ones that we supply. So we have not seen any material impact from a shipping standpoint. We have seen a slight impact on the scrap side. So I think you're going to see - whereas we anticipated that softening a little bit in the last month - for this month. I think prime scrap is probably going to be firm, maybe up a little. But then again, it's too early to tell the buy is still a couple of weeks ahead. But no major impact for us so far. Well, I think there's a general impact across the space. We've seen a little greater activity sort of seams pipe for the for the energy markets, yellow goods is stronger, manufacturing is strong. But I would say the principal growth and target for that growth there has been automotive. I think we're around about 20% of the mix there right now. And if you remember some years ago, we installed a smaller diameter mill and that utilization is picking up quite dramatically. Well, we've not seen any - at least I don't - I'm not aware of seeing any substitution threat right now. Obviously, all materials have come up together. But then again steel products are quite unique to replace - in the steel warehouse space where they want large spans, you obviously can't do that with lumber. You may see lumber substitution in high rise buildings in the past, but not in the growth area of distribution warehouses and that sort of thing. Well, super. For those that remain on the call, we certainly appreciate your time today and you're support of our company. For our employees, again, hats off to you, it was an absolutely phenomenal quarter and ask you to look after each other out there and be safe. And again, we wouldn't be able to have a phenomenal quarter without our customer base. We got some loyal phenomenal people that we worked with, that we partnered with over the years. So thank you, each and every one of you. With that said, make it a great day and be safe."

            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. I want to add my sincere appreciation and congratulations to the entire Steel Dynamics team. As Mark said we achieved numerous milestones and delivered a record first quarter performance. We achieved record revenues of $3.5 billion derived from near record quarterly steel shipments, record fabrication shipments and strong product pricing across all of our operating platforms. We achieved record quarterly operating income of $594 million and net income of $431 million or $2.03 per diluted share. And we had strong cash flow from operations of $262 million with a record quarterly adjusted EBITDA of $664 million, truly an extraordinary performance. Our first quarter 2021 results included costs of approximately $20 million or $0.07 per diluted share associated with the construction of our Sinton Texas Flat Roll Steel Mill. Excluding these costs, first quarter 2021 adjusted net income was $445 million or $2.10 per diluted share above our guidance of $1.94 to $1.98 due to stronger than anticipated March steel shipments as order activity remains very strong. Our first quarter 2021 revenues of $3.5 billion were 36% higher than sequential fourth quarter results, with growth from all of our operating platforms, and most significantly from our steel and metal recycling operations based on record flat roll steel selling values and strong shipments. Our first quarter 2021 operating income was $594 million, $335 million, or 130% higher than sequential fourth quarter results due to higher real life flat roll steel pricing more than offsetting increased scrap costs. As we discuss our business this morning, you'll find we continue to see positive industry fundamentals for the remainder of 2021. And we are confident in our fourth coming unique earnings catalysts. For steel operations we generated $641 million of operating income in the first quarter more than double fourth quarter sequential earnings as flat roll steel selling values increased significantly to record levels throughout the first quarter, driving expanded metal margins. We also saw expanded margins within our long products operations based on higher prices. First quarter steel shipments of 2.8 million tons were 6% above our sequential fourth quarter volume and only 25,000 tons less than our quarterly record set in the first quarter of 2020. Our steel mills operated at 93% of their capability during the quarter well above the industry average of 77%. As a reminder, we still have additional market share opportunity based on our existing annual steel shipping capability of over 13 million tons and when we finish our new Texas steel mill and it's fully online, we'll have over 16 million tons. As domestic steel production increased scrap demand strengthened in the first quarter, resulting in significantly higher scrap prices and resulting metal spread expansion. Operating income from our mills recycling operations was $54 million, nearly 100% improvement sequentially. The team continues to effectively lever the strength of our vertically connected operating model benefiting both our steel and metals recycling operations by providing higher quality scrap, which improves furnace efficiency and by reducing companywide working capital requirements. Despite record first quarter 2021 shipments for our steel fabrication segment, first quarter operating income was $10 million, compared to sequential fourth quarter earnings of $25 million. Lower earnings were the result of metal spread compression, as higher average selling values were offset by significantly higher steel input costs. As evidenced through our record shipments, record order backlog and extremely strong continued order activity, lower first quarter earnings is not reflective of a weaker demand environment. It is a matter of timing, as higher steel costs are being matched with a six-month order backlog in which joist and deck prices were lower. This will begin to reverse in the coming months as current steel joist and deck prices have increased considerably. Our cash generation continues to be strong based on our differentiated business model and highly variable cost structure. During the first quarter of 2021, we generated cash flow from operations of $262 million. Operational working capital grew $411 million during the quarter driven by higher customer account and inventory values due to increased pricing in shipments. During the quarter we also invested $310 million in capital investments, of which $254 million was invested in our new Texas flat roll steel mill. For the remainder of 2021, we estimate capital investments will be roughly $650 million to $700 million, with the Texas steel mill representing about $535 million of that amount. This estimate does not include spending for construction or the recently announced four flat roll steel coating lines. We believe the lines will cost between $400 million and $425 million combined, and we will likely fund between $50 million to $75 million for engineering and down payments late this year. The lines are currently planned to begin operating sometime in the second half of 2022. In February, we also increased our cash dividend 4% to $0.26 per common share based on our ability to consistently generate strong cash. Since 2016, we've increased our cash dividend over 85% and invested $1.3 billion in our common stock, representing over 15% of our outstanding shares. We have $444 million that remain authorized for share repurchases. These actions reflect the strength of our capital foundation, consistent cash flow generation, strong liquidity profile and the continued optimism and confidence in our future. We're in a position of strength, with liquidity over $2.4 billion at the end of the quarter, comprised of cash of $1.2 billion and our fully available unsecured revolver of $1.2 billion. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes responsible strategic growth with shareholder distributions comprised of the base positive dividend profile that is complemented with a variable share repurchase program, while also being dedicated to preserving our investment grade credit rating. We're squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable optimized long-term value creation. And we believe sustainability is a part of our long-term value creation. And we're dedicated to our people, our communities and our environment. We're committed to operating our business with the highest integrity and have been since our founding. We produce steel using only Electric Arc Furnace technology with recycled ferrous scrap as the primary raw material. EAS steel production technology currently has the least environmental impact, is the most cost effective and provides the most operational flexibility. With the addition of our mills recycling and fabrication platforms, we intentionally developed a vertically connected operating model crane and almost closed loop manufacturing business, which both benefits us financially and reduces our environmental impact. In 2020, we shared our qualitative climate related goals and our most recent sustainability report. This summer, we also plan to adopt quantitative goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, participate in greater renewable energy use and continue to invest in energy efficiency opportunities. We're currently in the process of assessing the use of renewable energy alternatives at our steel mills. Our sustainability and environmental impact strategy is an ongoing journey. And we're moving forward with the intention to make a positive difference. We plan to continue to address these matters and to play a leadership role in developing innovative ways to reduce our impact on the environment. For those of you that use our detailed shipments for the flat roll product for your models, in the first quarter of 2021, we have hot-rolled P&O shipments of 774,000 tons, cold-rolled of 149,000 tons and coated of 996,000 tons. On a personal note, I just want to continue to thank the teams for operating safely and for taking care of one another from a health perspective as well. Mark? That's a great question Sathish. So in the first quarter generally, we're somewhere between probably 55% to 60% contract business in any given quarter related to just our flat roll operations. But because of the way that contracts have minimum and maximum volumes, in the first quarter, we actually had probably a little over 70% of our mix was contract related. So it was more than we typically would have. However, going into the second quarter, you're likely to see that moderate back to a 60% to 65%. And so we think it'll get closer to what we normally see. And the lag is generally around two months. We had the update - the customers that have committed to be on site. There's four in place today that represent just over 1.3 million tons. We're currently having discussions with at least two others. Mark, I don't know if you want to comment on the additional volume that may come with that or not? And just to add to that Sathish, we've actually had several customers that were not able to locate with us on site because of area constraints, et cetera. But there are those that are moving contingent or contiguous to the site. So there is a lot of excitement among the customer group. And that's from a full utilization as we run Columbus and Butler, basically at full or over full capacity. We don't see any reason why could achieve that in the 2023 timeframe. I would just add, so there are transactional opportunities as well. And so we are a growth company. And so there is the organic side, which I think Sinton represents the largest project, and that we've had. But as you think about transaction opportunities, whether it's in manufacturing businesses that utilize our steel as raw material input, or whether it even the steel production assets perhaps that's something definitely we can differentiate the business and improve the business and add a lot of value. We're still very interested in things like that as well. Andreas, are you talking specifically about Steel Dynamics and our first quarter shipments? Yeah. So it was a direct result of two of our steel divisions. We actually had improvement over all of our operations, except for Roanoke Bar Division and the Steel of West Virginia Division. And there have been some good improvements made there commercially and the team is doing incredibly well. And they think you're going to see a big shift and change in that. But that specifically, it wasn't anything that was noteworthy, and it was only about 25,000 tons difference, I think. Andreas, as we look at - We pull together what we believe to be scrap generation over the coming years, and we added in new capacity related to electric arc furnaces. The scrap generation, both including prime scrap as well as prime scrap substitutes with a lot of the additional projects coming on line, we believe will outpace the increased demand. Though I know there's different philosophies being touted about out there right now. But that was our original promise and we still believe in that. Yeah. Absolutely. Good morning. So from the steel fabrication, we're likely to see March and April be the drought months as we are working through or have worked through the order backlog. Today, steel and steel deck - steel joist and steel deck prices are actually at all-time record highs and demand is extraordinary. So one should see that starts to develop, it's already into a record backlog that's reaching into the fourth quarter of 2021. And you're likely to see a better second quarter, but in the second half of the year, it could be quite powerful from an earnings perspective. Yeah. Carlos, it's actually opposite. And we may have said it wrong. The $225 million lines are likely to be in the south. And the $175 million to $200 million lines are likely to be in the Midwest. Mark, do you want to talk about the technical differences between the sets of lines, why one might be higher than the other? I think has a little to do with the infrastructure that's possibly required as well. Well, first of all, I'll just jump in. I thought Andreas was talking about shipments not production. So if I got that wrong that was my fault. Mark, you want to talk about the production side of things. We suffice it to say, Timna that we are running as hard as we can at both Butler and at Columbus. We aren't without some of our hiccups along the way as well. But we've rectified those and yeah."

You will also find any referenced non-GAAP financial measures reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the press release issued yesterday entitled Steel Dynamics reports fourth quarter and full-year 2022 results. And now I’m pleased to turn the call over to Mark.\nMark Millett: Thank you, David. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for being with us for our fourth quarter and full-year 2022 earnings call. And as I think you saw, operationally, our teams had a very, very, very solid fourth quarter. Our New Millennium Building Systems platform generated record steel fabrication earnings, Sinton is showing significant operating improvement with a clear path to profitability in the second quarter of 2023. Our new aluminum group is making great progress on our aluminum flat-rolled investments, and I will share more details later in the call. Relative to full-year 2022, the entire Steel Dynamics delivered an exceptional performance with record sales, earnings and cash flow generation. I think it was a tremendous achievement, and I’m incredibly proud of our team. They are the foundation of our company, and they are the ones that have truly driven our success over the years. It is their culture of excellence and the strategic positioning executed over the last number of years that allows us to maximize opportunities resulting in higher lows and higher highs through all market cycles. However, none of this matters without keeping our teams safe. Often, employees are described as a company’s most important resource. But for Steel Dynamics, they are more than that, they are a family. And now we number over 12,000 strong. We are continually focused and provide the very best for their health, safety and welfare. We are actively engaged in safety at all times at every level, came in to top of mind and an active conversation at all levels through the organization. And with that focus, the team’s safety performance improved significantly in 2022. We but there is certainly more to do as we will not rest until we consistently achieve our goal of zero injuries. But before I add any more detail, Theresa, would you like to give us some detailed financial results.\nTheresa Wagler: Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. I add my sincere appreciation and congratulations to the entire team. We continue to hit new milestones throughout the company achieving record annual performance in 2022, with record revenues of $22.3 billion derived from strong product pricing and volumes across all of our operating platforms. Record operating income of $5.1 billion and net income of $3.9 million or $2.92 per diluted share, and record cash flow from operations of $4.5 billion with EBITDA of $5.5 billion. As Mark mentioned, is truly an exceptional performance. Regarding our fourth quarter 2020 results, net income was $635 million or $3.61 per diluted share which includes additional performance-based special compensation of $24 million or $0.09 per diluted share that was awarded to all nonexecutive eligible team members and recognition of their extraordinary performance and costs of approximately $168 million or $0.67 per diluted share associated with our Sinton Texas flat-rolled steel mill ramp. Our fourth quarter 2022 operating income declined 35% sequentially to $759 million due to lower realized selling values and seasonally lower shipments within our steel operations, which individually generate operating income of $178 million with shipments of 3 million tons in the fourth quarter. Our flat-rolled steel mills were negatively impacted during the quarter with high-cost pig iron that was purchased earlier in 2022 during the early stages of Russia and Beijing of Ukraine. Based on current pig iron prices of $500 per ton versus our average cost incurred in the fourth quarter, earnings were negatively impacted by about $80 million. We expect to see that continue into the first quarter and the negative impact is likely to be around $60 million as we work through all the higher price pig iron before the end of the first quarter. For the full-year 2022, operating income from our steel operations was $3.1 billion, representing the second strongest year in our history, with record annual shipments of 12.2 million tons. Fourth quarter operating income from our metals recycling operations improved to $14 million based on increased volume and metal spread expansion despite lower average selling values. For the full-year 2022, operating income from our mills recycling operations was $130 million. Due to lower volume and average selling values, our spare scrap prices fell nine out of 12 months during the year. It was sequentially lower than the record results in 2021. Our Mexican recycling operations have proven to be a strategic key for both sourcing scrap for our Southern steel mills and driving profitability. I want to say a sincere thank you to the Zimmer and Roka team. We continue to effectively lever the strength of our circular manufacturing model, benefiting both our steel and metals recycling operations by providing higher quality scrap to our steel mills which improves furnace efficiency, lowers cost and reduces company-wide working capital needs. And once again, our steel fabrication operations achieved record quarterly operating income of $682 million as metal spreads continue to expand based on steady product pricing and lower steel input costs, which more than offset the impact of seasonally lower shipments. steel joists and deck remains solid as evidenced by our continued strong order backlog and which extends through the first half of 2023. Our steel fabrication platform also achieved another record year in 2022, with operating income of $2.4 billion eclipsing last year’s record of $365 million. Congratulations to the entire team, well done. This demonstrates the power of our circular manufacturing model and the natural hedge our steel fabrication business provides to steel price shifts. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we generated strong cash flow from operations of $1.1 billion due to strong results in the release of working capital. For the full-year, we generated a record $4.5 billion, our cash generation is consistently strong based on our differentiated circular business model and highly variable low-cost structure. At the end of the year, we had liquidity of $3.4 billion comprised of cash and short-term investments of $2.2 billion and our fully available unsecured revolver of $1.2 billion. During 2022, we invested $909 million in capital investments of which over half related to ongoing construction of our four new flat-rolled coating lines and our aluminum flat-rolled mill investments. For 2023, we believe capital investments will be in the range of $1.5 billion, the majority of which relates to our aluminum flat-rolled investments and the completion of our flat-rolled coating lines. Since our last call, we also announced the location for our aluminum rolling mill as Columbus, Mississippi. Mark will share the strategy of the location later in the call. We are also incredibly pleased to have received near-term state incentives for the project, of $250 million with meaningful additional tax benefits to occur over the next 15-years. During the fourth quarter, we maintained our cash dividend of $0.34 per common share after increasing at 31% in the first quarter of 2022. We also repurchased $413 million of our common stock in the fourth quarter. For the full-year, we paid cash dividends of $237 million and repurchased $1.8 billion or 12% of our outstanding shares, representing a 53% net income shareholder distribution rate. At the end of the year, $1.3 billion remains available under our current share authorization program. Since 2017, we have increased our cash dividend per share by 119% and we have repurchased $4.2 billion of our common stock, representing 31% of our outstanding shares. These actions reflect the strength of our capital foundation and consistently strong cash flow generation capability and the continued optimism and confidence in our future. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes high-return strategic growth with shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that is complemented with a variable share repurchase program, while we remain dedicated to preserving our investment-grade credit designation. We have strategically placed ourselves in a position of strength to have a sustainable capital foundation that provides the opportunity for meaningful strategic growth and strong shareholder returns while maintaining investment-grade metrics. Our free cash flow profile has fundamentally changed over the last five years from an annual average of $580 million between 2011 and 2015 to $2.6 billion today between 2018 and 2022. Our recently announced aluminum investment is consistent with our unchanged capital allocation strategy. We will readily fund our flat-rolled aluminum investment with available cash and cash flow from operations. We also plan to continue strong and responsible shareholder distributions as we have clearly demonstrated. We are squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable optimized long-term value creation. Sustainability is also a significant part of our long-term value creation strategy, and we are dedicated to our people, our communities under environment. We are committed to operating our business with the highest integrity. In that regard, we are excited about our newly formed joint venture with Aymium, a leading producer of renewable biocarbon products. We believe our first joint facility could decrease our steel Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 35%. We have an actionable path toward carbon neutrality that is more manageable and we believe, considerably less expensive than may lay ahead for many of our industry peers. Our sustainability and carbon reduction strategy is an ongoing journey and we are moving forward with an intention to make a positive difference. We plan to continue to address these matters and to play a leadership role moving forward. As I conclude my remarks, I know there is some of you that follow more detail of our flat-rolled shipments. So for the fourth quarter, our hot-rolled shipments were 959,000 tons, our cold-rolled shipments were 109,000 tons, and our coated shipments were 1.1 million tons. Mark.\nMark Millett: Thank you, Theresa. Well, as was mentioned, steel fabrication saw phenomenal results in the platform in the year. And again, thank you to the Penal team. I think their effectiveness and their efficiency and their output per employee exceeds anyone in the industry. So congratulations to you and thank you for all you do there. It was another record quarterly performance, and record annual operating income of $2.4 billion for the year, with record shipments of 856,000 tons. Although the macro industries remain a little mixed, we believe nonresidential construction markets are and will continue to remain strong throughout the year. Despite lower ABI indications, I believe overall architectural firms remain optimistic for 23 Dodge Momentum Index improved around about 6% in December. And nonresidential starts and build rates are also forecast to remain solid through the year. I think the continued onshoring of manufacturing businesses and the infrastructure spending programs will start kicking in that will continue to provide momentum for construction spending. More relevant, I think our customers certainly tell us demand remains solid in spite of economic uncertainty, and it is certainly confirmed by current order rates, not only in the joist and deck business but also our structural products business as well. Our steel fabrication order backlog extends through the first half of 2023, with strong pricing dynamics. And with continued solid order intake rates, we expect to see continued strong volume and performance those operations throughout 2023. And the fabrication platform is not only a significant contributor itself, but it provides significant pull-through volume for our steel mills, allowing higher through-cycle utilization rates, and it also provides a meaningful natural hedge to lower steel pricing. Our MEL’s recycling platform had a solid year, especially in light of the challenging pricing environment. During 2022, ferrous scrap prices declined nine out of 12 months and volumes were marginally lower. The team managed to achieve metal margins that were only $2 per gross ton lower than record 2021 results. After seven consecutive months of declining price during 2022, First scrap prices improved in December and January, and it is our expectation that pricing will continue a moderate seasonal increase during the first quarter. Our metals recycling geographic footprint provides a strategic competitive advantage for our steel mills and our scrap generating customers. In particular, our growing Mexican volumes will enhance our Columbus and symptom positions and the Zimmer and Roka acquisitions are performing very well, and integration is outstanding. Our metals recycling team continues to partner with our steel teams to expand traded scrap separation to provide more high-quality, low-residual scrap to our steel mills. The impact of these efforts, along with others in the industry, has demonstrated that innovation will provide ample scrap supply in the years ahead. Similarly, we are also exploring technologies for more effective aluminum scrap separation in anticipation of sourcing material for our upcoming aluminum flat rolled operations to maximize recycled content. Steel operations achieved record shipments in the second best annual earnings in 2022, again, outstanding performance by an outstanding team. So thank you for each and every one of you there, record shipments of 12.2 million tons, operating income of $3.1 billion. Our 2022 steel production utilization rate was 92%, excluding Sinton, compared to a domestic industry rate of 78%. And again, our higher utilization rates are clearly demonstrated throughout all market cycles. Our value-added diversified product offerings differentiated supply chain solutions provides stickiness and the support of our internal pull-through manufacturing volume has clearly demonstrated time and time again that we can maintain a higher utilization than our peers in the industry. As a key differentiator. It supports our strong and growing through-cycle cash generation capability and best-in-class financial metrics. Looking forward, customer order entry is good and backlogs are solid. In actuality, December was a historically high order intake month followed by another historic high order intake year-to-date. So we see a very, very, very solid market developing for the rest of the year. Auto production is expected to increase in 2023 from the lower 2022 rates. Dealer inventories have improved, but still remain meaningfully below historic norms. The build rate in 2022 was roughly 14.3 million units, and it is expected to grow a little to about 15%, 15.1% for 2023 and higher thereafter. Nonresidential construction remains solid as evidenced by fabrication backlog, and as I said, the long product steel volumes. Residential construction has certainly softened. It is impacting HVAC, appliance and other housing-related products, but fortunately, much of our portfolio is biased toward replacement. Oil and gas activity is driving improved orders for OCTG and line pipe and solar continues to grow. And I think generally, this market strength is clearly supporting market price appreciation and in particular, the challenges with OMS in Mexico, has certainly changed the regional sort of markets and the Mexico a stand in Mexico and the U.S. market is certainly benefiting from that. In Sinton, the downstream coating lines are running well. They are running below full capacity, though, as the rest of the mill continues to work through start-up items. The hot mill, and that is the good news, the homes turned the corner, running more consistency, approaching 65% capability month-to-date. We have been experiencing very, very long sequence lengths on the case recently up to 22 hours at a time. We are achieving days in excess of 85% capacity, and we should be around about 150,000 tons for the month of January and improving thereafter. Our current utilization is certainly being impacted by certain supply chain issues related to bearings and roles. This is specific to the casted roles in the segments. But we expect to have this resolved before the end of the first quarter, which will allow for a much stronger production for the rest of the year. Additionally, high-priced pig iron inventory is being drawn down through the quarter and the raw material input cost was normalized for Q2 through the rest of the year. While financial performance will likely be flat there in the first quarter, as we consume that high-price pig iron we expect significant events in both productivity and earnings in Q2. Mill production dimensional capabilities improving there. The hot strip mill design is certainly allowed for thermal mechanical rolling, allowing production of higher strength grades with lower alloyed content and associated alloy cost, and we have already been approved and shipped some API grades. I think experience to-date certainly affirms our technical and process choices, and there is no doubt that this is the next-generation electric arc furnace-based flat-rolled steel technology of choice going forward. We continue to grow our exceptional through cyclical operating and financial performance continues to support our cash generation and growth investment strategies. We have the four value-add flat-rolled steel coating lines under construction. These projects have gone well, and they are targeted for start-up in the second half of 2023. We have a galvanizing line and paint line going in at Sinton and similarly into Heartland, and we are seeing very good customer interest for that new volume. Currently, we are the largest domestic nonautomotive coater flat rolled steel with and annual coating capacity of over six million tons, these four new lines will increase that capacity by an additional 1.1 million tons. We have created unique supply chain solutions for our customers, which allow our downstream lines to remain always fully utilized with our highest margin products. Switching to aluminum, market response from both current and new customers across all markets has truly been incredible. To recap the project itself the 650,000 metric ton per year aluminum flat roll facility. The main mill facility will be located in Columbus, Mississippi. It is close to the Southeastern markets and well positioned to serve Mexico. It is on the KCS rail line, which connects us again to Mexico to bring slab up and material back down to Mexico and it also connects to Canada to bring primary aluminum down from the sources up there. We intentionally located it on the TVA power grid to allow supply green energy. And we have water access by the Tom Big B waterway. So the transportation structure is good for us. We attained an attractive incentive package and having our current our Columbus steel mill close by. It allows us to draw on that facility for talent or professional services, and there will be a transition or transfer of many of our folks there which will have an immediate infusion of our culture to that aluminum facility. So we are excited about that. The mill itself will have on-site melt slab capacity of roughly 600,000 metric tons and will be supported by two satellite recycled aluminum slab casting centers. One will be located in the Southwest U.S. and one in SLP Mexico. Both sites, we have - letters have been sent in place, and we are under due diligence, but I believe it will serve us very, very, very well. And obviously, the strategic thought there was to place the slab centers in areas of surplus scrap and the California Western market and Mexico will have an abundance of UBC material. The mill itself, again, is going to be equipped with the two cash lines, the coating line, downstream processing and packaging lines. We have actually expanded the product scope there to include additional scrap processing and treatment to maximize recycled content. It is a state-of-the-art facility, and we will be serving the sustainable beverage and packaging markets, both body and TAM, the automotive sector and industrial sectors. Breakdown would be 300,000 tons of can sheet, 200,000 tons of auto and about 150,000 tons of industrial, or the principal equipment is on order, allowing for a pretty firm startup of the mill mid-2025. We believe the Mexican slab center will start up in the second half and the Southwest U.S. slab Center early 2025. The total project cost, including the recycled slab centers has grown a little from our initial $2.2 billion estimate. The increase is somewhat associated with - now that we have truly defined the equipment costs. But we have also added scope as I said, we put in a scrap processing and treatment and segregation at both the slab centers, which has increased that number a little and today, we estimate a firm budget of about $2.5 billion. It will be 100% funded with available cash and cash flow from operations. So there is no additional debt or financial needed to push this thing forward. And we clearly expect to see about $650 million to $700 million of through-cycle annual EBITDA, with an additional $40 million to $50 million arising from our recycled Omni Source efforts. From an investment premise and we have talked about it before, but we see the aluminum market, not unlike that in the steel industry, when we started SDI some 30-years ago. It is an industry that has essentially older assets, there has been little reinvestment over the years, heavy legacy cost, there is inefficiency and sort of high-cost operations. And the advantage compared to any other steel market that we have entered is there is actually a supply side deficit. Every other market in steel has always been oversupplied, and we have had to use our culture and low-cost strategies to penetrate those markets. With aluminum, there is a clear, clear supply deficit will certainly aid the ramp-up and a very, very quick profitability of that project. Certainly business alignment, we believe it is sort of an adjacent industry, so to speak. It is going to allow us to leverage our core competencies of constructing design, constructing, ramping up very, very large capital assets. It will allow us to leverage our recycling footprint, Omni Source is the largest North American recycling of nonferrous products, including aluminum. We recycle over GBP 1.2 billion, half of that is aluminum to there. I believe we will certainly be able to infuse the project with our culture, and that will power a very low cost, very high efficiency operations. So we are very, very excited and we are certainly excited from the reception we are getting from those aluminum customers. Looking forward, we are certainly excited and passion by our future growth opportunities as they will continue the high returning growth momentum we have consistently demonstrated over the years. We were recently added to the S&P 500 Index. I feel that is a true testament to our people and to the financial strength and maturity of our company. We are arguably one of the top five steel producers in the world as measured by market cap today and the third largest in North America by capacity and we certainly have the best financial metrics of any of our peers. And all these achievements have been achieved in a relatively short time frame, and that could not be accomplished without the phenomenal commitment of our extraordinary people. Everyone has had an impact and everyone contributes each and every day. We are celebrating our 30th year in business later this year, and there are only better things to come. Our teams and the culture they create on our foundation, and I thank each of them for their passion and their dedication. And in turn, we are committed to their wealth firm, their health and their safety. And I remind those listening today that safety for yourselves and each other is our highest priority each and every day. Our success is also driven by the loyal support of our customers who have become partners and friends over the years and together, we have created many innovative supply chain solutions, creating value for all. And we look forward to providing similar value and optionality to all our new customers as we continue to expand our product offerings in the steel arena, but also in the new aluminum market that we are entering. And finally, thank you to all that have invested in us. There is a growing number that recognizing the power of our culture, the resilience of our business model and the potential outsized depreciation that are significant yet disciplined growth will return. We certainly look forward to creating new opportunities for all of us today and in the years ahead. So with that said, I would love to open the floor up or the call up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Emily Chieng of Goldman Sachs. Emily your line is live.\nEmily Chieng: Good morning, Mark and Theresa and thank your taking my question. I would like to start with the aluminum rolling mill and what progress you have made there. Maybe curious as to how many sort of contract negotiations or discussions you have started to have with different customers. Maybe what end markets you have been targeting so far and as you think about how Steel Dynamics may ultimately disrupt this industry, are there any indications that the pricing construct that we have historically seen of this industry could change.\nMark Millett: Thank you good morning and thanks for your question. I do believe that - when one says disrupt an industry that can be taken both positively and negatively. I think from our perspective, we look at it from a very positive nature, creating optionality for the customer base, many of our existing steel customers also buy and consume aluminum and so it is great to be able to create further value for them. I do believe that our advantage and we have seen that over the last 30-years in steel, in that the power of our culture allowing us to leverage state-of-the-art equipment tends to drive very, very effective, highly efficient, low-cost operations and in any commodity any commodity market, the low-cost producer will survive and thrive and allow superior financial metrics through the cycle. And so the mill itself, the combination again of our culture, as stated on the equipment, just simply the plant layout, the high recycled content that we will enjoy the improved yield impact through the process, the low overhead cost all will combine to provide a very low cost solution and allow us to, I think, penetrate those markets quite effectively. Will that change the pricing environment? I don’t think so. We will be just a partial participant initially anyway in that marketplace.\nTheresa Wagler: From a progress perspective Emily, I think that Mark mentioned earlier that we do have locations that we have in mind and we are negotiating right now for both of the recycled slab facilities plus we now have a location. And so there is a lot of excitement happening in Columbus, Mississippi. Last year, we spent about just a little over $120 million on the investments going forward, just to kind of recalibrate since we do have an increased amount of $2.5 billion. In 2023, we are likely to spend somewhere between $900 million and $950 million in capital, in 2024, $1.2 billion, with the remaining $200 million to $300 million during the startup year of 2025. So the teams are pushing forward very quickly.\nEmily Chieng: All right. Thank you for the color.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Carlos de Alba of Morgan Stanley. Carlos your line is live.\nCarlos De Alba: Thank you very much Mark and Theresa. So on capacity, I would like to discuss capacity utilization, both for the industry, the company as well as the expected ramp-up of the fourth value-added current lines. So you guys have been running as you described in earlier comments at a higher capacity the decision in the industry. But now the industry in the U.S. is running around just slightly above 70%, 75%. How long can this persist, do you think, given that prices are increasing, supply discipline has been there so far. But there are some folks out there that are doing as well as you clearly by the numbers that you have posted. So how do you see the situation evolving Mark perhaps on these? And then in Mark, how do you see the ramp-up - the expected ramp-up of the capacity utilization of the four value-added lines. You mentioned that you see 80% in 2023 for Sinton, but any color on the fourth order lines would be great.\nMark Millett: Thank you Carlos, you were like a machine gun there. So I’m not so sure I got all your questions. I think from a ramp-up, I will work backwards, but from the ramp-up of the coating lines, those will be, I think, very, very, very strong. Obviously, we have many, many galvanizing lines, prepaint lines throughout the company, and we will harness all our technical resources there to get those lines up quickly. We certainly have the substrate available to fully load those lines. So I think the ramp up, again, those lines of start up at second half, perhaps fourth quarter and will ramp up quite quickly through the rest of the year into the following year.\nTheresa Wagler: As it relates to the first part of your question, Carlos, around utilization for the industry. I would point out that even if you go back to more challenging times like 2015, et cetera, our utilization still remained very high, and that is because of the power of our pull-through volume, which we would anticipate as well. But we are really optimistic for 2023 with the additional on shoring of manufacturing businesses, which you are seeing in reality as well as with the infrastructure program and other investment opportunities. We think that steel demand in the U.S. will continue to stay steady to potentially increasing as well as the trade benefits of melting and casting in the U.S. for the U.S. producer. So yes, flat-rolled prices specifically have improved recently, which we think that they should have. We don’t think that, that is going to have a negative impact. We think that will be a positive impact, and we think both industry utilization rates and ours specifically, should remain steady to improving in 2023.\nCarlos De Alba: All right. Great. Thank you very much Mark and Theresa. I’m sorry Mark I will slowdown next time.\nOperator: Thank you very much. Your next question is coming from Timna Tanners of Wolfe Research. Timna your line is live.\nTimna Tanners: Hey good morning guys. I wanted to ask about the downstream, the fabricate segment please. Just a little clarity, if you could, on the guidance. As I understand it, you talked about some slippage from very high levels, but still above historical levels. But historically, EBITDA per ton prior to 2022 is $190 a ton, and 2022 is $2,850. I’m just wondering if you could provide a little more color on where we should fall between those two extremes. And maybe if you could, it would be helpful. I know Nucor mentioned a year-over-year comparison? Or if there is anything that you can provide a little more clarity on that, that would be great.\nMark Millett: I think one has to recognize that the industry has gone through quite a consolidation comparing it to some years ago and that has allowed sort of market strength or strong market pricing compared to history, and that will continue. The year as it is unfolding, we are entering the year with an absolute solid backlog through the middle of the year for sure. The order input rate is indeed off the kind of the frenetic crazy pace that it was 12-months ago. But it is very, very, very solid, and we believe that it is going to be a very, very good year for us at year-end. And I believe there is some concern maybe as I said earlier, the macro indices may not look as rosy as some would think. And some believe that there is economic uncertainty out there, as I hopefully articulated, we don’t see the gloom and doom that everyone else is seeing it. Our order input rates across all our sectors with the 1 exception, a little off on residential is solid. And our December bookings record level on a historic basis similarly year-to-date. So we just see strength through the year through our lands through our order book.\nTimna Tanners: Okay. Mark, does that strength on volumes, strengthen prices into margins I mean do you expect year-over-year to be up and just like I’m saying it is a big gap. I get that it will be higher than it is been historically, but any color on if we should expect some continuation of what we saw in 2022?\nMark Millett: Well, I think the steel space will -- I know I’m saying that the steel space will appreciate from the lows. Obviously, we are seeing the hot-band pricing off the market pricing of 650 and it is up away over 700. In fabrication, the spreads will likely come off a little. They certainly haven’t to any large extent at this point. You are certainly seeing people say, well, our projects are getting delayed, we are not seeing any cancellations at all. We are seeing projects delayed some. But in my mind, it is not an unhealthy thing in all honesty, because it is just protracting or extending the cycle -- the business cycle in that arena.\nTimna Tanners: Okay, thanks Mark.\nOperator: Thank you very much. Your next question is coming from Curt Woodworth of Credit Suisse. Curt your line is live.\nCurtis Woodworth: Yes, thanks good morning, Mark and Theresa, how are you? Good. I just want to follow up on the fabrication comments. So in the past, you have talked about you have had backlog basically priced through the middle part of this year, and I think you had discussed I believe pricing in the 5,000 or higher level. So I just wondered if you could confirm that, that is kind of the price level your backlog is at. And then if you are sold through the first part of this year, I assume you are bidding projects now for can you comment on price levels you see there? And then with respect to some of the delays or project push outs from what we have seen, the data center and some of those areas are still very strong oil the Amazon type warehouse spent a lot of those have been canceled. So if you could just kind of help us maybe understand a little bit of the DNA of the backlog would be helpful.\nTheresa Wagler: Good morning Curt. So from the perspective of pricing, Obviously, we are not going to give specific pricing. But you would have seen that the pricing held in very steadily in the fourth quarter from an average perspective. And we have seen very steady pricing in the backlog as well. So I would err on the higher side if you think about what is in the backlog. And that is why we have great confidence in the earnings resiliency of the fabrication business through at least the first half of this year. And the order backlog, it is an interesting question because it is broadened out, wherein as it was very concentrated in warehouses, it is broadened out now into more, I would say, infrastructure type hospitals, schools, churches et cetera, so that is a good thing and that is what we think we are seeing more of. We expected very strong volumes for fabrication in 2023 from what we are seeing so far. And Mark mentioned the order entry activity is very good from a historical. So then you can contemplate what you think steel prices will be to make an estimation of whether you think we will continue to see expanding spreads in fabrication or not. That is what we saw in the fourth quarter definitively. Mark, do you want to add anything?\nMark Millett: And just the one comment, though, I think it was mentioned that the distribution warehouses are again canceled. We actually are only seeing that in one customer. Well, actually, not a customer of ours, but one company the distribution warehouse business in our backlog is solid and not getting canceled out. So that is not a comprehensive issue. And just to reemphasize what Teresa said on earlier on the reshoring. Reshoring is real. It truly is. That is going to be supportive of that business. And if you look through just the size of some of these factories, the battery manufacturing facilities is a huge, massive, massive facilities that will require a lot of joists and deck. So again, it is off the frenetic pace that we saw, but it is a very, very, very solid sector for us for the rest of the year.\nCurtis Woodworth: Okay. I appreciate that. And then just a follow-up on Sinton. What were the volumes shipped this quarter and we look at start-up costs for the year is roughly $430 million. So those material drag on your profitability. Can you comment on maybe when you would expect to maybe breakeven with respect to start-up costs and do you have any guidance for what start-up impact would look like in the first quarter? Thank you.\nTheresa Wagler: Yes. So from a volume perspective Curt, Sinton had shipments in the third quarter of around just under 270,000 tons, and it increased to just under 340,000 tons for shipments in the fourth quarter, and we expect to see that improve in the first quarter and then have a significant improvement in the second quarter of 2023. From an impact, we still expect to see losses as they work through the higher-priced pigeon which is obviously matching against lower steel prices than they were at this time last year. And so like it will be -- it should improve over the fourth quarter losses pretty significantly, but still be higher than we would like to see maybe around the $10 million mark.\nCurtis Woodworth: Great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Tristan Gresser of BNP Paribas. Tristan your line is live.\nTristan Gresser: Hi, thank you for taking my questions. Maybe just a quick follow-up on Sinton. Are you able to share any EBITDA annual contribution you are expecting for next year or maybe kind of a sense of how this compares versus the normalized EBITDA target you mentioned and given maybe a slower start-up and then some ramp-up of the coating lines as well in Q4 that is going to help. So any kind of a sense you can give us that would be great.\nTheresa Wagler: So I think Mark mentioned the ramp-up for the two additional value-add lines that will be in Sinton the third quarter of 2023. Those should ramp, we expect fairly quickly to start benefiting their product mix. We are not going to give full-year guidance for Sinton as far as EBITDA. But I would tell you that I think Curt mentioned earlier on the call, that the losses in 2022 were over $400 million, and it is going to swing to a significant positive for 2023. So just that differential alone will have a significant momentum benefit to our earnings in 2023, but it is just too early for us to give an estimate, but it won’t hit through cycle EBITDA in the year where we are still ramping up production.\nTristan Gresser: Okay. That is really helpful. And my second question is more on the demand side. You talked about steel demand increasing in 2023. Can you give us a sense of what kind of number you are seeing and maybe diving into your key end markets also there if you are able to share some quantitative number that would be great.\nMark Millett: I guess from our perspective, the higher demand translates to, in large part, to price up point and spread support. Our operations are already running at quite a high utilization rate. Further demand, obviously, is certainly going to help our Sinton facility. And given the market sectors, energy is very, very strong in that area in Texas. That is helping us. And the challenges that we are seeing in Mexico and the imports of sheet coming up from Mexico into the Southwest markets, but also even under the Midwest have essentially mitigate they are staying in Mexico now. So that is going to create good demand and great dynamics. So from a market perspective, we will certainly be able to support all the capability that the ramp-up will allow.\nTristan Gresser: Okay, thanks for the color.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Andreas Bokkenheuser from UBS. Andreas your line is live.\nAndreas Bokkenheuser: Thank you very much. Just one question for me. Just switching gears a little bit over to the long steel segment, what are you seeing there in terms of potential new orders coming in from the infrastructure bill, the IRA. Are you seeing anything yet there? We have obviously seen rebar is kind of coming down for the last six, seven months. It doesn’t feel like the infrastructure build is kind of abating yet. But what are you seeing on your side to kind of stop the rebar price decline?\nMark Millett: Well, as we have suggested in the past, we are not big in the rebar markets in at. But nonetheless, from our structural long products perspective, the infrastructure bill or spending is not necessarily kicked in yet. It typically takes six to nine months for that to materialize. And obviously, it is too soon. But come the summer of this year, I think you will start to see some benefit there.\nAndreas Bokkenheuser: Got it. That’s very clear. Thank you Mark.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Lawson Winder of BofA Securities. Lawson your line is live.\nLawson Winder: Hi. Good morning Mark. Good morning Theresa, thank you for today’s call. Maybe could I ask about the dividend outlook and just kind of get your thoughts on return of capital. So last year, you bumped the dividend quite substantially. And this year, you have expressed some confidence in symptom and Sinton wasn’t contributing, in fact, was a drag in 2022 so maybe just kind of your thoughts around 2023. Thank you.\nTheresa Wagler: Good one. I’m smiling because Mark tosses things my way, and it is funny how he does it. But from a dividend perspective, we do like to grow the dividend in a way that is consistent so that we are constantly having increases across the spectrum. And I think as I mentioned, since 2017, we actually increased the dividend by almost 120%. And we like to do that lockstep with free cash flow increases that are through cycle like Sinton. I would expect that we should have a pretty significant increase coming forward as well. We like to do those traditionally in the first quarter time frame. We have additional projects that are a little bit smaller, but that are coming online in 2023 that will add to through-cycle earnings. And given our stock price, which has been fantastic, driving up recently, you should expect to see strong shareholder distributions continue, and that would include a strong increase in the dividend coming forward.\nLawson Winder: Okay, fantastic. Thank you. Congratulations.\nOperator: Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from John Tumazos, of John Tumazos Very Independent Research. John your line is live.\nJohn Tumazos: Thank you. I try to keep a little spread on non-scrap cost of goods sold per ton just taking your total corporate revenues per ton and pretax per ton and subtracting scrap profits and it peaked a year ago at 673 and was only 4.56% this quarter. Are the bigger contributors to that the much lower price of purchased steel for your galvanizing and painting, et cetera, divisions first, lower profit sharing improvement in the Sinton mill as it ramps up, and hopefully, it will be the lowest cost when it is four and maybe a mix shift into some. So please explain - by the way, Nucor’s non-scrap cost of goods sales went up and were the highest in the last two-years in the current quarter. So there is the opposite direction, but that is a separate problem to figure out.\nMark Millett: John, great to have you on the call as always, and thanks for the question. I think the biggest parameter is substrate costs. As we have -- over the years, we have ramped up the tech substrate, Holland substrate and even at Sinton, we actually pre-purchased about 150,000 tons, maybe a little more to load the downstream coating lines in preparation for when the hot mill started up. So you are certainly seeing that influence our costs, for sure.\nTheresa Wagler: And the other thing that you hit, John, was spot on as well. It has to do with mix. So if you think about the increase in the impact from our fabrication business, that we would have had some change in that as well. So I think it is both mix and what Mark talked about is the steel substrate.\nJohn Tumazos: In your steel mills, with the normal non-scrap cost of goods sold be closer to $200 a ton or $250 tons or $300 tons.\nMark Millett: We have always tried to not share that information, John. So I would prefer to stay that way. I would tell you though that, one, our conversion cost is probably as good as anyone in the world. And number two, the people don’t necessarily recognize the offsetting sort of efficiency or effectiveness of volume. So on our process lines, carbonizing lines prepaint lines, even though some of the input costs have appreciated, the fact that our teams continually just improve productivity, put more volume through offsetting the sort of the overhead and the fixed costs. Our actual processing costs on those lines have been sort of almost stagnant for the last, I don’t know, how many years.\nJohn Tumazos: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you very much. There appears to be no further questions in the queue. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for any closing remarks.\nMark Millett: Thank you and thank you for everyone on the call for your time today. Certainly, thanks to our team. I want to remind each and every one of you that you do contribute, you do have an impact on our success and stay safe and keep each other safe. Customers, we can do it without you. And I would just like to reemphasize those that have invested in us, there is a growing cadre of folks that are building positions that - they really are recognizing the power of our culture. It is different. We are different, and we drive absolutely different results. Our business model allows us to perform and maintain a higher through-cycle cash generation than our peers. And I think hopefully, people are starting to recognize that that our capital allocation, our growth is incredibly disciplined, particularly on the acquisition side. And I think that that speaks to just our underlying results. It is interesting if one measures the earnings power of our company on an employee basis, we are substantially higher than anyone else out there in our peer group. And again, it speaks to our overall efficiency and effectiveness of the culture, the strategic decisions that the team has made over the years, and it will continue to drop to the bottom line. So investors that support us, again, many, many thanks to you as well and with that said, have a great day.\nOperator: Again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today’s call. Thank you for your participation, and have a great and safe day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mark Millett",
            "content": "Thank you, David. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for being with us for our fourth quarter and full-year 2022 earnings call. And as I think you saw, operationally, our teams had a very, very, very solid fourth quarter. Our New Millennium Building Systems platform generated record steel fabrication earnings, Sinton is showing significant operating improvement with a clear path to profitability in the second quarter of 2023. Our new aluminum group is making great progress on our aluminum flat-rolled investments, and I will share more details later in the call. Relative to full-year 2022, the entire Steel Dynamics delivered an exceptional performance with record sales, earnings and cash flow generation. I think it was a tremendous achievement, and I'm incredibly proud of our team. They are the foundation of our company, and they are the ones that have truly driven our success over the years. It is their culture of excellence and the strategic positioning executed over the last number of years that allows us to maximize opportunities resulting in higher lows and higher highs through all market cycles. However, none of this matters without keeping our teams safe. Often, employees are described as a company's most important resource. But for Steel Dynamics, they are more than that, they are a family. And now we number over 12,000 strong. We are continually focused and provide the very best for their health, safety and welfare. We are actively engaged in safety at all times at every level, came in to top of mind and an active conversation at all levels through the organization. And with that focus, the team's safety performance improved significantly in 2022. We but there is certainly more to do as we will not rest until we consistently achieve our goal of zero injuries. But before I add any more detail, Theresa, would you like to give us some detailed financial results. Thank you, Theresa. Well, as was mentioned, steel fabrication saw phenomenal results in the platform in the year. And again, thank you to the Penal team. I think their effectiveness and their efficiency and their output per employee exceeds anyone in the industry. So congratulations to you and thank you for all you do there. It was another record quarterly performance, and record annual operating income of $2.4 billion for the year, with record shipments of 856,000 tons. Although the macro industries remain a little mixed, we believe nonresidential construction markets are and will continue to remain strong throughout the year. Despite lower ABI indications, I believe overall architectural firms remain optimistic for 23 Dodge Momentum Index improved around about 6% in December. And nonresidential starts and build rates are also forecast to remain solid through the year. I think the continued onshoring of manufacturing businesses and the infrastructure spending programs will start kicking in that will continue to provide momentum for construction spending. More relevant, I think our customers certainly tell us demand remains solid in spite of economic uncertainty, and it is certainly confirmed by current order rates, not only in the joist and deck business but also our structural products business as well. Our steel fabrication order backlog extends through the first half of 2023, with strong pricing dynamics. And with continued solid order intake rates, we expect to see continued strong volume and performance those operations throughout 2023. And the fabrication platform is not only a significant contributor itself, but it provides significant pull-through volume for our steel mills, allowing higher through-cycle utilization rates, and it also provides a meaningful natural hedge to lower steel pricing. Our MEL's recycling platform had a solid year, especially in light of the challenging pricing environment. During 2022, ferrous scrap prices declined nine out of 12 months and volumes were marginally lower. The team managed to achieve metal margins that were only $2 per gross ton lower than record 2021 results. After seven consecutive months of declining price during 2022, First scrap prices improved in December and January, and it is our expectation that pricing will continue a moderate seasonal increase during the first quarter. Our metals recycling geographic footprint provides a strategic competitive advantage for our steel mills and our scrap generating customers. In particular, our growing Mexican volumes will enhance our Columbus and symptom positions and the Zimmer and Roka acquisitions are performing very well, and integration is outstanding. Our metals recycling team continues to partner with our steel teams to expand traded scrap separation to provide more high-quality, low-residual scrap to our steel mills. The impact of these efforts, along with others in the industry, has demonstrated that innovation will provide ample scrap supply in the years ahead. Similarly, we are also exploring technologies for more effective aluminum scrap separation in anticipation of sourcing material for our upcoming aluminum flat rolled operations to maximize recycled content. Steel operations achieved record shipments in the second best annual earnings in 2022, again, outstanding performance by an outstanding team. So thank you for each and every one of you there, record shipments of 12.2 million tons, operating income of $3.1 billion. Our 2022 steel production utilization rate was 92%, excluding Sinton, compared to a domestic industry rate of 78%. And again, our higher utilization rates are clearly demonstrated throughout all market cycles. Our value-added diversified product offerings differentiated supply chain solutions provides stickiness and the support of our internal pull-through manufacturing volume has clearly demonstrated time and time again that we can maintain a higher utilization than our peers in the industry. As a key differentiator. It supports our strong and growing through-cycle cash generation capability and best-in-class financial metrics. Looking forward, customer order entry is good and backlogs are solid. In actuality, December was a historically high order intake month followed by another historic high order intake year-to-date. So we see a very, very, very solid market developing for the rest of the year. Auto production is expected to increase in 2023 from the lower 2022 rates. Dealer inventories have improved, but still remain meaningfully below historic norms. The build rate in 2022 was roughly 14.3 million units, and it is expected to grow a little to about 15%, 15.1% for 2023 and higher thereafter. Nonresidential construction remains solid as evidenced by fabrication backlog, and as I said, the long product steel volumes. Residential construction has certainly softened. It is impacting HVAC, appliance and other housing-related products, but fortunately, much of our portfolio is biased toward replacement. Oil and gas activity is driving improved orders for OCTG and line pipe and solar continues to grow. And I think generally, this market strength is clearly supporting market price appreciation and in particular, the challenges with OMS in Mexico, has certainly changed the regional sort of markets and the Mexico a stand in Mexico and the U.S. market is certainly benefiting from that. In Sinton, the downstream coating lines are running well. They are running below full capacity, though, as the rest of the mill continues to work through start-up items. The hot mill, and that is the good news, the homes turned the corner, running more consistency, approaching 65% capability month-to-date. We have been experiencing very, very long sequence lengths on the case recently up to 22 hours at a time. We are achieving days in excess of 85% capacity, and we should be around about 150,000 tons for the month of January and improving thereafter. Our current utilization is certainly being impacted by certain supply chain issues related to bearings and roles. This is specific to the casted roles in the segments. But we expect to have this resolved before the end of the first quarter, which will allow for a much stronger production for the rest of the year. Additionally, high-priced pig iron inventory is being drawn down through the quarter and the raw material input cost was normalized for Q2 through the rest of the year. While financial performance will likely be flat there in the first quarter, as we consume that high-price pig iron we expect significant events in both productivity and earnings in Q2. Mill production dimensional capabilities improving there. The hot strip mill design is certainly allowed for thermal mechanical rolling, allowing production of higher strength grades with lower alloyed content and associated alloy cost, and we have already been approved and shipped some API grades. I think experience to-date certainly affirms our technical and process choices, and there is no doubt that this is the next-generation electric arc furnace-based flat-rolled steel technology of choice going forward. We continue to grow our exceptional through cyclical operating and financial performance continues to support our cash generation and growth investment strategies. We have the four value-add flat-rolled steel coating lines under construction. These projects have gone well, and they are targeted for start-up in the second half of 2023. We have a galvanizing line and paint line going in at Sinton and similarly into Heartland, and we are seeing very good customer interest for that new volume. Currently, we are the largest domestic nonautomotive coater flat rolled steel with and annual coating capacity of over six million tons, these four new lines will increase that capacity by an additional 1.1 million tons. We have created unique supply chain solutions for our customers, which allow our downstream lines to remain always fully utilized with our highest margin products. Switching to aluminum, market response from both current and new customers across all markets has truly been incredible. To recap the project itself the 650,000 metric ton per year aluminum flat roll facility. The main mill facility will be located in Columbus, Mississippi. It is close to the Southeastern markets and well positioned to serve Mexico. It is on the KCS rail line, which connects us again to Mexico to bring slab up and material back down to Mexico and it also connects to Canada to bring primary aluminum down from the sources up there. We intentionally located it on the TVA power grid to allow supply green energy. And we have water access by the Tom Big B waterway. So the transportation structure is good for us. We attained an attractive incentive package and having our current our Columbus steel mill close by. It allows us to draw on that facility for talent or professional services, and there will be a transition or transfer of many of our folks there which will have an immediate infusion of our culture to that aluminum facility. So we are excited about that. The mill itself will have on-site melt slab capacity of roughly 600,000 metric tons and will be supported by two satellite recycled aluminum slab casting centers. One will be located in the Southwest U.S. and one in SLP Mexico. Both sites, we have - letters have been sent in place, and we are under due diligence, but I believe it will serve us very, very, very well. And obviously, the strategic thought there was to place the slab centers in areas of surplus scrap and the California Western market and Mexico will have an abundance of UBC material. The mill itself, again, is going to be equipped with the two cash lines, the coating line, downstream processing and packaging lines. We have actually expanded the product scope there to include additional scrap processing and treatment to maximize recycled content. It is a state-of-the-art facility, and we will be serving the sustainable beverage and packaging markets, both body and TAM, the automotive sector and industrial sectors. Breakdown would be 300,000 tons of can sheet, 200,000 tons of auto and about 150,000 tons of industrial, or the principal equipment is on order, allowing for a pretty firm startup of the mill mid-2025. We believe the Mexican slab center will start up in the second half and the Southwest U.S. slab Center early 2025. The total project cost, including the recycled slab centers has grown a little from our initial $2.2 billion estimate. The increase is somewhat associated with - now that we have truly defined the equipment costs. But we have also added scope as I said, we put in a scrap processing and treatment and segregation at both the slab centers, which has increased that number a little and today, we estimate a firm budget of about $2.5 billion. It will be 100% funded with available cash and cash flow from operations. So there is no additional debt or financial needed to push this thing forward. And we clearly expect to see about $650 million to $700 million of through-cycle annual EBITDA, with an additional $40 million to $50 million arising from our recycled Omni Source efforts. From an investment premise and we have talked about it before, but we see the aluminum market, not unlike that in the steel industry, when we started SDI some 30-years ago. It is an industry that has essentially older assets, there has been little reinvestment over the years, heavy legacy cost, there is inefficiency and sort of high-cost operations. And the advantage compared to any other steel market that we have entered is there is actually a supply side deficit. Every other market in steel has always been oversupplied, and we have had to use our culture and low-cost strategies to penetrate those markets. With aluminum, there is a clear, clear supply deficit will certainly aid the ramp-up and a very, very quick profitability of that project. Certainly business alignment, we believe it is sort of an adjacent industry, so to speak. It is going to allow us to leverage our core competencies of constructing design, constructing, ramping up very, very large capital assets. It will allow us to leverage our recycling footprint, Omni Source is the largest North American recycling of nonferrous products, including aluminum. We recycle over GBP 1.2 billion, half of that is aluminum to there. I believe we will certainly be able to infuse the project with our culture, and that will power a very low cost, very high efficiency operations. So we are very, very excited and we are certainly excited from the reception we are getting from those aluminum customers. Looking forward, we are certainly excited and passion by our future growth opportunities as they will continue the high returning growth momentum we have consistently demonstrated over the years. We were recently added to the S&P 500 Index. I feel that is a true testament to our people and to the financial strength and maturity of our company. We are arguably one of the top five steel producers in the world as measured by market cap today and the third largest in North America by capacity and we certainly have the best financial metrics of any of our peers. And all these achievements have been achieved in a relatively short time frame, and that could not be accomplished without the phenomenal commitment of our extraordinary people. Everyone has had an impact and everyone contributes each and every day. We are celebrating our 30th year in business later this year, and there are only better things to come. Our teams and the culture they create on our foundation, and I thank each of them for their passion and their dedication. And in turn, we are committed to their wealth firm, their health and their safety. And I remind those listening today that safety for yourselves and each other is our highest priority each and every day. Our success is also driven by the loyal support of our customers who have become partners and friends over the years and together, we have created many innovative supply chain solutions, creating value for all. And we look forward to providing similar value and optionality to all our new customers as we continue to expand our product offerings in the steel arena, but also in the new aluminum market that we are entering. And finally, thank you to all that have invested in us. There is a growing number that recognizing the power of our culture, the resilience of our business model and the potential outsized depreciation that are significant yet disciplined growth will return. We certainly look forward to creating new opportunities for all of us today and in the years ahead. So with that said, I would love to open the floor up or the call up for questions. Thank you good morning and thanks for your question. I do believe that - when one says disrupt an industry that can be taken both positively and negatively. I think from our perspective, we look at it from a very positive nature, creating optionality for the customer base, many of our existing steel customers also buy and consume aluminum and so it is great to be able to create further value for them. I do believe that our advantage and we have seen that over the last 30-years in steel, in that the power of our culture allowing us to leverage state-of-the-art equipment tends to drive very, very effective, highly efficient, low-cost operations and in any commodity any commodity market, the low-cost producer will survive and thrive and allow superior financial metrics through the cycle. And so the mill itself, the combination again of our culture, as stated on the equipment, just simply the plant layout, the high recycled content that we will enjoy the improved yield impact through the process, the low overhead cost all will combine to provide a very low cost solution and allow us to, I think, penetrate those markets quite effectively. Will that change the pricing environment? I don't think so. We will be just a partial participant initially anyway in that marketplace. Thank you Carlos, you were like a machine gun there. So I'm not so sure I got all your questions. I think from a ramp-up, I will work backwards, but from the ramp-up of the coating lines, those will be, I think, very, very, very strong. Obviously, we have many, many galvanizing lines, prepaint lines throughout the company, and we will harness all our technical resources there to get those lines up quickly. We certainly have the substrate available to fully load those lines. So I think the ramp up, again, those lines of start up at second half, perhaps fourth quarter and will ramp up quite quickly through the rest of the year into the following year. I think one has to recognize that the industry has gone through quite a consolidation comparing it to some years ago and that has allowed sort of market strength or strong market pricing compared to history, and that will continue. The year as it is unfolding, we are entering the year with an absolute solid backlog through the middle of the year for sure. The order input rate is indeed off the kind of the frenetic crazy pace that it was 12-months ago. But it is very, very, very solid, and we believe that it is going to be a very, very good year for us at year-end. And I believe there is some concern maybe as I said earlier, the macro indices may not look as rosy as some would think. And some believe that there is economic uncertainty out there, as I hopefully articulated, we don't see the gloom and doom that everyone else is seeing it. Our order input rates across all our sectors with the 1 exception, a little off on residential is solid. And our December bookings record level on a historic basis similarly year-to-date. So we just see strength through the year through our lands through our order book. Well, I think the steel space will -- I know I'm saying that the steel space will appreciate from the lows. Obviously, we are seeing the hot-band pricing off the market pricing of 650 and it is up away over 700. In fabrication, the spreads will likely come off a little. They certainly haven't to any large extent at this point. You are certainly seeing people say, well, our projects are getting delayed, we are not seeing any cancellations at all. We are seeing projects delayed some. But in my mind, it is not an unhealthy thing in all honesty, because it is just protracting or extending the cycle -- the business cycle in that arena. And just the one comment, though, I think it was mentioned that the distribution warehouses are again canceled. We actually are only seeing that in one customer. Well, actually, not a customer of ours, but one company the distribution warehouse business in our backlog is solid and not getting canceled out. So that is not a comprehensive issue. And just to reemphasize what Teresa said on earlier on the reshoring. Reshoring is real. It truly is. That is going to be supportive of that business. And if you look through just the size of some of these factories, the battery manufacturing facilities is a huge, massive, massive facilities that will require a lot of joists and deck. So again, it is off the frenetic pace that we saw, but it is a very, very, very solid sector for us for the rest of the year. I guess from our perspective, the higher demand translates to, in large part, to price up point and spread support. Our operations are already running at quite a high utilization rate. Further demand, obviously, is certainly going to help our Sinton facility. And given the market sectors, energy is very, very strong in that area in Texas. That is helping us. And the challenges that we are seeing in Mexico and the imports of sheet coming up from Mexico into the Southwest markets, but also even under the Midwest have essentially mitigate they are staying in Mexico now. So that is going to create good demand and great dynamics. So from a market perspective, we will certainly be able to support all the capability that the ramp-up will allow. Well, as we have suggested in the past, we are not big in the rebar markets in at. But nonetheless, from our structural long products perspective, the infrastructure bill or spending is not necessarily kicked in yet. It typically takes six to nine months for that to materialize. And obviously, it is too soon. But come the summer of this year, I think you will start to see some benefit there. John, great to have you on the call as always, and thanks for the question. I think the biggest parameter is substrate costs. As we have -- over the years, we have ramped up the tech substrate, Holland substrate and even at Sinton, we actually pre-purchased about 150,000 tons, maybe a little more to load the downstream coating lines in preparation for when the hot mill started up. So you are certainly seeing that influence our costs, for sure. We have always tried to not share that information, John. So I would prefer to stay that way. I would tell you though that, one, our conversion cost is probably as good as anyone in the world. And number two, the people don't necessarily recognize the offsetting sort of efficiency or effectiveness of volume. So on our process lines, carbonizing lines prepaint lines, even though some of the input costs have appreciated, the fact that our teams continually just improve productivity, put more volume through offsetting the sort of the overhead and the fixed costs. Our actual processing costs on those lines have been sort of almost stagnant for the last, I don't know, how many years. Thank you and thank you for everyone on the call for your time today. Certainly, thanks to our team. I want to remind each and every one of you that you do contribute, you do have an impact on our success and stay safe and keep each other safe. Customers, we can do it without you. And I would just like to reemphasize those that have invested in us, there is a growing cadre of folks that are building positions that - they really are recognizing the power of our culture. It is different. We are different, and we drive absolutely different results. Our business model allows us to perform and maintain a higher through-cycle cash generation than our peers. And I think hopefully, people are starting to recognize that that our capital allocation, our growth is incredibly disciplined, particularly on the acquisition side. And I think that that speaks to just our underlying results. It is interesting if one measures the earnings power of our company on an employee basis, we are substantially higher than anyone else out there in our peer group. And again, it speaks to our overall efficiency and effectiveness of the culture, the strategic decisions that the team has made over the years, and it will continue to drop to the bottom line. So investors that support us, again, many, many thanks to you as well and with that said, have a great day."

            "name": "Theresa Wagler",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. I add my sincere appreciation and congratulations to the entire team. We continue to hit new milestones throughout the company achieving record annual performance in 2022, with record revenues of $22.3 billion derived from strong product pricing and volumes across all of our operating platforms. Record operating income of $5.1 billion and net income of $3.9 million or $2.92 per diluted share, and record cash flow from operations of $4.5 billion with EBITDA of $5.5 billion. As Mark mentioned, is truly an exceptional performance. Regarding our fourth quarter 2020 results, net income was $635 million or $3.61 per diluted share which includes additional performance-based special compensation of $24 million or $0.09 per diluted share that was awarded to all nonexecutive eligible team members and recognition of their extraordinary performance and costs of approximately $168 million or $0.67 per diluted share associated with our Sinton Texas flat-rolled steel mill ramp. Our fourth quarter 2022 operating income declined 35% sequentially to $759 million due to lower realized selling values and seasonally lower shipments within our steel operations, which individually generate operating income of $178 million with shipments of 3 million tons in the fourth quarter. Our flat-rolled steel mills were negatively impacted during the quarter with high-cost pig iron that was purchased earlier in 2022 during the early stages of Russia and Beijing of Ukraine. Based on current pig iron prices of $500 per ton versus our average cost incurred in the fourth quarter, earnings were negatively impacted by about $80 million. We expect to see that continue into the first quarter and the negative impact is likely to be around $60 million as we work through all the higher price pig iron before the end of the first quarter. For the full-year 2022, operating income from our steel operations was $3.1 billion, representing the second strongest year in our history, with record annual shipments of 12.2 million tons. Fourth quarter operating income from our metals recycling operations improved to $14 million based on increased volume and metal spread expansion despite lower average selling values. For the full-year 2022, operating income from our mills recycling operations was $130 million. Due to lower volume and average selling values, our spare scrap prices fell nine out of 12 months during the year. It was sequentially lower than the record results in 2021. Our Mexican recycling operations have proven to be a strategic key for both sourcing scrap for our Southern steel mills and driving profitability. I want to say a sincere thank you to the Zimmer and Roka team. We continue to effectively lever the strength of our circular manufacturing model, benefiting both our steel and metals recycling operations by providing higher quality scrap to our steel mills which improves furnace efficiency, lowers cost and reduces company-wide working capital needs. And once again, our steel fabrication operations achieved record quarterly operating income of $682 million as metal spreads continue to expand based on steady product pricing and lower steel input costs, which more than offset the impact of seasonally lower shipments. steel joists and deck remains solid as evidenced by our continued strong order backlog and which extends through the first half of 2023. Our steel fabrication platform also achieved another record year in 2022, with operating income of $2.4 billion eclipsing last year's record of $365 million. Congratulations to the entire team, well done. This demonstrates the power of our circular manufacturing model and the natural hedge our steel fabrication business provides to steel price shifts. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we generated strong cash flow from operations of $1.1 billion due to strong results in the release of working capital. For the full-year, we generated a record $4.5 billion, our cash generation is consistently strong based on our differentiated circular business model and highly variable low-cost structure. At the end of the year, we had liquidity of $3.4 billion comprised of cash and short-term investments of $2.2 billion and our fully available unsecured revolver of $1.2 billion. During 2022, we invested $909 million in capital investments of which over half related to ongoing construction of our four new flat-rolled coating lines and our aluminum flat-rolled mill investments. For 2023, we believe capital investments will be in the range of $1.5 billion, the majority of which relates to our aluminum flat-rolled investments and the completion of our flat-rolled coating lines. Since our last call, we also announced the location for our aluminum rolling mill as Columbus, Mississippi. Mark will share the strategy of the location later in the call. We are also incredibly pleased to have received near-term state incentives for the project, of $250 million with meaningful additional tax benefits to occur over the next 15-years. During the fourth quarter, we maintained our cash dividend of $0.34 per common share after increasing at 31% in the first quarter of 2022. We also repurchased $413 million of our common stock in the fourth quarter. For the full-year, we paid cash dividends of $237 million and repurchased $1.8 billion or 12% of our outstanding shares, representing a 53% net income shareholder distribution rate. At the end of the year, $1.3 billion remains available under our current share authorization program. Since 2017, we have increased our cash dividend per share by 119% and we have repurchased $4.2 billion of our common stock, representing 31% of our outstanding shares. These actions reflect the strength of our capital foundation and consistently strong cash flow generation capability and the continued optimism and confidence in our future. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes high-return strategic growth with shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that is complemented with a variable share repurchase program, while we remain dedicated to preserving our investment-grade credit designation. We have strategically placed ourselves in a position of strength to have a sustainable capital foundation that provides the opportunity for meaningful strategic growth and strong shareholder returns while maintaining investment-grade metrics. Our free cash flow profile has fundamentally changed over the last five years from an annual average of $580 million between 2011 and 2015 to $2.6 billion today between 2018 and 2022. Our recently announced aluminum investment is consistent with our unchanged capital allocation strategy. We will readily fund our flat-rolled aluminum investment with available cash and cash flow from operations. We also plan to continue strong and responsible shareholder distributions as we have clearly demonstrated. We are squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable optimized long-term value creation. Sustainability is also a significant part of our long-term value creation strategy, and we are dedicated to our people, our communities under environment. We are committed to operating our business with the highest integrity. In that regard, we are excited about our newly formed joint venture with Aymium, a leading producer of renewable biocarbon products. We believe our first joint facility could decrease our steel Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 35%. We have an actionable path toward carbon neutrality that is more manageable and we believe, considerably less expensive than may lay ahead for many of our industry peers. Our sustainability and carbon reduction strategy is an ongoing journey and we are moving forward with an intention to make a positive difference. We plan to continue to address these matters and to play a leadership role moving forward. As I conclude my remarks, I know there is some of you that follow more detail of our flat-rolled shipments. So for the fourth quarter, our hot-rolled shipments were 959,000 tons, our cold-rolled shipments were 109,000 tons, and our coated shipments were 1.1 million tons. Mark. From a progress perspective Emily, I think that Mark mentioned earlier that we do have locations that we have in mind and we are negotiating right now for both of the recycled slab facilities plus we now have a location. And so there is a lot of excitement happening in Columbus, Mississippi. Last year, we spent about just a little over $120 million on the investments going forward, just to kind of recalibrate since we do have an increased amount of $2.5 billion. In 2023, we are likely to spend somewhere between $900 million and $950 million in capital, in 2024, $1.2 billion, with the remaining $200 million to $300 million during the startup year of 2025. So the teams are pushing forward very quickly. As it relates to the first part of your question, Carlos, around utilization for the industry. I would point out that even if you go back to more challenging times like 2015, et cetera, our utilization still remained very high, and that is because of the power of our pull-through volume, which we would anticipate as well. But we are really optimistic for 2023 with the additional on shoring of manufacturing businesses, which you are seeing in reality as well as with the infrastructure program and other investment opportunities. We think that steel demand in the U.S. will continue to stay steady to potentially increasing as well as the trade benefits of melting and casting in the U.S. for the U.S. producer. So yes, flat-rolled prices specifically have improved recently, which we think that they should have. We don't think that, that is going to have a negative impact. We think that will be a positive impact, and we think both industry utilization rates and ours specifically, should remain steady to improving in 2023. Good morning Curt. So from the perspective of pricing, Obviously, we are not going to give specific pricing. But you would have seen that the pricing held in very steadily in the fourth quarter from an average perspective. And we have seen very steady pricing in the backlog as well. So I would err on the higher side if you think about what is in the backlog. And that is why we have great confidence in the earnings resiliency of the fabrication business through at least the first half of this year. And the order backlog, it is an interesting question because it is broadened out, wherein as it was very concentrated in warehouses, it is broadened out now into more, I would say, infrastructure type hospitals, schools, churches et cetera, so that is a good thing and that is what we think we are seeing more of. We expected very strong volumes for fabrication in 2023 from what we are seeing so far. And Mark mentioned the order entry activity is very good from a historical. So then you can contemplate what you think steel prices will be to make an estimation of whether you think we will continue to see expanding spreads in fabrication or not. That is what we saw in the fourth quarter definitively. Mark, do you want to add anything? Yes. So from a volume perspective Curt, Sinton had shipments in the third quarter of around just under 270,000 tons, and it increased to just under 340,000 tons for shipments in the fourth quarter, and we expect to see that improve in the first quarter and then have a significant improvement in the second quarter of 2023. From an impact, we still expect to see losses as they work through the higher-priced pigeon which is obviously matching against lower steel prices than they were at this time last year. And so like it will be -- it should improve over the fourth quarter losses pretty significantly, but still be higher than we would like to see maybe around the $10 million mark. So I think Mark mentioned the ramp-up for the two additional value-add lines that will be in Sinton the third quarter of 2023. Those should ramp, we expect fairly quickly to start benefiting their product mix. We are not going to give full-year guidance for Sinton as far as EBITDA. But I would tell you that I think Curt mentioned earlier on the call, that the losses in 2022 were over $400 million, and it is going to swing to a significant positive for 2023. So just that differential alone will have a significant momentum benefit to our earnings in 2023, but it is just too early for us to give an estimate, but it won't hit through cycle EBITDA in the year where we are still ramping up production. Good one. I'm smiling because Mark tosses things my way, and it is funny how he does it. But from a dividend perspective, we do like to grow the dividend in a way that is consistent so that we are constantly having increases across the spectrum. And I think as I mentioned, since 2017, we actually increased the dividend by almost 120%. And we like to do that lockstep with free cash flow increases that are through cycle like Sinton. I would expect that we should have a pretty significant increase coming forward as well. We like to do those traditionally in the first quarter time frame. We have additional projects that are a little bit smaller, but that are coming online in 2023 that will add to through-cycle earnings. And given our stock price, which has been fantastic, driving up recently, you should expect to see strong shareholder distributions continue, and that would include a strong increase in the dividend coming forward. And the other thing that you hit, John, was spot on as well. It has to do with mix. So if you think about the increase in the impact from our fabrication business, that we would have had some change in that as well. So I think it is both mix and what Mark talked about is the steel substrate."

They are intended to be protected by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 should actual results to turn out differently. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties related to integrating or starting up new assets, the aluminum industry, the use of estimates and assumptions in connection with anticipated project returns and our steel, metals recycling and fabrication businesses, as well as to general business and economic conditions. Examples of these are described in the related press release as well as in our annually filed SEC Form 10-K under the heading, Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors, found on the Internet at www.sec.gov, and if applicable, in any later SEC Form 10-Q. You'll also find any referenced non-GAAP financial measures reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the press release issued yesterday entitled, Steel Dynamics Reports Third Quarter 2022 results. And now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mark.\nMark Millett: Thank you, David. I forgot to turn the microphone on there as always. But thank you, everyone, for being with us on our third quarter earnings call. It certainly was an exciting quarter with great performance by the team and growth on many fronts. Firstly, a great welcome to the ROCA team, Senate in Monterrey. In combination with the former Zimmer Group, OmniSource Mexico now is a significant recycling presence within Mexico that will support their existing Mexican customer base, while providing strategic sourcing opportunities for our Sinton and Columbus steel mills and soon to be aluminum mill. Sinton has turned the corner and is showing significant improvement. The team is also making great progress on our aluminum flat rolled strategy, which I will share later on the call. Operationally, our third quarter was a great quarter, achieving several new benchmarks, including record steel and steel fabrication shipments and record cash flow from operations, all supporting our cash allocation strategy and commitment to further expansion of shareholder value. I continue to be incredibly proud of our teams. They are on our foundation and the catalyst of our current and future success. It's their culture of excellence and the strategic positioning executed over the last number of years that allows us to maximize opportunities, resulting in higher lows and higher highs through the cycle. So a great quarter, yet none of this matters without keeping our teams safe. Often employees are described as a company's most important resource. For us, they are more than that. They are family and the SDI family now is 26,000 strong. We are focused to provide the very best for their health, safety and welfare. We're actively engaged in safety at all times at every level of our organization, came in top of mind and an active conversation throughout the company. We will not rest until we consistently achieve our goal of zero incidents. But before I continue, Theresa, would you like to give us some details?\nTheresa Wagler: Thanks, Mark. Good morning, everyone. I add my sincere appreciation and personal congratulations to the team on another strong operational and financial performance. Our third quarter 2022 net income was $914 million or $5.03 per diluted share, inclusive of costs of $111 million or $0.43 per diluted share associated with the continued start-up of our Sinton, Texas flat-rolled steel mill. Excluding these costs, third quarter 2022 adjusted net income was $992 million or $5.46 per diluted share. Third quarter revenues of $5.7 billion declined 9% sequentially based on lower flat-rolled steel and scrap pricing. Our third quarter 2022 operating income was $1.2 billion lower than sequential results due to lower pricing and resulting metal spread compression in our flat-rolled steel operations. Our steel operations generated solid operating income of $658 million in the third quarter, with record shipments, as Mark mentioned, the 3.2 million tons, of which Sinton contributed 268,000 tons. Sequential earnings were significantly lower due to the previously mentioned metal spread compression within our flat-rolled steel businesses. In contrast, our long product steel operations experienced metal spread expansion as average scrap cost declined more than product pricing in the quarter. In fact, our Structural and Rail and Roanoke Bar divisions each achieved record earnings. Congratulations to those teams. Third quarter operating income for our mills recycling operations declined to $10 million as ferrous pricing declined month-over-month through the quarter, resulting in significant metal margin compression but the team continues to effectively lever the strength of our circular manufacturing operating model, benefiting both our steel and metals recycling operations by providing higher quality scrap to our steel mills, which improves furnace efficiency and by reducing company-wide working capital requirements. I also give my welcome to the Roanoke team. A huge congratulations once again to our steel fabrication team. They achieved record third quarter operating income of $677 million. These earnings were driven by record average pricing, record shipments and lower steel input costs. Steel joist and deck demand remained solid as evidenced by our continued strong order backlog, which extends well through the first half of 2023. We generated record cash flow from operations of $1.5 billion in the third quarter as strong results and release of working capital benefited cash flow. Year-to-date 2022, we've generated a record $3.3 billion. Our cash generation is consistently strong based on our differentiated circular business model and highly low-cost variable cost structure. At the end of September, we had record liquidity of $3.2 billion comprised of cash and short-term investments of $2 billion and an undrawn unsecured revolver of $1.2 billion. Year-to-date 2022, we funded $565 million in capital investments. For the fourth quarter of 2022, we estimate capital investments will be close to $400 million, of which about $200 million is related to our recently announced aluminum flat-rolled investments, with much of the remaining capital related to our four new flat-rolled coating lines that will be located in Sinton and Heartland. We maintained our cash dividend at $0.34 per common share after increasing at 31% in the first quarter. We also repurchased $482 million of our common stock in the third quarter, representing over 3% of our outstanding shares. Year-to-date, we paid cash dividends of $177 million and repurchased $1.4 billion or 10% of our outstanding shares, representing a 48% net income distribution ratio. At the end of the third quarter, $245 million remained available under our current share repurchase authorization. These actions reflect the strength of our capital foundation and consistently strong cash flow generation capability throughout all market cycles and the continued optimism and confidence in our future. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes strategic growth with shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that's complemented with a variable share repurchase program, while remaining dedicated to preserving our investment-grade credit designation. Our recently announced aluminum investment is consistent with our unchanged capital allocation philosophy. We have strategically placed ourselves in a position to have a sustainable capital foundation that provides the opportunity for strategic growth; strong shareholder returns and maintain investment-grade metrics. Our cash flow profile has fundamentally changed over the last five years. We will readily fund our flat-rolled aluminum investments with available cash and cash flow from operations. We also plan to continue strong shareholder distributions as we clearly demonstrated in the third quarter. We're squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable optimized long-term value creation. Sustainability is also a significant part of our long-term value creation strategy, and we are dedicated to our people, our communities and our environment. We're committed to operating our business with the highest integrity. In that regard, we're excited about our newly formed joint venture with Aymium, a leading producer of renewable biocarbon products. We believe our first joint venture facility will decrease our steel Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 25%. We have an actionable path to our carbon neutrality as more manageable, and we believe considerably less expensive than may lie ahead for many of our industry peers. Our sustainability and carbon reduction strategy is an ongoing journey, and we are moving forward with the intention to make a positive difference. We plan to continue to address these matters and to play a leadership role moving forward. In conclusion, I know some of you track the details behind our flat-rolled shipments. And so for the quarter, we shipped hot-rolled and P&O of 951,000 tons; cold rolled of 139,000 tons; and finally, coated flat rolled products of 1,102,000 tons. For a total of 2,192,000 tons of flat rolled shipments. Mark?\nMark Millett: Super. Thank you, Teresa. And certainly, incredible results from the steel fabrication platform, a product that is obviously a market tailwind, but our strategic positioning over the years. We had record operating income of $677 million in the quarter, with the record shipments of 218,000 tons. Nonresidential construction markets remain strong, as would be suggested by the macro indicators. They all remain positive. ABI index of fitting a little over 53. ABI reports, business conditions remain generally strong, and Dodge Momentum Index improved 6% in September. Nonresidential starts and build rates are forecast to remain good into 2023. More importantly, our customers tell us demand remains solid in spite of economic uncertainty. Order activity is better paced versus the frenetic pace of the recent past and remains higher than historical norms. Our order backlog is well into the first half of 2023 with strong pricing dynamics and we expect to see continued strong volume for fabrication in the fourth quarter and for 2023 in general. Aside from the significant advantage of pull-through volume for our sheet mills, New Millennium provides a perfect hedge to our steel operations. Although SDI mills saw steady utilization throughout the third quarter, lower domestic steel industry utilization in general reduced the demand for scrap in the quarter. First, scrap prices have declined month-over-month beginning in May through October, prime dropping from some $735 a ton to more recently around about $380 per gross ton. Omni's earnings suffered as a result of this progression in market pricing and weaker industry demand. The Omni platform is continuing to work with our steel mill teams to expand our shred separation opportunities to provide even higher volumes of low residual scrap. The impact of our efforts, along with others in the industry, has amply demonstrated our view that innovation will solve any perceived fears of prime scrap shortage in the years ahead. With additional producers coming to the market, pig iron availability is normalized and pricing has moderated significantly to a little over $500 per ton. We have sufficient pig iron sourced well into next year. Supply is not an issue for our flat rolled operations. And again, we're excited for the addition of Roka to our OmniSource Mexico portfolio, which now will grow to some 2.5 million tons of ferrous and non-ferrous annual capability. It was another historically strong quarter for the steel platform. We had record shipments of 3.2 million tons and operating income of $658 million. Our third quarter production utilization rate was around 93%, which was incrementally lower than the second quarter that was 95%, yet significantly above the industry average of 78%. High utilization rates are clearly demonstrated through time. Value-added diversified product offerings, differentiated supply chain solutions all support and the support of internal pull-through volume all support that utilization -- higher utilization rate compared to our peers. And in turn, it supports our strong and growing through-cycle cash the industry capability and best-in-class financial metrics. Looking forward, customer order entry is good and backlogs are solid and that's supported by our diversified portfolio of value-added products, which comprised now of around 70% of steel sales. We focus on value-creating supply chains to mitigate the impact of price volatility and all this just maintains a higher through-cycle utilization rate. Relative to the markets, we see automotive steady at current rates and we expect that to improve off low 2022 production based on the extremely low dealer inventories and pent-up vehicle demand. The 2022 build rate is going to be some 14.5 million units, and we would expect 2023 to grow to 15.5 units or so, and 2024 to 16-plus units -- million units. Non-residential construction remains solid as evidenced by fabrication backlog and long product steel volumes. Long product steel backlogs are good and several of our divisions, Summa City and Roanoke in particular, achieved strong volumes and record earnings in the third quarter, demonstrating our market depth. Infrastructure spending should also provide further meaningful support in the coming years. New residential construction has softened a little, impacting HVAC and appliance and other housing-related products. Fortunately, our portfolio is biased to replacement, and we won't get a ton of a ton impact. Oil and gas activity is driving improved orders for OCTG and line pipe, and solar renewable expansion continues to grow. Turning to Sinton. Both coating lines are running extremely well, and ramp-up continues on the hot side in the tandem cold mill. I believe the hot mill has certainly turned the corner, becoming more consistently running at a 60%, 65% month-to-date with days exceeding well over 80%. Surface quality is excellent. Reported coil shape from processing customers is also excellent. And our hot strip mill design has allowed for thermal mechanical rolling, allowing higher strength grades with lower alloy content and associated costs. And we've already been approved and shipped some API grades, which is quite remarkable given the mill has only been up and running for what, nine months. So the team has done a phenomenal job. And I think it certainly affirms our technical and process choices and it is indeed a next-generation mill. Our exceptional through cycle operating and financial performance continues to support our cash allocation strategies and growth. The four value-add flat-rolled steel coating lines are going well and are targeted for the second half of 2023 for startup, two for Sinton and two for Heartland, and we're already seeing customer interest for that new volume. We're the largest domestic non-automotive coater of flat-rolled steel with an annual coating capacity over 6 million tons. These four new lines will increase that capacity by an additional 1.1 million tons. We have created unique supply chain solutions for our customers, which allow our downstream lines to remain always full with our highest margin products. Relative to the lunar dynamics, the market response from both current and new customers across all market sectors has been absolutely incredible. And so to recap that project, it's a 650,000 metric ton a year aluminum flat roll facility, which will be located in the Southeastern US, and we expect to announce that site location in the next few weeks. On-site mill and cash slab capacity will consist of 450,000 metric tons, and that will be supported by two satellite recycled aluminum slab casting centers, one in the Southwest US and one in the South. We'll have two cash lines, coating line and downstream processing and packaging lines. So we'll be able to furnish all products to the beverage -- food packaging arena, automotive and industrial. The mill is planned to start up in mid-2025, the Mexico Slab Center in 2024 and the Southwest Slab Center in the first quarter of 2025. The financial impact will be around $2.2 billion CapEx over four years. It's going to be funded 100% with available cash and cash flow from operations with no additional debt needed. We expect to add about $650 million to $700 million of through cycle annual EBITDA once it's up and running. So in closing, we're excited and passion by our future growth opportunities as they will continue the high returning growth momentum we have demonstrated over the last 15 years. Our teams are our foundation. I thank each of them for their passion and their dedication and their desire to excel. We are committed to the health and safety. And I remind those listening today that safety for yourselves and each other is our highest priority. Our culture and business model continues to positively differentiate our performance from others. We're competitively positioned and continue to focus on providing superior value for our company, our customers, team members and shareholders, and we look forward to creating new opportunities for everyone today and in the years ahead. So with that said, we would love to answer any questions you might have.\nOperator: Thank you [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is coming from Emily Chieng with Goldman Sachs.\nEmily Chieng: Good morning, Mark and Theresa. Thank you for the time this morning. My question is just around the fabrication business, and we've certainly seen realized pricing trend higher on a sequential basis. But perhaps could you share some color on where new contract awards are getting priced? And how should we be thinking about the sustainability of your margins in this segment in the near-term and perhaps call it on a normalized basis?\nMark Millett: Certainly, Emily. Well, again, that business is incredibly robust. Our backlogs are so from a volume standpoint and pricing standpoint at historic highs. And we see that backlog well into 2023, probably about eight months from there, and it remains solid. Spreads are at very high numbers, as you can see from our most recent results. And we see that volume being sustained. Our Q3 volume into Q4. And our earnings should certainly parallel that as relative to the third quarter. I do believe. So very, very strong. As you may recognize, that industry over the years is sort of rationalized and consolidated. And no longer fragmented as it once was. And we see higher pricing and higher spreads being sustained through the cycle going forward.\nEmily Chieng: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley.\nCarlos De Alba: Thank you very much. Good morning. So the question is based on the comments for end markets, it seems that long products should be doing better than the flat end markets on the lending products. But in the reported volumes, we saw your long steel volumes falling a little bit quarter-on-quarter, while flat improved. So I just wonder if you can give us a little bit of your -- how you see that evolving in the fourth quarter? Do you think that this is going to probably reverse based on the end market situation and how those are evolving? And also you mentioned in your press release that, seasonally, you see lower volumes in the fourth quarter. However, your seasonality in the last couple of years has been quite different than what we saw in, say, 2015 to 2019 prior to the pandemic. So if you could share some color as to how you see the seasonality playing out this time around will be also great.\nTheresa Wagler: Good morning, Carlos, thanks for joining us on the call. So from the specifics of flat increasing, while, I would say, long products was very strong, because long products had record shipments in the second quarter, so still very strong. But you have to remember that, Sinton is starting up in this time frame. So the addition of Sinton ramping up helps offset some of the seasonality that you might see in our flat roll shipments even as we head into the fourth quarter. That being said, we're expecting still to see really resilient volume from the steel base, both in long and flat, as we head into the -- what -- you're correct, is more of a seasonal time frame, but we have some offsetting parameters as we look at both Sinton. And frankly, as we look at our coated products, specifically Galvalume had a really strong third quarter.\nCarlos De Alba: Right. Thank you, Theresa.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research.\nTimna Tanners: Great. Thanks. Good morning.\nMark Millett: Good morning.\nTimna Tanners: I wanted to just ask you about things, you utilization continuing to be higher than peers. And it's a pretty big contrast, as you point out, you're ramping up Sinton. And meanwhile, US Steel has cut production, saying there's not enough demand. And your utilization is a pretty stark contrast. I'm just -- and Nucor said that they're being disciplined in holding off tons because of weaker demand. So I'm just wondering, you can explain what's different about what you're seeing? And if you could, while you do that, if you could talk a little bit about the opportunities that you'd mentioned in the past for exporting to Mexico and the West Coast from the Sinton operation. Thanks.\nMark Millett: Well, Timna, I think, as we told in the past, I do believe our business model is definitely differentiated from our peers for sure. And the high utilization rate is triggered, I think, probably in three spots. One, is we have a much more diversified value-add product portfolio mix than probably any steel producer in the state today. That allows us optionality across all market sectors and all market products, and that certainly has a significant impact. I do believe we have cultivated and developed over time some pretty unique supply chain sort of partnerships with many of our customers, and that gives us resilience through the cycle. And then thirdly, the pull-through volume of our sort of downstream conversion facilities and New Millennium is quite considerable. So if you look at this year, New Millennium, we'll be consuming about somewhere close to probably 800,000 tons of substrate. And much of that is procured through our own mills. So there's a massive volume sort of pull through there. And then our Heartland facility, which is roughly 800 million ton a year converter takes material and also The Techs, which has 850,000, 900,000 tons of consumption. So that pull-through volume onto itself. When there's a need, we bring a lot more of that in-house to maintain that utilization. And as you point out, through the cycle, we typically at 10%, 15% higher utilization than the industry in general. And I can't overemphasize the impact that has on our through-cycle cash generation capability. It certainly supports that and in turn, supports all the growth and the cash allocation strategies that we -- the balanced cash allocation strategies that we continue to execute.\nTimna Tanners: Okay. Great. Would you mind on the other part of the question about the opportunities that you'd allocation strategies that ability to ramp -- produce at higher levels as well?\nMark Millett: Yes. Sorry. I mean, a little tough time hearing Timna. The Sinton mill, obviously, ramping up focused on furnishing material through the two coating lines, the galvanized line, the paint line and just ramping up and commissioning all the different product capabilities we have there. We believe Mexico will long-term despite the additional hot band capability that's come on stream, we'll continue to have a mismatch in the cold-rolled coated arena and so it's our intent to be transferring or selling into the Mexican market, HVAC appliance, and automotive there. And we have yet to develop a meaningful sort of shipping volume to the West Coast, but I'm confident that, that will occur over time as that ramp continues.\nTimna Tanners: Okay. Thanks. I'll get back in the queue.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Cleveland Rueckert with UBS Securities.\nCleveland Rueckert: Hey everybody. I'll say good day, it's almost noon here. I appreciate question I'll stick to one, just to start. But Mark, I wanted to build on your comment about raw materials and scrap availability. I'm just curious, as we think about investment opportunities, I get that you're shifting investment into aluminum and that's kind of the priority right now. But -- is there any opportunity to invest in some of the raw materials businesses that you already own? I think on these calls before; you've talked about increasing usage of different scrap grades. I'm just wondering if that's more of an R&D exercise on your part on the steel operations or if there's some infrastructure that you're thinking could add some efficiency there?\nMark Millett: Well, I think the -- given our investment in Mexico for Zimmer and with Roka where we thought there was a very unique opportunity that, that arena is prime scrap rich and it would allow us to support Columbus and Sinton. Beyond that, we're not interested in any sort of large-scale recycled sort of acquisition-type investment. The investments will be centered though on streamlining and improving our existing operations, lowering our cost structure throughout that organization. And more specifically, investing in sort of segregation separating type technologies to optimize the streams, the waste streams that we have. So the ore, the switch and everything divide that up into more value-added 5,000, 6,000 series type raw materials for our aluminum mill. And also investing in technologies and expanding our current technologies because in all honesty, on the ferrous separation, what we call Shred One [ph], the improved shredded material; we have the technologies available to us. It's just a matter of expanding that across our omni base. And those technologies, they honestly, it's not a massive amount of CapEx spend. Can be underemphasized though, how that's impacting the scrap flows, and it's not just us. Some of our peers are doing the same thing, producing a very low residual shred. And as I've said in the past, if you look at a shredded car today, if you just take a piece of the rusty metal itself, that's likely been produced through a integrated mill and is a very, very low residual. So by separating out the little bit of copper and nickel, you can get a prime scrap from that obsolete flow. And I think we're seeing it, you can see it in the marketplace today where prime is actually selling under the shred price today. And it is amplifying the fact that their perceived concerns as additional capacity comes online over the next few years. But I think we've demonstrated clearly -- the industry has demonstrated clearly what I've always said, and as innovation will trump a challenge each and every day.\nCleveland Rueckert: That’s well understood. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Alex Hacking with Citi.\nAlex Hacking: Yeah. Thanks Mark and Theresa. So on Sinton, Mark, I think you mentioned that it had turned the corner. How close are you there to operating at consistent 80% rate? What are the remaining challenges? And then what needs to happen to get it up to 90%, 95% or whatever you would be targeting longer term? And is that the rate you would be expecting 90%, 95% exit rate in 2023? So you stopped below 80% and then you build up through the year, or it would be more of a consistent rate through the year? Thanks.\nMark Millett: Well, I would describe the issues at Sinton today as just typical start-up issues, a little amplified by the supply chain constraints out there. In the old days or the other mills we started up, you need a spare part, and it's like literally on the shelf in the local city. We were seeing a little more time to react to certain issues. That said, it is purely just making sure that we are operating each piece of equipment all the way from the electric arc furnaces through the label furnaces cast and external just operating each and every minute of each and every day. As I said earlier, the equipment is proven to be able to produce everything we intended. It's produced out to 84 wide. We've gone down to 043 or 044 and light gauge. We produced 1-inch plate. As I said earlier, we've already been certified on some of the perhaps slightly easier API grades, but the other grades will come with time. There's no issue or challenge to get there. It's just a matter of time. So from a capability standpoint, it's definitely there. We've had shifts. We've had days close to 85%, 86% of production rate, which again, given the relative short time that, that team has been ramping up is absolutely incredible. I think it took us three years in Butler to get a 4,000 ton shift, and we've had many of those already. So I'm not concerned. It's just a matter of time. Would expect that 2023, we should get around 80% of our 3 million tons of shipping capability.\nTheresa Wagler: But Alex, you're correct. That's for the entirety of the year. So there will be a progression of ramp so that by the time we're exiting 2023, we would expect to be operating at or near that capacity rate -- that full capacity rate.\nAlex Hacking: Okay. Thanks. And then just to clarify on the earlier comments, again, on Sinton. Would you be expecting to ship more flat-rolled in the 4Q, considering the ramp-up of Sinton or the seasonality will offset that? Thank you.\nTheresa Wagler: Alex, I think you were asking about the full complement of our flat roll operations? And we are expecting to have higher shipments from Sinton itself, but I'll leave you to determine what seasonality does to the rest of the group.\nAlex Hacking: Okay. Thank you.\nTheresa Wagler: You’re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Curt Woodworth with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nCurt Woodworth: Yes. Hi, Mark and Theresa. How are you?\nMark Millett: Good, thanks.\nCurt Woodworth: So I just wanted to talk a little bit more about fabrication. Can you kind of talk to the diversity within your backlog and maybe how bidding activity has progressed maybe the last 90 days? I think there is some concern in the market that the data center and warehouse build-out has really driven the bulk of this growth rate, and that could potentially fall sharply. And it sounds clear, if you have like a lot of big chunky projects that once those burn off, then you could be more at risk. And then within that, I know you spoke about pricing being fairly favorable. And I think you talked about how pricing would be going up progressively, I believe, into the second quarter, but can you just confirm that?\nTheresa Wagler: Good afternoon, Kurt. Thanks for the question. I'll let Mark address the diversity within the backlog of the fabrication business. It has changed just slightly. And I think it's become more favorable as these things are changing. As it relates to the backlog and the pricing, what Mark was suggesting is that we still have incredibly favorable pricing heading with the backlog that goes through much of the first half of 2023. It's not likely to be at that same peak level of $5,000-plus, but still very favorable. And at the same time, we're going to and expect to have lower steel input costs as we move through at least the fourth quarter. And so, as you can imagine, that's why the power in the business model of having fabrication be a real natural hedge to lower steel prices is very favorable to us. And that's what you're seeing today, and we would expect to see in the coming quarters as well. Mark, do you want to describe the diversity in the order backlog?\nMark Millett: Yes. I think it is transitioning a little bit. Early on, it was very, very sort of distribution warehouse focused with cloud computing and things are following along. Cloud computing, construction tends to be -- continue to be strong and grow. Warehouse may be kind of flat to stable. And we're also seeing sort of more infrastructure, hospitals, school type construction activity. So we see it strong. I mentioned earlier, it's not at the frenetic pace that it was perhaps six months ago or eight months ago. It's normalized to still very high relative to historic norms. And if you think about it, given the interest rate sort of environment and the little economic cloud that we have, it's not unexpected that people are wondering about projects, 7, 8, 9, 10 months out, and they're just waiting a little. But, in general, we see that just the nonresidential construction in general, remaining very, very, very robust through certainly the first half of next year into the latter half.\nTheresa Wagler: And just to address your point on the backlog, if there's any risk that we’d want to point out, there's really not. It's a well-diversified backlog. There's not individual projects that are of too large of a size. And something to just keep in mind as well as once something enters the backlog for the fabrication business, the projects have already been engineered. They generally have already been financed. There's a lot of certainty in that backlog. And if you look on average of the projects that we do, the cost of steel joist and steel jack or steel deck as a part of the entire project itself is only between 10% and 15%. So it's a small piece of that project in and of itself, which also reduces the risk.\nCurt Woodworth: Okay. Very helpful. And then, just as a follow-up, I think there have been some maybe incremental concerns on the aluminum flat rolled market, just given some of the announcements by Ball and others on the beverage can sheet side. So can you just give an update on maybe how you're progressing commercially with that project and what initial discussions have been like since you announced the project? Thanks very much.\nMark Millett: Well, relative to aluminum, we are awash with interest, an incredible interest. To be honest, we have been focused of late locating the facilities. Glenn and his team have just, in the last week or two, completed the purchase of all the major sort of components. Certainly, all the long lead time issues, equipment packages. So progress is being made dramatically. We're now starting to focus on the commercial side. We've had initial conversations with all but one of the major beverage outfits, can makers. Incredible interest in honesty there. And also in automotive, there are several folks that have approached us to partner with us going forward. So, from a standpoint of contracted volumes, pricing, those sorts of things, that's too early yet.\nCurt Woodworth: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc.\nPhilip Gibbs: Sorry, I was on mute. Can you hear me now?\nMark Millett: We can. Hi Phil.\nPhilip Gibbs: Hey, how are you?\nMark Millett: Good.\nPhilip Gibbs: Specifically, you talked about in the script that you were at a 60% to 65% utilization on average for the month of October so far. Is that what we should expect for the fourth quarter, which would get us near 500,000 tons for that asset, or do we expect something a little bit more than that as you ramp?\nMark Millett: I would not expect 65% for the whole quarter. No. But I -- Phil, it's tough to give you a number. If things continue to proceed as they have, month-to-date, then you're going to see a very good number for the quarter. But I can't foretell the future. All I can say is the operation has reached a more stable, consistent level of operation. The big shifts or the big days, there are more of them. But more importantly, we're not seeing the zero shifts as we once were in the summer and as you see in any startup. So, the consistency of operation is very, very much improved and gives me a lot of confidence going forward.\nPhilip Gibbs: Should we expect, given higher volume incrementally and some of that stabilization and just the overall operations that you will get to EBITDA positive in the fourth quarter and sort of out of the start-up phase that you've been in?\nTheresa Wagler: Yes, Phil, good afternoon. We talked about it on the second quarter conference call that our expectations were sitting at that point in time was that we would reach EBITDA positive sometime in the fourth quarter. That's likely pushed out sometime in the first quarter rather than the fourth quarter. But definitely, as Mark mentioned, we're seeing a lot of positive changes and there's been some key successes that the teams had just recently in October that we would expect to result in some really good changes heading forward. But I would suggest it's probably closer to in the first quarter versus the fourth.\nPhilip Gibbs: Okay. And then as just a follow-up, if you could take a shot and talking about 2023 CapEx if you have a general idea? And then just also thoughts on net working capital in Q4. Thank you.\nTheresa Wagler: You're welcome. So we're in the middle of our detailed planning phase related to capital. I'll give some directionality, but we would have more clear and defined expectations for you as we meet in January for the fourth quarter conference call. But right now, the aluminum investments still look like we'll be spending about $750 million in 2023 as it relates to both the recycled shop centers and the rolling mill itself. We also have the completion of the four flat roll lines, which is likely to be around $200 million in 2023. And then we have the biocarbon facility. So I would say just those growth projects alone will probably get us to around $1 billion for capital spending in 2023. And then as we think about the additional projects that we're evaluating right now, I would suggest that it shouldn't be any greater than $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, but we'll have more clarity as we talk to you in January. I'm sorry. Thanks, David. And as it relates to the working capital, as we've had -- as we expect to see some seasonality in volume for customers to reorient their inventories by the end of the year, and as we've seen pricing declines in both scrap and in steel, I would expect to see another pretty significant funding from working capital. So a contribution from working capital in the fourth quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Tristan Gresser with BNP Paribas.\nTristan Gresser: Yes, hi. Thank you for taking my questions. First one is on the cost of ferrous scrap. This came much higher than what we forecasted. And I guess this is due to the purchase of more expensive metallics in H1 that some of your peers also flagged. Are you able to quantify this extra negative impact yet in the quarter? And do you believe this will remain a headwind into Q4? Thank you.\nTheresa Wagler: So the question related to ferrous scrap pricing and our average price was higher than expected from their models. And I would tell you, there's a significant piece of that that has to do with higher pig iron prices. So during the first quarter with the Russian-Ukraine circumstance, we, as did others, went out and purchased more pig iron to have certainty around supply. It was at a higher price than we're currently seeing today, which I think Mark mentioned was around $500 per ton.  And so the flat-rolled steel mills, specifically Sinton, Columbus and Butler are still working through that higher cost pig iron at this time. Mark, do you wish to add any more commentary?\nMark Millett: The pig iron, and we also ended the quarter with some scrap inventory that obviously flows through into the higher-priced scrap inventory that flowed into the third quarter, too. Those inventories are well in control now, and we're back to four-week, maybe five-week inventory level. So going forward, I think that will normalize. But the pig iron price in all honestly is going to continue into the fourth quarter, for sure.\nTristan Gresser: Okay. That's very helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up on the Buy Clean Initiative that has been put in motion by the US government. What kind of impact are you expecting from that new policy the potential boost to demand? And are you seeing already some impact on that initiative? Thank you.\nTheresa Wagler: From a Buy America policy, I'm sorry, it was hard to hear you at the very end. Is it had -- it related to the Buy-America policy, that is still so early on. We're not seeing a considerable amount of traction from it at this point. Conversations with customers on the commercial side though, we believe that it won't just be Buy America, but if you look at, again, our steel operations, specifically as it relates to even our current low carbon footprint for our carbon steels and our long product steel, we believe will be the beneficiary continuing going forward of that, I'm going to call it steel for lack of a more simple terminology at this point in time. And we believe that the Buy America will also have a positive influence. As well as the Jobs Act and the infrastructure program, which you should really start seeing traction from in the next nine to 12 months. That should support steel consumption in the US specifically in our estimation. Mark, do you have anything to add?\nMark Millett: No.\n : Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from John Tumazos with John Tumazos Independent Research.\nJohn Tumazos: Thank you. Do you expect a significant drop in scrap flows with funds and [ph] scrap steel prices?\nMark Millett: John, they've eased and ebbed a little. I would say that reduction in flow is probably going to sort of mitigate any further substantial decline in scrap pricing.\nJohn Tumazos: Thank you. Mark, I just want to recall that we met in 2083 at Darlington when you were working the House Lancaster for Nucor when you were a fresh student.\nMark Millett: I remember.\nJohn Tumazos: Your aluminum competitors have 30- to 50-year old house with Twin belt casters that you intimately understand often unionized. And maybe you're a little bit too humble or modest and don't want to say that you think you can build a new plant with an SMS design that's more efficient. People don't understand the opportunity you have in aluminum and congratulations. It looks great.\nMark Millett: Thank you, John. Thanks for the memory. But I do believe, to your point, the new aluminum mill -- and honestly, I don't look at it as an aluminum mill. It's a new horizon. It's the aluminum business for us. And it's not unlike 27 years ago, when we put SDI together and we penetrated and have been somewhat successful growing within the steel industry. The same sort of drivers exists today in aluminum as it did back in steel. You've got an aged industry, has very, very high legacy costs for sure, inefficiencies. Hasn't been a new mill built for some 45 years. And as you know, Glenn and his team is incredibly smart and talented getting the right technology and building it effectively and efficiently. It's exciting. And it's exciting for the young team that we have to see that being the foundation of our growth for the next 25 years.\nJohn Tumazos: Congratulations.\nMark Millett: Thanks mate.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research.\nTimna Tanners: Hi, guys. Thanks for the follow-up. I guess I had another big picture question, if you could indulge me. There are so many new galvanizing lines being added just by you guys, by Nucor for sure, definitely some planned ones around the corner potentially from US Steel in Ternium. I'm just wondering, is there a structurally better outlook for galvanize? There some incremental demand story or some supply piece I'm missing that's going to continue to support that level -- increased level of galvanized supply?\nMark Millett: Well, I think the utilization of galv product is just generally expanding. I don't know whether you have a crawl around cars, but over my 20 or 30 years, it went from just one or two parts of the car to be galvanized -- or almost the whole car is becoming galvanized. So I think there's just a general expansion of that. Over time, people talk about the lightweighting in the automotive arena or lightweighting comes from stronger products, but also comes through thinner gauge material. So if you look at the length of coated material today versus the past. Just thinner means less throughput and needs more lines to get the same volume. So, I don't see there being a galvanized flood or issue that you might see.\nTimna Tanners: Okay, great. Thanks again. Appreciate it.\nEnd of Q&A:\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for any closing remarks.\nMark Millett: Well, super. Well, thank you, everyone, for your time today. Certainly, for those that have enabled our success, our customers, our service providers, and most importantly, our teams absolutely phenomenal group of people. We appreciate your loyalty, because we've been doing business together for years and years and years. And to those in the investment community that support us, thank you. We will endeavor to continue to treat our money or SDI's money like our own, like your money. We're going to utilize it very, very effectively. I think if you look at our use of those proceeds, we're very diligent, very disciplined in this interesting environment, spending money, again, effectively with higher returns than perhaps the industry in general. So thank you. Thank you for your support and to every individual of the SDI family that's on the line. Thank you for what you do. Be safe each and every day and look after each other. Cheers. Bye.\nOperator: Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation and have a great and safe day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mark Millett",
            "content": "Thank you, David. I forgot to turn the microphone on there as always. But thank you, everyone, for being with us on our third quarter earnings call. It certainly was an exciting quarter with great performance by the team and growth on many fronts. Firstly, a great welcome to the ROCA team, Senate in Monterrey. In combination with the former Zimmer Group, OmniSource Mexico now is a significant recycling presence within Mexico that will support their existing Mexican customer base, while providing strategic sourcing opportunities for our Sinton and Columbus steel mills and soon to be aluminum mill. Sinton has turned the corner and is showing significant improvement. The team is also making great progress on our aluminum flat rolled strategy, which I will share later on the call. Operationally, our third quarter was a great quarter, achieving several new benchmarks, including record steel and steel fabrication shipments and record cash flow from operations, all supporting our cash allocation strategy and commitment to further expansion of shareholder value. I continue to be incredibly proud of our teams. They are on our foundation and the catalyst of our current and future success. It's their culture of excellence and the strategic positioning executed over the last number of years that allows us to maximize opportunities, resulting in higher lows and higher highs through the cycle. So a great quarter, yet none of this matters without keeping our teams safe. Often employees are described as a company's most important resource. For us, they are more than that. They are family and the SDI family now is 26,000 strong. We are focused to provide the very best for their health, safety and welfare. We're actively engaged in safety at all times at every level of our organization, came in top of mind and an active conversation throughout the company. We will not rest until we consistently achieve our goal of zero incidents. But before I continue, Theresa, would you like to give us some details? Super. Thank you, Teresa. And certainly, incredible results from the steel fabrication platform, a product that is obviously a market tailwind, but our strategic positioning over the years. We had record operating income of $677 million in the quarter, with the record shipments of 218,000 tons. Nonresidential construction markets remain strong, as would be suggested by the macro indicators. They all remain positive. ABI index of fitting a little over 53. ABI reports, business conditions remain generally strong, and Dodge Momentum Index improved 6% in September. Nonresidential starts and build rates are forecast to remain good into 2023. More importantly, our customers tell us demand remains solid in spite of economic uncertainty. Order activity is better paced versus the frenetic pace of the recent past and remains higher than historical norms. Our order backlog is well into the first half of 2023 with strong pricing dynamics and we expect to see continued strong volume for fabrication in the fourth quarter and for 2023 in general. Aside from the significant advantage of pull-through volume for our sheet mills, New Millennium provides a perfect hedge to our steel operations. Although SDI mills saw steady utilization throughout the third quarter, lower domestic steel industry utilization in general reduced the demand for scrap in the quarter. First, scrap prices have declined month-over-month beginning in May through October, prime dropping from some $735 a ton to more recently around about $380 per gross ton. Omni's earnings suffered as a result of this progression in market pricing and weaker industry demand. The Omni platform is continuing to work with our steel mill teams to expand our shred separation opportunities to provide even higher volumes of low residual scrap. The impact of our efforts, along with others in the industry, has amply demonstrated our view that innovation will solve any perceived fears of prime scrap shortage in the years ahead. With additional producers coming to the market, pig iron availability is normalized and pricing has moderated significantly to a little over $500 per ton. We have sufficient pig iron sourced well into next year. Supply is not an issue for our flat rolled operations. And again, we're excited for the addition of Roka to our OmniSource Mexico portfolio, which now will grow to some 2.5 million tons of ferrous and non-ferrous annual capability. It was another historically strong quarter for the steel platform. We had record shipments of 3.2 million tons and operating income of $658 million. Our third quarter production utilization rate was around 93%, which was incrementally lower than the second quarter that was 95%, yet significantly above the industry average of 78%. High utilization rates are clearly demonstrated through time. Value-added diversified product offerings, differentiated supply chain solutions all support and the support of internal pull-through volume all support that utilization -- higher utilization rate compared to our peers. And in turn, it supports our strong and growing through-cycle cash the industry capability and best-in-class financial metrics. Looking forward, customer order entry is good and backlogs are solid and that's supported by our diversified portfolio of value-added products, which comprised now of around 70% of steel sales. We focus on value-creating supply chains to mitigate the impact of price volatility and all this just maintains a higher through-cycle utilization rate. Relative to the markets, we see automotive steady at current rates and we expect that to improve off low 2022 production based on the extremely low dealer inventories and pent-up vehicle demand. The 2022 build rate is going to be some 14.5 million units, and we would expect 2023 to grow to 15.5 units or so, and 2024 to 16-plus units -- million units. Non-residential construction remains solid as evidenced by fabrication backlog and long product steel volumes. Long product steel backlogs are good and several of our divisions, Summa City and Roanoke in particular, achieved strong volumes and record earnings in the third quarter, demonstrating our market depth. Infrastructure spending should also provide further meaningful support in the coming years. New residential construction has softened a little, impacting HVAC and appliance and other housing-related products. Fortunately, our portfolio is biased to replacement, and we won't get a ton of a ton impact. Oil and gas activity is driving improved orders for OCTG and line pipe, and solar renewable expansion continues to grow. Turning to Sinton. Both coating lines are running extremely well, and ramp-up continues on the hot side in the tandem cold mill. I believe the hot mill has certainly turned the corner, becoming more consistently running at a 60%, 65% month-to-date with days exceeding well over 80%. Surface quality is excellent. Reported coil shape from processing customers is also excellent. And our hot strip mill design has allowed for thermal mechanical rolling, allowing higher strength grades with lower alloy content and associated costs. And we've already been approved and shipped some API grades, which is quite remarkable given the mill has only been up and running for what, nine months. So the team has done a phenomenal job. And I think it certainly affirms our technical and process choices and it is indeed a next-generation mill. Our exceptional through cycle operating and financial performance continues to support our cash allocation strategies and growth. The four value-add flat-rolled steel coating lines are going well and are targeted for the second half of 2023 for startup, two for Sinton and two for Heartland, and we're already seeing customer interest for that new volume. We're the largest domestic non-automotive coater of flat-rolled steel with an annual coating capacity over 6 million tons. These four new lines will increase that capacity by an additional 1.1 million tons. We have created unique supply chain solutions for our customers, which allow our downstream lines to remain always full with our highest margin products. Relative to the lunar dynamics, the market response from both current and new customers across all market sectors has been absolutely incredible. And so to recap that project, it's a 650,000 metric ton a year aluminum flat roll facility, which will be located in the Southeastern US, and we expect to announce that site location in the next few weeks. On-site mill and cash slab capacity will consist of 450,000 metric tons, and that will be supported by two satellite recycled aluminum slab casting centers, one in the Southwest US and one in the South. We'll have two cash lines, coating line and downstream processing and packaging lines. So we'll be able to furnish all products to the beverage -- food packaging arena, automotive and industrial. The mill is planned to start up in mid-2025, the Mexico Slab Center in 2024 and the Southwest Slab Center in the first quarter of 2025. The financial impact will be around $2.2 billion CapEx over four years. It's going to be funded 100% with available cash and cash flow from operations with no additional debt needed. We expect to add about $650 million to $700 million of through cycle annual EBITDA once it's up and running. So in closing, we're excited and passion by our future growth opportunities as they will continue the high returning growth momentum we have demonstrated over the last 15 years. Our teams are our foundation. I thank each of them for their passion and their dedication and their desire to excel. We are committed to the health and safety. And I remind those listening today that safety for yourselves and each other is our highest priority. Our culture and business model continues to positively differentiate our performance from others. We're competitively positioned and continue to focus on providing superior value for our company, our customers, team members and shareholders, and we look forward to creating new opportunities for everyone today and in the years ahead. So with that said, we would love to answer any questions you might have. Certainly, Emily. Well, again, that business is incredibly robust. Our backlogs are so from a volume standpoint and pricing standpoint at historic highs. And we see that backlog well into 2023, probably about eight months from there, and it remains solid. Spreads are at very high numbers, as you can see from our most recent results. And we see that volume being sustained. Our Q3 volume into Q4. And our earnings should certainly parallel that as relative to the third quarter. I do believe. So very, very strong. As you may recognize, that industry over the years is sort of rationalized and consolidated. And no longer fragmented as it once was. And we see higher pricing and higher spreads being sustained through the cycle going forward. Good morning. Well, Timna, I think, as we told in the past, I do believe our business model is definitely differentiated from our peers for sure. And the high utilization rate is triggered, I think, probably in three spots. One, is we have a much more diversified value-add product portfolio mix than probably any steel producer in the state today. That allows us optionality across all market sectors and all market products, and that certainly has a significant impact. I do believe we have cultivated and developed over time some pretty unique supply chain sort of partnerships with many of our customers, and that gives us resilience through the cycle. And then thirdly, the pull-through volume of our sort of downstream conversion facilities and New Millennium is quite considerable. So if you look at this year, New Millennium, we'll be consuming about somewhere close to probably 800,000 tons of substrate. And much of that is procured through our own mills. So there's a massive volume sort of pull through there. And then our Heartland facility, which is roughly 800 million ton a year converter takes material and also The Techs, which has 850,000, 900,000 tons of consumption. So that pull-through volume onto itself. When there's a need, we bring a lot more of that in-house to maintain that utilization. And as you point out, through the cycle, we typically at 10%, 15% higher utilization than the industry in general. And I can't overemphasize the impact that has on our through-cycle cash generation capability. It certainly supports that and in turn, supports all the growth and the cash allocation strategies that we -- the balanced cash allocation strategies that we continue to execute. Yes. Sorry. I mean, a little tough time hearing Timna. The Sinton mill, obviously, ramping up focused on furnishing material through the two coating lines, the galvanized line, the paint line and just ramping up and commissioning all the different product capabilities we have there. We believe Mexico will long-term despite the additional hot band capability that's come on stream, we'll continue to have a mismatch in the cold-rolled coated arena and so it's our intent to be transferring or selling into the Mexican market, HVAC appliance, and automotive there. And we have yet to develop a meaningful sort of shipping volume to the West Coast, but I'm confident that, that will occur over time as that ramp continues. Well, I think the -- given our investment in Mexico for Zimmer and with Roka where we thought there was a very unique opportunity that, that arena is prime scrap rich and it would allow us to support Columbus and Sinton. Beyond that, we're not interested in any sort of large-scale recycled sort of acquisition-type investment. The investments will be centered though on streamlining and improving our existing operations, lowering our cost structure throughout that organization. And more specifically, investing in sort of segregation separating type technologies to optimize the streams, the waste streams that we have. So the ore, the switch and everything divide that up into more value-added 5,000, 6,000 series type raw materials for our aluminum mill. And also investing in technologies and expanding our current technologies because in all honesty, on the ferrous separation, what we call Shred One [ph], the improved shredded material; we have the technologies available to us. It's just a matter of expanding that across our omni base. And those technologies, they honestly, it's not a massive amount of CapEx spend. Can be underemphasized though, how that's impacting the scrap flows, and it's not just us. Some of our peers are doing the same thing, producing a very low residual shred. And as I've said in the past, if you look at a shredded car today, if you just take a piece of the rusty metal itself, that's likely been produced through a integrated mill and is a very, very low residual. So by separating out the little bit of copper and nickel, you can get a prime scrap from that obsolete flow. And I think we're seeing it, you can see it in the marketplace today where prime is actually selling under the shred price today. And it is amplifying the fact that their perceived concerns as additional capacity comes online over the next few years. But I think we've demonstrated clearly -- the industry has demonstrated clearly what I've always said, and as innovation will trump a challenge each and every day. Well, I would describe the issues at Sinton today as just typical start-up issues, a little amplified by the supply chain constraints out there. In the old days or the other mills we started up, you need a spare part, and it's like literally on the shelf in the local city. We were seeing a little more time to react to certain issues. That said, it is purely just making sure that we are operating each piece of equipment all the way from the electric arc furnaces through the label furnaces cast and external just operating each and every minute of each and every day. As I said earlier, the equipment is proven to be able to produce everything we intended. It's produced out to 84 wide. We've gone down to 043 or 044 and light gauge. We produced 1-inch plate. As I said earlier, we've already been certified on some of the perhaps slightly easier API grades, but the other grades will come with time. There's no issue or challenge to get there. It's just a matter of time. So from a capability standpoint, it's definitely there. We've had shifts. We've had days close to 85%, 86% of production rate, which again, given the relative short time that, that team has been ramping up is absolutely incredible. I think it took us three years in Butler to get a 4,000 ton shift, and we've had many of those already. So I'm not concerned. It's just a matter of time. Would expect that 2023, we should get around 80% of our 3 million tons of shipping capability. Good, thanks. Yes. I think it is transitioning a little bit. Early on, it was very, very sort of distribution warehouse focused with cloud computing and things are following along. Cloud computing, construction tends to be -- continue to be strong and grow. Warehouse may be kind of flat to stable. And we're also seeing sort of more infrastructure, hospitals, school type construction activity. So we see it strong. I mentioned earlier, it's not at the frenetic pace that it was perhaps six months ago or eight months ago. It's normalized to still very high relative to historic norms. And if you think about it, given the interest rate sort of environment and the little economic cloud that we have, it's not unexpected that people are wondering about projects, 7, 8, 9, 10 months out, and they're just waiting a little. But, in general, we see that just the nonresidential construction in general, remaining very, very, very robust through certainly the first half of next year into the latter half. Well, relative to aluminum, we are awash with interest, an incredible interest. To be honest, we have been focused of late locating the facilities. Glenn and his team have just, in the last week or two, completed the purchase of all the major sort of components. Certainly, all the long lead time issues, equipment packages. So progress is being made dramatically. We're now starting to focus on the commercial side. We've had initial conversations with all but one of the major beverage outfits, can makers. Incredible interest in honesty there. And also in automotive, there are several folks that have approached us to partner with us going forward. So, from a standpoint of contracted volumes, pricing, those sorts of things, that's too early yet. We can. Hi Phil. Good. I would not expect 65% for the whole quarter. No. But I -- Phil, it's tough to give you a number. If things continue to proceed as they have, month-to-date, then you're going to see a very good number for the quarter. But I can't foretell the future. All I can say is the operation has reached a more stable, consistent level of operation. The big shifts or the big days, there are more of them. But more importantly, we're not seeing the zero shifts as we once were in the summer and as you see in any startup. So, the consistency of operation is very, very much improved and gives me a lot of confidence going forward. The pig iron, and we also ended the quarter with some scrap inventory that obviously flows through into the higher-priced scrap inventory that flowed into the third quarter, too. Those inventories are well in control now, and we're back to four-week, maybe five-week inventory level. So going forward, I think that will normalize. But the pig iron price in all honestly is going to continue into the fourth quarter, for sure. No.:Thanks a lot. John, they've eased and ebbed a little. I would say that reduction in flow is probably going to sort of mitigate any further substantial decline in scrap pricing. I remember. Thank you, John. Thanks for the memory. But I do believe, to your point, the new aluminum mill -- and honestly, I don't look at it as an aluminum mill. It's a new horizon. It's the aluminum business for us. And it's not unlike 27 years ago, when we put SDI together and we penetrated and have been somewhat successful growing within the steel industry. The same sort of drivers exists today in aluminum as it did back in steel. You've got an aged industry, has very, very high legacy costs for sure, inefficiencies. Hasn't been a new mill built for some 45 years. And as you know, Glenn and his team is incredibly smart and talented getting the right technology and building it effectively and efficiently. It's exciting. And it's exciting for the young team that we have to see that being the foundation of our growth for the next 25 years. Thanks mate. Well, I think the utilization of galv product is just generally expanding. I don't know whether you have a crawl around cars, but over my 20 or 30 years, it went from just one or two parts of the car to be galvanized -- or almost the whole car is becoming galvanized. So I think there's just a general expansion of that. Over time, people talk about the lightweighting in the automotive arena or lightweighting comes from stronger products, but also comes through thinner gauge material. So if you look at the length of coated material today versus the past. Just thinner means less throughput and needs more lines to get the same volume. So, I don't see there being a galvanized flood or issue that you might see. Well, super. Well, thank you, everyone, for your time today. Certainly, for those that have enabled our success, our customers, our service providers, and most importantly, our teams absolutely phenomenal group of people. We appreciate your loyalty, because we've been doing business together for years and years and years. And to those in the investment community that support us, thank you. We will endeavor to continue to treat our money or SDI's money like our own, like your money. We're going to utilize it very, very effectively. I think if you look at our use of those proceeds, we're very diligent, very disciplined in this interesting environment, spending money, again, effectively with higher returns than perhaps the industry in general. So thank you. Thank you for your support and to every individual of the SDI family that's on the line. Thank you for what you do. Be safe each and every day and look after each other. Cheers. Bye."

            "name": "Theresa Wagler",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark. Good morning, everyone. I add my sincere appreciation and personal congratulations to the team on another strong operational and financial performance. Our third quarter 2022 net income was $914 million or $5.03 per diluted share, inclusive of costs of $111 million or $0.43 per diluted share associated with the continued start-up of our Sinton, Texas flat-rolled steel mill. Excluding these costs, third quarter 2022 adjusted net income was $992 million or $5.46 per diluted share. Third quarter revenues of $5.7 billion declined 9% sequentially based on lower flat-rolled steel and scrap pricing. Our third quarter 2022 operating income was $1.2 billion lower than sequential results due to lower pricing and resulting metal spread compression in our flat-rolled steel operations. Our steel operations generated solid operating income of $658 million in the third quarter, with record shipments, as Mark mentioned, the 3.2 million tons, of which Sinton contributed 268,000 tons. Sequential earnings were significantly lower due to the previously mentioned metal spread compression within our flat-rolled steel businesses. In contrast, our long product steel operations experienced metal spread expansion as average scrap cost declined more than product pricing in the quarter. In fact, our Structural and Rail and Roanoke Bar divisions each achieved record earnings. Congratulations to those teams. Third quarter operating income for our mills recycling operations declined to $10 million as ferrous pricing declined month-over-month through the quarter, resulting in significant metal margin compression but the team continues to effectively lever the strength of our circular manufacturing operating model, benefiting both our steel and metals recycling operations by providing higher quality scrap to our steel mills, which improves furnace efficiency and by reducing company-wide working capital requirements. I also give my welcome to the Roanoke team. A huge congratulations once again to our steel fabrication team. They achieved record third quarter operating income of $677 million. These earnings were driven by record average pricing, record shipments and lower steel input costs. Steel joist and deck demand remained solid as evidenced by our continued strong order backlog, which extends well through the first half of 2023. We generated record cash flow from operations of $1.5 billion in the third quarter as strong results and release of working capital benefited cash flow. Year-to-date 2022, we've generated a record $3.3 billion. Our cash generation is consistently strong based on our differentiated circular business model and highly low-cost variable cost structure. At the end of September, we had record liquidity of $3.2 billion comprised of cash and short-term investments of $2 billion and an undrawn unsecured revolver of $1.2 billion. Year-to-date 2022, we funded $565 million in capital investments. For the fourth quarter of 2022, we estimate capital investments will be close to $400 million, of which about $200 million is related to our recently announced aluminum flat-rolled investments, with much of the remaining capital related to our four new flat-rolled coating lines that will be located in Sinton and Heartland. We maintained our cash dividend at $0.34 per common share after increasing at 31% in the first quarter. We also repurchased $482 million of our common stock in the third quarter, representing over 3% of our outstanding shares. Year-to-date, we paid cash dividends of $177 million and repurchased $1.4 billion or 10% of our outstanding shares, representing a 48% net income distribution ratio. At the end of the third quarter, $245 million remained available under our current share repurchase authorization. These actions reflect the strength of our capital foundation and consistently strong cash flow generation capability throughout all market cycles and the continued optimism and confidence in our future. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes strategic growth with shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that's complemented with a variable share repurchase program, while remaining dedicated to preserving our investment-grade credit designation. Our recently announced aluminum investment is consistent with our unchanged capital allocation philosophy. We have strategically placed ourselves in a position to have a sustainable capital foundation that provides the opportunity for strategic growth; strong shareholder returns and maintain investment-grade metrics. Our cash flow profile has fundamentally changed over the last five years. We will readily fund our flat-rolled aluminum investments with available cash and cash flow from operations. We also plan to continue strong shareholder distributions as we clearly demonstrated in the third quarter. We're squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable optimized long-term value creation. Sustainability is also a significant part of our long-term value creation strategy, and we are dedicated to our people, our communities and our environment. We're committed to operating our business with the highest integrity. In that regard, we're excited about our newly formed joint venture with Aymium, a leading producer of renewable biocarbon products. We believe our first joint venture facility will decrease our steel Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 25%. We have an actionable path to our carbon neutrality as more manageable, and we believe considerably less expensive than may lie ahead for many of our industry peers. Our sustainability and carbon reduction strategy is an ongoing journey, and we are moving forward with the intention to make a positive difference. We plan to continue to address these matters and to play a leadership role moving forward. In conclusion, I know some of you track the details behind our flat-rolled shipments. And so for the quarter, we shipped hot-rolled and P&O of 951,000 tons; cold rolled of 139,000 tons; and finally, coated flat rolled products of 1,102,000 tons. For a total of 2,192,000 tons of flat rolled shipments. Mark? Good morning, Carlos, thanks for joining us on the call. So from the specifics of flat increasing, while, I would say, long products was very strong, because long products had record shipments in the second quarter, so still very strong. But you have to remember that, Sinton is starting up in this time frame. So the addition of Sinton ramping up helps offset some of the seasonality that you might see in our flat roll shipments even as we head into the fourth quarter. That being said, we're expecting still to see really resilient volume from the steel base, both in long and flat, as we head into the -- what -- you're correct, is more of a seasonal time frame, but we have some offsetting parameters as we look at both Sinton. And frankly, as we look at our coated products, specifically Galvalume had a really strong third quarter. But Alex, you're correct. That's for the entirety of the year. So there will be a progression of ramp so that by the time we're exiting 2023, we would expect to be operating at or near that capacity rate -- that full capacity rate. Alex, I think you were asking about the full complement of our flat roll operations? And we are expecting to have higher shipments from Sinton itself, but I'll leave you to determine what seasonality does to the rest of the group. You're welcome. Good afternoon, Kurt. Thanks for the question. I'll let Mark address the diversity within the backlog of the fabrication business. It has changed just slightly. And I think it's become more favorable as these things are changing. As it relates to the backlog and the pricing, what Mark was suggesting is that we still have incredibly favorable pricing heading with the backlog that goes through much of the first half of 2023. It's not likely to be at that same peak level of $5,000-plus, but still very favorable. And at the same time, we're going to and expect to have lower steel input costs as we move through at least the fourth quarter. And so, as you can imagine, that's why the power in the business model of having fabrication be a real natural hedge to lower steel prices is very favorable to us. And that's what you're seeing today, and we would expect to see in the coming quarters as well. Mark, do you want to describe the diversity in the order backlog? And just to address your point on the backlog, if there's any risk that we'd want to point out, there's really not. It's a well-diversified backlog. There's not individual projects that are of too large of a size. And something to just keep in mind as well as once something enters the backlog for the fabrication business, the projects have already been engineered. They generally have already been financed. There's a lot of certainty in that backlog. And if you look on average of the projects that we do, the cost of steel joist and steel jack or steel deck as a part of the entire project itself is only between 10% and 15%. So it's a small piece of that project in and of itself, which also reduces the risk. Yes, Phil, good afternoon. We talked about it on the second quarter conference call that our expectations were sitting at that point in time was that we would reach EBITDA positive sometime in the fourth quarter. That's likely pushed out sometime in the first quarter rather than the fourth quarter. But definitely, as Mark mentioned, we're seeing a lot of positive changes and there's been some key successes that the teams had just recently in October that we would expect to result in some really good changes heading forward. But I would suggest it's probably closer to in the first quarter versus the fourth. You're welcome. So we're in the middle of our detailed planning phase related to capital. I'll give some directionality, but we would have more clear and defined expectations for you as we meet in January for the fourth quarter conference call. But right now, the aluminum investments still look like we'll be spending about $750 million in 2023 as it relates to both the recycled shop centers and the rolling mill itself. We also have the completion of the four flat roll lines, which is likely to be around $200 million in 2023. And then we have the biocarbon facility. So I would say just those growth projects alone will probably get us to around $1 billion for capital spending in 2023. And then as we think about the additional projects that we're evaluating right now, I would suggest that it shouldn't be any greater than $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, but we'll have more clarity as we talk to you in January. I'm sorry. Thanks, David. And as it relates to the working capital, as we've had -- as we expect to see some seasonality in volume for customers to reorient their inventories by the end of the year, and as we've seen pricing declines in both scrap and in steel, I would expect to see another pretty significant funding from working capital. So a contribution from working capital in the fourth quarter. So the question related to ferrous scrap pricing and our average price was higher than expected from their models. And I would tell you, there's a significant piece of that that has to do with higher pig iron prices. So during the first quarter with the Russian-Ukraine circumstance, we, as did others, went out and purchased more pig iron to have certainty around supply. It was at a higher price than we're currently seeing today, which I think Mark mentioned was around $500 per ton.  And so the flat-rolled steel mills, specifically Sinton, Columbus and Butler are still working through that higher cost pig iron at this time. Mark, do you wish to add any more commentary? From a Buy America policy, I'm sorry, it was hard to hear you at the very end. Is it had -- it related to the Buy-America policy, that is still so early on. We're not seeing a considerable amount of traction from it at this point. Conversations with customers on the commercial side though, we believe that it won't just be Buy America, but if you look at, again, our steel operations, specifically as it relates to even our current low carbon footprint for our carbon steels and our long product steel, we believe will be the beneficiary continuing going forward of that, I'm going to call it steel for lack of a more simple terminology at this point in time. And we believe that the Buy America will also have a positive influence. As well as the Jobs Act and the infrastructure program, which you should really start seeing traction from in the next nine to 12 months. That should support steel consumption in the US specifically in our estimation. Mark, do you have anything to add?"

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to David Lipschitz, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDavid Lipschitz: Thank you, Holly. Good morning and welcome to Steel Dynamics second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. As a reminder, today’s call is being recorded and will be available on our website for replay later today. Leading today’s call are Mark Millett, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Steel Dynamics; and Theresa Wagler, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The other members of our senior leadership team are joining us on the call individually.

You will also find any referenced non-GAAP financial measures reconciled to the most directly compared GAAP measures in the press release issued yesterday entitled Steel Dynamics Reports Record Second Quarter 2022 Results. Now I’m pleased to turn the call over to Mark.\nMark Millett: Well, thank you, David. Thank you, everyone, for being with us on our second call this week. It’s been – it was exciting to announce our new growth initiative on Tuesday with our entry into the aluminum market. And it’s only been, I think, probably 48 hours or so, and the customer response from all three market segments, whether it be distribution processes, whether it be the packaging industry or even automotive, it’s been absolutely staggering the early sign of affirmation of us getting into the marketplace, and I think speaks to the lack of supply and optionality within that market. So that’s exciting. And it’s as exciting and even more exciting to announce yet another record quarter, record consolidated volumes, earnings per share, cash flow, all supporting our cash allocation strategy and commitment to build shareholder value. Specifically, we repurchased $517 million worth of the company’s common stock, representing 3.5% of our outstanding shares in the quarter. So we were staying true to our repurchase programs. We are certainly beneficiary of a strong market tailwind but I’m incredibly proud of our 11,000 strong team. They are the foundation and the catalyst of our success. They are the ones driving the superior results. It’s their culture of excellence and the strategic positioning executed over the last 10 years that allows us to exploit the current market and will continue to produce higher lows and higher highs through the cycle. I’ve said it many times before, but none of this matters without keeping everyone safe. Often, employees are described as a company’s most important asset. For us, they are more than that. They’re part of the SDI family, the people, and we are always striving to provide the best for their health, their safety and for their welfare. We’re actively focused on safety at all times, keeping it top of mind and an active conversation at every level within the organization. We’re certainly better than industry averages, but we’re not going to rest until we consistently achieve our goal of zero incidents. We’re continuing to see material market share gains driven by our ESG profile, an industry-leading low carbon footprint for flat rolled products. We will continue our journey to environmental excellence through a defined and achievable plan to be carbon neutral by 2050. Our recent Aymium investment and our joint venture is a perfect example of that. It’s an exciting opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through renewable biomass replacing fossil fuels in our electric arc furnaces. We have tested the product and it works beautifully. We believe it will also work within our iron operations. Initially, it will be 160,000 metric tons per year, and the CapEx is estimated to be around $125 million to $150 million. It will reduce our Scope 1 steelmaking greenhouse gas intensity by some 20%, 25% with even further potential upside from the use of the biogas. So with that said, Theresa, would you like to give us some thoughts?\nTheresa Wagler: Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. As Mark said, what an incredible week. We announced our aluminum strategy on Tuesday, and now we’re sharing our record results. I can see personal things relate to the entire SDI family. Your performance resulted in record sales, earnings and cash flow, a truly exceptional performance. Our second quarter 2022 net income was $1.2 billion, or $6.44 per diluted share, inclusive of cost of $77 million, or $0.29 per diluted share associated with the continued start-up of our Sinton, Texas Flat Rolled Steel Mill. Excluding these costs, second quarter 2022 adjusted net income was $1.3 billion, or $6.73 per diluted share. Revenues improved across all of our platforms to a record $6.2 billion, driven by record steel shipments and record pricing volume in our steel fabrication business. Our second quarter 2022 record operating income of $1.6 billion improved 8% versus first quarter results, driven by record steel fabrication earnings. Our steel operations generated very strong operating income of $1.1 billion in the second quarter with record shipments of 3.1 million tons, of which Sinton contributed 171,000 tons. Sequential earnings were 5% lower due to metal spread compression in our flat-rolled steel operations as realized pricing declined and average scrap costs increased. In contrast, our long product steel operations experienced metal spread expansion resulting from rising product prices. In fact, we set quarterly record shipments at our Structural Engineer Bar and Roanoke Bar divisions. Second quarter operating income for our mills recycling operations remained strong at $58 million, representing a 20% sequential quarterly improvement as ferrous metal margin and volume improved. The team continues to effectively lever the strength of our circular manufacturing operating model, benefiting both our steel and mills recycling operations by providing higher quality scrap, which improves furnace efficiency and by reducing company-wide working capital requirements. A huge congratulations once again to our steel fabrication team. They achieved record second quarter operating income of $599 million. These earnings were driven by record average pricing, coupled with record shipments. Steel joist and deck demand remains strong as evidenced by the continued strength in our order backlog, which remains at near record levels and contain strong forward pricing. Based on the strength, we expect steel fabrication earnings to continue to increase even further as the year progresses. Our cash generation continues to be consistently strong based on our differentiated circular business model and highly variable cost structure. At the end of June, we had record liquidity of $2.5 billion, comprised of cash and short-term investments of $1.3 billion and an undrawn unsecured revolver of $1.2 billion. We generated record cash flow from operations of $1 billion in the second quarter and $1.8 billion year-to-date. During the first half of 2022, we have funded $323 million in capital investments. For the second half of 2022, we estimate capital investments will be approximately $350 million to $400 million, the majority of which relate to our four new flat roll coating lines be located in Sinton and Heartland. We maintained our cash dividend at $0.34 per common share after increasing it 31% in the first quarter. Year-to-date, we repurchased $906 million or 6.5% of our outstanding shares. At the end of the second quarter, $727 million remained available under our most recent share repurchase authorization. Since 2017, we’ve increased our cash dividend per share by 143%, and we have repurchased $3.2 billion of our common stock, representing 30% of our outstanding shares. These actions reflect the strength of our capital foundation and consistently strong cash flow generation capability throughout all market cycles and the continued optimism and confidence in our future. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes strategic growth with the shareholder distributions comprised of a positive dividend profile that is complemented with a variable share repurchase program, while also dedicated to preserving our investment grade credit designation. Our recently announced aluminum investment is consistent with our unchanged strategy. As I mentioned on Tuesday’s call, our cash flow profile has fundamentally changed over the last five years. We will readily fund this investment with available cash and cash flow from operations. We also plan to continue strong shareholder distributions. We’ve strategically placed ourselves in a position to have a sustainable capital foundation that provides the opportunity for strategic growth, strong shareholder returns, and maintain investment grade metrics. We are squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable optimized long-term value creation. Sustainability is a part of our long-term value creation strategy, and we are dedicated to our people, our communities and our environment. We’re committed to operating our business with the highest integrity. In that regard, as Mark mentioned, we’re very excited to – that we formed our joint venture with Aymium recently, a leading producer of renewable biocarbon products. Steel Dynamics owns 55% of the joint venture, and we’re the operating partner. We have an actionable path toward carbon neutrality that is more manageable and we believe considerably less expensive than may lay ahead for many of our industry peers. Our sustainability and carbon reduction strategy is an ongoing journey and we are moving forward with the intention to make a positive difference. We plan to continue to address these matters and to play a leadership role moving forward. Mark?\nMark Millett: Thank you, Theresa. As you saw, absolutely incredible results from the New Millennium fabrication platform, record operating income of $599 million in Q2 on record 218,000 tons of shipments. We see the nonresidential construction markets remaining strong. Despite the caution emanating from Amazon’s message for next year, we have had reaffirmation from our major customers anyway, including warehouse customers that everything remains incredibly strong going forward into 2023. Cloud-based computing, data centers, pharma and schools are all strong. Although the ABI index may have drifted slightly month-over-month, the AI reports, ongoing order activity and architectural firms as well as new work online remains very strong. For us, order input activity remains robust, and we still have near-peak backlog persisting. So that’s a very, very good position to be in. Q3 earnings from fabrication will certainly increase. We’re going to see increased shipments and metal spread expansion from both increased selling values and lower steel input costs. And as you’ve seen, this is a – it’s providing a perfect hedge to softening steel prices. Although we mentioned his impending retirement on our Q1 call, Russ Rinn had his final official day in the office last week after about 11 years of dedicated commitment to SDI and the OmniSource recycling platform. And yes, it’s – people say it’s sweet and sour, but for me, it was tough to see him go. He repositioned OmniSource to record earnings last year, dramatically influenced their safety performance over the years and has been a key contributor to the strategic moves we’ve made as a company. Right now, he is hiking in Virginia. And mate, thank you very much for everything you’ve done. The recycled platform saw stronger earnings based on higher domestic steel industry utilization pushing demand up, drove higher shipment volume, pricing and associated metal spread. After a strong downward move in prime scrap relative to shred through the quarter, that spread is normalized and pricing is expected to remain more stable in the months ahead. The Omni platform is continuing to work with the steel melt teams to further expand our shred segregation to provide higher volumes of low residual shred scrap, which continues to reduce our dependence on more expensive prime grades. Pig iron availability is normalized and pricing has moderated significantly to low $50 per ton range. We have sufficient pig iron sourced well into next year, and supply is not an issue and the rumors of us having problems with fos levels and such is totally inaccurate. There’s no problem using the Brazilian pig iron that we’re bringing into our mills. Steel operations had another terrific quarter, record shipments of 3.1 million tons, strong operating income of $1.1 billion. Our second quarter production utilization rate was 95%, certainly above the industry average of some 82%. I think we clearly communicated in the past that higher utilization rates have been clearly demonstrated over time. Our strategy of the value-add diversified product offerings coming out with differentiated supply chains support that along with our internal support from fabrication and downstream. Altogether, it supports our strong and growing through-cycle cash generation capability. Our customer order entry remains strong. Support of value-added products is certainly a part of that. And as I said, we’ve intentionally grown that value-added steel product mix, created valuable supply chains to mitigate the impact of price volatility. Today, some 70% of our steel sales are value-added. This supports our continued best-in-class financial metrics and cash generation. Specifically to the markets, we expect the automotive arena to remain strong and probably improve as the chip issue mitigates. You still have extremely low dealer inventories and a very strong pent-up vehicle demand from the consumer base. 2022 build rate, there’ll be some, I don’t know, around about 14 million units, and it’s projected to grow to 16.4 million in 2023 and perhaps 16.8 million in 2024. I think the chip shortage actually for us is a good thing. It’s effectively extending the auto cycle and just given us a market that’s going to be strong for longer. Construction remains strong as evidenced with the fabrication backlog. Our long products steel backlogs are also strong and several of our divisions recorded record earnings and volume in the second quarter, demonstrating the market’s depth. Infrastructure is a further meaningful support. High demand continues for HVAC, appliance and other related products. Energy continues to improve. We’re getting large orders in the South. I think it’s significant to note that the import arrivals that the sort of Ukraine-Russia conflict drove early in the year, those are arriving now, but there’s very, very little import interest for sort of October, November, December. And I believe we’re going to see moderated import volumes in the second half. And significantly, it appears our hot-rolled coil order input rate has grew dramatically in the last week or so, showing signs of an inflection there. Turning to Sinton. Commissioning continues on the hot side and tandem cold mill. The rest of the mill is fully operational. The hot mill has established target volume throughput rates with an average run rate of 75% to 80%. And I just want to emphasize that, that is when we are running, we’re running at that rate. Surface quality is excellent. It’s proven to be superior to both our Columbus and our Butler facilities. The hot strip mill design is allowed for thermomechanical rolling. That’s allowing higher strength grades to be produced at lower alloy content. The reported coil shape from our processes is excellent. And so in total, it affirms the technical process capability of the equipment, affirms the design decisions that were made some years ago for the mill. We are wrestling a little with uptime in July. We have a substation arcing issue that should be resolved this week. We have some unique Texas power supply issues right now. And we are seeing some miscellaneous equipment failures that are typical of commissioning an integrated line. The supply chain is aggravating that a little bit because when you have a – when you need a part instead of getting it in a matter of hours, sometimes it takes a day or two. So we are wrestling with those alligators, not atypical of a start-up of new plant, but we expect substantial resolution of these issues over the next few weeks. So the July issue may have cost us 100,000, 150,000 tons of production for the year, we think, to [indiscernible] itself because July is not over yet, but certainly moving in the right direction, and we clearly expect to be EBITDA positive in the Q4. We continue on our growth. We have the four value-added coating lines under construction and progressing well. They’re targeted for the second half of 2023 to start up. As you know, we – again, it’s the strength of our overall strategy and our product mix, but we are the largest non-automotive coater of flat-rolled steels, and now have annual coating capacity of over 6 million tons. Four new lines will increase that capacity by an additional 1.1 million tons. We’ve created unique supply chain solutions for our customers, and these lines are almost always fully utilized with our highest-margin products. So switching now to aluminum dynamics. It’s been an incredibly exciting week, and it has been incredible. I said it earlier, it’s been staggering, the initial support that we’re seeing from all our customers and a massive number of new customers. To recap, it’s a 650,000 metric ton a year flat-rolled facility that’s going to be located in the Southeastern U.S. It have on-site melt and cast lab capacity of roughly 450,000 metric tons. It’s a fully equipped flat-rolled mill with two cash lines, coating line and downstream processing and packaging capability. It’s going to be supported by two satellite recycled aluminum slab casting centers, one in the Southwest U.S. and one in Mexico. We expect the mill itself to start up in the first half of 2025, the Mexican slab casting center in 2024 and the Southwest slap casting center in – at the end of 2025. Financial impact the total project cost of some $2.2 billion. That expenditure is going to be spread over four years of the project. It’s going to be 100% funded with available cash and cash flow through operations, and it’s expected to add a good $650 million to $700 million in through-cycle consolidated annual EBITDA per year. We certainly anticipate no requirement to add any additional debt. From conversations on the call and subsequent conversations that there appears to be some skepticism regarding our EBITDA per ton target of $1,000. We are confident of that number. And it speaks to what was driven by a myriad of things, but firstly, it’s a greenfield facility. Everything is happening essentially on one side or the rolling, processing, coating, heat treating. It allows for an optimum site layout and flow of material and logistics, and you can quite easily reduce the labor, the man power input because of that with robotics and automatic storage and retrievable systems. So labor input is going to be dramatically less than the current industry. We will not be burdened by aged facilities and legacy costs. Energy, because of the state-of-the-art equipment that where be installing is going to be a lot lower. Yield improvements will dramatically improve the cost structure, pushing higher scrap content levels and transportation, given the satellite slab casting centers transporting solid dense slab as opposed to scrap is going to be a significant improvement. So we’re very, very confident of that cost projection. From an investment premise standpoint, obviously, we see a very clear gap in the supply and demand. There’s a current and growing deficit, supply deficit. We see a very close sort of overlap and business alignment. And essentially, you could – if we filmed the steel mill and an aluminum mill in black and white, most people on the call today wouldn’t be able to tell the difference. I mean it’s – all it is a different metal. We clearly will be able to execute the project well. It’s incredibly cost-effective growth. Given the opportunities that are in the marketplace today, and the exorbitant multiples that are expected from sellers. This is a very, very CapEx efficient growth project. As I said, we have got absolutely great customer support. And at the end of the day, our success has always been driven by the SDI culture by our employees. It drives higher efficiency than anyone else, drive lower cost. And if you look at that industry, it has a very, very, very steep cost curve. And that will obviously – if you were at the lowest quartile, that’s going to support margin through the cycle. So we’re incredibly excited by the opportunity. So in general, it’s been a phenomenal week. It’s been a phenomenal year for SDI that will continue through the rest of this year. Our team provides our success, the foundation for that success, and I thank each of them for their hard work and their commitment. I remind each and everyone to remember, safety is always our first priority. We’re going to continue to focus on providing superior value for our customers, through our company, team members and shareholders alike. We look forward to creating new opportunities for everyone in the years ahead. So with that said, I’d like to pass the call over for questions. Holly?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question for today is coming from Emily Chieng with Goldman Sachs. Emily, your line is live.\nEmily Chieng: Good morning, Mark and Theresa, and thank you for the update today. My question is just around your power cost exposures across the portfolio. Can you highlight to us what is hedged or fixed price power and what still remains on spot? Is Sinton actually exposed to market prices? Or have you since put some hedges in place there?\nTheresa Wagler: Emily, we have – across the portfolio of those steel mills, we have a mix. So for example, and then to be able to split it out in a manner on a percentage basis, I’ll have to kind of go back and talk to the team. But I would say it’s probably at least 50% to 60% that’s contractual, and they tend to be long-term contracts of two to three years, have escalating factors included in them. And the remainder is spot. There is some that we hedge. Sinton right now is a little bit difficult simply because, as Mark mentioned, we’re in startup and they actually constructed a massive substation on our behalf in the region. And so I think most of Sinton at this point is still on a spot basis because of the stop and starts that we’ve been having right now in July.\nMark Millett: Emily, that’s the electrical power. On the natural gas side of things, we typically hedge around about 60%, 65% of our consumption.\nEmily Chieng: Great. That’s very clear. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Seth Rosenfeld with BNB Paribas. Seth, your line is live.\nSeth Rosenfeld: Thanks for taking our question. If I can ask one with regards to [indiscernible] fabrication and non-resi activity. At the time of Q1 results, I think you noted still record backlog and that change site to a near record. Can you give us any color for how significant of the contraction in backlog tons or duration has been realized? And on the pricing side, you commented earlier, aggregate price realizations will increase coming quarters. But on the most recently on orders, are we seeing any downward inflection of late?\nTheresa Wagler: Thanks, Seth. So as it relates to the fabrication business, we said near records just because of recent we have people back checking all the time and if it’s not a record, we have to say near record. There has been some contraction from the peaks, but we’re still having a backlog that’s well into 2023. So it’s not something that we’re concerned about or we think it’s endemic of anything changing significantly. From a pricing perspective, we’re still having very strong price support, and there is still increased pricing that is included in the backlog. So we’re feeling very good about the non-residential market, specifically for our steel fabrication business. Mark, do you have anything to add?\nMark Millett: No, no. That sums it up well.\nSeth Rosenfeld: Thanks very much. Let’s ask a separate question, please. On the working capital side, I think on the call earlier this week, you had a potential tailwind from working capital release moving forward. And Q2, you saw another quarter of large investment. Can you give us any color on your expectations for second half as steel raw materials price decline?\nTheresa Wagler: Absolutely, Seth. We’re still – so I don’t – I guess I wouldn’t call it a significant increase. I think the increase in the second quarter for working capital was just a little over $100 million. So I thought that small, but given the size of the working capital at this point in time, it was incremental. But we would expect a pretty significant working capital release in the probably two to three quarters. And it has to do with not necessarily just have seen some weakness, as Mark mentioned, or some softening in the flat-rolled prices, but we’ve also been specifically reducing physical inventories at our steel fabrication business as they had extra substrate for different reasons on the ground from a steel perspective. So there’s some structural things that we’re doing as well as from a pricing standpoint. So again, second half of the year into next year, I would expect working capital release.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley. Carlos, your line is live.\nCarlos De Alba: Great. Thank you. Good morning, Mark and Theresa. The question is on CapEx progression for the aluminum project announced, how do you see the CapEx for this year and for the coming years until the project is ready to start up?\nTheresa Wagler: Carlos, I’ll point you to the presentation that’s still out on the website that we provided on Tuesday. But from a CapEx progression standpoint, we believe we’ll spend somewhere between $200 million and $300 million on the flat-rolled aluminum project in 2022. That would be additive to the number that I gave you earlier for the estimate for the rest of 2022 of being in that $350 million to $400 million range. And then the bulk of the spend will be in 2023 and 2024, each of those years being around $750 million to $800 million. And then finally, we would have the remainder, which is around $300 million to $350 million in that 2025, 2026 time frame. So it’s over a period of four to five years where we’ll be spending the investment. And that’s why Mark was very clear, and I’ve tried to be clear as well that this will readily be funded through cash flow and cash flow from operations.\nCarlos De Alba: Fair enough. Thank you. And if I may just try another one quickly. Have you seen any particular pricing pressure in the steel Southern markets or Northern Mexico with the ramp-up of Sinton as well as the ramp-up of – steel ramp-up of Ternium’s facility as well as Metals facility, a little bit further south in the Mexican market?\nMark Millett: Well, I think, Carlos, you saw generally a sort of erosion on the hot band, hot-rolled coil pricing across the U.S. in general, and it was a little stronger in the South, because of the reasons that you suggest. As I suggested, we’re seeing our order activity on hot band recently pick up dramatically. And so I think there’s no support there in that product category.\nCarlos De Alba: Fair enough. Thank you very much. Good luck.\nMark Millett: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research. Timna, your line is live.\nTimna Tanners: Hey, good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask a little bit more, if I could, I know on the last call, when we’ve spoken to you, you mentioned that you were looking at a pig iron alternative kind of leveraging your iron dynamics operations. So – if you could expand on that. And then if I could throw in one more. Just I thought it was interesting that you mentioned the market is pessimistic, but your customers are optimistic. So I was just hoping you could also elaborate on that. Thanks a lot.\nMark Millett: Well, from a pig iron perspective, we certainly would like to pursue sort of some level of captive supply and self-sufficiency. And not unlike the last call, we are pursuing or exploring whether the Iron Dynamics technology or an alternative technology is best suited for us. But that’s sort of a project in process going forward, Timna. If there were to be a project, again, from a capital perspective, that’s not a huge, huge issue. I’m sorry, I didn’t catch the – quite the second comment or question.\nTimna Tanners: Thanks on Iron Dynamics. That’s helpful. So it doesn’t sound like a big capital use then, is that what you’re saying?\nMark Millett: Absolutely not. Yes.\nTimna Tanners: Okay. Helpful. Thank you. No, I just wanted to…\nMark Millett: You had a market question?\nTimna Tanners: Yes, if you wouldn’t mind elaborating, in the release, you talked about how there’s a prevailing pessimism, but your customers are optimistic? And then you talked about hot-rolled order entry improving recently. And I’m just wondering if you could elaborate a bit on how that contrasts with the pessimism and maybe some elevated inventories.\nMark Millett: Well, I guess, all we can do or all I can do is look through the lens of our order book. And as I mentioned over the years, a wise man told me that, hey, the order book tells all, but it tells all for us. I can’t speak for the rest of the industry. But we’re not – we haven’t seen a dramatic structural sort of change in underlying demand. Order activity has remained pretty strong. There was a little softness in hot-rolled coil, and that’s rebounding, I think. And so there’s – when I say sort of motion in the marketplace, there seems to be a cloud out there that you got recessionary pressures and all these things going to drive the market there. As just pointed out, right now, through our order book, we don’t see it.\nTimna Tanners: Thanks very much.\nMark Millett: Thanks, Timna.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc. Phil, your line is live.\nPhil Gibbs: Hey, good morning.\nMark Millett: Good morning, Phil.\nPhil Gibbs: Mark, you mentioned spot prices for pig iron are clearly coming down, and we see that, too. But are you all locked into higher numbers than that prevailing spot if you chose to hedge a lot more forward during the war?\nMark Millett: We had, I would say, a mix. There were right at the onset of the conflict. We did buy a couple of both that were at the high end of that range over, but we now have a kind of a mix of material. I think the highest we may have paid is like $900 or so a ton. We got a couple of boatloads of that. But then we have a lot more material coming in at lower pricing. And the forward boats are tending to be indexed against the market price. So it shouldn’t be a major impact for us.\nPhil Gibbs: Okay. And then Theresa, the normal mix dispersion on sheet, if you have it?\nTheresa Wagler: Absolutely, Phil. The hot roll P&L number is 861,000 tons; cold rolled, 131,000 tons; and the coated products are 1,132,000 tons.\nPhil Gibbs: Thank you. And if I could sneak in one more here. Just on Sinton, have you all changed your thought process on what it’s going to do this year in terms of volume contribution to the second half? I’m just trying to trying to read what you all have put now in terms of having lost production in July, but having got to high melt utilization at one point. So just trying to think through what the next few months look like here because we’re getting to the tail end of the year.\nMark Millett: Got it. The – and again, it’s – we’re wrestling alligators a little, I guess, and sometimes you don’t know when you’re going to win. But I suggested earlier, our July issues have probably cost us 100,000, 150,000 tons, Phil, from our annual sort of projection, and we were around 1.5-ish. So you can do the math, Phil.\nPhil Gibbs: Okay. But that number was relative to the 1.5, that’s kind of just what I wanted to hear in terms of understanding that. And then last question from a housekeeping standpoint is just what the updated CapEx numbers for this year, if I missed it, because I know you got the aluminum project and some other things that you had done there? Thank you.\nTheresa Wagler: So Phil, for the second half of the year, excluding the aluminum project, we estimate CapEx to be somewhere between $350 million and $400 million, and a majority of that relates to the four new flat-rolled coating lines. If we look at what we may spend on the aluminum investment, we’ll likely spend an additional $200 million to $300 million. So the total second half of the year is likely to be somewhere between $550 million and call it, yes, around $550 million, $600 million.\nPhil Gibbs: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Andrew Keches with Barclays. Andrew, your line is live.\nAndrew Keches: Hi, good morning. Theresa, I don’t want to belabor the point, but I want to try and ask the capital deployment question from earlier in the week in a slightly different way. So you have the two turns of net debt threshold out there, but the reality is you’ve been operating at about half of that for the past year or so. And you made the comment, I think it’s obvious that without buybacks, you’d eventually find yourself net cash, and you also don’t want to go to the bottom end of that range. So I guess what would be helpful is to know what you think the right level of leverage is for the business at this point in the cycle? Is 2 times the level where you’re comfortable getting back to? Or should we take the fact that you’ve been operating below that for the last year or so as an indication that you want to keep some flexibility within that range, so we’re not just going to intentionally lever back up?\nTheresa Wagler: No, the intent isn’t to intentionally lever the balance sheet. We like to maintain it at a flexible level to allow for growth projects just like we’re doing right now. So we did this with Sinton as well. We started out with an additional cash, lower leverage on the balance sheet so that we were able to very easily commit to a capital investment that would be funded through cash and cash flow from operations, while maintaining flexibility and optionality in case there were to be some sort of acquisition opportunity that were to become available, et cetera, or in the absence of that, so that we’re able to continue to have our very, we believe, is a positive shareholder distribution plan, which allows for us to continue to keep increasing the dividend at an appropriate level, because it is a forever type of investment for us. We want to make sure it’s maintained at a manageable level. And then in addition to that, we have the opportunity to strategically and opportunistically use the share buyback program. So there is no intention to relever the balance sheet, but we are keeping that flexibility within it so that we can easily fund these projects.\nAndrew Keches: Okay. Maybe just as a quick follow-up. So what – you’ve talked about the cash flow profile structurally changing, but the business is also growing. So what do you think the right level of cash is for the business going forward?\nTheresa Wagler: We actually don’t manage to a cash level on the balance sheet. We look at liquidity in totality. And so yes, I’m not really comfortable answering that question.\nAndrew Keches: Okay. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] There appear to be no further questions in queue. I’d like to turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for any closing remarks.\nMark Millett: Well, thank you, Holly. Again, thank you, everyone, for being on the call joining us today. Just finally, I’d like to congratulate once again the team. Absolutely fantastic performance this past quarter, and we’re continuing that through the rest of the year. To our customers, again, you have been loyal to us. Thank you for your support and for the growing support. And I would also like to look forward to welcoming our new customers on the aluminum side and any folks that want an incredibly dynamic career, come join us, we’re going to be making some aluminum. So thank you very much, everyone. Have a great day. Bye-bye.\nOperator: Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today’s call. Thank you for your participation, and have a great and safe day.",

            "name": "Mark Millett",
            "content": "Well, thank you, David. Thank you, everyone, for being with us on our second call this week. It's been – it was exciting to announce our new growth initiative on Tuesday with our entry into the aluminum market. And it's only been, I think, probably 48 hours or so, and the customer response from all three market segments, whether it be distribution processes, whether it be the packaging industry or even automotive, it's been absolutely staggering the early sign of affirmation of us getting into the marketplace, and I think speaks to the lack of supply and optionality within that market. So that's exciting. And it's as exciting and even more exciting to announce yet another record quarter, record consolidated volumes, earnings per share, cash flow, all supporting our cash allocation strategy and commitment to build shareholder value. Specifically, we repurchased $517 million worth of the company's common stock, representing 3.5% of our outstanding shares in the quarter. So we were staying true to our repurchase programs. We are certainly beneficiary of a strong market tailwind but I'm incredibly proud of our 11,000 strong team. They are the foundation and the catalyst of our success. They are the ones driving the superior results. It's their culture of excellence and the strategic positioning executed over the last 10 years that allows us to exploit the current market and will continue to produce higher lows and higher highs through the cycle. I've said it many times before, but none of this matters without keeping everyone safe. Often, employees are described as a company's most important asset. For us, they are more than that. They're part of the SDI family, the people, and we are always striving to provide the best for their health, their safety and for their welfare. We're actively focused on safety at all times, keeping it top of mind and an active conversation at every level within the organization. We're certainly better than industry averages, but we're not going to rest until we consistently achieve our goal of zero incidents. We're continuing to see material market share gains driven by our ESG profile, an industry-leading low carbon footprint for flat rolled products. We will continue our journey to environmental excellence through a defined and achievable plan to be carbon neutral by 2050. Our recent Aymium investment and our joint venture is a perfect example of that. It's an exciting opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through renewable biomass replacing fossil fuels in our electric arc furnaces. We have tested the product and it works beautifully. We believe it will also work within our iron operations. Initially, it will be 160,000 metric tons per year, and the CapEx is estimated to be around $125 million to $150 million. It will reduce our Scope 1 steelmaking greenhouse gas intensity by some 20%, 25% with even further potential upside from the use of the biogas. So with that said, Theresa, would you like to give us some thoughts? Thank you, Theresa. As you saw, absolutely incredible results from the New Millennium fabrication platform, record operating income of $599 million in Q2 on record 218,000 tons of shipments. We see the nonresidential construction markets remaining strong. Despite the caution emanating from Amazon's message for next year, we have had reaffirmation from our major customers anyway, including warehouse customers that everything remains incredibly strong going forward into 2023. Cloud-based computing, data centers, pharma and schools are all strong. Although the ABI index may have drifted slightly month-over-month, the AI reports, ongoing order activity and architectural firms as well as new work online remains very strong. For us, order input activity remains robust, and we still have near-peak backlog persisting. So that's a very, very good position to be in. Q3 earnings from fabrication will certainly increase. We're going to see increased shipments and metal spread expansion from both increased selling values and lower steel input costs. And as you've seen, this is a – it's providing a perfect hedge to softening steel prices. Although we mentioned his impending retirement on our Q1 call, Russ Rinn had his final official day in the office last week after about 11 years of dedicated commitment to SDI and the OmniSource recycling platform. And yes, it's – people say it's sweet and sour, but for me, it was tough to see him go. He repositioned OmniSource to record earnings last year, dramatically influenced their safety performance over the years and has been a key contributor to the strategic moves we've made as a company. Right now, he is hiking in Virginia. And mate, thank you very much for everything you've done. The recycled platform saw stronger earnings based on higher domestic steel industry utilization pushing demand up, drove higher shipment volume, pricing and associated metal spread. After a strong downward move in prime scrap relative to shred through the quarter, that spread is normalized and pricing is expected to remain more stable in the months ahead. The Omni platform is continuing to work with the steel melt teams to further expand our shred segregation to provide higher volumes of low residual shred scrap, which continues to reduce our dependence on more expensive prime grades. Pig iron availability is normalized and pricing has moderated significantly to low $50 per ton range. We have sufficient pig iron sourced well into next year, and supply is not an issue and the rumors of us having problems with fos levels and such is totally inaccurate. There's no problem using the Brazilian pig iron that we're bringing into our mills. Steel operations had another terrific quarter, record shipments of 3.1 million tons, strong operating income of $1.1 billion. Our second quarter production utilization rate was 95%, certainly above the industry average of some 82%. I think we clearly communicated in the past that higher utilization rates have been clearly demonstrated over time. Our strategy of the value-add diversified product offerings coming out with differentiated supply chains support that along with our internal support from fabrication and downstream. Altogether, it supports our strong and growing through-cycle cash generation capability. Our customer order entry remains strong. Support of value-added products is certainly a part of that. And as I said, we've intentionally grown that value-added steel product mix, created valuable supply chains to mitigate the impact of price volatility. Today, some 70% of our steel sales are value-added. This supports our continued best-in-class financial metrics and cash generation. Specifically to the markets, we expect the automotive arena to remain strong and probably improve as the chip issue mitigates. You still have extremely low dealer inventories and a very strong pent-up vehicle demand from the consumer base. 2022 build rate, there'll be some, I don't know, around about 14 million units, and it's projected to grow to 16.4 million in 2023 and perhaps 16.8 million in 2024. I think the chip shortage actually for us is a good thing. It's effectively extending the auto cycle and just given us a market that's going to be strong for longer. Construction remains strong as evidenced with the fabrication backlog. Our long products steel backlogs are also strong and several of our divisions recorded record earnings and volume in the second quarter, demonstrating the market's depth. Infrastructure is a further meaningful support. High demand continues for HVAC, appliance and other related products. Energy continues to improve. We're getting large orders in the South. I think it's significant to note that the import arrivals that the sort of Ukraine-Russia conflict drove early in the year, those are arriving now, but there's very, very little import interest for sort of October, November, December. And I believe we're going to see moderated import volumes in the second half. And significantly, it appears our hot-rolled coil order input rate has grew dramatically in the last week or so, showing signs of an inflection there. Turning to Sinton. Commissioning continues on the hot side and tandem cold mill. The rest of the mill is fully operational. The hot mill has established target volume throughput rates with an average run rate of 75% to 80%. And I just want to emphasize that, that is when we are running, we're running at that rate. Surface quality is excellent. It's proven to be superior to both our Columbus and our Butler facilities. The hot strip mill design is allowed for thermomechanical rolling. That's allowing higher strength grades to be produced at lower alloy content. The reported coil shape from our processes is excellent. And so in total, it affirms the technical process capability of the equipment, affirms the design decisions that were made some years ago for the mill. We are wrestling a little with uptime in July. We have a substation arcing issue that should be resolved this week. We have some unique Texas power supply issues right now. And we are seeing some miscellaneous equipment failures that are typical of commissioning an integrated line. The supply chain is aggravating that a little bit because when you have a – when you need a part instead of getting it in a matter of hours, sometimes it takes a day or two. So we are wrestling with those alligators, not atypical of a start-up of new plant, but we expect substantial resolution of these issues over the next few weeks. So the July issue may have cost us 100,000, 150,000 tons of production for the year, we think, to [indiscernible] itself because July is not over yet, but certainly moving in the right direction, and we clearly expect to be EBITDA positive in the Q4. We continue on our growth. We have the four value-added coating lines under construction and progressing well. They're targeted for the second half of 2023 to start up. As you know, we – again, it's the strength of our overall strategy and our product mix, but we are the largest non-automotive coater of flat-rolled steels, and now have annual coating capacity of over 6 million tons. Four new lines will increase that capacity by an additional 1.1 million tons. We've created unique supply chain solutions for our customers, and these lines are almost always fully utilized with our highest-margin products. So switching now to aluminum dynamics. It's been an incredibly exciting week, and it has been incredible. I said it earlier, it's been staggering, the initial support that we're seeing from all our customers and a massive number of new customers. To recap, it's a 650,000 metric ton a year flat-rolled facility that's going to be located in the Southeastern U.S. It have on-site melt and cast lab capacity of roughly 450,000 metric tons. It's a fully equipped flat-rolled mill with two cash lines, coating line and downstream processing and packaging capability. It's going to be supported by two satellite recycled aluminum slab casting centers, one in the Southwest U.S. and one in Mexico. We expect the mill itself to start up in the first half of 2025, the Mexican slab casting center in 2024 and the Southwest slap casting center in – at the end of 2025. Financial impact the total project cost of some $2.2 billion. That expenditure is going to be spread over four years of the project. It's going to be 100% funded with available cash and cash flow through operations, and it's expected to add a good $650 million to $700 million in through-cycle consolidated annual EBITDA per year. We certainly anticipate no requirement to add any additional debt. From conversations on the call and subsequent conversations that there appears to be some skepticism regarding our EBITDA per ton target of $1,000. We are confident of that number. And it speaks to what was driven by a myriad of things, but firstly, it's a greenfield facility. Everything is happening essentially on one side or the rolling, processing, coating, heat treating. It allows for an optimum site layout and flow of material and logistics, and you can quite easily reduce the labor, the man power input because of that with robotics and automatic storage and retrievable systems. So labor input is going to be dramatically less than the current industry. We will not be burdened by aged facilities and legacy costs. Energy, because of the state-of-the-art equipment that where be installing is going to be a lot lower. Yield improvements will dramatically improve the cost structure, pushing higher scrap content levels and transportation, given the satellite slab casting centers transporting solid dense slab as opposed to scrap is going to be a significant improvement. So we're very, very confident of that cost projection. From an investment premise standpoint, obviously, we see a very clear gap in the supply and demand. There's a current and growing deficit, supply deficit. We see a very close sort of overlap and business alignment. And essentially, you could – if we filmed the steel mill and an aluminum mill in black and white, most people on the call today wouldn't be able to tell the difference. I mean it's – all it is a different metal. We clearly will be able to execute the project well. It's incredibly cost-effective growth. Given the opportunities that are in the marketplace today, and the exorbitant multiples that are expected from sellers. This is a very, very CapEx efficient growth project. As I said, we have got absolutely great customer support. And at the end of the day, our success has always been driven by the SDI culture by our employees. It drives higher efficiency than anyone else, drive lower cost. And if you look at that industry, it has a very, very, very steep cost curve. And that will obviously – if you were at the lowest quartile, that's going to support margin through the cycle. So we're incredibly excited by the opportunity. So in general, it's been a phenomenal week. It's been a phenomenal year for SDI that will continue through the rest of this year. Our team provides our success, the foundation for that success, and I thank each of them for their hard work and their commitment. I remind each and everyone to remember, safety is always our first priority. We're going to continue to focus on providing superior value for our customers, through our company, team members and shareholders alike. We look forward to creating new opportunities for everyone in the years ahead. So with that said, I'd like to pass the call over for questions. Holly? Emily, that's the electrical power. On the natural gas side of things, we typically hedge around about 60%, 65% of our consumption. No, no. That sums it up well. Well, I think, Carlos, you saw generally a sort of erosion on the hot band, hot-rolled coil pricing across the U.S. in general, and it was a little stronger in the South, because of the reasons that you suggest. As I suggested, we're seeing our order activity on hot band recently pick up dramatically. And so I think there's no support there in that product category. Thank you. Well, from a pig iron perspective, we certainly would like to pursue sort of some level of captive supply and self-sufficiency. And not unlike the last call, we are pursuing or exploring whether the Iron Dynamics technology or an alternative technology is best suited for us. But that's sort of a project in process going forward, Timna. If there were to be a project, again, from a capital perspective, that's not a huge, huge issue. I'm sorry, I didn't catch the – quite the second comment or question. Absolutely not. Yes. You had a market question? Well, I guess, all we can do or all I can do is look through the lens of our order book. And as I mentioned over the years, a wise man told me that, hey, the order book tells all, but it tells all for us. I can't speak for the rest of the industry. But we're not – we haven't seen a dramatic structural sort of change in underlying demand. Order activity has remained pretty strong. There was a little softness in hot-rolled coil, and that's rebounding, I think. And so there's – when I say sort of motion in the marketplace, there seems to be a cloud out there that you got recessionary pressures and all these things going to drive the market there. As just pointed out, right now, through our order book, we don't see it. Thanks, Timna. Good morning, Phil. We had, I would say, a mix. There were right at the onset of the conflict. We did buy a couple of both that were at the high end of that range over, but we now have a kind of a mix of material. I think the highest we may have paid is like $900 or so a ton. We got a couple of boatloads of that. But then we have a lot more material coming in at lower pricing. And the forward boats are tending to be indexed against the market price. So it shouldn't be a major impact for us. Got it. The – and again, it's – we're wrestling alligators a little, I guess, and sometimes you don't know when you're going to win. But I suggested earlier, our July issues have probably cost us 100,000, 150,000 tons, Phil, from our annual sort of projection, and we were around 1.5-ish. So you can do the math, Phil. Well, thank you, Holly. Again, thank you, everyone, for being on the call joining us today. Just finally, I'd like to congratulate once again the team. Absolutely fantastic performance this past quarter, and we're continuing that through the rest of the year. To our customers, again, you have been loyal to us.

            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. As Mark said, what an incredible week. We announced our aluminum strategy on Tuesday, and now we're sharing our record results. I can see personal things relate to the entire SDI family. Your performance resulted in record sales, earnings and cash flow, a truly exceptional performance. Our second quarter 2022 net income was $1.2 billion, or $6.44 per diluted share, inclusive of cost of $77 million, or $0.29 per diluted share associated with the continued start-up of our Sinton, Texas Flat Rolled Steel Mill. Excluding these costs, second quarter 2022 adjusted net income was $1.3 billion, or $6.73 per diluted share. Revenues improved across all of our platforms to a record $6.2 billion, driven by record steel shipments and record pricing volume in our steel fabrication business. Our second quarter 2022 record operating income of $1.6 billion improved 8% versus first quarter results, driven by record steel fabrication earnings. Our steel operations generated very strong operating income of $1.1 billion in the second quarter with record shipments of 3.1 million tons, of which Sinton contributed 171,000 tons. Sequential earnings were 5% lower due to metal spread compression in our flat-rolled steel operations as realized pricing declined and average scrap costs increased. In contrast, our long product steel operations experienced metal spread expansion resulting from rising product prices. In fact, we set quarterly record shipments at our Structural Engineer Bar and Roanoke Bar divisions. Second quarter operating income for our mills recycling operations remained strong at $58 million, representing a 20% sequential quarterly improvement as ferrous metal margin and volume improved. The team continues to effectively lever the strength of our circular manufacturing operating model, benefiting both our steel and mills recycling operations by providing higher quality scrap, which improves furnace efficiency and by reducing company-wide working capital requirements. A huge congratulations once again to our steel fabrication team. They achieved record second quarter operating income of $599 million. These earnings were driven by record average pricing, coupled with record shipments. Steel joist and deck demand remains strong as evidenced by the continued strength in our order backlog, which remains at near record levels and contain strong forward pricing. Based on the strength, we expect steel fabrication earnings to continue to increase even further as the year progresses. Our cash generation continues to be consistently strong based on our differentiated circular business model and highly variable cost structure. At the end of June, we had record liquidity of $2.5 billion, comprised of cash and short-term investments of $1.3 billion and an undrawn unsecured revolver of $1.2 billion. We generated record cash flow from operations of $1 billion in the second quarter and $1.8 billion year-to-date. During the first half of 2022, we have funded $323 million in capital investments. For the second half of 2022, we estimate capital investments will be approximately $350 million to $400 million, the majority of which relate to our four new flat roll coating lines be located in Sinton and Heartland. We maintained our cash dividend at $0.34 per common share after increasing it 31% in the first quarter. Year-to-date, we repurchased $906 million or 6.5% of our outstanding shares. At the end of the second quarter, $727 million remained available under our most recent share repurchase authorization. Since 2017, we've increased our cash dividend per share by 143%, and we have repurchased $3.2 billion of our common stock, representing 30% of our outstanding shares. These actions reflect the strength of our capital foundation and consistently strong cash flow generation capability throughout all market cycles and the continued optimism and confidence in our future. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes strategic growth with the shareholder distributions comprised of a positive dividend profile that is complemented with a variable share repurchase program, while also dedicated to preserving our investment grade credit designation. Our recently announced aluminum investment is consistent with our unchanged strategy. As I mentioned on Tuesday's call, our cash flow profile has fundamentally changed over the last five years. We will readily fund this investment with available cash and cash flow from operations. We also plan to continue strong shareholder distributions. We've strategically placed ourselves in a position to have a sustainable capital foundation that provides the opportunity for strategic growth, strong shareholder returns, and maintain investment grade metrics. We are squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable optimized long-term value creation. Sustainability is a part of our long-term value creation strategy, and we are dedicated to our people, our communities and our environment. We're committed to operating our business with the highest integrity. In that regard, as Mark mentioned, we're very excited to – that we formed our joint venture with Aymium recently, a leading producer of renewable biocarbon products. Steel Dynamics owns 55% of the joint venture, and we're the operating partner. We have an actionable path toward carbon neutrality that is more manageable and we believe considerably less expensive than may lay ahead for many of our industry peers. Our sustainability and carbon reduction strategy is an ongoing journey and we are moving forward with the intention to make a positive difference. We plan to continue to address these matters and to play a leadership role moving forward. Mark? Emily, we have – across the portfolio of those steel mills, we have a mix. So for example, and then to be able to split it out in a manner on a percentage basis, I'll have to kind of go back and talk to the team. But I would say it's probably at least 50% to 60% that's contractual, and they tend to be long-term contracts of two to three years, have escalating factors included in them. And the remainder is spot. There is some that we hedge. Sinton right now is a little bit difficult simply because, as Mark mentioned, we're in startup and they actually constructed a massive substation on our behalf in the region. And so I think most of Sinton at this point is still on a spot basis because of the stop and starts that we've been having right now in July. Thanks, Seth. So as it relates to the fabrication business, we said near records just because of recent we have people back checking all the time and if it's not a record, we have to say near record. There has been some contraction from the peaks, but we're still having a backlog that's well into 2023. So it's not something that we're concerned about or we think it's endemic of anything changing significantly. From a pricing perspective, we're still having very strong price support, and there is still increased pricing that is included in the backlog. So we're feeling very good about the non-residential market, specifically for our steel fabrication business. Mark, do you have anything to add? Absolutely, Seth. We're still – so I don't – I guess I wouldn't call it a significant increase. I think the increase in the second quarter for working capital was just a little over $100 million. So I thought that small, but given the size of the working capital at this point in time, it was incremental. But we would expect a pretty significant working capital release in the probably two to three quarters. And it has to do with not necessarily just have seen some weakness, as Mark mentioned, or some softening in the flat-rolled prices, but we've also been specifically reducing physical inventories at our steel fabrication business as they had extra substrate for different reasons on the ground from a steel perspective. So there's some structural things that we're doing as well as from a pricing standpoint. So again, second half of the year into next year, I would expect working capital release. Carlos, I'll point you to the presentation that's still out on the website that we provided on Tuesday. But from a CapEx progression standpoint, we believe we'll spend somewhere between $200 million and $300 million on the flat-rolled aluminum project in 2022. That would be additive to the number that I gave you earlier for the estimate for the rest of 2022 of being in that $350 million to $400 million range. And then the bulk of the spend will be in 2023 and 2024, each of those years being around $750 million to $800 million. And then finally, we would have the remainder, which is around $300 million to $350 million in that 2025, 2026 time frame. So it's over a period of four to five years where we'll be spending the investment. And that's why Mark was very clear, and I've tried to be clear as well that this will readily be funded through cash flow and cash flow from operations. Absolutely, Phil. The hot roll P&L number is 861,000 tons; cold rolled, 131,000 tons; and the coated products are 1,132,000 tons. So Phil, for the second half of the year, excluding the aluminum project, we estimate CapEx to be somewhere between $350 million and $400 million, and a majority of that relates to the four new flat-rolled coating lines. If we look at what we may spend on the aluminum investment, we'll likely spend an additional $200 million to $300 million. So the total second half of the year is likely to be somewhere between $550 million and call it, yes, around $550 million, $600 million. No, the intent isn't to intentionally lever the balance sheet. We like to maintain it at a flexible level to allow for growth projects just like we're doing right now. So we did this with Sinton as well. We started out with an additional cash, lower leverage on the balance sheet so that we were able to very easily commit to a capital investment that would be funded through cash and cash flow from operations, while maintaining flexibility and optionality in case there were to be some sort of acquisition opportunity that were to become available, et cetera, or in the absence of that, so that we're able to continue to have our very, we believe, is a positive shareholder distribution plan, which allows for us to continue to keep increasing the dividend at an appropriate level, because it is a forever type of investment for us. We want to make sure it's maintained at a manageable level. And then in addition to that, we have the opportunity to strategically and opportunistically use the share buyback program. So there is no intention to relever the balance sheet, but we are keeping that flexibility within it so that we can easily fund these projects. We actually don't manage to a cash level on the balance sheet. We look at liquidity in totality. And so yes, I'm not really comfortable answering that question."

Now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mark.\nMark Millett: Thank you, David. Welcome to our first quarter earnings call. And as always, we appreciate and value your time with us this morning. Record results are of no importance if our teams did not remain safe. So before beginning this morning, I want to pause for a moment to acknowledge a recent workplace fatality that occurred at our Heartland Flat Roll division. We are deeply saddened, our thoughts and prayers reside with his family and friends. The reason I always begin our calls with a topic of safety is because it can never be overemphasized. Safety is our #1 value and first priority. Nothing is more important than sustaining a safe environment for our employees. We must all be continuously aware of our surroundings and our team members. We must actively think about safety at all times, keeping it top of mind, an active conversation. Simply, safety comes before everything. And with this backdrop, it's difficult to celebrate an otherwise phenomenal performance. But we're here this morning to share what the team accomplished in the first quarter and to congratulate them. Their record performance this quarter was another extraordinary achievement driven by the commitment, innovation and passion of our people, executing on our long-term strategies of diversified value-adding growth. I thank the whole team, the entire team for your dedication to excellence in every pursuit. We're committed to operating our business in an environmentally responsible manner and have been since our founding. We have always been and continue to be a leader in production of sustainable low-carbon emission steel products. We encourage the use of new technologies and processes to reduce our impact on the environment, including a strategic focus on carbon emissions mitigation with a goal for our steel mills to be carbon neutral by 2050. Our sustainability strategy is an ongoing journey. We are starting from a leadership position within the industry and plan to stay there by doing even more. But before I continue with more market commentary, Theresa will share insights into our performance.\nTheresa Wagler: Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. It's exciting to continue to see all the new milestones being continually reached throughout the company. A personal thanks to our teams and congratulations. Your performance resulted in another record quarter for Steel Dynamics with net income of $1.1 billion or $5.71 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2022. In the quarter, we incurred cost of $84 million or $0.31 per diluted share for the continued commissioning start-up of our Sinton Texas Flat Roll Steel Mill. Excluding these costs, first quarter 2022 adjusted net income was $1.2 billion or $6.02 per diluted share. First quarter 2022 record revenues of $5.6 billion and record operating income of $1.5 billion were both 5% higher than sequential fourth quarter results driven by higher realized selling values in our steel fabrication business and continued strong performance in our steel and metals recycling operations. We also achieved record quarterly cash flow from operations of $819 billion [ph] and adjusted EBITDA of $1.6 billion, a truly exceptional performance. We see positive industry fundamentals for at least the remainder of 2022 and believe our second quarter 2022 results could achieve yet another new record performance. Our steel operations generated very strong operating income of $1.2 billion in the first quarter, achieving record shipments of 2.9 million tons, of which Sinton contributed 50,000 tons. Earnings from our steel operations were 15% lower than sequential record fourth quarter results related to metal spread compression and our flat-roll steel operations as realized pricing declined more than raw material costs. In contrast, our long product steel operations experienced metal spread expansion based on rising product prices. Despite hitting record volumes, we still have additional steel shipping capacity, much of which is within the long product steel group. When Sinton is fully operational, it will contribute an additional 750,000 tons per quarter of availability. Operating income from our mills recycling operations for the first quarter were strong at $48 million, based on improved metal margins as both average ferrous and nonferrous pricing improved in the quarter. The team continues to effectively lever the strength of our circular manufacturing operating model benefiting both our steel and metals recycling operations by providing higher quality scrap which improves furnace efficiency and by reducing company-wide raw material working capital requirements. Mark will expand on the meaningful benefit of our steel and metals recycling teams working together to reduce our cost of raw materials as well. A huge congratulations to our steel fabrication team. They almost doubled their previous record results, achieving a new record high quarterly operating income of $467 million, eclipsing the entire full year of 2021 results by almost 30% in just one quarter. These earnings were driven by record pricing supported by near-record shipments of 210,000 tons. Steel joist and deck order activity remains incredibly strong. Our steel fabrication business continues to operate with a record backlog considering both forward product pricing and volumes which currently extends through the first quarter of 2023. Based on this strength, we expect steel fabrication earnings to continue to increase even further as the year progresses. Our cash generation continues to be consistently strong based on our differentiated circular business model. At the end of March, we had liquidity of $2.4 billion comprised of cash of $1.2 billion and our fully undrawn unsecured revolver. During the first quarter of 2022, we generated record cash flow from operations of $819 million. Working capital grew $757 million due to higher customer account values stemming from higher prices and volume, coupled with the payment of our 2021 company-wide profit sharing of $360 million. We also funded $159 million in organic capital investments. We believe full year 2022 capital investments will approximate $750 million the majority of which relate to our four new flat-rolled value-added coating lines to be located in Sinton and Heartland. We also finalized the purchase of 45% of the equity interest in New Process Steel on February 1. We increased our first quarter cash dividend by 31% to $0.34 per common share based on the additional ongoing through-cycle free cash flow expected from our new Sinton steel mill. We repurchased 390 -- excuse me, we repurchased $389 million of our common stock in the first quarter, representing 3% of our outstanding shares. As we exhausted our previous program, we also announced the Board's approval on an additional $1.25 billion share repurchase authorization, further demonstrating our confidence in Steel Dynamics future cash flow generation. Since 2017, we've increased our cash dividend per share by 143% and we've repurchased $2.7 billion of our common stock, representing 27% of our outstanding shares. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizing strategic growth with shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that's complemented with a variable share repurchase program while also dedicated to preserving our investment-grade credit designation. We're squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable optimized long-term value creation. Sustainability is a part of that long-term value creation strategy and we're dedicated to our people, our communities and our environment. We're committed to operating our business with the highest integrity. Further committing to this path, in 2021, we announced greenhouse gas reduction and renewable energy goals, including a goal for our steel mills to be carbon neutral by 2050. To increase transparency and accountability, we've also set interim milestones for 2025 and 2030. We had led the steel industry with our exclusive use of electric arc core steelmaking technology, our circular manufacturing model and our innovative solutions. We plan to sustain our leadership position by executing our carbon reduction goals through among other avenues, investing in emission reduction projects, increasing the use of renewable energy and developing and supporting new innovative technology. As an example, we're incredibly excited to recently invest $25 million in the equity of Aymium. Aymium is a producer of renewable biocarbon products that replace fossil fuels and reduce emissions in large global industries, including new electric arc furnace steel industry. We have an actionable path towards carbon neutrality that is more manageable and we believe considerably less expensive than most of our peers. Our sustainability and carbon reduction strategy is an ongoing journey and we are moving towards the intention to make a positive difference. We plan to continue to address these matters and to play a leadership role moving forward. For those of you that like to track our detailed flat roll shipments for the quarter, hot rolled and Pickled and Oiled shipments were 736,000 tons, cold-rolled shipments were 162,000 tons and coated shipments were 1,065,000 tons. Mark?\nMark Millett: Thank you, Theresa. Our steel fabrication operations executed another exceptional record quarter. The earnings power of this platform in this environment still has not been completely displayed as customer demand and pricing continue to be strong. Our steel joist and deck order backlog remain at record volume and forward pricing levels, extending well into the first quarter of '23. The nonresidential construction market remains solid, considering the trend we have seen over the last year, especially in areas that support online retail, specifically represented by construction of distribution and warehouse facilities, along with data centers, schools and health care. Our steel fabrication operations provide a significant natural hedge to our steel production operations in a stable or moderating steel price environment. They also support our steel mills during periods of weaker steel demand as a ready internal customer, what we call pull-through volume, increasing the through-cycle utilization of our steel mills. We have steel fabrication facilities located throughout the U.S. and in Mexico, providing us with an advantaged broad-based customer-centric supply chain. As I move into metals recycling, I'll just take a moment to thank Russ Rinn given his impending retirement in July for the truly significant contributions he's made to that platform over his 10 years, 11-year tenure. He's helped transform that business. Today, we're operating at the same volumes with 1,500 less teammates. So the consolidation there and rationalization has been excellent. And I got massive faith in Miguel Alvarez, who now is leading that platform. I've got great faith that he's going to continue that transformation and do great things with that business. So Russ, my sincere thanks mate. Our metals recycling operations also performed well in the quarter with steady operating income of $48 million. As one of the largest ferrous and nonferrous metal recyclers in North America with operations throughout the U.S. and Mexico, we have a competitive advantage in providing the highest quality, cost-effective scrap to our EAF-based steel mills and to our other customers. In today's environment, our advantage of having our metals recycling platform is even greater. During the last 18 months, our recycling and steel teams have worked closely in developing a higher-quality shredded scrap that can be used in place of prime scrap. The combined effort resulted in our Butler Flat Roll Steel division, reducing its need for prime scrap from 65% of its mix to only 40%, while achieving the same steel qualities. We are currently rolling this out to our Columbus and Sinton Steel divisions, allowing for a lower cost, readily available, low-residual scrap supply. Additionally, given the historically high spread between prime and obsolete grades which is around $170 a ton today, the reduced prime scrap requirement has provided a significant cost savings. The teams are also working together as global pig iron supply chains have been disrupted with the advent of the invasion of Ukraine. Our flat-roll steel operations have reduced the demand of pig iron usage while maintaining the highest level of steel quality through changes in our operating practices and the health of our metals recycling team and sourcing alternative inputs. We have sufficient resources for our steel production to continue operating uninterrupted. Additionally, of particular note, our Butler Flat Roll division has the advantage of iron dynamics, an on-site liquid pig iron production facility that supplies almost all of Butler's pig iron requirements. Charging liquid pig iron into the electric hot furnace also significantly increases productivity and reduces melting costs. We developed the technology years ago and it's the only existing facility of its kind today. We are currently in the process of pursuing opportunities to become even more pig iron self-sufficient for the future. The steel team had an outstanding quarter as well, achieving record shipments and operating income of $1.2 billion. During the quarter, the domestic steel industry operated at production utilization rate of 80%, while our steel mills operated at a rate of 93%. We consistently operated at higher utilization due to our value-added product diversification, our differentiated customer supply chain solutions and to support our internal manufacturing businesses. hot roll coil pricing moderated during the early part of the first quarter but prices have recently firmed with extending order lead times across the product set, especially in coated products. With continued strong demand, we believe steel prices will remain strong. Based on higher raw material input costs, global flat-rolled steel supply disruptions related to the Ukraine, Russia conflict and lower steel imports. Throughout our company history, we have intentionally grown our value-added steel product portfolio and created valuable customer supply chain solutions to mitigate the impact of price volatility. Today, at least 70% of our steel sales are considered value-added. This differentiated business model will continue to provide best-in-class financial metrics and through cycle cash generation. Looking forward, we remain optimistic. The automotive sector steel consumption is expected to grow with production through 2024 returning to over 17 million units supported by an extreme lack of automotive dealer inventory and strong pent up demand. The nonresidential construction sector is strong as evidenced by the strength of our customer backlogs within our long product steel group. Our Structural and Rail and Roanoke Bar divisions both achieved record quarterly earnings and our Engineered Bar Products division is operating at historically strong volumes. And additionally, as we discussed steel fabrication operations are operating at never seen before levels. Residential construction is also good, resulting in high demand for HVAC appliance and other related products. Strong energy prices continue to push up the rig count and we have seen solid demand for energy products. In aggregate, our steel order backlogs and order input strength coupled with broad optimistic customer commentary and general market momentum drive us to conclude that steel market dynamics will remain strong throughout 2022. Steel Dynamics is a dynamic growth company, increasing through-cycle earnings and cash flow to support continuous long-term value creation. Our most recent and significant investment represented by a new state-of-the-art electric arc furnace flat roll steel mill located in Sinton, Texas. This differentiated strategic investment facilitates significant through-cycle operational and financial growth for our teams and customers and for our vendors and shareholders. This electric arc furnace steel mill represents next-generation lower carbonate emitting steel production capabilities, providing differentiated products and supply chain solutions. The 3 million tons state-of-the-art facility is designed to have product capabilities beyond that of any existing electric arc furnace flat-rolled steel producer, competing even more effectively with higher carbon-emitting integrated steel facilities and high carbon foreign competition. It provides us with a more diverse value-added steel product portfolio and benefits our customers with an even broader climate conscious supply option. Sinton's strategic location is centralized in our underserved steel consumer region that represents over 27 million tons of relevant flat roll steel consumption in the U.S. and Mexico. We offer shorter delivery lead times, providing a superior customer supply chain solution for the region. We will also effectively compete with steel imports arriving in Houston and the West Coast. We have seven customers locating on our site, representing up to 1.8 million tons of annual flat-rolled steel processing and consumption capability, four are already operating and the other two have broken ground -- three have broken ground actually. This represents a unique closed loop process as we provide them on-site steel and simultaneously reclaiming the scrap to be remelted into new steel products. We have an advantaged raw material procurement strategy for Sinton. Our acquisition of a Mexican metals recycling company in 2020 provides a critical source of prime scrap supply. These operations are strategically located near high-volume industrial scrap sources throughout Central and Northern Mexico. Sinton provides a differentiated product offering, a unique regional supply chain solution, with significant geographic freight and lead time advantage and offers a lower carbon alternative to imports in a region in need of options. We currently expect 2022 shipments from Sinton to be over 1.5 million tons achieving utilization of approximately 80% by the end of the third quarter and over 90% before year-end. In addition, our previously announced additional four value-added flat roll coating lines are still on schedule to begin operating mid-'23 in support of our Sinton steel mill and our Heartland flat roll operations. The four lines are comprised of two new paint lines and two new galvanizing lines with Galvalume coating capability. Our unique value-added coating supply chain strategy has resulted in our existing lines consistently running at or near full capacity. Existing customers are anxiously awaiting the volume from these new lines. We're the largest domestic non-automated coater of flat roll steels with an annual coating capacity of over 6 million tons. And these four lines will increase that capacity by an additional 1.1 million tons. In closing, our sustainable symbiotic operating platforms and customer-centric supply solutions demonstrate our financial and operating stability differentiating from any competition. We're not the same company that we were nearly five years ago. We are not just a steel company. Our average annual free cash flow has more than doubled and is still growing. The consistency and industrial strength of our earnings is clear and we are investing for transformational growth. Our people and their spirit of excellence provides the foundation for this success. And I thank you, each and every one of you for your passion and dedication and remind you that safety is always our most critical priority. So everyone, thank you for joining us today and we'll open the line-up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question for today is coming from Emily Chieng with Goldman Sachs.\nEmily Chieng: My first question is just around your raw material update there. Can you remind us what the raw material mix is or was previously before the shift to using more obsolete versus prime scrap. The amount of IDI that your liquid pig iron that you're using and perhaps how we should see that changing over time?\nMark Millett: Well, IDI is consistently running at about a 260,000 ton rate as we speak. It's been very, very consistent for many years now. And after the original pioneering efforts or challenges that we had many, many years ago, is an absolutely solid, solid, solid technology for us. And again, as I mentioned, virtually all our pig iron needs that Butler is captive from that facility.\nTheresa Wagler: Emily, one way to look at it from the shift that Mark talked about from going to -- from prime scrap to an upgraded type of obsolete scrap all the way from 65% to 40%. So if that were able to be accomplished with Columbus, Sinton and Butler, if you just make high-level assumptions that generally we would use approximately 20% of pig iron. And then the rest would be more geared toward that prime scrap. If you think about that from a volume perspective, it could be as much as 1.5 million to 2 million tons shifting from prime scrap to higher grade. So if you apply any spread to that. Today, I think Mark mentioned it's like around $170 per ton which is higher than normal. Even if it's $100, $150 per ton, that could be a significant change once -- if all three mills are fully operational.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Michael Glick with JPMorgan.\nMichael Glick: Just on the cost side, beyond scrap, how should we think about energy costs more broadly, just given some of the recent moves we've seen in several of the regional power hubs and natural gas prices as well?\nTheresa Wagler: Just as a reminder, from a natural gas perspective, for electric arc furnaces for Steel Dynamics specifically, it isn't a huge part of the cost structure. It ends up being somewhere around 2% or 3% of the cost of manufacturing of steel products. But obviously, there's impact. We're likely to see increasing prices across the spectrum from a natural gas perspective but nothing that we believe is necessarily significantly impractical. And from a power perspective across the spectrum, we're operating in all different grades. And so it's very different. In some areas, we're in the open market and others, we actually have contracts in place. So there should be some escalating prices but nothing that we think will be material at this point.\nMark Millett: And just to add, if you look at it from a global perspective, obviously, energy prices in other parts of the world have appreciated far greater than the U.S., along with other commodity pricing issues. And so the actual global cost curve has risen and should support pricing further. And obviously, given our low-cost position advantages Steel Dynamics.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets.\nDavid Gagliano: I just wanted to ask a little more about the fabrication business, unbelievable how much this has exploded higher over the last year, I know it's directionally not new but again, another doubling in basically the profit contribution this quarter which is fabulous. But it's -- there's a lot of moving parts embedded in that business. And mind me, the visibility towards longer term is still fairly low. So I'm just trying to see if you could give us a little more information on that segment. Can you talk more about how this business is priced? Are there cost pass-throughs? Are there lags between those pass-throughs and contract prices? I know there's a lot of different pieces within that business. But if there's any more visibility, I really appreciate it. And it really just to summarize, if you could just give us what you think your view is on a normalized go-forward EBITDA contribution basis from this business beyond the first quarter of 2023.\nMark Millett: Several points, somewhat collected maybe. But firstly, demand is at historic highs. If you follow the American Joist Institute numbers, it's at peak, peak levels for sure. And it is driven largely by the change in retail, going online retail distribution houses along with the data centers. So that arena is truly pushing massive demand. Secondly, I think it needs to be recognized that the industry since prior peaks has changed dramatically. It's a rationalized, consolidated industry today. And that allows -- it's just a change dynamic that allows us to have, I think, greater pricing strength. And as a realization today, the value of the product is a lot higher than people would suggest in past history, that product is going to sell at higher levels going forward no matter where we are in the cycle.\nTheresa Wagler: Good morning, David. Just a couple of other points to add to what Mark described. So if you're looking at a backlog for the fabrication business versus the steel business, it's very different. So once a project enters the backlog in our fabrication business, the entire project has been highly engineered and is part of a bigger construction project overall. And if you look at the steel costs that are involved in these large projects that we're participating in, it's really not a large percentage of the entire project. So the customer base, if you will, is not as sensitive to steel pricing as one would think. I mean I think you saw that in the first quarter where even though flat rolled steel prices had a couple of months of weakening that didn't change at all what we were putting in the order backlog at our fabrication business. And so that's one thing. The second thing is because our backlog is out much longer than it typically is, we typically would see a backlog of maybe four to six months. Now it's out and that would be a very good backlog. I mean now we're out into -- well into 2023. And so we changed some of the contract terms as well to try to ensure there's more security and what I would say is more visibility and certainty around the backlog. So we believe that we have a great deal of visibility. We know where we're pricing today and Mark mentioned in his notes that, that forward pricing is higher than what we even realized at this point in time. And that's why I had the confidence in my notes to say that we expect earnings from the fabrication business to continue to increase throughout 2022. And so, I'm not sure if there's no specific you asked about pass-throughs of costs, specific surcharges, etcetera, like you might see in some of the steel businesses in fabrication. But all of that, once it hits the backlog, it's already guaranteed from a price perspective. So I'll just pause on that and see if Mark and I have addressed your question.\nDavid Gagliano: Yes. That's absolutely helpful. Just again, I'm trying to gauge what the comfort level is around a normalized -- the EBITDA contribution now is 20x what it was historic average for well over five years and that 20x increase happened in four quarters. So I'm just trying to figure out as we go out beyond 2022 and in 1Q '23. Some of this is structural and some of it is not, I'm trying to figure out what you think a normal sort of contribution should be for a business that's relatively low visibility from my perspective.\nTheresa Wagler: Sure, David. I would tell you that -- and I can't answer you specifically at this point but what I would tell you is that it's certainly not what the last five years were because Mark pointed to some structural changes within the industry itself from consolidation and other avenues as well as the construction market itself and what it's doing. So there has been some structural change which I think will make that normalized earnings moving forward are higher than we've seen historically as well as what we've done internally. The fabrication team has really done an incredible job. And I know that you've been to some of our operations and we're looking to further automate and to do some really exciting things in the future as well. But also not what we're experiencing today from a normalized level. There are some specific things that happened and with extended steel prices with a very strong construction market, we think that market will continue. I mean specific to there's a large concentration in warehouses at this point. but we will do our best in the future to try to give you a little better idea of what normalized might look like.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Seth Rosenfeld with BNP.\nSeth Rosenfeld: I have two follow-ups, please with regards to the raw material strategy. First, thanks for the color on your efforts to cut your reliance on prime scrap and pig iron. Can you just talk a bit more about those markets and the outlook into spring, so you had a huge squeeze in March. Are you now seeing any signs of some softening of those markets as availability improves? And a follow-up, please, you commented quickly in your prepared remarks with regards to some interest in becoming more self-sufficient for pig iron. What might that include? Is it going to be organic or inorganic in nature. I'll stop there, please.\nMark Millett: Well, firstly, on the pig iron opportunities I prefer not to go into that. Just suffice it to say that we have plans. Relative to -- and I apologize, I didn't necessarily hear all the first question.\nTheresa Wagler: Mark, the question Seth asked relates to pricing around raw materials and what we're seeing kind of in the near term and longer term for scrap and maybe for pig iron?\nMark Millett: Well, obviously, the unimaginable human tragedy of U.K. -- of Ukraine, sorry, should be at the forefront of everyone's mind but the consequences of that on our industry has obviously been massive and I think just on commodities in general, all commodities. If you look at pig iron, the typical global trade is around about 12 million tons merchant trade, roughly 7 million, maybe 8 million tons of that were originating from Russia and Ukrainian mills. So there's been a big chunk of availability or supply taken out. We -- I can't speak really for other metals but I think they followed suit that we scrambled as an industry to cover our needs for the rest of the year into 2023 from other sources, we were very, very successful in procuring material from Brazil and from India in particular and at the same time, changing our sort of operations and process to lower the need or the requirement of that pig iron. So typically, where a mill is around about 22% pig iron input, our mills today are running around about 14%. So in combination, that's got us into 2023 from an uninterrupted supply. Consequence of all that, though, obviously, pushed pig iron pricing up, it peaked at around about $1,100 a ton. And that drew particularly if we prime scrap up with it, prime scrap today is around $75-ish I guess. Pig iron there is turned over. Transactions are in the kind of the very low $900 range today. And we foresee that pressuring scrap pricing down, at least sideways but more likely pressuring it down going forward into the summer. On the flip side, on the obsolete side, when you have pricing at these levels. And as Theresa suggested, there's a record spread between obsolete shred grades to prime of around about $170 a ton. Historically, that was only about $40 a ton. So at these trading levels, everyone is out there with their pickup trucks picking up old cars and old refrigerators. And so the obsolete stream is considerable today. Flow is very, very, very high and we feel that is going to pressure scrap pricing over the next few months as well.\nSeth Rosenfeld: If I can have just one follow-up, please. Within your recycling business noticed that the fair shipments were down year-over-year quite considerably. Can you touch on what's driving that decrease and how you'd expect it to transpire into Q2.\nTheresa Wagler: So from a fairs perspective, the shipments were down in the first quarter. It wasn't structural per se. It had to do with where raw material inventories were at the end of the year, heading into the first quarter. There were some mill outages during the first quarter as well. Heading forward is when traditionally, you're going to see seasonality kick in and based on where we see steel demand and how that translates then into raw material demand as well, we would expect to see increasing volumes second and third quarter for mill recycling.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research.\nTimna Tanners: So first, I just wanted to just get a little bit more color on the new guidance for Sinton starting up. I think now 1.5 million and it was previously 2 million. Is it possible? There's just further delays. Can you give us a little more color on that and what's happened there?\nMark Millett: Sure. Absolutely. And I would say and just to emphasize the progress at Sinton is remarkable. The reduced volume and I think we gave that in our January call was still a little higher than that. And that was before the hot side of the caster and the caster that was delayed. Just to start up itself. But since then, the mill is running extremely well as we commission all the different sort of bells and whistles and commission our capabilities. So we've already been at 84.6 inch width coil. We've already been down to 0.60 on high-strength low alloy grades -- and the hot band itself is -- it was described to me this morning as from our customers as beautiful. So I think it's going well, to be honest and confident that we will exceed that 1.5 million tons in all honesty, we're just being conservative perhaps. I would say, that we just had our national sales, flat roll sales, meaning at Sinton for the last two weeks -- last two days, sorry. And the tenor there is that the customer interest is absolutely off the charts. As I said, it's such an underserved marketplace today and the product differentiation of that facility is going to be insane. And the fact that we have the selling facilities, four of which are already operating will be a massive sort of pull-through sort of volume for that facility. So we couldn't be -- to be honest, we couldn't be happier. Yes, what could...\nTimna Tanners: So 90% of the...\nMark Millett: Last December. Yes. But the good side and I think it was -- I can't remember which one have you suggested but a slow ramp isn't all that bad from a supply-demand dynamic right now anyway. And we -- if you consider our ramp-up is going to be solid through the rest of this year and we went to 24, five operation, just this Monday. Up into that point, we would just commissioning sort of 12 hours a day on days. Galvalume steel, obviously, is not ramping up yet and delta is not. So net-net, it's a good thing.\nTimna Tanners: Got you. So David and I have said that we're going to start a fab shop. I'm joking, obviously. But we would -- I did want to ask you how hard it would be to see any competitors there in that space, right? Given that prices are now higher than $4,000 a ton. And historically, I calculated $1350. I mean even with the higher costs, those are pretty nice margins. So I know you said it's consolidated but -- how hard would it be to see a new entrant there? And how much of that could be a risk.\nMark Millett: The cost of entry from an asset perspective is not massive. As we've seen or as we described in our last call, we substantially increased productivity and volume capability from our facilities there with almost no capital expense because simply, it's people alliance more than actual capital asset. The engineering of that product is intense to engineer cost effectively is a -- it's proprietary kind of intellectual sort of evolution of many, many, many years. For someone who jumped in fresh nothing is impossible. There's absolutely no way they could emulate our productivity and our efficiency and they wouldn't be able to penetrate in my mind, the marketplace.\nTheresa Wagler: Just to add to what Mark is saying, if you think about it, you have to have the architecture and the firms the customers are willing to design at some extent, for your products, etcetera. So it's not something that someone can just get involved and have all the constituents know you right off the bat, Mark said that incredibly well.\nMark Millett: One last thing I would add also is to create the cultural -- the culture for those facilities is absolutely phenomenal. Team does incredibly well. And if you were to visit a joist plant, it's almost a choreography of action and activity and it's very, very difficult to replicate.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley.\nCarlos De Alba: Just a couple of questions. The first one, are there -- could you talk about any potential additional cost in this enhanced shredded-scrap products that you are now creating and charging your mills with other than the spread which obviously is a big incentive for you to move down to shredded. Are there any costs that you incurred or maybe we should take into consideration just besides the spread and the cost of shredded scrap? And then my second question, if I can is, could you remind us or provide us an updated CapEx guidance for this year? And in particular, is there any changes on the CapEx for Sinton given there's lower ramp-up and the delay on the caster?\nMark Millett: Well, I'll take the scrap one and essentially call us, I'd say, somewhere around $10 a ton.\nTheresa Wagler: That was very short response. From the perspective of guidance for CapEx for this year, we're still tracking around $750 million and your question was specific to Sinton. And specific to it, we don't expect anything of significance for digital CapEx related to the delays, there was additional expense which you saw flow through the first quarter already due to the delay in just manpower and maintenance of things associated with that delay but not from a capital perspective. So for Sinton we're still at that $2 billion mark which honestly is incredible, given what the teams have gone through for them to be able to maintain their budget while being able to make it through COVID and whatnot and everything else. So we're not expecting anything for the rest of the year in addition from a Sinton perspective for capital.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Curt Woodworth with Credit Suisse.\nCurt Woodworth: Mark, with respect to the 1.8 million tons on site that -- I know you said four operating, three under construction but when would you expect that to be fully operational. And then also, when you look at that sort of localized manufacturing capability, do you have a sense of if -- how much of that would be a potential onshoring capability, i.e., sort of new demand or are those facilities replacing, say, existing sites within North America? That's my first question.\nMark Millett: Well, I guess the on-campus sort of development is firstly evolved much quicker than we anticipated. It's been absolutely incredible to see the faith of our customer base and coming to and investing in our sort of dream down there. And secondly, as I said, when I say intentional, we wanted to make sure is that we differentiated our supply chains. And each of those on-site customers per se are in a different field. So we have everything covered from automotive to light-gauge coated to heavy gauge plate cuts and everything. We have a pipe producer there and we have a couple of pipe producers there actually. So it's a good spread, a good array of activity to support our supply chain to customers. And obviously, it's a huge benefit to them. We're able to firstly deliver that material to them free of charge. It's just 200 -- well, not smaller than 200 yards. It's a big site. But a mile down the track, we can deliver it very, very effectively at low cost. If you see and stand beside one of our coils there, it is absolutely remarkable, the difference in size between a 22-ton coil and a 52-ton coil. That's giving those customers massive operational benefits, yield benefits. And so that's a plot. And it also, obviously, just the elimination of that first freight is $25, $30, $35 a ton savings in the supply chain. So we see it as a very, very effective solution. It's going to allow us to penetrate markets much, much quicker.\nTheresa Wagler: And Curt, in addition to what Mark said and we're getting a lot of excitement from this from customers of those customers that are on site is that it removes a considerable amount as the greenhouse gas is associated with delivery and movement of material and we'll be able to take their scrap as well. So it's almost a perfect closed-loop environment that heretofore really hasn't been available. So it will be interesting to see how that develops from a marketing perspective as well.\nCurt Woodworth: Okay. And then with respect to Iron Dynamics, I mean it seems like that facility has really become a viable asset to the company. I know in the past, had some issues. Are you evaluating potentially building another facility like that at some point? I know in your prepared remarks, you said you were evaluating potential further investment into pig iron. Just curious kind of how you could see the evolution of that going forward?\nMark Millett: I prefer not to reveal our strategy on pig iron supply right now. But I appreciate the question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We do have a follow-up question coming from Seth Rosenfeld.\nSeth Rosenfeld: Just one more with regards to working capital, please. Obviously, very significant investments in Q1 weighing on free cash flow. Can you give a bit more color on the split, perhaps, how much of that was tied to strength in steel prices and volumes versus growth in raw materials inventories, perhaps there was a need to build particularly elevated inventories of raw mats given supply chain disruption. And then, looking forward into Q2 or into the back half what should we think about the sequencing of working capital investment potential release as Sinton begins to then ramp up.\nTheresa Wagler: Fairly fast. From the second, working capital. One big draw which I'll just reiterate, even though I had it in my opening comments is that we do pay our company-wide profit sharing in March of every year -- the following year. So there was a $360 million payment to the profit sharing which we're fairly excited to be able to provide that for the retirement of our teams. It's based, as you know, on 8% of pretax earnings. And -- so that was a big part of the lever. The other piece of it really related to fabrication and customer account values and volumes. And it was really less to do with inventory. So inventory was fairly flat. Specifically as it relates to Sinton, Sinton isn't in a building working capital mode. So it increases working capital in the first quarter, somewhere around $150 million to $200 million. You'll see that continue. It might be another $100 million to $150 million in the second quarter and third quarter combined. And then we should really be reaching that capacity point outside of any big movements in inventory valuation itself or in customer evaluations themselves for Sinton. From a consolidated perspective, moving throughout the year, again, we're heading into a seasonally strong environment, second and third quarter. I don't -- you're not going to see as big of a build as we saw in the first quarter because you don't have the same movement in payables and accruals. So I would say it's going to be muted, then likely you'll see some working capital give back in third and fourth quarter.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Alex Hacking with Citi.\nAlex Hacking: I got dropped off the call for a little bit, so I apologize if this was asked. And I also appreciate if you're going to give me the same answer that you just gave Curt. But you've talked about scrap and pig, how does DRI, HBI potentially fit into your raw material strategy.\nMark Millett: We currently are purchasing, procuring DRI -- well, not DRI, HBI and have been for many years. For us, it tends to be what we call a value and use kind of economic calculation if it makes financial sense to put it in the mix, then we will buy it. HBI tends to be an inferior product for the electric arc furnace. It's slows productivity there. It's low yield increases energy consumption. So it's never a preferred material. But at the right price, it makes sense. And so we do have a small but kind of steady diet to keep in line with that supply chain. Our furnace is actually at Sinton and we're converting Columbus to sort of in-line charging which allows higher volumes of HBI to be added to the furnace if need be.\nOperator: That concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for any closing remarks.\nMark Millett: Well, again, we certainly appreciate your time. And hopefully and I see some are just recognizing the strength of our business model, the vertical integration, the downstream supply chain solutions that we have, the diversified value-add mix that we have and now Sinton coming online and another four lines soon thereafter. But we truly, in my humble opinion, we and the team has truly transformed this company over the last five, six years. We're a different company today. We're not just a steel company. And I see that some of you are recognizing that and I think with time. And as my mom always used to say, proof is in the pudding. Well, we're making the pudding, we're proving it and I can't be prouder of the team. They're a phenomenal team. I ask them to be safe each and every day and looking after each other. Thank you for the customers, for your faith and support and for our vendors, particularly the vendors that have gone far and beyond the call of duty, so to speak, in putting Sinton together. They've done a phenomenal job. So thank you. and thank you to our shareholders who support us. So with that said, thank you and have a safe and wonderful day.\nOperator: Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation and have a great and safe day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mark Millett",
            "content": "Thank you, David. Welcome to our first quarter earnings call. And as always, we appreciate and value your time with us this morning. Record results are of no importance if our teams did not remain safe. So before beginning this morning, I want to pause for a moment to acknowledge a recent workplace fatality that occurred at our Heartland Flat Roll division. We are deeply saddened, our thoughts and prayers reside with his family and friends. The reason I always begin our calls with a topic of safety is because it can never be overemphasized. Safety is our #1 value and first priority. Nothing is more important than sustaining a safe environment for our employees. We must all be continuously aware of our surroundings and our team members. We must actively think about safety at all times, keeping it top of mind, an active conversation. Simply, safety comes before everything. And with this backdrop, it's difficult to celebrate an otherwise phenomenal performance. But we're here this morning to share what the team accomplished in the first quarter and to congratulate them. Their record performance this quarter was another extraordinary achievement driven by the commitment, innovation and passion of our people, executing on our long-term strategies of diversified value-adding growth. I thank the whole team, the entire team for your dedication to excellence in every pursuit. We're committed to operating our business in an environmentally responsible manner and have been since our founding. We have always been and continue to be a leader in production of sustainable low-carbon emission steel products. We encourage the use of new technologies and processes to reduce our impact on the environment, including a strategic focus on carbon emissions mitigation with a goal for our steel mills to be carbon neutral by 2050. Our sustainability strategy is an ongoing journey. We are starting from a leadership position within the industry and plan to stay there by doing even more. But before I continue with more market commentary, Theresa will share insights into our performance. Thank you, Theresa. Our steel fabrication operations executed another exceptional record quarter. The earnings power of this platform in this environment still has not been completely displayed as customer demand and pricing continue to be strong. Our steel joist and deck order backlog remain at record volume and forward pricing levels, extending well into the first quarter of '23. The nonresidential construction market remains solid, considering the trend we have seen over the last year, especially in areas that support online retail, specifically represented by construction of distribution and warehouse facilities, along with data centers, schools and health care. Our steel fabrication operations provide a significant natural hedge to our steel production operations in a stable or moderating steel price environment. They also support our steel mills during periods of weaker steel demand as a ready internal customer, what we call pull-through volume, increasing the through-cycle utilization of our steel mills. We have steel fabrication facilities located throughout the U.S. and in Mexico, providing us with an advantaged broad-based customer-centric supply chain. As I move into metals recycling, I'll just take a moment to thank Russ Rinn given his impending retirement in July for the truly significant contributions he's made to that platform over his 10 years, 11-year tenure. He's helped transform that business. Today, we're operating at the same volumes with 1,500 less teammates. So the consolidation there and rationalization has been excellent. And I got massive faith in Miguel Alvarez, who now is leading that platform. I've got great faith that he's going to continue that transformation and do great things with that business. So Russ, my sincere thanks mate. Our metals recycling operations also performed well in the quarter with steady operating income of $48 million. As one of the largest ferrous and nonferrous metal recyclers in North America with operations throughout the U.S. and Mexico, we have a competitive advantage in providing the highest quality, cost-effective scrap to our EAF-based steel mills and to our other customers. In today's environment, our advantage of having our metals recycling platform is even greater. During the last 18 months, our recycling and steel teams have worked closely in developing a higher-quality shredded scrap that can be used in place of prime scrap. The combined effort resulted in our Butler Flat Roll Steel division, reducing its need for prime scrap from 65% of its mix to only 40%, while achieving the same steel qualities. We are currently rolling this out to our Columbus and Sinton Steel divisions, allowing for a lower cost, readily available, low-residual scrap supply. Additionally, given the historically high spread between prime and obsolete grades which is around $170 a ton today, the reduced prime scrap requirement has provided a significant cost savings. The teams are also working together as global pig iron supply chains have been disrupted with the advent of the invasion of Ukraine. Our flat-roll steel operations have reduced the demand of pig iron usage while maintaining the highest level of steel quality through changes in our operating practices and the health of our metals recycling team and sourcing alternative inputs. We have sufficient resources for our steel production to continue operating uninterrupted. Additionally, of particular note, our Butler Flat Roll division has the advantage of iron dynamics, an on-site liquid pig iron production facility that supplies almost all of Butler's pig iron requirements. Charging liquid pig iron into the electric hot furnace also significantly increases productivity and reduces melting costs. We developed the technology years ago and it's the only existing facility of its kind today. We are currently in the process of pursuing opportunities to become even more pig iron self-sufficient for the future. The steel team had an outstanding quarter as well, achieving record shipments and operating income of $1.2 billion. During the quarter, the domestic steel industry operated at production utilization rate of 80%, while our steel mills operated at a rate of 93%. We consistently operated at higher utilization due to our value-added product diversification, our differentiated customer supply chain solutions and to support our internal manufacturing businesses. hot roll coil pricing moderated during the early part of the first quarter but prices have recently firmed with extending order lead times across the product set, especially in coated products. With continued strong demand, we believe steel prices will remain strong. Based on higher raw material input costs, global flat-rolled steel supply disruptions related to the Ukraine, Russia conflict and lower steel imports. Throughout our company history, we have intentionally grown our value-added steel product portfolio and created valuable customer supply chain solutions to mitigate the impact of price volatility. Today, at least 70% of our steel sales are considered value-added. This differentiated business model will continue to provide best-in-class financial metrics and through cycle cash generation. Looking forward, we remain optimistic. The automotive sector steel consumption is expected to grow with production through 2024 returning to over 17 million units supported by an extreme lack of automotive dealer inventory and strong pent up demand. The nonresidential construction sector is strong as evidenced by the strength of our customer backlogs within our long product steel group. Our Structural and Rail and Roanoke Bar divisions both achieved record quarterly earnings and our Engineered Bar Products division is operating at historically strong volumes. And additionally, as we discussed steel fabrication operations are operating at never seen before levels. Residential construction is also good, resulting in high demand for HVAC appliance and other related products. Strong energy prices continue to push up the rig count and we have seen solid demand for energy products. In aggregate, our steel order backlogs and order input strength coupled with broad optimistic customer commentary and general market momentum drive us to conclude that steel market dynamics will remain strong throughout 2022. Steel Dynamics is a dynamic growth company, increasing through-cycle earnings and cash flow to support continuous long-term value creation. Our most recent and significant investment represented by a new state-of-the-art electric arc furnace flat roll steel mill located in Sinton, Texas. This differentiated strategic investment facilitates significant through-cycle operational and financial growth for our teams and customers and for our vendors and shareholders. This electric arc furnace steel mill represents next-generation lower carbonate emitting steel production capabilities, providing differentiated products and supply chain solutions. The 3 million tons state-of-the-art facility is designed to have product capabilities beyond that of any existing electric arc furnace flat-rolled steel producer, competing even more effectively with higher carbon-emitting integrated steel facilities and high carbon foreign competition. It provides us with a more diverse value-added steel product portfolio and benefits our customers with an even broader climate conscious supply option. Sinton's strategic location is centralized in our underserved steel consumer region that represents over 27 million tons of relevant flat roll steel consumption in the U.S. and Mexico. We offer shorter delivery lead times, providing a superior customer supply chain solution for the region. We will also effectively compete with steel imports arriving in Houston and the West Coast. We have seven customers locating on our site, representing up to 1.8 million tons of annual flat-rolled steel processing and consumption capability, four are already operating and the other two have broken ground -- three have broken ground actually. This represents a unique closed loop process as we provide them on-site steel and simultaneously reclaiming the scrap to be remelted into new steel products. We have an advantaged raw material procurement strategy for Sinton. Our acquisition of a Mexican metals recycling company in 2020 provides a critical source of prime scrap supply. These operations are strategically located near high-volume industrial scrap sources throughout Central and Northern Mexico. Sinton provides a differentiated product offering, a unique regional supply chain solution, with significant geographic freight and lead time advantage and offers a lower carbon alternative to imports in a region in need of options. We currently expect 2022 shipments from Sinton to be over 1.5 million tons achieving utilization of approximately 80% by the end of the third quarter and over 90% before year-end. In addition, our previously announced additional four value-added flat roll coating lines are still on schedule to begin operating mid-'23 in support of our Sinton steel mill and our Heartland flat roll operations. The four lines are comprised of two new paint lines and two new galvanizing lines with Galvalume coating capability. Our unique value-added coating supply chain strategy has resulted in our existing lines consistently running at or near full capacity. Existing customers are anxiously awaiting the volume from these new lines. We're the largest domestic non-automated coater of flat roll steels with an annual coating capacity of over 6 million tons. And these four lines will increase that capacity by an additional 1.1 million tons. In closing, our sustainable symbiotic operating platforms and customer-centric supply solutions demonstrate our financial and operating stability differentiating from any competition. We're not the same company that we were nearly five years ago. We are not just a steel company. Our average annual free cash flow has more than doubled and is still growing. The consistency and industrial strength of our earnings is clear and we are investing for transformational growth. Our people and their spirit of excellence provides the foundation for this success. And I thank you, each and every one of you for your passion and dedication and remind you that safety is always our most critical priority. So everyone, thank you for joining us today and we'll open the line-up for questions. Well, IDI is consistently running at about a 260,000 ton rate as we speak. It's been very, very consistent for many years now. And after the original pioneering efforts or challenges that we had many, many years ago, is an absolutely solid, solid, solid technology for us. And again, as I mentioned, virtually all our pig iron needs that Butler is captive from that facility. And just to add, if you look at it from a global perspective, obviously, energy prices in other parts of the world have appreciated far greater than the U.S., along with other commodity pricing issues. And so the actual global cost curve has risen and should support pricing further. And obviously, given our low-cost position advantages Steel Dynamics. Several points, somewhat collected maybe. But firstly, demand is at historic highs. If you follow the American Joist Institute numbers, it's at peak, peak levels for sure. And it is driven largely by the change in retail, going online retail distribution houses along with the data centers. So that arena is truly pushing massive demand. Secondly, I think it needs to be recognized that the industry since prior peaks has changed dramatically. It's a rationalized, consolidated industry today. And that allows -- it's just a change dynamic that allows us to have, I think, greater pricing strength. And as a realization today, the value of the product is a lot higher than people would suggest in past history, that product is going to sell at higher levels going forward no matter where we are in the cycle. Well, firstly, on the pig iron opportunities I prefer not to go into that. Just suffice it to say that we have plans. Relative to -- and I apologize, I didn't necessarily hear all the first question. Well, obviously, the unimaginable human tragedy of U.K. -- of Ukraine, sorry, should be at the forefront of everyone's mind but the consequences of that on our industry has obviously been massive and I think just on commodities in general, all commodities. If you look at pig iron, the typical global trade is around about 12 million tons merchant trade, roughly 7 million, maybe 8 million tons of that were originating from Russia and Ukrainian mills. So there's been a big chunk of availability or supply taken out. We -- I can't speak really for other metals but I think they followed suit that we scrambled as an industry to cover our needs for the rest of the year into 2023 from other sources, we were very, very successful in procuring material from Brazil and from India in particular and at the same time, changing our sort of operations and process to lower the need or the requirement of that pig iron. So typically, where a mill is around about 22% pig iron input, our mills today are running around about 14%. So in combination, that's got us into 2023 from an uninterrupted supply. Consequence of all that, though, obviously, pushed pig iron pricing up, it peaked at around about $1,100 a ton. And that drew particularly if we prime scrap up with it, prime scrap today is around $75-ish I guess. Pig iron there is turned over. Transactions are in the kind of the very low $900 range today. And we foresee that pressuring scrap pricing down, at least sideways but more likely pressuring it down going forward into the summer. On the flip side, on the obsolete side, when you have pricing at these levels. And as Theresa suggested, there's a record spread between obsolete shred grades to prime of around about $170 a ton. Historically, that was only about $40 a ton. So at these trading levels, everyone is out there with their pickup trucks picking up old cars and old refrigerators. And so the obsolete stream is considerable today. Flow is very, very, very high and we feel that is going to pressure scrap pricing over the next few months as well. Sure. Absolutely. And I would say and just to emphasize the progress at Sinton is remarkable. The reduced volume and I think we gave that in our January call was still a little higher than that. And that was before the hot side of the caster and the caster that was delayed. Just to start up itself. But since then, the mill is running extremely well as we commission all the different sort of bells and whistles and commission our capabilities. So we've already been at 84.6 inch width coil. We've already been down to 0.60 on high-strength low alloy grades -- and the hot band itself is -- it was described to me this morning as from our customers as beautiful. So I think it's going well, to be honest and confident that we will exceed that 1.5 million tons in all honesty, we're just being conservative perhaps. I would say, that we just had our national sales, flat roll sales, meaning at Sinton for the last two weeks -- last two days, sorry. And the tenor there is that the customer interest is absolutely off the charts. As I said, it's such an underserved marketplace today and the product differentiation of that facility is going to be insane. And the fact that we have the selling facilities, four of which are already operating will be a massive sort of pull-through sort of volume for that facility. So we couldn't be -- to be honest, we couldn't be happier. Yes, what could... Last December. Yes. But the good side and I think it was -- I can't remember which one have you suggested but a slow ramp isn't all that bad from a supply-demand dynamic right now anyway. And we -- if you consider our ramp-up is going to be solid through the rest of this year and we went to 24, five operation, just this Monday. Up into that point, we would just commissioning sort of 12 hours a day on days. Galvalume steel, obviously, is not ramping up yet and delta is not. So net-net, it's a good thing. The cost of entry from an asset perspective is not massive. As we've seen or as we described in our last call, we substantially increased productivity and volume capability from our facilities there with almost no capital expense because simply, it's people alliance more than actual capital asset. The engineering of that product is intense to engineer cost effectively is a -- it's proprietary kind of intellectual sort of evolution of many, many, many years. For someone who jumped in fresh nothing is impossible. There's absolutely no way they could emulate our productivity and our efficiency and they wouldn't be able to penetrate in my mind, the marketplace. One last thing I would add also is to create the cultural -- the culture for those facilities is absolutely phenomenal. Team does incredibly well. And if you were to visit a joist plant, it's almost a choreography of action and activity and it's very, very difficult to replicate. Well, I'll take the scrap one and essentially call us, I'd say, somewhere around $10 a ton. Well, I guess the on-campus sort of development is firstly evolved much quicker than we anticipated. It's been absolutely incredible to see the faith of our customer base and coming to and investing in our sort of dream down there. And secondly, as I said, when I say intentional, we wanted to make sure is that we differentiated our supply chains. And each of those on-site customers per se are in a different field. So we have everything covered from automotive to light-gauge coated to heavy gauge plate cuts and everything. We have a pipe producer there and we have a couple of pipe producers there actually. So it's a good spread, a good array of activity to support our supply chain to customers. And obviously, it's a huge benefit to them. We're able to firstly deliver that material to them free of charge. It's just 200 -- well, not smaller than 200 yards. It's a big site. But a mile down the track, we can deliver it very, very effectively at low cost. If you see and stand beside one of our coils there, it is absolutely remarkable, the difference in size between a 22-ton coil and a 52-ton coil. That's giving those customers massive operational benefits, yield benefits. And so that's a plot. And it also, obviously, just the elimination of that first freight is $25, $30, $35 a ton savings in the supply chain. So we see it as a very, very effective solution. It's going to allow us to penetrate markets much, much quicker. I prefer not to reveal our strategy on pig iron supply right now. But I appreciate the question. We currently are purchasing, procuring DRI -- well, not DRI, HBI and have been for many years. For us, it tends to be what we call a value and use kind of economic calculation if it makes financial sense to put it in the mix, then we will buy it. HBI tends to be an inferior product for the electric arc furnace. It's slows productivity there. It's low yield increases energy consumption. So it's never a preferred material. But at the right price, it makes sense. And so we do have a small but kind of steady diet to keep in line with that supply chain. Our furnace is actually at Sinton and we're converting Columbus to sort of in-line charging which allows higher volumes of HBI to be added to the furnace if need be. Well, again, we certainly appreciate your time. And hopefully and I see some are just recognizing the strength of our business model, the vertical integration, the downstream supply chain solutions that we have, the diversified value-add mix that we have and now Sinton coming online and another four lines soon thereafter. But we truly, in my humble opinion, we and the team has truly transformed this company over the last five, six years. We're a different company today. We're not just a steel company. And I see that some of you are recognizing that and I think with time. And as my mom always used to say, proof is in the pudding. Well, we're making the pudding, we're proving it and I can't be prouder of the team. They're a phenomenal team. I ask them to be safe each and every day and looking after each other. Thank you for the customers, for your faith and support and for our vendors, particularly the vendors that have gone far and beyond the call of duty, so to speak, in putting Sinton together. They've done a phenomenal job. So thank you. and thank you to our shareholders who support us. So with that said, thank you and have a safe and wonderful day."

            "name": "Theresa Wagler",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. It's exciting to continue to see all the new milestones being continually reached throughout the company. A personal thanks to our teams and congratulations. Your performance resulted in another record quarter for Steel Dynamics with net income of $1.1 billion or $5.71 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2022. In the quarter, we incurred cost of $84 million or $0.31 per diluted share for the continued commissioning start-up of our Sinton Texas Flat Roll Steel Mill. Excluding these costs, first quarter 2022 adjusted net income was $1.2 billion or $6.02 per diluted share. First quarter 2022 record revenues of $5.6 billion and record operating income of $1.5 billion were both 5% higher than sequential fourth quarter results driven by higher realized selling values in our steel fabrication business and continued strong performance in our steel and metals recycling operations. We also achieved record quarterly cash flow from operations of $819 billion [ph] and adjusted EBITDA of $1.6 billion, a truly exceptional performance. We see positive industry fundamentals for at least the remainder of 2022 and believe our second quarter 2022 results could achieve yet another new record performance. Our steel operations generated very strong operating income of $1.2 billion in the first quarter, achieving record shipments of 2.9 million tons, of which Sinton contributed 50,000 tons. Earnings from our steel operations were 15% lower than sequential record fourth quarter results related to metal spread compression and our flat-roll steel operations as realized pricing declined more than raw material costs. In contrast, our long product steel operations experienced metal spread expansion based on rising product prices. Despite hitting record volumes, we still have additional steel shipping capacity, much of which is within the long product steel group. When Sinton is fully operational, it will contribute an additional 750,000 tons per quarter of availability. Operating income from our mills recycling operations for the first quarter were strong at $48 million, based on improved metal margins as both average ferrous and nonferrous pricing improved in the quarter. The team continues to effectively lever the strength of our circular manufacturing operating model benefiting both our steel and metals recycling operations by providing higher quality scrap which improves furnace efficiency and by reducing company-wide raw material working capital requirements. Mark will expand on the meaningful benefit of our steel and metals recycling teams working together to reduce our cost of raw materials as well. A huge congratulations to our steel fabrication team. They almost doubled their previous record results, achieving a new record high quarterly operating income of $467 million, eclipsing the entire full year of 2021 results by almost 30% in just one quarter. These earnings were driven by record pricing supported by near-record shipments of 210,000 tons. Steel joist and deck order activity remains incredibly strong. Our steel fabrication business continues to operate with a record backlog considering both forward product pricing and volumes which currently extends through the first quarter of 2023. Based on this strength, we expect steel fabrication earnings to continue to increase even further as the year progresses. Our cash generation continues to be consistently strong based on our differentiated circular business model. At the end of March, we had liquidity of $2.4 billion comprised of cash of $1.2 billion and our fully undrawn unsecured revolver. During the first quarter of 2022, we generated record cash flow from operations of $819 million. Working capital grew $757 million due to higher customer account values stemming from higher prices and volume, coupled with the payment of our 2021 company-wide profit sharing of $360 million. We also funded $159 million in organic capital investments. We believe full year 2022 capital investments will approximate $750 million the majority of which relate to our four new flat-rolled value-added coating lines to be located in Sinton and Heartland. We also finalized the purchase of 45% of the equity interest in New Process Steel on February 1. We increased our first quarter cash dividend by 31% to $0.34 per common share based on the additional ongoing through-cycle free cash flow expected from our new Sinton steel mill. We repurchased 390 -- excuse me, we repurchased $389 million of our common stock in the first quarter, representing 3% of our outstanding shares. As we exhausted our previous program, we also announced the Board's approval on an additional $1.25 billion share repurchase authorization, further demonstrating our confidence in Steel Dynamics future cash flow generation. Since 2017, we've increased our cash dividend per share by 143% and we've repurchased $2.7 billion of our common stock, representing 27% of our outstanding shares. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizing strategic growth with shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that's complemented with a variable share repurchase program while also dedicated to preserving our investment-grade credit designation. We're squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable optimized long-term value creation. Sustainability is a part of that long-term value creation strategy and we're dedicated to our people, our communities and our environment. We're committed to operating our business with the highest integrity. Further committing to this path, in 2021, we announced greenhouse gas reduction and renewable energy goals, including a goal for our steel mills to be carbon neutral by 2050. To increase transparency and accountability, we've also set interim milestones for 2025 and 2030. We had led the steel industry with our exclusive use of electric arc core steelmaking technology, our circular manufacturing model and our innovative solutions. We plan to sustain our leadership position by executing our carbon reduction goals through among other avenues, investing in emission reduction projects, increasing the use of renewable energy and developing and supporting new innovative technology. As an example, we're incredibly excited to recently invest $25 million in the equity of Aymium. Aymium is a producer of renewable biocarbon products that replace fossil fuels and reduce emissions in large global industries, including new electric arc furnace steel industry. We have an actionable path towards carbon neutrality that is more manageable and we believe considerably less expensive than most of our peers. Our sustainability and carbon reduction strategy is an ongoing journey and we are moving towards the intention to make a positive difference. We plan to continue to address these matters and to play a leadership role moving forward. For those of you that like to track our detailed flat roll shipments for the quarter, hot rolled and Pickled and Oiled shipments were 736,000 tons, cold-rolled shipments were 162,000 tons and coated shipments were 1,065,000 tons. Mark? Emily, one way to look at it from the shift that Mark talked about from going to -- from prime scrap to an upgraded type of obsolete scrap all the way from 65% to 40%. So if that were able to be accomplished with Columbus, Sinton and Butler, if you just make high-level assumptions that generally we would use approximately 20% of pig iron. And then the rest would be more geared toward that prime scrap. If you think about that from a volume perspective, it could be as much as 1.5 million to 2 million tons shifting from prime scrap to higher grade. So if you apply any spread to that. Today, I think Mark mentioned it's like around $170 per ton which is higher than normal. Even if it's $100, $150 per ton, that could be a significant change once -- if all three mills are fully operational. Just as a reminder, from a natural gas perspective, for electric arc furnaces for Steel Dynamics specifically, it isn't a huge part of the cost structure. It ends up being somewhere around 2% or 3% of the cost of manufacturing of steel products. But obviously, there's impact. We're likely to see increasing prices across the spectrum from a natural gas perspective but nothing that we believe is necessarily significantly impractical. And from a power perspective across the spectrum, we're operating in all different grades. And so it's very different. In some areas, we're in the open market and others, we actually have contracts in place. So there should be some escalating prices but nothing that we think will be material at this point. Good morning, David. Just a couple of other points to add to what Mark described. So if you're looking at a backlog for the fabrication business versus the steel business, it's very different. So once a project enters the backlog in our fabrication business, the entire project has been highly engineered and is part of a bigger construction project overall. And if you look at the steel costs that are involved in these large projects that we're participating in, it's really not a large percentage of the entire project. So the customer base, if you will, is not as sensitive to steel pricing as one would think. I mean I think you saw that in the first quarter where even though flat rolled steel prices had a couple of months of weakening that didn't change at all what we were putting in the order backlog at our fabrication business. And so that's one thing. The second thing is because our backlog is out much longer than it typically is, we typically would see a backlog of maybe four to six months. Now it's out and that would be a very good backlog. I mean now we're out into -- well into 2023. And so we changed some of the contract terms as well to try to ensure there's more security and what I would say is more visibility and certainty around the backlog. So we believe that we have a great deal of visibility. We know where we're pricing today and Mark mentioned in his notes that, that forward pricing is higher than what we even realized at this point in time. And that's why I had the confidence in my notes to say that we expect earnings from the fabrication business to continue to increase throughout 2022. And so, I'm not sure if there's no specific you asked about pass-throughs of costs, specific surcharges, etcetera, like you might see in some of the steel businesses in fabrication. But all of that, once it hits the backlog, it's already guaranteed from a price perspective. So I'll just pause on that and see if Mark and I have addressed your question. Sure, David. I would tell you that -- and I can't answer you specifically at this point but what I would tell you is that it's certainly not what the last five years were because Mark pointed to some structural changes within the industry itself from consolidation and other avenues as well as the construction market itself and what it's doing. So there has been some structural change which I think will make that normalized earnings moving forward are higher than we've seen historically as well as what we've done internally. The fabrication team has really done an incredible job. And I know that you've been to some of our operations and we're looking to further automate and to do some really exciting things in the future as well. But also not what we're experiencing today from a normalized level. There are some specific things that happened and with extended steel prices with a very strong construction market, we think that market will continue. I mean specific to there's a large concentration in warehouses at this point. but we will do our best in the future to try to give you a little better idea of what normalized might look like. Mark, the question Seth asked relates to pricing around raw materials and what we're seeing kind of in the near term and longer term for scrap and maybe for pig iron? So from a fairs perspective, the shipments were down in the first quarter. It wasn't structural per se. It had to do with where raw material inventories were at the end of the year, heading into the first quarter. There were some mill outages during the first quarter as well. Heading forward is when traditionally, you're going to see seasonality kick in and based on where we see steel demand and how that translates then into raw material demand as well, we would expect to see increasing volumes second and third quarter for mill recycling. Just to add to what Mark is saying, if you think about it, you have to have the architecture and the firms the customers are willing to design at some extent, for your products, etcetera. So it's not something that someone can just get involved and have all the constituents know you right off the bat, Mark said that incredibly well. That was very short response. From the perspective of guidance for CapEx for this year, we're still tracking around $750 million and your question was specific to Sinton. And specific to it, we don't expect anything of significance for digital CapEx related to the delays, there was additional expense which you saw flow through the first quarter already due to the delay in just manpower and maintenance of things associated with that delay but not from a capital perspective. So for Sinton we're still at that $2 billion mark which honestly is incredible, given what the teams have gone through for them to be able to maintain their budget while being able to make it through COVID and whatnot and everything else. So we're not expecting anything for the rest of the year in addition from a Sinton perspective for capital. And Curt, in addition to what Mark said and we're getting a lot of excitement from this from customers of those customers that are on site is that it removes a considerable amount as the greenhouse gas is associated with delivery and movement of material and we'll be able to take their scrap as well. So it's almost a perfect closed-loop environment that heretofore really hasn't been available. So it will be interesting to see how that develops from a marketing perspective as well. Fairly fast. From the second, working capital. One big draw which I'll just reiterate, even though I had it in my opening comments is that we do pay our company-wide profit sharing in March of every year -- the following year. So there was a $360 million payment to the profit sharing which we're fairly excited to be able to provide that for the retirement of our teams. It's based, as you know, on 8% of pretax earnings. And -- so that was a big part of the lever. The other piece of it really related to fabrication and customer account values and volumes. And it was really less to do with inventory. So inventory was fairly flat. Specifically as it relates to Sinton, Sinton isn't in a building working capital mode. So it increases working capital in the first quarter, somewhere around $150 million to $200 million. You'll see that continue. It might be another $100 million to $150 million in the second quarter and third quarter combined. And then we should really be reaching that capacity point outside of any big movements in inventory valuation itself or in customer evaluations themselves for Sinton. From a consolidated perspective, moving throughout the year, again, we're heading into a seasonally strong environment, second and third quarter. I don't -- you're not going to see as big of a build as we saw in the first quarter because you don't have the same movement in payables and accruals. So I would say it's going to be muted, then likely you'll see some working capital give back in third and fourth quarter."

And now, I’m pleased to turn the call over to Mark.\nMark Millett: Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for being with us on our fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings call. As you saw on our release, our teams achieved a strong annual 2023 financial and operational performance. I think most gratifying was achieving our best safety year with the lowest recordable incident rate ever. I want to applaud and congratulate all the teams because that it was a monumental effort put into get it. Steel shipments were record 12.8 million tons. I think, it needs to be emphasized that we've got 3 million tons yet of additional shipping capability to leverage. We have the second best year for revenues at $18.8 billion and cash flow from operations of $3.5 billion. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.7 billion. I think, the year clearly demonstrated the through cycle earnings resilience of our business model. It's manifest by a diverse value add product portfolio supported by a superior operating culture, driving world class low cost operations. I can be more pleased at Sinton. Sinton is showing significant operating improvement was EBITDA positive in December, with a clear path to profitability in the first quarter of 2024 and thereafter. We're also achieving fast paced progress on our aluminum flat rolled investments. There continues to be strong commercial support for a new and innovative supply chain solution from Steel Dynamics. So the aluminum industry is considering a well-known and highly regarded metals producer. I'm incredibly proud of the Steel Dynamics team. They're the foundation of our company and they drive our success. And to be honest, they inspire me. Feeling they were esprit de core and commitment to the SDI family during the recent holiday parties was absolutely just simply humbling. And that is why we were so focused on providing the very best for their health, safety and welfare. They're actively engaged in safety at all times and at every level, keeping it top of mind in an active conversation each and every day. As I already suggested, with that focus, the team's safety performance was a record low incident rate in 2023. Obviously, though there's more to do, we will not rest until we consistently achieve our goal of zero injuries. So that said, I will hand it to Theresa, who will then bet the ball to Barry and then back to me to finish up. So Theresa?\nTheresa Wagler : Thank you, Mark. Good morning everyone. Thank you for being with us today. In addition to the achievements Mark just mentioned, the teams also achieved our third best year for operating income of $3.2 billion and net income of $2.5 billion or $14.64 per diluted share. Cash flow from operations and liquidity of $3.5 billion and a three year after tax return on invested capital of 32%. A truly great performance, my sincere thank you and congratulations to our entire team. As for the fourth quarter of 2023, net income was $424 million, or $2.61 per diluted share with adjusted EBITDA of $659 million. Fourth quarter 2023 revenues of $4.2 billion, an operating income of $519 million were lower than sequential third quarter results driven by seasonally lower volume and realized steel and steel fabrication pricing. Our steel operations generated operating income of $365 million in the fourth quarter lower than sequential third quarter results due to lower realized flat rolled Steel pricing. Our steel shipments remain steady at 3.1 million tons. Our four new flat rolled coating lines have or will begin operating this quarter, increasing our higher margin value added product mix by an additional 1 million tons, making our capacity in value added and flat roll at 7 million tons on the coating lines. For the full year of 2023, operating income from our steel operations was $1.9 billion with record annual shipments of 12.8 million tons. For those of you that track our flat rolled shipments in more specificity, hot rolled coil and P&O shipments were 927,000 tons. Cold rolled shipments, 124,000 tons and coated shipments of 1,192,000 tons. For metals recycling fourth quarter operating income was $6 million due to seasonally lower volume in nonferrous metal spread compression. For the full year, operating income from our metals recycling operations was $108 million lower than prior year results based on decreased ferrous scrap pricing more than offsetting higher volume. We're the largest nonferrous and ferrous metals recycler in all of North America, recycling aluminum, copper, and other metals. The team continues to lever our circular manufacturing operating model, providing high quality, low cost scrap to our steel mills, which improves furnace efficiency and reduces company-wide working capital. Our steel fabrication operations achieved operating income of $250 million in the fourth quarter, lower than sequential third quarter results, yet historically strong due to lower pricing and seasonally lower shipments. Our steel fabrication platform had another great year in 2023 with operating income of $1.6 billion. Congratulations to the team. Our steel joists and deck demand remained solid with good order activity. Our backlog extends through the first half of 2024 and forward pricing remains strong. Infrastructure Inflation Reduction Act, the DOE decarbonization support and manufacturing onshoring are expected to support domestic fixed asset investment and related flat and long product steel consumption and related joists and deck consumption as well. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we generated strong cash flow from operations of $865 million. For the full year, we achieved our second best annual cash flow of $3.5 billion. Our cash generation is consistently strong based on our differentiated circular business model and highly variable low cost structure. At the end of the year, we had liquidity of $3.5 billion. During 2023, we invested $1.7 billion in capital investments, of which almost 60% related to the construction of our aluminum flat rolled investments. For 2024, we believe capital investments will be in the range of $2 billion, of which approximately $1.4 billion relates to aluminum investments. During the fourth quarter, we maintained our cash dividend at $0.425 per common share after increasing at 25% in the first quarter of 2023. During the full year of 2023, we paid cash dividends of $271 million and repurchased $1.5 billion or 8% of our outstanding shares, representing a 62% net income shareholder distribution rate. The Board also authorized an additional $1.5 billion share repurchase program in November, and $1.4 billion remained available at the end of the year. Since 2017, we've increased our cash dividend per share by 174%, and we've repurchased $5.5 billion of our common stock or 37% of our outstanding shares. These actions reflect the strength of our capital foundation and consistently strong cash flow generation capability and the continued optimism and confidence in our future. Our capital allocation strategy. Prioritizes high return growth with shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that's complimented with the variable share of purchase program, while we remain dedicated to preserving our investment grade credit designation. Our free cash flow profile has fundamentally changed over the last five years from an annual average of $540 million to $2.8 billion. We are squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable, optimized long-term value creation. Our three-year after-tax return on invested capital of 32% as a testament to our profitable growth. Sustainability is also a significant part of our long-term value creation strategy, and we're dedicated to our people, our communities, and our environment. We're committed to operating our business with the highest integrity. We have an actionable path forward to carbon neutrality that has more manageable and we believe considerably less expensive, that then lay ahead for many of our industry peers. Our sustainability and carbon reduction strategy is an ongoing journey, and we're moving forward with the intention to make a positive difference. Thank you for your time this morning, Barry?\nBarry Schneider : Thanks, Theresa. Our steel fabrication operations performed exceptionally well throughout 2023, achieving historically strong earnings. At the end of the year, our steel joists and deck order backlog was solid extending to the first half of 2024. We continued to have high expectations for the business, continued onshoring and manufacturing, coupled with infrastructure spending and fixed asset investment related to the IRA programs could continue to provide momentum for additional construction spending. Equally important, our customers tell us demand remains solid and share our optimism. Current pricing is stabilized at historically higher levels and order entry has improved. Fabrication platform provides meaningful volume support for our steel mills, critical and softer demand environments, allowing for higher through cycle steel utilization compared to our peers. It also helps mitigate the financial risk of lower steel prices. Our metals recycling operations also perform well this year, considering the challenge of declining scrap prices throughout much of 2023. The North American Geographic footprint of our metals recycling platform provides a strategic competitive advantage for our steel mills and for our scrap generating customers. Particular our Mexican locations competitively advantage our Columbus and Sinton raw material positions. They will strategically support aluminum scrap procurement for our future flat rolled aluminum investments. Our metals recycling team is also partnering even more closely with both our steel and aluminum teams to expand our scrap separation capabilities through process and technology solutions. This will help mitigate potential prime fair scrap supply issues in the future. It will also provide us with significant advantage to materially increase recycled content for our aluminum flat roll products and increase the earnings opportunities. The steel team had another strong year achieving record volume of 12.8 million tons. During 2023, the domestic steel industry operated at an estimated production utilization rate of 76%, while our steel mills operated at a rate of 93% excluding the Sinton plant. We consistently operate a higher utilization due to our value added steel product diversification, our differentiated customer supply chain, and the support of our internal manufacturing businesses. This higher through cycle utilization of all our steel mills is a key competitive advantage, supporting our strong and growing cash generation capability and best-in-class financial metrics. Regarding the steel markets, steel pricing improved in the fourth quarter 2023 and into January. Customer order entry rate has been strong and lead times have been extended, while their inventory levels remained at historically low amounts. In fact, our flat wheel steel operations have experienced one of the strongest order entry environments in January, especially for our value added products. Additionally, steel imports have generally remained at a manageable level with expectations of this to continue. As Sinton and the team has achieved significant improvements in operating efficiency and consistency. They average about 65% of capability in November, December, and have been running even stronger rates here in January. We are planning for Sinton additional improvements in production after the team makes changes to certain transformers at the end of this first quarter, 2024, while we allow access to a 100% of our mill capacity versus the current 80% capacity. Additionally, the two new value added coating lines will begin operating in the first quarter, supporting increased volume and margins. Regarding the steel market environment, automotive production estimates for 2024 or estimated 16 million units, while automotive dealer inventories remain below historical norms. Non-residential construction remains solid as evidenced by the strength of shipments and backlogs at our structural rail division, and customer inventory levels are low. Additionally, onshoring and infrastructure spending should provide meaningful support to fixed asset investment in related construction oriented projects in the coming years. As for the energy market, oil and gas activity is strong, driving approved orders for OCTG and solar, those areas all grow. Looking forward, we are optimistic regarding steel demand and pricing dynamics for 2024. With that, Mark?\nMark Millett : Thanks Barry. Thanks Theresa. I think, our consistently strong through cycle operating and financial performance continues to support our cash generation and growth investment strategies. As Barry mentioned, the four value add flat roll steel coating lines are starting this quarter, and Sinton should see a step function improvement hitting its stride in the second quarter of this year. Our aluminum growth strategy is especially compelling, responses from existing and new customers across all markets remain incredible, only strengthening as we move forward. Many customers have already indicated they would like to build facilities on our rolling mill site in Columbus, Mississippi, and this core location strategy provides a sustainably competitive model for all of us, conserving time, money, and reducing emissions across the supply chain and has already proven itself clearly in Sinton. The project itself was 650,000 metric ton aluminum flat rolled facility located in Columbus, Mississippi. It's going to be a state-of-the-art plant, obviously, serving the sustainable beverage and packaging both the ore body and then TAM, automotive and industrial sectors. Roughly 300,000 metric tons of Canstar, which is about 45% of the output roughly 200,000 tons of auto and 150,000 metric tons of industrial and construction products. The onsite metal cast slab capability of 600,000 metric tons will be supported by two satellite recycled aluminum slab casting centers located in UBC scrap rich regions, one in West, and one in Central Mexico. The expanded product scope is including additional scrap processing and treatment to maximize aluminum recycled content. Our plans are on schedule, rolling mill should be mid-'25, the Mexico slab center at the end of '24, and then Arizona slab center around mid-'25. The total project cost, as you saw in the release, including the recycled slab centers has risen to $2.7 billion. The installation cost for the rolling mill has expanded due to inflationary installation costs that we are all facing. So with virtually all equipment and construction contracts complete, we are confident in this final budget. As we've said before, 100% to be funded with cash. And the expectation is to have a through cycle annual EBITDA of around $650 million to $700 million from the [aluminum] facility with an additional $40 million to $50 million from [indiscernible]. I think we're definitely going to see superior financial metrics relative to our competition. The -- as we see it, the market environment is similar to the domestic steel industry when we started SDI 30 years ago, other assets, little reinvestment, heavy legacy costs with inefficient high-cost operations. We're confident, we can emulate the performance-driven high-efficiency, low-cost model that drove our success in steel to drive superior financial metrics. Our organizational mill structure to just advanced layout and technology and our performance-driven sort of speed core culture will drive a census of around about 750 people versus typically 2,000 or more in a similar competitor out there. We will have higher yield through the system. We will leverage OmniSource's market position and their separation technologies to ensure higher recycled content. We obviously won't have the legacy burden that others have. We will have production cost efficiencies and along with the customer co-location. In the end, we also have a preferred sustainability profile. If you put it all together, we're confident that our earnings profile is going to be far superior to the industry today. We've developed the best financial metrics in the steel industry. And as I said, we have confidence we can do the same in aluminum. We're poised for continued growth. We have an additional 3 million tons, as I said earlier, have shipping capability that will be leveraged through our new processing lines, new products and new supply chains. And we are on passion by our future growth plans as they will continue to drive the high return growth momentum we have consistently demonstrated over the years. We have the highest average five year after-tax return on invested capital within the S&P 500 materials companies. In the last three years, we had an average after-tax ROIC of 32%. I'm going to say that just doesn't happen. Our disciplined, intentional organic and acquisition strategy focused on differentiated value-added supply chain solutions is providing sustainable cash generation and strong returns. I continue to be optimistic moving forward. I believe the market dynamics are in place to support increased demand across our operating platforms in 2024 and the years ahead. North America will benefit from continued onshoring and manufacturing businesses. And the U.S. will benefit from the allocation of public monies from the infrastructure program, Inflation Reduction Act and other public programs. Fuel dynamics is levered to benefit from those programs through increased steel joists and deck demand, flat and long product steel demand and the associated higher demand for recycled scrap and aluminum. In closing, there is no doubt our teams are our foundation. And I thank each of them for their passion and dedication. We're committed to them. And I remind those listening today that safety for yourselves, your families and each other is the highest priority. Our culture and business model continue to positively differentiate our performance, leading to best-in-class financial metrics. We are no longer a pure steel company, but an integrated metals business providing enhanced supply chain solutions to the industry and, in turn, mitigating volatility in cash flow generation through all market cycles. We're competitively positioned and continue to focus on providing superior value for our company, customers, team members and shareholders alike. We look forward to creating new opportunities for everyone, today and the years ahead. So with that said, Holly, I would love for you to open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question for today is coming from Martin Englert with Seaport Research.\nMartin Englert: Quick question on steel conversion. Costs were estimated around $5.30 per ton in the fourth quarter and kind of average around there for the year. Looking ahead at 1Q, taking that point of reference into account, should we expect some decline there based on the ramping of Sinton further and some better fixed cost leverage?\nTheresa Wagler: As the way that the information that you guys can use to back into our conversion costs, I know it's a little difficult, but you hit the primary driver with Sinton and ramping up as significantly as we're expecting them to do in the first quarter and as they are doing right now in January already, we would expect to see that overall as you calculate it conversion costs come down absent any other factors, correct?\nMartin Englert: Okay. And any goalpost as far as when we think about what that could potentially decline on a sequential basis? And I understand there might be other offsets there with substrate that's flowing kind of flowing through there as well. But.\nTheresa Wagler: No, it is really hard for us to give you guidance, as you know, Martin, as it relates to the conversion costs as you're calculating it. As conversion costs really stand within the steel operations themselves, the two conversion costs are very stable. We don't expect to see a lot of movement except for Sinton again because of the additional volumes. The substrate does have an impact, as you mentioned, but we don't expect to see that mix of processing versus production be dramatically different in the first quarter.\nMartin Englert: Okay. If I could one follow-up on steel fabrication in the release, you noted improved activity as well as well price backlog extending through first half of '24. On average, is the backlog price higher or lower than the fourth quarter ASP of $3,500 per ton?\nTheresa Wagler: Martin, the backlog prices held in very steadily. There's not a dramatic difference. And again, we don't give specific sense to the backlog pricing for fabrication or for other operations. But the resiliency and the price, both what we're seeing now and in that backlog is very steady.\nMark Millett: I would just add, in the fourth quarter, and our belief is that the fabrication is kind of troughed in large part. But in the fourth quarter, we had the highest order input rate of the prior six quarters. So volumes are -- will turn. Obviously, you've got a little seasonality in Q1, but the expectation is things will go upward thereafter.\nMartin Englert: Your comment on you believe that its trough, does that pertain to volumes or price or volumes and price?\nMark Millett: I would say that for sure, volume and pricing appears to have stabilized.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Tristan Gresser with BNP Paribas.\nTristan Gresser: The first one is kind of a follow-up on the fabrication guidance, maybe on the volumes. If we look at the shipments you had in Q4, it's probably the lowest fab shipments we've seen in five years, and you mentioned you've seen that trough, but could you explain a little bit what is been holding you back there of late. And if we look at 2024, what kind of growth expectation do you foresee for the business? I know you provided some guidance last year on a half-on-half basis. So anything there would be helpful. That would be my first question.\nMark Millett: I guess, I would just leave it as already stated, the order input rate increased in Q4. That will flow through this year. You all have as you -- I know you appreciate sort of seasonality in this first quarter with the winter months and construction being a little inhibited by the weather. But I think we will certainly see a turn into the second quarter and through the rest of the year.\nTristan Gresser: All right. That's fair. And my second question is more on the CapEx hikes or the project budget hikes. I think you mentioned the aluminum, but I think the biocarbon project also the CapEx has been high. So what drove that? And when we look at this, let's say, $300 million budget hike versus prior, how should it be spread out between 2024 and 2025. I know you provided some insight on the budget for 2024, around $2 billion but there is a significant drop in consensus expectation into 2025. So it'd be helpful to get a sense of how much is flowing into 2025 for those projects? And also, do you -- when you look at this elevated CapEx budget for next year and your expectation for your several businesses, do you expect to be free cash flow positive for 2024?\nTheresa Wagler: Thanks, Tristan. So the biocarbon project hasn't increased in cost. It's stayed put. It stayed the same. It's $260 million. We did expect at one point in time to possibly get some tax credits that became unavailable once the definitions kind of became more precise from the administration. But otherwise, the capital cost of $260 million remains what we thought it would be. And that project is still online to be completed and to start before the end of 2024 which, as a reminder, is incredibly additive to our decarbonization path, and it's going to really help our customer base as you look at the carbon content across our steel operations with the benefit of using the biocarbon. So incredibly excited and the team is doing a fantastic job in Mississippi getting that up and running. So that will be spent primarily in 2024. And that $2 billion is a number that I would have given you last quarter as well. So that stayed the same for total CapEx in 2024. As it relates to the aluminum project, most of the incremental and it rounded to $200 million, but it was less than that in actuality. But most of that will be spent in 2024. So I gave you the spend for aluminum of about $1.4 billion. This year, and it would be our expectation. And then there would be a trailing, call it, $150 million to $200 million remaining to be spent in 2025 related to the aluminum projects. And so really nothing significant has changed on the capital front, except for that incremental addition in the aluminum project itself -- I'm sorry, I forgot, I had to look at my notes. You asked a lot of questions, Tristan. The last one was related to consensus for 2025. And I would just -- and free cash flow. I would just point out for everyone on the call. So for the last two years, unfortunately, Sinton has been negative from an EBITDA perspective. And Mark said on the call this morning that we will be EBITDA positive in the first quarter and thereafter, that's a significant swing in just earnings itself just as it relates to the ramp-up of Sinton. In addition to that, you have the four value-add flat roll lines that are coming online in 2024, which are significant additional opportunity for contribution to earnings on the value-added side as well as that's where the demand is today is in the painted products and the Galvalume products. And then if you couple that with the fact that we've been increasing and will continue to increase volumes in our metals recycling segment, both related to the collection of nonferrous scrap, specifically aluminum and to help service our steel mills on the ferrous side of the equation. And then finally, in 2025, we will be starting our aluminum mill, midyear is the current forecast. So that's contributing to earnings, as Mark mentioned, not we believe through cycle earnings of $650 million to $700 million. So I think everybody maybe needs to take a step back and kind of look at the opportunities that we have from an earnings perspective. And yes, we do expect to generate cash in 2024, and we expect to continue -- we plan to continue with our share repurchase program.\nMark Millett: Just one added point. Although we are disappointed with the CapEx creep there at Sinton. We are very, very confident -- I mean, sorry, sorry, in Columbus aluminum. We're confident that that's the final creep, but it has no impact to schedule. To be honest, it is going at a breadth taking place, absolutely phenomenal job by the team down there. And there's no doubt we'll be up and running midyear of '25.\nOperator: The next question for today is coming from Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley.\nCarlos De Alba: My question is on the aluminum project. I don't know if you could maybe give a little bit of color as to what extent have you been able to contract some of the volumes that will come online in mid-2025? And what type of pricing mechanism or structure even at just high level and on a qualitative basis, have you been able to use to implement in those contracts, if you have done so?\nMark Millett: Thank you, Carlos. The commercial team, in all honesty, has only been put together over the last, I would say, two months. They're very, very active with our customer base and all honestly, we all are at every level. And the reception is incredibly high. And I would suggest that we have total confidence that we're going to be able to support the ramp-up in '25 into '26.\nCarlos De Alba: And if I may ask on the -- what is the expected ramp-up and EBITDA contribution for the four quarter lines? I mean, I think two of them will start in the first quarter.\nTheresa Wagler: As far as the ramp-up, I'll let Barry address how quickly they ramp up. I would tell you from a financial perspective, the coating lines, they are in totality, all four, around $600 million and they tend to have a 2.5 to 3-year payback. So it's very nice returns.\nBarry Schneider: Yes, this is Barry. I'd just like to add the teams, the personnel are in place. They've been training, building the lines. That's our culture to be part of the construction. So the teams are already very familiar with the equipment. Two of the lines have actually run first coils, one at Heartland, the paint line and a coating line down in Sinton. So that's great news. That's always exhilarating for the teams to get that point. The next two lines are in hot commissioning now, and we anticipate those running first coils in the March time frame. So the ramp-up, keep product for them, we're pretty aggressive in what we do typically, and we anticipate these will be contributing to our customers here in the near future. I envision prime sales in Q1 from the two lines that have run first coils, and we see all four of the lines making and shipping salable goods into the marketplace in Q2. So we anticipate our experience and our culture will allow these startups to be very, very seamless. And we're very responsible to our customers to make sure the product that's leaving is nothing less than the best they expect from us.\nMark Millett: When you think about the four lines or particularly the two lines in Sinton, obviously, it's going to expand our value-add sort of product portfolio down there and enhance the margin directly there. But as importantly, it will allow us to fully utilize the downstream lines. So yes, the team has done a phenomenal job on the hot side. The -- you're going to see great gains there through increased utilization. As Barry said, we're knocking on 75% utilization today in January and 80% is right around the corner. But downstream, when you take that product, you pickle it, you put it through the time mill and other lines. Having the additional what is 300,000, 400,000 tons of downstream. That's going to allow probably loading of those downstream lines and obviously a dilution of the cost structure. So it's a very, very important and effective impact to some here in the next three or four or five months.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research.\nTimna Tanners: I wanted to ask about -- I wanted to follow -up and just -- I know you mentioned that you thought volumes had hit bottom and prices were stabilizing. Do we have kind of the effect of the higher price from the -- into the fourth quarter hitting in the first quarter? Or is that more of a second quarter phenomenon? So that was my first question -- asking about costs from throughput from the hot-rolled side.\nTheresa Wagler: Okay. Yes. So [indiscernible] though, you were talking about fabrication, you're actually talking about flat roll. So the -- we're operating contract business lagging, let's call it, two to three months. So the increased pricing that we saw in flat roll in the fourth quarter is going to be benefiting the first quarter from a contract perspective. And the 80% is -- it's really been pretty consistent all year for the flat roll operations. So we'll see that benefit Q1.\nTimna Tanners: Okay. That's actually really helpful, but I was asking about fabrication and the throughput of flat-rolled price increases and the impact on margins on downstream. So if you could actually answer that as well, that would be great.\nTheresa Wagler: Sorry, I'll get this right eventually. From a cost perspective for the substrate for fabrication, they tend to have anywhere between call it, eight to ten weeks of inventory on the ground. That's the same thing that they would have had coming into the first quarter. So you're going to see some of that incremental price hike in the first quarter but you would have seen some of it in the fourth quarter as well.\nTimna Tanners: And then if I could, just one last one. I know Barry talked about and Mark talked about customer inventories being low. So I just don't understand that because I know that at least SMU actually had some really high inventories for December. So is that just not aligned with what you're seeing? Or can you help me understand why the difference of narrative there?\nBarry Schneider: Well, Timna, this is Barry. I think a lot of our relationships, especially with the galvanized and the pain at are very directly with customers. So we see our supply chains still needing to fill orders at a really good rate. So the MSCI inventories still are traditionally pretty low. But more to the point or specific OEM relationships are still pulling tons from us. And when we have conversations, the lead times haven't changed at all with a vast majority of the business we do that is on these contract relationships. So I think what we're seeing out there and the nature of our inquiries make us feel like that there is a real demand out there still underneath everything we're doing.\nMark Millett: And just to add to that. I think generally, we believe we are just very, very constructive for 2024 relative to steel demand. And everyone gets a little excited by maybe a little backing off of hot-band pricing here of late. But for us, flat roll continues to be very, very solid. And maybe the macro indicators may not be overly constructive right now. The order input rate in January for us has been incredibly strong. And we would, as Barry said, suggest that supply chain inventories, not just MSCI or SMU, but just supply chain in general is relatively tight. And imports are not a material factor today and won't be. We're booked out for coated and prepayment, right? It's very, very strong for us. And I think the -- again, when you look at the -- just the hot band pricing because coated, prepaint is all very, very, very strong still. It's just like recent cycles, and its more emotion than anything else, but you get that steep climb. You have exuberance hence to overshoot the market a little bit, and it just sort of retrenches itself a little bit. And I think that's where we are today. And it's not a signal as it used to be. It's not a signal as the underlying -- the structural underlying demand because there's so little spot material transacted today. Just because you have a slight erosion in hot band price, it doesn't mean to say that that's reflective of where the demand is. So for us, demand is, as I said, very, very solid throughout our sheet mills. And I also see that long products is in a very, very solid territory. Would like to congratulate the team. They had record earnings and record volumes in 2023. They've done an incredible job. They've changed the commercial approach somewhat. They've expanded their product portfolio, and that's going to support higher through-cycle volumes going forward for the long product platform as well. So I think for us, [indiscernible] quite rosy.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Curt Woodworth with UBS.\nCurtis Woodworth: Just wanted to follow-up on the fab pricing dynamic. I think at the start or maybe at the end of the first quarter of '23, you talked about pricing in the back half of the year being down 10% to 15%, and you came in down 22%. And then I think for now two quarters in a row, you have talked about price stabilization. And obviously, you mentioned the order entry getting better. So would you be willing to provide any directional color on pricing? Like should we assume that the first half -- that the backlog you've priced for the first half of this year is somewhat similar to where you were in the fourth quarter, which would be consistent with kind of what you've said in the past two quarters, that pricing has stabilized?\nMark Millett: Well, I never do well in Vegas. So I don't think that given a projection is solid projection is perhaps sorry -- perhaps right. But directionally, I do believe, again, that the underlying structural demand is there. If you look at -- literally the last 18 to 24 months, you've seen these hot band pricing cycles, and they have not been driven by demand. They've been driven by motion, whether it be the threat or the anticipation of high interest rates and inflation and recession and all these sorts of things. They've been emotional pivots as opposed to demand for us. And all we can say is that we do believe strongly that the underlying demand is going to be sustained through the year, and that should support pricing.\nCurtis Woodworth: Okay. And then in terms of -- I think you noted the order entry in fab was the highest you've seen in the past six quarters, which is a pretty healthy statement. So I'm just curious, like what's driving that? A lot of the data we've seen in terms of warehouse starts is still somewhat negative. I know data centers is growing in other areas. But how do you characterize kind of the composition of your end market composition of fabrication demand today versus maybe how that looked 18 months ago.\nTheresa Wagler: Here you may have additional commentary as well, but we're seeing a lot of incremental demand on the manufacturing side. We've been talking about onshoring that is actually happening, and that does have a good impact on the steel joists and deck market. We're also seeing a lot of activity in the education side as well as in the, I'll call it, pharma or health care. And then anecdotally, you have to separate warehouses from data centers. We're continuing to see really good strength in the data center arena as well. Barry, I don't know if there's anything I'm missing.\nBarry Schneider: No, I'd just say that the mix is -- it's a good mix for them on the engineering side of the business to keep up with their lead times. So it -- isn't substantially different than the typical business flow that comes through it's small changes in the segments that we're serving through fabrication.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Katja Jancic with BMO.\nKatja Jancic: Just quickly on the aluminum segment, you started disclosing the operating loss. Can you provide some color how we should think about the cost there over the next few quarters or how it should impact you?\nTheresa Wagler: Katja, we did break out. So aluminum, because of the investment size, we will have a separate segment going forward. The -- we can't really give you projections on start-up losses. We expect them during 2024 to not be of significant size, and you will be able to see them. The one thing I'd note that you should recognize though, it's kind of an odd thing that's required from an accounting perspective, but those start-up losses actually get reflected in our SG&A amount. So if you see SG&A fluctuating, and maybe being higher than it is normally, it's because those start-up losses during construction are actually included in that line.\nKatja Jancic: But is it a fair -- fair to assume that they should come up. I think in the fourth quarter, they were around $11 million? Or is that a fair assumption over the next few quarters?\nTheresa Wagler: We do have a good contingent of people on the ground now. But yes, during the year because we'll be expecting to actually still start up, as Mark said, in mid-2025, you're going to be seeing headcount increase as well as additional construction activity. So yes, you should expect to see those costs rise during 2024.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Alex Hacking with Citi.\nAlexander Hacking : On Sinton, how much of Sinton's output is currently being sold into Mexico, if I remember correctly, you were targeting something like 30% before that mill started up?\nBarry Schneider: Yes, we've had a very good ability to move product into Mexico. We have a very established team down there that's been serviced in our Flat Roll Group for a while, but we added a warehouse capability in Monterrey. And last year, we moved about 600,000 tons into Mexico in various industries altogether. But we're very pleased with how the business is moving. We are welcoming -- being welcomed by the customer base in Mexico. And in many cases, we've had relationships and haven't had the ability to get the tons there. Sinton provides us the opportunity not just through proximity, but through the advanced product features that we have. So we have wider, we have heavier products than we would typically have. And these products are being very well received in the various industries. I would tell you that the continued near-shoring of manufacturing in the United States is very apparent with the investments we see in Mexico and the customer base there. So it continues to go along with our strategy as being a great place to do business, and we're excited about it.\nAlexander Hacking: Thanks, Barry. And then just a follow-up, if I may, on the ally rolling mill. How comfortable are you with your ability to source 900,000 tons of scrap or how much you need. I'm not as familiar with the ally scrap market, but it doesn't seem like there's particularly a lot of excess scrap. And I guess like how much -- just for context, how much does OmniSource handle today, how many tons?\nBarry Schneider: Great question. Obviously, I think we're advantaged by having OmniSource recycled platform because today, not only are they the largest or second largest ferrous scrap recycler that they are clearly the largest nonferrous recycler and they're recycling somewhere around 500 million pounds of aluminum. We also have a secondary aluminum operation here in Fort Wayne that we're making, I don't know, 260 million pounds or thereabouts of secondary aluminum. So we're not -- it's not a new environment for us. I think we've got a great team. We've actually hired some incredible talent to supplement our already incredible talent. And so sourcing the material is not a -- we don't believe a major issue. If you look at our strategy, there are two principal kind of scrap streams, you might say. One is for the automotive industrial base. The other is for Comstock and the UBC scrap is -- well, it's highly available in California. They're a deposit state. So there's a lot of aluminum UBC scrap generated up and down the West Coast, currently either moving to Asia or to the Midwest. And similarly, in Mexico, a sort of a UBC scrap arena, so that's why we're locating two facilities, two satellite facilities in those scrap-rich areas, like the scrap at the source, molded in the freight of then moving big solid slab versus scrap to the Midwest is at around about half the price. And so we're not only advantaging ourselves on the scrap collection side but economically on getting that aluminum to the mill.\nAlexander Hacking: Okay. Just one follow-up, if I may. This is probably a really dumb question, but I assume the facility can handle primary as well, if required.\nMark Millett: We certainly will. And you don't -- because you've got 900,000 tons of just to be clear, of cash need because the yield loss through the system, and when I say yield loss, it's not what we call of loss. This appears is just sort of a circular within the mill, you still only need roughly 650,000 tons of total input, 20% of which is primary.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Bill Peterson with JPMorgan.\nWilliam Peterson: Just on Sinton, I think you mentioned hitting stride in the second quarter. How should we think about utilization for the full year? If I recall correctly, I think you had expected on 80% for the full year at the last quarterly earnings call. Is that still the target? Or should we assume a bit lower?\nMark Millett: It's my target, Barry?\nBarry Schneider: No. We continue to strive for 80%. We the team is doing, as Mark said, a phenomenal job. It's a big challenge of bringing such a big asset up all at once. Transporter problems have been unfortunate, but we have several fixes in the works. Approaching the problem for both resiliency is also is getting back to full power capacity. So we remain confident that the operational levels we're going to see 80% is the target the whole team is aware of. We're all incentive to make that happen.\nMark Millett: And not to complicate the math. But if you think about it in January, we're approaching 75% utilization right now, that's 75% of ultimate even though the team is handcuffed because of the lower power input. So we are quite confident to get to that 80% for the year.\nWilliam Peterson: Okay. We'll plug in 84%. No, just joking. Just on the -- I guess, things like onshore and the infrastructure bill. You said this is an expectation to benefit in 2024. I guess have you seen orders. When do you expect to see orders, should we think of this more as a second half '24 to really kind of benefit you? And then between, I guess, onshoring and infrastructure, specifically, which you've seen being more impactful for you this year?\nMark Millett: Just from a sort of a product mix, so to speak, the infrastructure growth. On the solar, it's already -- the solar has exploded. Renewables exploded last year, continues to grow dramatically. We were advantaged hugely both structural for the TOR tubes and also for flat roll for the support tubing. We're starting to see -- I don't think we can be specific on how that ramps up. But directionally, we're starting to see orders from bridge makers currently. And so that's -- the start, at least from my perspective, the start of a ramp-up in spend.\nBarry Schneider: We also see in the long products, a lot of, let's call it, foundational type structural sales. And even though it's a smaller division, Steel of West Virginia is very, very full with us right now with stuff that is tangential, whether it's solar fields, the support deal that goes in the ground or fork trucks and things like that, that go into these new factories and these new warehouses and data centers. So we do see a good bounce from that. We also see the pipeline industry in the states is picking up orders some cases for carbon sequestration lines as well as some major pipelines. So those markets are awake, and we see a lot of inquiry activity that is very exciting for us ultimately.\nTheresa Wagler: And just I want to encourage that there are some of you on the phone right now that may not understand that the infrastructure program and the IRA and anything related to the roads and bridges and construction, they don't really benefit long products. They benefit long products, they certainly benefit our steel & joist and deck operations. But additionally, the front roll operations have exposure to that as well, whether it's through HVAC systems or pipe and tube, like Barry just mentioned there's a lot of impact on the flat rolled side, and I would encourage you to think about that perspective as well.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from John Tumazos, a private investor.\nJohn Tumazos : Could you give us a little feedback on the potential 2025 CapEx. And with Sinton and the four coating lines in the aluminum and the carbon projects behind us, what are some of the leading candidates for the next capital investments going forward. And in particular, could you talk about growth in recycling where aluminum, copper, zinc have much lower global recycling rates than steel, in particular.\nTheresa Wagler: Yes, we do have projects in mind for 2025. I'm not sure that we're prepared to go into that today. I would say from the perspective of capital spending, as I mentioned earlier on the call, aluminum will probably have a tail of somewhere between, call it, $200 million and $250 million. Our teams are consistently bringing us wonderful ideas that have high returns associated with them. Again, I'll point back to our ROIC. They do a good job of giving us those projects that have really great returns. So the number for 2025, I would say would be a minimum of probably $500 million, something like that, because you do still have some sustaining capital as well, which for us is very low at around $160 million, but there's still some benefit there. Mark, I don't know if you want to add any addition to that?\nMark Millett: [Indiscernible] The deal just to get the CapEx part, not the whole thing. But no, John -- and Theresa has just mentioned, we have an absolutely incredible team that continues to be innovative. And if you were to -- I don't know, just be with us or be with that team. It's incredible. We have a new digital planning technology that we're exploiting, again, not big dollars, but it's going to be an incredibly, incredibly high-margin niche business. We have two -- suffice it to say, two product segments that we're not in today in flat roll that we're exploring and they have a couple of innovative things there. So the pipeline in steel is still there, for sure. I think also -- and we've got to walk before we run. But in aluminum, I see that growth kind of paralleling the growth in steel, yes. We get on the front end, make the basic substrate, so to speak. And then from a processing standpoint, for instance, there's a massive, massive amount of the aluminum that gets prepaid today. That's an expertise of ours. You can see growth and expansion there. So I think you witnessed it, John, almost personally over the years and shared our history, but we've clearly demonstrated the ability to be innovative and grow. I would emphasize grow in a very disciplined, intentional manner. That's the only way you can get the return on invested capital numbers that we achieve. So both organically, but also through acquisition will continue to be opportunity there. But you will see us remain very, very disciplined, very, very intentional. We're not going to overpay for anything, and we're going to retain the best financial metrics in our industry.\nJohn Tumazos : As we build our financial models, if in 2025, the CapEx fell to somewhere, let's just say, for discussion in the range of $500 million to $1 billion, should we be increasing the share buyback dollars from the levels of the last several years given the drop in CapEx?\nTheresa Wagler: So John, we want to be super clear that we see the share buyback program is a very good tool for us to be able to use and you've seen that. So very much the dividend, we've been increasing and we increased it with increases in our structural through-cycle cash flow generation when projects come online and then we do it pretty aggressively. We want to keep that positive momentum. But then we use that share buyback program during periods of excess cash flow when we maybe have less growth in mind, but we still are very much a growth company. To Mark's point, whether that's through greenfield assets or whether that's through acquisitions. But at the same time, we have the luxury that we don't have to sacrifice the share repurchase program. We absolutely can execute on all of those things. And that's what you'll continue to see us do in 2024 and 2025, absent extraneous things.\nJohn Tumazos : Thank you very much. I'm a happy shareholder.\nOperator: Your next question is a follow-up question coming from Martin Englert.\nMartin Englert : I appreciate the time for the follow-up. Just two quick ones here. Over the last four years, seasonal sequential 1Q gain in external steel volumes averaged about 7% quarter-on-quarter based on what you're seeing with order intake in the new year here, and then also taking into account the continued ramp in Sinton and value-added lines. Should we expect something at the core, similar on a sequential basis, around 7% and then layer in the additional volumes from ramping assets.\nTheresa Wagler: Martin, we can't give directionality. Obviously, we had outages in the fourth quarter at two of our steel mills, and we won't have those in the first quarter. We've just mentioned that Sinton's going to be ramping up aggressively in the first quarter. So all in all, absent any significant market moves, you should expect to see incremental volume from our steel operations. And as Barry pointed out, with the additional value-added lines, you're going to start to see that product mix get richer and richer. So it will go more into the processing lines. You'll eventually see some really great spread enhancement throughout the year as well?\nMartin Englert: What were the outages in 4Q? And assume that you mentioned it because it did have an adverse impact on volumes?\nTheresa Wagler: Martin, they weren't -- they were just normal outages. We take outages at our foot roll mills and in our long product mills. They weren't anything that were -- we didn't note them as far as from a volume perspective. But yes, obviously, when you have outages that does impact volume, but there was nothing of significance to note.\nMartin Englert: One last one, if I could, on the aluminum project. Based on the two cycle estimate to give implied EBITDA of around $900 to $1,000 per ton, when you were coming up with that analysis, are you able to share what you think the bottom and top quartile of profitability might look like when we think about peak to trough?\nTheresa Wagler: No, Martin, we're not. We do mid-cycle through cycle. And as we get more familiar, we just -- we don't provide that type of information.\nOperator: That concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for any closing remarks.\nMark Millett: Well, thank you, everyone, and thank you, Holly, and thank you, everyone, on the call. I guess, as John noted, he's a happy shareholder. To be honest, everyone at SDI are happy shareholders because we all are equity holders and as part of the compensation for each and every one of us. Collectively, we do own a reasonable amount of our stock. And I would just emphasize that we treat your dollars just like they are our own. And we're absolutely focused on continuing to outstrip our competition relative to shareholder value creation through the cycle but we can't do it on our own. So any customers listening at thank you for your support. We have loyal support, and it takes us through the cycles suppliers can do it without you and got to stress. We have the best metals team in the world. Our people are absolutely phenomenal. Thank you for what you do each and every day. For those that are owners on the call as well. Thank you for your support. Have a great day. Bye-bye.\nOperator: Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation, and have a great and safe day.",

            "name": "Mark Millett",
            "content": "Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for being with us on our fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings call. As you saw on our release, our teams achieved a strong annual 2023 financial and operational performance. I think most gratifying was achieving our best safety year with the lowest recordable incident rate ever. I want to applaud and congratulate all the teams because that it was a monumental effort put into get it. Steel shipments were record 12.8 million tons. I think, it needs to be emphasized that we've got 3 million tons yet of additional shipping capability to leverage. We have the second best year for revenues at $18.8 billion and cash flow from operations of $3.5 billion. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.7 billion. I think, the year clearly demonstrated the through cycle earnings resilience of our business model. It's manifest by a diverse value add product portfolio supported by a superior operating culture, driving world class low cost operations. I can be more pleased at Sinton. Sinton is showing significant operating improvement was EBITDA positive in December, with a clear path to profitability in the first quarter of 2024 and thereafter. We're also achieving fast paced progress on our aluminum flat rolled investments. There continues to be strong commercial support for a new and innovative supply chain solution from Steel Dynamics. So the aluminum industry is considering a well-known and highly regarded metals producer. I'm incredibly proud of the Steel Dynamics team. They're the foundation of our company and they drive our success. And to be honest, they inspire me. Feeling they were esprit de core and commitment to the SDI family during the recent holiday parties was absolutely just simply humbling. And that is why we were so focused on providing the very best for their health, safety and welfare. They're actively engaged in safety at all times and at every level, keeping it top of mind in an active conversation each and every day. As I already suggested, with that focus, the team's safety performance was a record low incident rate in 2023. Obviously, though there's more to do, we will not rest until we consistently achieve our goal of zero injuries. So that said, I will hand it to Theresa, who will then bet the ball to Barry and then back to me to finish up. So Theresa? Thanks Barry. Thanks Theresa. I think, our consistently strong through cycle operating and financial performance continues to support our cash generation and growth investment strategies. As Barry mentioned, the four value add flat roll steel coating lines are starting this quarter, and Sinton should see a step function improvement hitting its stride in the second quarter of this year. Our aluminum growth strategy is especially compelling, responses from existing and new customers across all markets remain incredible, only strengthening as we move forward. Many customers have already indicated they would like to build facilities on our rolling mill site in Columbus, Mississippi, and this core location strategy provides a sustainably competitive model for all of us, conserving time, money, and reducing emissions across the supply chain and has already proven itself clearly in Sinton. The project itself was 650,000 metric ton aluminum flat rolled facility located in Columbus, Mississippi. It's going to be a state-of-the-art plant, obviously, serving the sustainable beverage and packaging both the ore body and then TAM, automotive and industrial sectors. Roughly 300,000 metric tons of Canstar, which is about 45% of the output roughly 200,000 tons of auto and 150,000 metric tons of industrial and construction products. The onsite metal cast slab capability of 600,000 metric tons will be supported by two satellite recycled aluminum slab casting centers located in UBC scrap rich regions, one in West, and one in Central Mexico. The expanded product scope is including additional scrap processing and treatment to maximize aluminum recycled content. Our plans are on schedule, rolling mill should be mid-'25, the Mexico slab center at the end of '24, and then Arizona slab center around mid-'25. The total project cost, as you saw in the release, including the recycled slab centers has risen to $2.7 billion. The installation cost for the rolling mill has expanded due to inflationary installation costs that we are all facing. So with virtually all equipment and construction contracts complete, we are confident in this final budget. As we've said before, 100% to be funded with cash. And the expectation is to have a through cycle annual EBITDA of around $650 million to $700 million from the [aluminum] facility with an additional $40 million to $50 million from [indiscernible]. I think we're definitely going to see superior financial metrics relative to our competition. The -- as we see it, the market environment is similar to the domestic steel industry when we started SDI 30 years ago, other assets, little reinvestment, heavy legacy costs with inefficient high-cost operations. We're confident, we can emulate the performance-driven high-efficiency, low-cost model that drove our success in steel to drive superior financial metrics. Our organizational mill structure to just advanced layout and technology and our performance-driven sort of speed core culture will drive a census of around about 750 people versus typically 2,000 or more in a similar competitor out there. We will have higher yield through the system. We will leverage OmniSource's market position and their separation technologies to ensure higher recycled content. We obviously won't have the legacy burden that others have. We will have production cost efficiencies and along with the customer co-location. In the end, we also have a preferred sustainability profile. If you put it all together, we're confident that our earnings profile is going to be far superior to the industry today. We've developed the best financial metrics in the steel industry. And as I said, we have confidence we can do the same in aluminum. We're poised for continued growth. We have an additional 3 million tons, as I said earlier, have shipping capability that will be leveraged through our new processing lines, new products and new supply chains. And we are on passion by our future growth plans as they will continue to drive the high return growth momentum we have consistently demonstrated over the years. We have the highest average five year after-tax return on invested capital within the S&P 500 materials companies. In the last three years, we had an average after-tax ROIC of 32%. I'm going to say that just doesn't happen. Our disciplined, intentional organic and acquisition strategy focused on differentiated value-added supply chain solutions is providing sustainable cash generation and strong returns. I continue to be optimistic moving forward. I believe the market dynamics are in place to support increased demand across our operating platforms in 2024 and the years ahead. North America will benefit from continued onshoring and manufacturing businesses. And the U.S. will benefit from the allocation of public monies from the infrastructure program, Inflation Reduction Act and other public programs. Fuel dynamics is levered to benefit from those programs through increased steel joists and deck demand, flat and long product steel demand and the associated higher demand for recycled scrap and aluminum. In closing, there is no doubt our teams are our foundation. And I thank each of them for their passion and dedication. We're committed to them. And I remind those listening today that safety for yourselves, your families and each other is the highest priority. Our culture and business model continue to positively differentiate our performance, leading to best-in-class financial metrics. We are no longer a pure steel company, but an integrated metals business providing enhanced supply chain solutions to the industry and, in turn, mitigating volatility in cash flow generation through all market cycles. We're competitively positioned and continue to focus on providing superior value for our company, customers, team members and shareholders alike. We look forward to creating new opportunities for everyone, today and the years ahead. So with that said, Holly, I would love for you to open it up for questions. I would just add, in the fourth quarter, and our belief is that the fabrication is kind of troughed in large part. But in the fourth quarter, we had the highest order input rate of the prior six quarters. So volumes are -- will turn. Obviously, you've got a little seasonality in Q1, but the expectation is things will go upward thereafter. I would say that for sure, volume and pricing appears to have stabilized. I guess, I would just leave it as already stated, the order input rate increased in Q4. That will flow through this year. You all have as you -- I know you appreciate sort of seasonality in this first quarter with the winter months and construction being a little inhibited by the weather. But I think we will certainly see a turn into the second quarter and through the rest of the year. Just one added point. Although we are disappointed with the CapEx creep there at Sinton. We are very, very confident -- I mean, sorry, sorry, in Columbus aluminum. We're confident that that's the final creep, but it has no impact to schedule. To be honest, it is going at a breadth taking place, absolutely phenomenal job by the team down there. And there's no doubt we'll be up and running midyear of '25. Thank you, Carlos. The commercial team, in all honesty, has only been put together over the last, I would say, two months. They're very, very active with our customer base and all honestly, we all are at every level. And the reception is incredibly high. And I would suggest that we have total confidence that we're going to be able to support the ramp-up in '25 into '26. When you think about the four lines or particularly the two lines in Sinton, obviously, it's going to expand our value-add sort of product portfolio down there and enhance the margin directly there. But as importantly, it will allow us to fully utilize the downstream lines. So yes, the team has done a phenomenal job on the hot side. The -- you're going to see great gains there through increased utilization. As Barry said, we're knocking on 75% utilization today in January and 80% is right around the corner. But downstream, when you take that product, you pickle it, you put it through the time mill and other lines. Having the additional what is 300,000, 400,000 tons of downstream. That's going to allow probably loading of those downstream lines and obviously a dilution of the cost structure. So it's a very, very important and effective impact to some here in the next three or four or five months. And just to add to that. I think generally, we believe we are just very, very constructive for 2024 relative to steel demand. And everyone gets a little excited by maybe a little backing off of hot-band pricing here of late. But for us, flat roll continues to be very, very solid. And maybe the macro indicators may not be overly constructive right now. The order input rate in January for us has been incredibly strong. And we would, as Barry said, suggest that supply chain inventories, not just MSCI or SMU, but just supply chain in general is relatively tight. And imports are not a material factor today and won't be. We're booked out for coated and prepayment, right? It's very, very strong for us. And I think the -- again, when you look at the -- just the hot band pricing because coated, prepaint is all very, very, very strong still. It's just like recent cycles, and its more emotion than anything else, but you get that steep climb. You have exuberance hence to overshoot the market a little bit, and it just sort of retrenches itself a little bit. And I think that's where we are today. And it's not a signal as it used to be. It's not a signal as the underlying -- the structural underlying demand because there's so little spot material transacted today. Just because you have a slight erosion in hot band price, it doesn't mean to say that that's reflective of where the demand is. So for us, demand is, as I said, very, very solid throughout our sheet mills. And I also see that long products is in a very, very solid territory. Would like to congratulate the team. They had record earnings and record volumes in 2023. They've done an incredible job. They've changed the commercial approach somewhat. They've expanded their product portfolio, and that's going to support higher through-cycle volumes going forward for the long product platform as well. So I think for us, [indiscernible] quite rosy. Well, I never do well in Vegas. So I don't think that given a projection is solid projection is perhaps sorry -- perhaps right. But directionally, I do believe, again, that the underlying structural demand is there. If you look at -- literally the last 18 to 24 months, you've seen these hot band pricing cycles, and they have not been driven by demand. They've been driven by motion, whether it be the threat or the anticipation of high interest rates and inflation and recession and all these sorts of things. They've been emotional pivots as opposed to demand for us. And all we can say is that we do believe strongly that the underlying demand is going to be sustained through the year, and that should support pricing. We certainly will. And you don't -- because you've got 900,000 tons of just to be clear, of cash need because the yield loss through the system, and when I say yield loss, it's not what we call of loss. This appears is just sort of a circular within the mill, you still only need roughly 650,000 tons of total input, 20% of which is primary. It's my target, Barry? And not to complicate the math. But if you think about it in January, we're approaching 75% utilization right now, that's 75% of ultimate even though the team is handcuffed because of the lower power input. So we are quite confident to get to that 80% for the year. Just from a sort of a product mix, so to speak, the infrastructure growth. On the solar, it's already -- the solar has exploded. Renewables exploded last year, continues to grow dramatically. We were advantaged hugely both structural for the TOR tubes and also for flat roll for the support tubing. We're starting to see -- I don't think we can be specific on how that ramps up. But directionally, we're starting to see orders from bridge makers currently. And so that's -- the start, at least from my perspective, the start of a ramp-up in spend. [Indiscernible] The deal just to get the CapEx part, not the whole thing. But no, John -- and Theresa has just mentioned, we have an absolutely incredible team that continues to be innovative. And if you were to -- I don't know, just be with us or be with that team. It's incredible. We have a new digital planning technology that we're exploiting, again, not big dollars, but it's going to be an incredibly, incredibly high-margin niche business. We have two -- suffice it to say, two product segments that we're not in today in flat roll that we're exploring and they have a couple of innovative things there. So the pipeline in steel is still there, for sure. I think also -- and we've got to walk before we run. But in aluminum, I see that growth kind of paralleling the growth in steel, yes.

            "name": "Theresa Wagler",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Good morning everyone. Thank you for being with us today. In addition to the achievements Mark just mentioned, the teams also achieved our third best year for operating income of $3.2 billion and net income of $2.5 billion or $14.64 per diluted share. Cash flow from operations and liquidity of $3.5 billion and a three year after tax return on invested capital of 32%. A truly great performance, my sincere thank you and congratulations to our entire team. As for the fourth quarter of 2023, net income was $424 million, or $2.61 per diluted share with adjusted EBITDA of $659 million. Fourth quarter 2023 revenues of $4.2 billion, an operating income of $519 million were lower than sequential third quarter results driven by seasonally lower volume and realized steel and steel fabrication pricing. Our steel operations generated operating income of $365 million in the fourth quarter lower than sequential third quarter results due to lower realized flat rolled Steel pricing. Our steel shipments remain steady at 3.1 million tons. Our four new flat rolled coating lines have or will begin operating this quarter, increasing our higher margin value added product mix by an additional 1 million tons, making our capacity in value added and flat roll at 7 million tons on the coating lines. For the full year of 2023, operating income from our steel operations was $1.9 billion with record annual shipments of 12.8 million tons. For those of you that track our flat rolled shipments in more specificity, hot rolled coil and P&O shipments were 927,000 tons. Cold rolled shipments, 124,000 tons and coated shipments of 1,192,000 tons. For metals recycling fourth quarter operating income was $6 million due to seasonally lower volume in nonferrous metal spread compression. For the full year, operating income from our metals recycling operations was $108 million lower than prior year results based on decreased ferrous scrap pricing more than offsetting higher volume. We're the largest nonferrous and ferrous metals recycler in all of North America, recycling aluminum, copper, and other metals. The team continues to lever our circular manufacturing operating model, providing high quality, low cost scrap to our steel mills, which improves furnace efficiency and reduces company-wide working capital. Our steel fabrication operations achieved operating income of $250 million in the fourth quarter, lower than sequential third quarter results, yet historically strong due to lower pricing and seasonally lower shipments. Our steel fabrication platform had another great year in 2023 with operating income of $1.6 billion. Congratulations to the team. Our steel joists and deck demand remained solid with good order activity. Our backlog extends through the first half of 2024 and forward pricing remains strong. Infrastructure Inflation Reduction Act, the DOE decarbonization support and manufacturing onshoring are expected to support domestic fixed asset investment and related flat and long product steel consumption and related joists and deck consumption as well. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we generated strong cash flow from operations of $865 million. For the full year, we achieved our second best annual cash flow of $3.5 billion. Our cash generation is consistently strong based on our differentiated circular business model and highly variable low cost structure. At the end of the year, we had liquidity of $3.5 billion. During 2023, we invested $1.7 billion in capital investments, of which almost 60% related to the construction of our aluminum flat rolled investments. For 2024, we believe capital investments will be in the range of $2 billion, of which approximately $1.4 billion relates to aluminum investments. During the fourth quarter, we maintained our cash dividend at $0.425 per common share after increasing at 25% in the first quarter of 2023. During the full year of 2023, we paid cash dividends of $271 million and repurchased $1.5 billion or 8% of our outstanding shares, representing a 62% net income shareholder distribution rate. The Board also authorized an additional $1.5 billion share repurchase program in November, and $1.4 billion remained available at the end of the year. Since 2017, we've increased our cash dividend per share by 174%, and we've repurchased $5.5 billion of our common stock or 37% of our outstanding shares. These actions reflect the strength of our capital foundation and consistently strong cash flow generation capability and the continued optimism and confidence in our future. Our capital allocation strategy. Prioritizes high return growth with shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that's complimented with the variable share of purchase program, while we remain dedicated to preserving our investment grade credit designation. Our free cash flow profile has fundamentally changed over the last five years from an annual average of $540 million to $2.8 billion. We are squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable, optimized long-term value creation. Our three-year after-tax return on invested capital of 32% as a testament to our profitable growth. Sustainability is also a significant part of our long-term value creation strategy, and we're dedicated to our people, our communities, and our environment. We're committed to operating our business with the highest integrity. We have an actionable path forward to carbon neutrality that has more manageable and we believe considerably less expensive, that then lay ahead for many of our industry peers. Our sustainability and carbon reduction strategy is an ongoing journey, and we're moving forward with the intention to make a positive difference. Thank you for your time this morning, Barry? As the way that the information that you guys can use to back into our conversion costs, I know it's a little difficult, but you hit the primary driver with Sinton and ramping up as significantly as we're expecting them to do in the first quarter and as they are doing right now in January already, we would expect to see that overall as you calculate it conversion costs come down absent any other factors, correct? No, it is really hard for us to give you guidance, as you know, Martin, as it relates to the conversion costs as you're calculating it. As conversion costs really stand within the steel operations themselves, the two conversion costs are very stable. We don't expect to see a lot of movement except for Sinton again because of the additional volumes. The substrate does have an impact, as you mentioned, but we don't expect to see that mix of processing versus production be dramatically different in the first quarter. Martin, the backlog prices held in very steadily. There's not a dramatic difference. And again, we don't give specific sense to the backlog pricing for fabrication or for other operations. But the resiliency and the price, both what we're seeing now and in that backlog is very steady. Thanks, Tristan. So the biocarbon project hasn't increased in cost. It's stayed put. It stayed the same. It's $260 million. We did expect at one point in time to possibly get some tax credits that became unavailable once the definitions kind of became more precise from the administration. But otherwise, the capital cost of $260 million remains what we thought it would be. And that project is still online to be completed and to start before the end of 2024 which, as a reminder, is incredibly additive to our decarbonization path, and it's going to really help our customer base as you look at the carbon content across our steel operations with the benefit of using the biocarbon. So incredibly excited and the team is doing a fantastic job in Mississippi getting that up and running. So that will be spent primarily in 2024. And that $2 billion is a number that I would have given you last quarter as well. So that stayed the same for total CapEx in 2024. As it relates to the aluminum project, most of the incremental and it rounded to $200 million, but it was less than that in actuality. But most of that will be spent in 2024. So I gave you the spend for aluminum of about $1.4 billion. This year, and it would be our expectation. And then there would be a trailing, call it, $150 million to $200 million remaining to be spent in 2025 related to the aluminum projects. And so really nothing significant has changed on the capital front, except for that incremental addition in the aluminum project itself -- I'm sorry, I forgot, I had to look at my notes. You asked a lot of questions, Tristan. The last one was related to consensus for 2025. And I would just -- and free cash flow. I would just point out for everyone on the call. So for the last two years, unfortunately, Sinton has been negative from an EBITDA perspective. And Mark said on the call this morning that we will be EBITDA positive in the first quarter and thereafter, that's a significant swing in just earnings itself just as it relates to the ramp-up of Sinton. In addition to that, you have the four value-add flat roll lines that are coming online in 2024, which are significant additional opportunity for contribution to earnings on the value-added side as well as that's where the demand is today is in the painted products and the Galvalume products. And then if you couple that with the fact that we've been increasing and will continue to increase volumes in our metals recycling segment, both related to the collection of nonferrous scrap, specifically aluminum and to help service our steel mills on the ferrous side of the equation. And then finally, in 2025, we will be starting our aluminum mill, midyear is the current forecast. So that's contributing to earnings, as Mark mentioned, not we believe through cycle earnings of $650 million to $700 million. So I think everybody maybe needs to take a step back and kind of look at the opportunities that we have from an earnings perspective. And yes, we do expect to generate cash in 2024, and we expect to continue -- we plan to continue with our share repurchase program. As far as the ramp-up, I'll let Barry address how quickly they ramp up. I would tell you from a financial perspective, the coating lines, they are in totality, all four, around $600 million and they tend to have a 2.5 to 3-year payback. So it's very nice returns. Okay. Yes. So [indiscernible] though, you were talking about fabrication, you're actually talking about flat roll. So the -- we're operating contract business lagging, let's call it, two to three months. So the increased pricing that we saw in flat roll in the fourth quarter is going to be benefiting the first quarter from a contract perspective. And the 80% is -- it's really been pretty consistent all year for the flat roll operations. So we'll see that benefit Q1. Sorry, I'll get this right eventually. From a cost perspective for the substrate for fabrication, they tend to have anywhere between call it, eight to ten weeks of inventory on the ground. That's the same thing that they would have had coming into the first quarter. So you're going to see some of that incremental price hike in the first quarter but you would have seen some of it in the fourth quarter as well. Here you may have additional commentary as well, but we're seeing a lot of incremental demand on the manufacturing side. We've been talking about onshoring that is actually happening, and that does have a good impact on the steel joists and deck market. We're also seeing a lot of activity in the education side as well as in the, I'll call it, pharma or health care. And then anecdotally, you have to separate warehouses from data centers. We're continuing to see really good strength in the data center arena as well. Barry, I don't know if there's anything I'm missing. Katja, we did break out. So aluminum, because of the investment size, we will have a separate segment going forward. The -- we can't really give you projections on start-up losses. We expect them during 2024 to not be of significant size, and you will be able to see them. The one thing I'd note that you should recognize though, it's kind of an odd thing that's required from an accounting perspective, but those start-up losses actually get reflected in our SG&A amount. So if you see SG&A fluctuating, and maybe being higher than it is normally, it's because those start-up losses during construction are actually included in that line. We do have a good contingent of people on the ground now. But yes, during the year because we'll be expecting to actually still start up, as Mark said, in mid-2025, you're going to be seeing headcount increase as well as additional construction activity. So yes, you should expect to see those costs rise during 2024. And just I want to encourage that there are some of you on the phone right now that may not understand that the infrastructure program and the IRA and anything related to the roads and bridges and construction, they don't really benefit long products. They benefit long products, they certainly benefit our steel & joist and deck operations. But additionally, the front roll operations have exposure to that as well, whether it's through HVAC systems or pipe and tube, like Barry just mentioned there's a lot of impact on the flat rolled side, and I would encourage you to think about that perspective as well. Yes, we do have projects in mind for 2025. I'm not sure that we're prepared to go into that today. I would say from the perspective of capital spending, as I mentioned earlier on the call, aluminum will probably have a tail of somewhere between, call it, $200 million and $250 million. Our teams are consistently bringing us wonderful ideas that have high returns associated with them. Again, I'll point back to our ROIC. They do a good job of giving us those projects that have really great returns. So the number for 2025, I would say would be a minimum of probably $500 million, something like that, because you do still have some sustaining capital as well, which for us is very low at around $160 million, but there's still some benefit there. Mark, I don't know if you want to add any addition to that? So John, we want to be super clear that we see the share buyback program is a very good tool for us to be able to use and you've seen that. So very much the dividend, we've been increasing and we increased it with increases in our structural through-cycle cash flow generation when projects come online and then we do it pretty aggressively. We want to keep that positive momentum. But then we use that share buyback program during periods of excess cash flow when we maybe have less growth in mind, but we still are very much a growth company. To Mark's point, whether that's through greenfield assets or whether that's through acquisitions. But at the same time, we have the luxury that we don't have to sacrifice the share repurchase program. We absolutely can execute on all of those things. And that's what you'll continue to see us do in 2024 and 2025, absent extraneous things. Martin, we can't give directionality. Obviously, we had outages in the fourth quarter at two of our steel mills, and we won't have those in the first quarter. We've just mentioned that Sinton's going to be ramping up aggressively in the first quarter. So all in all, absent any significant market moves, you should expect to see incremental volume from our steel operations. And as Barry pointed out, with the additional value-added lines, you're going to start to see that product mix get richer and richer. So it will go more into the processing lines. You'll eventually see some really great spread enhancement throughout the year as well? Martin, they weren't -- they were just normal outages. We take outages at our foot roll mills and in our long product mills. They weren't anything that were -- we didn't note them as far as from a volume perspective. But yes, obviously, when you have outages that does impact volume, but there was nothing of significance to note. No, Martin, we're not. We do mid-cycle through cycle. And as we get more familiar, we just -- we don't provide that type of information."

            "content": "Thanks, Theresa. Our steel fabrication operations performed exceptionally well throughout 2023, achieving historically strong earnings. At the end of the year, our steel joists and deck order backlog was solid extending to the first half of 2024. We continued to have high expectations for the business, continued onshoring and manufacturing, coupled with infrastructure spending and fixed asset investment related to the IRA programs could continue to provide momentum for additional construction spending. Equally important, our customers tell us demand remains solid and share our optimism. Current pricing is stabilized at historically higher levels and order entry has improved. Fabrication platform provides meaningful volume support for our steel mills, critical and softer demand environments, allowing for higher through cycle steel utilization compared to our peers. It also helps mitigate the financial risk of lower steel prices. Our metals recycling operations also perform well this year, considering the challenge of declining scrap prices throughout much of 2023. The North American Geographic footprint of our metals recycling platform provides a strategic competitive advantage for our steel mills and for our scrap generating customers. Particular our Mexican locations competitively advantage our Columbus and Sinton raw material positions. They will strategically support aluminum scrap procurement for our future flat rolled aluminum investments. Our metals recycling team is also partnering even more closely with both our steel and aluminum teams to expand our scrap separation capabilities through process and technology solutions. This will help mitigate potential prime fair scrap supply issues in the future. It will also provide us with significant advantage to materially increase recycled content for our aluminum flat roll products and increase the earnings opportunities. The steel team had another strong year achieving record volume of 12.8 million tons. During 2023, the domestic steel industry operated at an estimated production utilization rate of 76%, while our steel mills operated at a rate of 93% excluding the Sinton plant. We consistently operate a higher utilization due to our value added steel product diversification, our differentiated customer supply chain, and the support of our internal manufacturing businesses. This higher through cycle utilization of all our steel mills is a key competitive advantage, supporting our strong and growing cash generation capability and best-in-class financial metrics. Regarding the steel markets, steel pricing improved in the fourth quarter 2023 and into January. Customer order entry rate has been strong and lead times have been extended, while their inventory levels remained at historically low amounts. In fact, our flat wheel steel operations have experienced one of the strongest order entry environments in January, especially for our value added products. Additionally, steel imports have generally remained at a manageable level with expectations of this to continue. As Sinton and the team has achieved significant improvements in operating efficiency and consistency. They average about 65% of capability in November, December, and have been running even stronger rates here in January. We are planning for Sinton additional improvements in production after the team makes changes to certain transformers at the end of this first quarter, 2024, while we allow access to a 100% of our mill capacity versus the current 80% capacity. Additionally, the two new value added coating lines will begin operating in the first quarter, supporting increased volume and margins. Regarding the steel market environment, automotive production estimates for 2024 or estimated 16 million units, while automotive dealer inventories remain below historical norms. Non-residential construction remains solid as evidenced by the strength of shipments and backlogs at our structural rail division, and customer inventory levels are low. Additionally, onshoring and infrastructure spending should provide meaningful support to fixed asset investment in related construction oriented projects in the coming years. As for the energy market, oil and gas activity is strong, driving approved orders for OCTG and solar, those areas all grow. Looking forward, we are optimistic regarding steel demand and pricing dynamics for 2024. With that, Mark? Yes, this is Barry. I'd just like to add the teams, the personnel are in place. They've been training, building the lines. That's our culture to be part of the construction. So the teams are already very familiar with the equipment. Two of the lines have actually run first coils, one at Heartland, the paint line and a coating line down in Sinton. So that's great news. That's always exhilarating for the teams to get that point. The next two lines are in hot commissioning now, and we anticipate those running first coils in the March time frame. So the ramp-up, keep product for them, we're pretty aggressive in what we do typically, and we anticipate these will be contributing to our customers here in the near future. I envision prime sales in Q1 from the two lines that have run first coils, and we see all four of the lines making and shipping salable goods into the marketplace in Q2. So we anticipate our experience and our culture will allow these startups to be very, very seamless. And we're very responsible to our customers to make sure the product that's leaving is nothing less than the best they expect from us. Well, Timna, this is Barry. I think a lot of our relationships, especially with the galvanized and the pain at are very directly with customers. So we see our supply chains still needing to fill orders at a really good rate. So the MSCI inventories still are traditionally pretty low. But more to the point or specific OEM relationships are still pulling tons from us. And when we have conversations, the lead times haven't changed at all with a vast majority of the business we do that is on these contract relationships. So I think what we're seeing out there and the nature of our inquiries make us feel like that there is a real demand out there still underneath everything we're doing. No, I'd just say that the mix is -- it's a good mix for them on the engineering side of the business to keep up with their lead times. So it -- isn't substantially different than the typical business flow that comes through it's small changes in the segments that we're serving through fabrication. Yes, we've had a very good ability to move product into Mexico. We have a very established team down there that's been serviced in our Flat Roll Group for a while, but we added a warehouse capability in Monterrey. And last year, we moved about 600,000 tons into Mexico in various industries altogether. But we're very pleased with how the business is moving. We are welcoming -- being welcomed by the customer base in Mexico. And in many cases, we've had relationships and haven't had the ability to get the tons there. Sinton provides us the opportunity not just through proximity, but through the advanced product features that we have. So we have wider, we have heavier products than we would typically have. And these products are being very well received in the various industries. I would tell you that the continued near-shoring of manufacturing in the United States is very apparent with the investments we see in Mexico and the customer base there. So it continues to go along with our strategy as being a great place to do business, and we're excited about it. Great question. Obviously, I think we're advantaged by having OmniSource recycled platform because today, not only are they the largest or second largest ferrous scrap recycler that they are clearly the largest nonferrous recycler and they're recycling somewhere around 500 million pounds of aluminum. We also have a secondary aluminum operation here in Fort Wayne that we're making, I don't know, 260 million pounds or thereabouts of secondary aluminum. So we're not -- it's not a new environment for us. I think we've got a great team. We've actually hired some incredible talent to supplement our already incredible talent. And so sourcing the material is not a -- we don't believe a major issue. If you look at our strategy, there are two principal kind of scrap streams, you might say. One is for the automotive industrial base. The other is for Comstock and the UBC scrap is -- well, it's highly available in California. They're a deposit state. So there's a lot of aluminum UBC scrap generated up and down the West Coast, currently either moving to Asia or to the Midwest. And similarly, in Mexico, a sort of a UBC scrap arena, so that's why we're locating two facilities, two satellite facilities in those scrap-rich areas, like the scrap at the source, molded in the freight of then moving big solid slab versus scrap to the Midwest is at around about half the price. And so we're not only advantaging ourselves on the scrap collection side but economically on getting that aluminum to the mill. No. We continue to strive for 80%. We the team is doing, as Mark said, a phenomenal job. It's a big challenge of bringing such a big asset up all at once. Transporter problems have been unfortunate, but we have several fixes in the works. Approaching the problem for both resiliency is also is getting back to full power capacity. So we remain confident that the operational levels we're going to see 80% is the target the whole team is aware of. We're all incentive to make that happen. We also see in the long products, a lot of, let's call it, foundational type structural sales. And even though it's a smaller division, Steel of West Virginia is very, very full with us right now with stuff that is tangential, whether it's solar fields, the support deal that goes in the ground or fork trucks and things like that, that go into these new factories and these new warehouses and data centers. So we do see a good bounce from that. We also see the pipeline industry in the states is picking up orders some cases for carbon sequestration lines as well as some major pipelines. So those markets are awake, and we see a lot of inquiry activity that is very exciting for us ultimately."

After the management remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. Please be advised this call is being recorded today, October 19, 2023 and your participation implies consent to our recording this call. If you do not agree to these terms, please disconnect. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to David Lipschitz, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDavid Lipschitz: Thank you, Holly. Good morning and welcome to Steel Dynamics third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. As a reminder, today’s call is being recorded and will be available on our website for replay later today. Leading today’s call are Mark Millett, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Steel Dynamics and Theresa Wagler, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The other members of our senior leadership team are joining us on the call individually. Some of today’s statements, which speak only as of this date maybe forward-looking and predictive, specifically preceded by believe, expect, anticipate or words of similar meaning. They are intended to be protected by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 should actual results turn out differently. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties related to integrating or starting out new assets in the aluminum industry, the use of estimates and assumptions in connection with anticipated project returns and our steel metal recycling and fabrication businesses as well as to general business and economic conditions. Examples of these are described in the related press release as well as in our annual filed SEC Form 10-K under the heading Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors found on the Internet at www.sec.gov, and if applicable, in any later SEC Form 10-Q. You also find any referenced non-GAAP financial measures reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the press release issued yesterday entitled Steel Dynamics Reports Third Quarter 2023 Results. And now, I am pleased to turn the call over to Mark.\nMark Millett: Thank you, David. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for being with us on our third quarter earnings call. As you saw in the release, once again, our teams achieved a solid financial and operational quarter. Almost 80% of our facilities had zero safety incidents, and our company-wide trailing 12-month incident rate is running at an all-time low. So congratulations to everyone, but more importantly, thank you for all your work to make that happen. It takes each and every one of us to get there. Cash from operations was a healthy $1.1 billion, and with the adjusted EBITDA generation of $876 million. I think this performance truly affirms the cash generation resiliency of our diversified value added product portfolio. Seeing significant momentum in our aluminum flat rolled investments, both current and prospective customers are excited by our market entry and the new and differentiated supply chain solutions we can provide. They're actually very, very surprised by the speed and completeness of our execution so far. Sinton mill has proven its nameplate production capacity rate, and full product capability, but does remain challenged by equipment reliability issues. We're confident we can resolve the majority of these issues by the year-end. Successes cannot be achieved without the best metals team in the industry. I am incredibly proud to the whole SDI family. Their passion and spirit form the foundation of our company. They drive our success and it's an honor to work among them. In fact, in this world of turmoil with the human catastrophe happening in the Ukraine, the atrocities in Israel, the suppression of the Palestinian people and even closer to home, the anger and divisiveness within America and our political structure really is inspiring to come to work each and every day and be surrounded by very, very positive people that think right, they get it, they treat people right and a focus on what we do each and every day. As such, our greatest leadership commitment is to our SDI family. Not only our colleagues that come to work, but also their partners in life and their kids. They remind our team’s great financial performance of no importance without keeping everyone safe. We continue to be focused on providing the very best for the health, safety, and welfare. Today, the SDI family, when you include everyone, we have over 45,000 people that are reliant on the decisions that we make each and every day and we're focused. We truly are focused on that. Together, we're actively engaged in safety at all times and at every level, keeping safety top of mind and an active conversation. Before I continue, Theresa would you like to give us some details?\nTheresa Wagler: Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Mark. Add my sincere appreciation to our teams for a really solid performance in the third quarter. Our third quarter 2023 net income was $577 million or $3.47 per diluted share with adjusted EBITDA of $876 million. Third quarter 2023 revenues of $4.6 billion and operating income of $734 million were lower than sequential second quarter results driven by lower realized steel and steel fabrication pricing. We see solid industry fundamentals for the rest of this year and beyond, and we're focused on our continued transformational growth initiatives. Our steel operations generated operating income of $474 million in the third quarter lower than sequential second quarter results due to flat rolled steel pricing metal spray compression as realized pricing declined more than average scrap costs. Our steel shipments remain steady at 3.1 million tons, excluding the lost volume of approximately 90,000 tons related to Sinton's unplanned July outage. We expect our four new flat rolled coating lines to begin operating in the first quarter of 2024 at both Sinton and Heartland increasing our value added mix by additional 1 million tons making so that our total coating capacity will be 6.9 million tons going forward. For those that track our detailed flat rolled shipments, in the third quarter, we had hot rolled and P&O shipments of 858,000 tons; cold rolled shipments of 132,000 tons; and coated shipments of 1,202,000 tons. Operating income from our mills recycling operations was $19 million, significantly lower than second quarter results due to non-ferrous and ferrous metal spray compression. Ferrous scrap demand was also reduced as numerous domestic steel mills had maintenance outages in the quarter. We are the largest North American metals recycler, processing and consuming ferrous scrap and non-ferrous aluminum, copper, and other metals. The team continues to lever our circular manufacturing operating model, providing higher quality lower cost scrap to our still mills, which improves furnace efficiency and reduces company-wide working capital requirements.  Our steel fabrication operations achieved operating income of $330 million in the third quarter lower than sequential second quarter results, yet historically strong as average realized pricing declined 11% and volumes declined 16,000 tons. Our steel joist and deck demand remains solid with good order activity. Our backlog extends through the first quarter of 2024. The backlog has contracted from record highs experienced in 2022 as shipments have outpaced spot order activity. Forward backlog pricing remains very strong and spot pricing resilient. Based on our backlog, customer sentiment and manufacturing momentum, we expect steel fabrication earnings to remain solid in the fourth quarter, but below third quarter levels based on seasonally lower volumes. Infrastructure, Inflation Reduction Act, Department of Energy decarbonization support and manufacturing onshoring are expected to support domestic fixed asset investment in related steel and joists and deck consumption in the coming years. Our cash generation continues to be strong based on our differentiated circular business model and variable cost structure. During the third quarter of 2023, we generated strong cash flow from operations of $1.1 billion and generated $2.7 billion on a year-to-date basis. At September 30th, we achieved record liquidity of $3.7 billion inclusive of cash, liquid investments and our unsecured $1.2 billion revolver. Year-to-date of 2023 we've invested $1.1 billion in capital investments. For the fourth quarter, we estimate capital investments will be in the range of $500 million to $550 million, of which around $350 million is related to our aluminum flat rolled investments. Much of the remaining capital is related to the completion of our four new value added coded lines. In February, we increased our cash dividend 25% to $0.425 per common share. Year-to-date 2023 we've also repurchased $1.1 billion of our common stock, representing almost 6% of our outstanding shares. At September 30th, $278 million remained authorized for repurchase under our existing $1.5 billion authorized plan. Since 2017, we've increased our dividend per share by 174% and repurchase $5.2 billion of our common stock, representing over 40% of our outstanding shares. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes high return growth with shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that's complimented with a variable share repurchase program. We remain dedicated to preserving our investment grade credit designation at the same time. Our free cash flow profile has fundamentally changed over the last five years, generating from an annual average of $540 million to $2.6 billion today. We've placed ourselves in a position of strength to have a sustainable capital foundation that provides the opportunity for meaningful strategic growth and strong shareholder returns while maintaining investment grade metrics. Our aluminum growth strategy is consistent with this philosophy. We will readily fund our flat rolled aluminum investments with available cash and cash flow from operations. We also plan to continue strong and responsible shareholder distributions as we've clearly demonstrated, we're squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable, optimized long-term value creation. Sustainability is also a significant part of our long-term value creation strategy, and we're dedicated to our people, our communities, and our environment. We're committed to operating our business with the highest integrity. In that regard, we remain excited about our joint venture with Aymium, a leading producer of renewable biocarbon products. We believe our first joint venture facility could decrease our still scope one greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 35%, and we currently expect to have the facility operating in the second half of 2024. We have an actual path toward carbon neutrality that is more manageable and we believe considerably less expensive than may lay ahead for many of our industry peers. Our sustainability and carbon reduction strategy is an ongoing journey, and we're moving forward with its intention to make a positive difference. And again, before I turn the call back over to Mark, I just want to thank the teams for a great performance. Mark?\nMark Millett: Super. Thank you, Theresa. As you saw, the steel fabrication platform continues to perform well and it turned in another solid quarter. We continue to have high expectations for the future earnings profile of this business. We believe non-residential construction markets will be strong in the coming years. Some residential starts and build rates are forecast to remain strong into 2024, and related spending has been higher in 2023 compared to the last year at this time. So political dysfunction has delayed the awarding of public monies likely into the first quarter of next year, the infrastructure spending and fixed asset investment related to the IRA programs, along with the reshoring and manufacturing should provide momentum for additional construction spending through 2024 effectively extending the construction cycle. And customer commentary has, as I talked to lot of folks out there, has confirmed our positive outlook. Deal of fabrication order backlog has certainly shortened from its historical high of over 12 months achieved in 2022, but it remains strong from a historical perspective, standing through March, 2024 with strong forward pricing. Current order entry pricing remains resilient. Not only a significant contributor unto itself, our fabrication platform provides meaningful pull-through volume for our steel mills, particularly important in softer markets, allowing for higher through cycle steel production utilization rates compared to our peers, adding to the resiliency of our through cycle cash generation. Furthermore, it provides an effective natural hedge to lower steel prices. Our metals recycling platform had a challenging quarter. Its demand from domestic steel mills softened and realized ferrous scrap prices declined. Scrap prices pulled back in the third quarter with bushing prices falling some $80 a ton. The North American geographic footprint of our metals recycling platform provides a strategic competitive advantage for our electric arc furnace steel mills, and our scrap generating customers. In particular, our Mexican locations competitively advantage our Columbus and Sinton and raw material positions. We also strategically support aluminum scrap procurement for our future flat rolled aluminum investments. Our metals team is partnering even more closely with both our steel and aluminum teams to expand scrap separation capabilities through process and technological solutions, enhancing margin, increasing the availability of low residual ferrous scrap. This will mitigate prime ferrous scrap supply issues in the future. It'll also provide us with significant advantage to materially increase the recycled content for our aluminum flat rolled products and increase our earnings opportunities on that platform. Our steel operations achieve strong shipments of 3.1 million tons and solid financial results in the third quarter. Steel production utilization rate when you exclude Sinton was 90% compared to a domestic industry rate of some 76%. The higher utilization rates have been clearly demonstrated throughout all market cycles driven by the value added diversified product offerings, which are amount to 70% of our sales. And this, as Theresa mentioned, will increase further with the addition of two galvanizing and two paint lines that will be commissioned in the first quarter of 2024. Differentiated supply chain solutions driving customer preference and mitigating price volatility and support of downstream internal pull-through manufacturing volume are all contributors. Our higher through cycle utilization rate is a key differentiator and supports our strong and growing through cycle cash generation capability and best-in-class financial metrics. Looking forward, steel backlogs are strong and customer order entry is good. Customer inventories are also at historically low levels. Auto production estimates for 2023 remained around 15 million units, but obviously with the ongoing strike, the outlook for the remainder of the year is somewhat opaque. So positively, dealer inventories remain below historical norms, which will be further reduced by the ongoing strike. [Indiscernible] demand there is still strong and with tight supply, the auto build rate will likely be higher than the already anticipated 16 million unit plus for 2024. In the meantime, unfortunately, our auto direct flat rolled exposure is more concentrated toward European and Asian producers, which so far has mitigated the strike impact on our flat rolled auto volume. Although not a significant impact to overall earnings, we are seeing greater impact at our engineered bar division as their 15% -- 20% auto exposure is mostly consumed by domestic auto producers. Non-residential construction remains solid. Our long product steel backlogs are good and customer inventory levels are low. General market is estimated to be off 8% of some due to seasonality, but should rebound as infrastructure spending provides meaningful support in the first half of 2024. The turn down in residential construction seems to be abating with a depletion of available home inventory. Oil and gas activity is strong driving improved orders for OCTG products and still continues to grow at a rapid rate. In total aggregate, long product demand remains solid and in flat rolled lead times are extending. We're seeing excellent order entry. Supply chain inventory is low, and pricing is certainly in an upward trend. We certainly anticipate further meaningful strength once the strike is concluded. Turning to Sinton. After the unplanned July outage related to the caster shear, the Sinton team produced over 290,000 tons in the quarter. The mill has clearly demonstrated its production rate capability and achieving 36 heat sequence lengths, and it’s exceeded its hourly nameplate run rate. However, as I said, the constrained production is manifest from a low utilization rate caused principally by equipment reliability issues. That said, we expect to progressively ramp up to about 70% total run rate by the end of 2023, reaching a production of 2.4 million tons for 2024.  Despite our challenges, the team has demonstrated the key competitive advantages of the Texas steel mill. We have completed full product dimensional capability. It's proven up to one inch thick, down to 053, I do believe out to 84-inch width. Customers are reporting exceptional surface quality and the hot strip mill design has allowed for thermal mechanical rolling, allowing production of higher strength grades, tough grades with lower alloy content and thus lowering costs for those value added products. We've achieved grade 80, 100 and already been approved for some API grades. I think just generally, it affirms our technical and process choices, and there's no doubt that in my mind it's the next generation of electric arc furnace flat rolled steel technology of choice. We have gained strong market acceptance and we can sell every pound of steel we make. Our exceptional through cycle operating and financial performance continues to support our cash generation and our growth investment strategies. Relative to our expansion into aluminum, as I said the responses from existing and new customers across all markets is absolutely incredible. We are developing the site. We purchased some 2,600 acres, I do believe, but we're developing it for the colocation of customers with the rolling mill as we successfully did in Sinton. We're seeing a number of customers who are already indicating strong interest in that model because it provides a sustainable, competitive model for all of us. To recap the project, the 650,000 metric ton flat rolled facility, the rolling mill will be located in Columbus, Mississippi, state-of-the-art facility, serving the sustainable beverage and packaging, automotive and industrial sectors. Approximately 300,000 metric tons will be canned, 200,000 tons auto and 150,000 industrial. We have onsite mill and cast slab capacity in Columbus of around 600,000 metric tons and the project will be supported by two satellite recycled aluminum slab casting centers one in central Mexico and one in Arizona to capture scrap close to its source. We'll have two cast lines, coating lines, and downstream processing and packaging lines to fully support our customer base. Startup plans are still anticipated for mid-2025 start for the rolling mill. Mexico slab center should start up late 2024, perhaps January 2025, and the Arizona slab center in the first quarter of 2025. So the project cost, including all recycled slab centers, is around $2.5 billion, 100% to be funded with cash. As we stated in the past, we expect a through cycle annual EBITDA of around about $650 million to $700 million from the aluminum portion, and the support of OmniSource will draw another $40 million to $50 million for them. I think the market from an investment premise perspective, what excites me is the market environment is very similar to the domestic steel industry when we started SDI 30 years ago. The industry generally has older assets, had a tough time earning its cost of capital. There's been little reinvestment over the last 45 years. It has heavy legacy costs, tends to be inefficient in high cost operations. Again parallels the situation we saw within the steel industry 30 years ago. According that we see a definite deficiency in supply that is exists in North America. And that deficiencies expected to grow even with our and second competitor's new facility. From our perspective, it is an adjacent industry to us. It leverages our ability to design and build commission ramp up the large capital assets and operate those assets very effectively, efficiently, at low cost through our performance and incentivized innovated and very effective culture. In closing, we're excited and impassioned and we always are, and we continue to be by our future growth opportunities as they will continue to the high returning growth momentum we have consistently demonstrated over the years. Culture and business model continue to positively differentiate our performance leading to best-in-class financial metrics, allowing a balanced cash allocation strategy that has rewarded our shareholder by top-notch in class returns. We're no longer a pure steel company, but an integrated metals business providing an enhanced supply chain solutions to the industry. In return [ph], mitigating volatility and cash flow generation through all market cycles. Our teams are a foundation. I thank each and every one of them for their passion and their dedication. We're committed to them. As I remind those listening today, that safety for yourselves, your families, and for each other is the highest of priorities, but competitively position and continue to focus on providing superior value for our company, our customers, team members, our shareholders alike. Thank you. Thank you for joining us again today. And Holly, we would love to turn it over to questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question for today is coming from Martin Englert at Seaport Research Partners.\nMartin Englert: Hello. Good morning, everyone.\nMark Millett: Good morning.\nMartin Englert: Within the Steel segment, steel conversion costs, which do include some substrate costs increase I think to around about 576 per ton in the quarter from 522. Is there any additional color that you can share regarding the portion of substrates, and maybe some positives and negatives when you think about these sequential change in contributions between true conversion costs and substrates, as well as if there was any material impact from the Sinton outage on that conversion cost.\nTheresa Wagler: Good morning, Martin. It's Theresa. Great question and observation. It really didn't have anything to do with the change in substrate mix, but that can have an impact. But there's two things that I would point to. One is the fact that because Sinton didn't operate all of July, the way that you're calculating your conversion costs, that lack of volume does have a pretty significant impact. It's not that there was additional costs, the costs were pretty de minimis. It's just that lost volume affecting the denominator. It's really affecting your conversion costs on a per ton basis, a little bit on an outsized way. The second thing is that we are preparing to start the value added lines in Heartland and then Sinton will follow thereafter in the coming months. And there's some additional costs related to that as well. But nothing to point to that would be systemic of higher conversion costs going forward.\nMartin Englert: Okay. So there's certainly a one-off that seemed material for the quarter and then some lingering, kind of transitory as you're working on ramping the other value added assets that will -- how long do you think that will persist for -- through the fourth quarter and then in the first quarter of next year? Any idea?\nTheresa Wagler: No. So Martin, with the advent of Sinton now operating and not being a part of that outage, you're going to have that incremental volume, which is going to really make that conversion cost get back in line with what you're used to seeing. But the value added line, there is some incremental cost. It's nothing that is necessarily significant that you'll have to try to figure out for the fourth quarter. We have two of the lines coming line maybe even before the end of the year with the remaining two for the first, probably first couple months in the first quarter.\nMartin Englert: Thank you for that. If I could one last one here, excluding 2020, looking at seasonality in 4Q total steel shipments, they tend to decline around 5% sequentially. Is there anything you're seeing this year that would suggest something different? And I imagine comparing the sequential with the Sinton outage and then Sinton backup probably might have an impact here on a sequential basis.\nTheresa Wagler: Yeah. So you're spot on, Martin. We would expect to see normal seasonality within the steel operations, but as you have now Sinton ramping up and operating for the full fourth quarter, you will see some benefit from that additional volume.\nMartin Englert: And you're aiming for 70% utilization on exit for the year with Sinton, correct?\nTheresa Wagler: That's correct.\nMartin Englert: Okay. Thank you very much. Congratulations navigating the downward market on and the continued growth investments.\nTheresa Wagler: Thanks Martin.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Carlos de Alba at Morgan Stanley.\nCarlos de Alba: Yeah. Thank you very much. Good morning. Just continue on Sinton. I wonder if you can give us a little bit of color on the EBITDA generated by the operation, and how you see that going forward.\nTheresa Wagler: Martin, I'm sorry. You cut out.\nDavid Lipschitz: Do you repeat that?\nCarlos de Alba: Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Just on Sinton, given the outrage and that you experienced, but things now are ramping up nicely and you expect full production, well at least production throughout the fourth quarter. How do you see the evolution of the EBITDA generated by the company, by this -- the plant Sinton?\nTheresa Wagler: Carlos, we can't give -- we won't give specific guidance on the earnings associated with Sinton. We are giving updated items on volume so that you can understand from a modeling perspective. So we would expect to see a significant improvement from the third quarter given the fact that we weren't operating all of July. But that being said, I really can't give you any guidance specific to what the EBITDA will be at Sinton.\nCarlos de Alba: All right. And then just maybe one more on the fabrication business. You did mention strong forward pricing in your backlog. Is there any additional color that you can provide given, the extraordinary strong pricing that we have seen in recent quarters relative to history?\nTheresa Wagler: No, that's okay. It has to do with fabrication the pricing in the backlog. So from a historical basis and even from recent 2023, the pricing in the backlog is very strong. Much higher than previous historical peaks. We've seen that be maintained the spot market, where the order activity isn't as strong as it was in 2022. It's still really good from the -- a historical basis, but that is contracting the backlog somewhat. So now it extends through the first quarter of 2024. And I think something else that we just -- I want to keep in perspective. Mark mentioned it on his opening notes, but I want to reiterate it because I think it's really important. We've been talking about the IRA monies, the Department of Energy monies, monies that are coming from the administration for public dollars. It's our estimate. And others would agree that there's likely not even 5% to 10% of that money that's been allocated or awarded yet. It's going much slower than anyone had expected and much slower than the administrative -- administration had indicated that it would. So those projects aren't benefiting the elongation of construction, steel consumption success, asset investment, steel joist, and deck demand as well. We're fully expecting, and what we're hearing from the administration and from others is that those dollars will start flowing in the first half of 2024. So right now there's a bit of a gap in funding and I think you're seeing that in the volumes, but we fully expect that to pick up and improve in 2024 and 2025.\nCarlos de Alba: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Tristan Gresser at Exane BNP Paribas.\nTristan Gresser: Yes. Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Maybe the first one, following up on the fabrication. You provided some guidance back in Q2 and I now understand that the stable volume guidance half and half is no longer valued. So I was wondering if -- and it's not the first time the guidance has been cut there, so what is driving quarter after quarter that they can have cut in that weakness? And you provided some color on the sequential movements. I guess on the scale side for Q4 volumes, can you tell us a little bit more about fab. And the same question a little bit on ASP, you guided for down 10% to 15% in H2 versus H1 on the ASP front. The Q3 ASP is already down 17% versus that level. So can you help us try to calibrate the weakness in ASP we should expect in Q4, but also in Q1 because you have some visibility into that quarter as well.\nTheresa Wagler: From a modeling perspective, just from a volume, I mentioned in my opening notes that we do expect to see some regular seasonality in the steel fabrication volume as well. So sequentially we would expect it to be modestly lower than what you would've seen the third quarter. But again, we're not attesting that to -- I think I addressed the consumption question when I responded to Carlos. As it relates to average pricing. Again, the backlog's very strong. If you're having seasonally lower volumes, I think it's a reasonable expectation to think pricing will be down somewhat, but we don't see it being in the same magnitude as the sequential second to third quarter, it'll be somewhat less than that.\nTristan Gresser: Alright. If I may…\nMark Millett: Relative to the pricing, it's -- the market actually has been a little confounding because since mid-July, we have seen the market being very, very strong, very solid. In fact, order input rate has been great. You have a situation where people -- it was more emotional there. There's no main structural change in demand that allowed, or pushed pricing down. It was more emotion relative to the strike. Mid-September when people recognized that it's sort of already been baked into the price, when they saw that inventories are very, very, very low and the supply chain, they see that lead times are stretch -- already stretching out, that we've seen an inflection and that there is definitely an upward momentum in collaborative pricing today. It's our anticipation and the anticipation of others that there's going to be quite a market increase in pricing once there's a resolution to that strike. Looking forward, we see a very positive -- very positive constructive market environment.\nTristan Gresser: Thank you. That's very helpful. If I just have a quick follow up and this time more on the capital allocation side. I mean, given the current context, and I think you touch on and you reaffirm what are your capital allocation priorities are, can you just reiterate what you view on inorganic growth? And could you confirm that at the moment you're not interested in looking at large acquisition on the flat rolled side and that's not an area of focus and that right now a 100% of your attention is on aluminum?\nTheresa Wagler: Tristan, we can't confirm that. So from a growth perspective, we're very transparent on capital allocation. Our primary focus is for high return growth, and that can be both organically and it can be transactional. We are very much focused on the aluminum strategy and that will be a priority. We are sitting with record liquidity at the end of the quarter of $3.7 billion. So we really have, I think, the luxury and we don't take it for granted, it's because of the performance of the teams, which is incredible, the luxury to be able to both invest organically, transactionally if there was something that were to fit into our long-term strategy as well as continue with the strong shareholder returns. And that at this point in time is our full intent, is to be able to accomplish that.\nTristan Gresser: All right. That's very clear. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Timna Tanners at Wolfe Research.\nTheresa Wagler: Hey, good morning, Timna.\nTimna Tanners: Wanted to just ask a little bit more about Sinton. If I go back in my notes, a couple years ago you were talking about being at full capacity, 3 million tons, and now you're talking about 70%, 80%. So I'm just trying to understand, is there some reason that it's no longer expected to run full out or are you just assuming like maybe some gradual ramp up? I just want to understand that better.\nMark Millett: Yeah. No. That's fine. We probably have not done an elegant job of explaining that. The 70% is just the run rate at the end of this year, Timna. Again, we'll continue to ramp up. We expect to be 2.4 million tons total production next year, which I think is around over 80% of the 3 million. And then we'll continue to ramp up from there. There's absolutely no doubt that the plant capability can exceed the 3 million ton nameplate that we've advertised in the past.\nTheresa Wagler: And I guess just to bring a little bit more clarity to that. We would expect to be operating around that full capacity by the middle of 2024, Mark's just giving a total year view.\nTimna Tanners: Helpful. Okay. Thank you. One other timing question was really on the downstream lines that are going to really enrich your product mix. And in the presentation it says they're starting in the second half, but I thought I heard you saying they were contributing more in the first half. So just trying to get the cadence of when that ramps up.\nTheresa Wagler: Yeah. It probably should have been updated in the investor deck. I'm guessing that's what you're pointing toward. We're planning to have the Heartland paint line and the Heartland galvanizing line running first, which could be towards the end of 2023. But probably moving into that first month and a half in 2024 and then very closely thereafter, Sinton's additional paint line and galvanizing line will be starting as well still within the first quarter of 2024.\nTimna Tanners: Great. Thanks. And then the last question, if I could squeeze it in is just on the CapEx guidance. I think we had -- last quarter you had talked about a number for 2024 of about 1.5 billion and just with the higher CapEx guide for Q4, we just wanted to check on if that number is still right for 2024. Thanks again.\nTheresa Wagler: You're welcome, Timna. Actually, we're in the middle of planning for 2024 on the capital investment side right now. It looks like it's going to be closer to $1.8 billion to possibly $2 billion. I'll be able to put a finer point on that as we get through the first quarter, but it's primarily comprised of a little bit more on the aluminum side just from a timing perspective, not a total investment. So aluminum may be as much as $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion next year. We also have the construction and startup of the biocarbon facility, which could be as much as $150 million to $175 million. And then we have some tail to the four value added lines as well of maybe a $100 million. So I will be putting a finer point on that, but right now I'd say it's probably in the range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion.\nTimna Tanners: Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Bill Peterson with JP Morgan.\nBill Peterson: Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. We've been seeing some reports that the US and Europe are ahead of this summit tomorrow. Maybe looking at removing some of the tariffs or adjusting quotas and things like that. I guess, assuming that some of this does happen and quotas go away, how would you see this impacting the US steel market?\nMark Millett: Well, I guess we don't have the same intelligence that others have from our folks on the hill and just conversations. It really seems still up in the air. The European position and the US position are totally at odds, and not much progress has been made, but maybe you are wrong. That said, obviously the tariffs today, a lot of that has been negotiated away in only probably 25% or so of incoming, steel imports are affected by that. And obviously quotas are in place with Brazil and here and others. I would imagine that they will remain in place in some form of fashion. European tariffs maybe that is a little different, but Europe is not really a influence on our market, in all honesty. If you look at the straightforward arbitrage today between -- well, Asian pricing and European pricing, not that that attractive. We don't necessarily see a big influence there. We do feel strongly that any tariff and quota type activity will transition into some form of carbon tax on border tax. Actually, in the long run will likely be a lot more effective than the perhaps was in place today. Again, we need to remember and highlight that the principal trade constraints, the countervailing duty anti-dumping cases that were brought in 2015 went through sunset last summer and got continued. I think it's another five years. Those are legislative in nature. They won't change. They firmly, firmly, or eliminate these imports, for instance, certainly in addition with, or in concert with the kind availing duty.\nBill Peterson: Okay. Thanks for that color. Second question. So on bar volume, so you mentioned that there's some impact with the strike, but the strike really only started, I guess in late in the third quarter. So how should we think about the trajectory of volumes, assuming a bigger hit in the fourth quarter for that segment?\nMark Millett: Well, for us, we don't really see a major change in volume from an automotive perspective in the fourth quarter for us. As I mentioned in my notes, we have a large percentage of our auto book is European and Asian. They are not impacted by the strike as of now. We are -- we do have some business with Aymium and with Ford. But again, on a percentage basis, it's not going to be monumental to our book volume or earnings.\nBill Peterson: Okay. Thanks for sharing the insights.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from John Tumazos with John Tumazos Independent Research.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you. \nDavid Lipschitz: Hi, John.\nUnidentified Analyst: With all the great dynamics benefiting the steel business, industry-wide apparent demand looks like it's trending about 8 million tons below the average of 2017, 2018, 2019. I don't know what's normal, but I'm looking to the pre-pandemic period. Your own choice business is off 16,000 tons sequentially, and I guess 56,000 tons year-on-year. And there's no inventories in choice because they're made custom order. What are the segments that are down that are negating some of the other growth or accounting for the decline? A high rise office building with work at home with lower consumer spending, ecommerce warehouses and retail space are poor. Are there any other segments that could account for the deviations?\nMark Millett: Well, I think from a -- we got some feedback going on here, but the -- we're talking principally fabrication here. Yeah. I think it -- when -- again, all we can do John, is look through our book order book or lands, but obviously the distribution warehouse arena has come off, not stopped. It's not -- Amazon obviously came out very publicly and sort of almost holding the development because they over bill, but that's not the case with other distributors. It's still ongoing market for us. All of them is there. But I think we picked it up education, healthcare has been positive and the just manufacture -- manufacturing facilities, the battery plants, the chip plants are picking up. Not at the rate to offset, totally offset that distribution base, but nonetheless, it's picking up strongly and we would anticipate continued growth next year. Just the infrastructure, the IRA spending that certainly will bolster our order book there and give it some support.\nUnidentified Analyst: In terms of the two-year decline in spot sheet prices of $1,200 from big records, how much damage do you think that's caused across consumer and distributor inventory as you know, and prices fall, people don't want to hold the hot potato.\nMark Millett: Well, I think the biggest impact is the reduced level of speculation in the supply chain. In fact, it's not a reduced level of speculation. People just don't speculate anymore. So you see people that's kind of hand in mouth. They tend to be ordering and buying on as needed basis that, that allows consistent shipping since July, mid-July, where we've seen very, very, very consistent order input rates and deliveries. Even as pricing came off the pricing this time and just as it was last year, last year with had a similar story with a very constructive outlook for 2023, which in all honesty came to fruition. The emotion last year was [indiscernible] us, we're headed for a recession and we got high interest rates, inflation, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. There was no change, no structural change in underlying demand in the fourth quarter of last year. We're seeing the same thing today. Demand is very, very solid across virtually every market sector that we have. Yet we see -- saw that softness strike related emotional. People are starting to see lead time stretch out. They're starting to see, or get a little worried. We're booked out. And essentially our order book is closed for November. And given the interest, we see for December, we haven't opened that book yet., We're not so sure we will be able to satisfy the total appetite there. So it's a positive market momentum going into 2024.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you. I'm a shareholder.\nMark Millett: Thank you. Stay that way.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] That concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for any closing remarks.\nEnd of Q&A:\nMark Millett: Well, thank you, Holly. And for anyone that remains on the line, I would tell you I am blessed. SDI is blessed. Each and every one of us is blessed here because we have phenomenal loyal customers. Thank you for your support today and in the future. We have great service providers. We've got a phenomenal, phenomenal team of people that come to work, as I said earlier, inspired and positive each and every day. So thank you. Thank you for those that our shareholders and those on, I would hope that you consider us because we will create better shareholder value than most folks in the years ahead. So thank you very much. Have a great day. Bye-bye.\nOperator: Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation and have a great and safe day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mark Millett",
            "content": "Thank you, David. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for being with us on our third quarter earnings call. As you saw in the release, once again, our teams achieved a solid financial and operational quarter. Almost 80% of our facilities had zero safety incidents, and our company-wide trailing 12-month incident rate is running at an all-time low. So congratulations to everyone, but more importantly, thank you for all your work to make that happen. It takes each and every one of us to get there. Cash from operations was a healthy $1.1 billion, and with the adjusted EBITDA generation of $876 million. I think this performance truly affirms the cash generation resiliency of our diversified value added product portfolio. Seeing significant momentum in our aluminum flat rolled investments, both current and prospective customers are excited by our market entry and the new and differentiated supply chain solutions we can provide. They're actually very, very surprised by the speed and completeness of our execution so far. Sinton mill has proven its nameplate production capacity rate, and full product capability, but does remain challenged by equipment reliability issues. We're confident we can resolve the majority of these issues by the year-end. Successes cannot be achieved without the best metals team in the industry. I am incredibly proud to the whole SDI family. Their passion and spirit form the foundation of our company. They drive our success and it's an honor to work among them. In fact, in this world of turmoil with the human catastrophe happening in the Ukraine, the atrocities in Israel, the suppression of the Palestinian people and even closer to home, the anger and divisiveness within America and our political structure really is inspiring to come to work each and every day and be surrounded by very, very positive people that think right, they get it, they treat people right and a focus on what we do each and every day. As such, our greatest leadership commitment is to our SDI family. Not only our colleagues that come to work, but also their partners in life and their kids. They remind our team's great financial performance of no importance without keeping everyone safe. We continue to be focused on providing the very best for the health, safety, and welfare. Today, the SDI family, when you include everyone, we have over 45,000 people that are reliant on the decisions that we make each and every day and we're focused. We truly are focused on that. Together, we're actively engaged in safety at all times and at every level, keeping safety top of mind and an active conversation. Before I continue, Theresa would you like to give us some details? Super. Thank you, Theresa. As you saw, the steel fabrication platform continues to perform well and it turned in another solid quarter. We continue to have high expectations for the future earnings profile of this business. We believe non-residential construction markets will be strong in the coming years. Some residential starts and build rates are forecast to remain strong into 2024, and related spending has been higher in 2023 compared to the last year at this time. So political dysfunction has delayed the awarding of public monies likely into the first quarter of next year, the infrastructure spending and fixed asset investment related to the IRA programs, along with the reshoring and manufacturing should provide momentum for additional construction spending through 2024 effectively extending the construction cycle. And customer commentary has, as I talked to lot of folks out there, has confirmed our positive outlook. Deal of fabrication order backlog has certainly shortened from its historical high of over 12 months achieved in 2022, but it remains strong from a historical perspective, standing through March, 2024 with strong forward pricing. Current order entry pricing remains resilient. Not only a significant contributor unto itself, our fabrication platform provides meaningful pull-through volume for our steel mills, particularly important in softer markets, allowing for higher through cycle steel production utilization rates compared to our peers, adding to the resiliency of our through cycle cash generation. Furthermore, it provides an effective natural hedge to lower steel prices. Our metals recycling platform had a challenging quarter. Its demand from domestic steel mills softened and realized ferrous scrap prices declined. Scrap prices pulled back in the third quarter with bushing prices falling some $80 a ton. The North American geographic footprint of our metals recycling platform provides a strategic competitive advantage for our electric arc furnace steel mills, and our scrap generating customers. In particular, our Mexican locations competitively advantage our Columbus and Sinton and raw material positions. We also strategically support aluminum scrap procurement for our future flat rolled aluminum investments. Our metals team is partnering even more closely with both our steel and aluminum teams to expand scrap separation capabilities through process and technological solutions, enhancing margin, increasing the availability of low residual ferrous scrap. This will mitigate prime ferrous scrap supply issues in the future. It'll also provide us with significant advantage to materially increase the recycled content for our aluminum flat rolled products and increase our earnings opportunities on that platform. Our steel operations achieve strong shipments of 3.1 million tons and solid financial results in the third quarter. Steel production utilization rate when you exclude Sinton was 90% compared to a domestic industry rate of some 76%. The higher utilization rates have been clearly demonstrated throughout all market cycles driven by the value added diversified product offerings, which are amount to 70% of our sales. And this, as Theresa mentioned, will increase further with the addition of two galvanizing and two paint lines that will be commissioned in the first quarter of 2024. Differentiated supply chain solutions driving customer preference and mitigating price volatility and support of downstream internal pull-through manufacturing volume are all contributors. Our higher through cycle utilization rate is a key differentiator and supports our strong and growing through cycle cash generation capability and best-in-class financial metrics. Looking forward, steel backlogs are strong and customer order entry is good. Customer inventories are also at historically low levels. Auto production estimates for 2023 remained around 15 million units, but obviously with the ongoing strike, the outlook for the remainder of the year is somewhat opaque. So positively, dealer inventories remain below historical norms, which will be further reduced by the ongoing strike. [Indiscernible] demand there is still strong and with tight supply, the auto build rate will likely be higher than the already anticipated 16 million unit plus for 2024. In the meantime, unfortunately, our auto direct flat rolled exposure is more concentrated toward European and Asian producers, which so far has mitigated the strike impact on our flat rolled auto volume. Although not a significant impact to overall earnings, we are seeing greater impact at our engineered bar division as their 15% -- 20% auto exposure is mostly consumed by domestic auto producers. Non-residential construction remains solid. Our long product steel backlogs are good and customer inventory levels are low. General market is estimated to be off 8% of some due to seasonality, but should rebound as infrastructure spending provides meaningful support in the first half of 2024. The turn down in residential construction seems to be abating with a depletion of available home inventory. Oil and gas activity is strong driving improved orders for OCTG products and still continues to grow at a rapid rate. In total aggregate, long product demand remains solid and in flat rolled lead times are extending. We're seeing excellent order entry. Supply chain inventory is low, and pricing is certainly in an upward trend. We certainly anticipate further meaningful strength once the strike is concluded. Turning to Sinton. After the unplanned July outage related to the caster shear, the Sinton team produced over 290,000 tons in the quarter. The mill has clearly demonstrated its production rate capability and achieving 36 heat sequence lengths, and it's exceeded its hourly nameplate run rate. However, as I said, the constrained production is manifest from a low utilization rate caused principally by equipment reliability issues. That said, we expect to progressively ramp up to about 70% total run rate by the end of 2023, reaching a production of 2.4 million tons for 2024.  Despite our challenges, the team has demonstrated the key competitive advantages of the Texas steel mill. We have completed full product dimensional capability. It's proven up to one inch thick, down to 053, I do believe out to 84-inch width. Customers are reporting exceptional surface quality and the hot strip mill design has allowed for thermal mechanical rolling, allowing production of higher strength grades, tough grades with lower alloy content and thus lowering costs for those value added products. We've achieved grade 80, 100 and already been approved for some API grades. I think just generally, it affirms our technical and process choices, and there's no doubt that in my mind it's the next generation of electric arc furnace flat rolled steel technology of choice. We have gained strong market acceptance and we can sell every pound of steel we make. Our exceptional through cycle operating and financial performance continues to support our cash generation and our growth investment strategies. Relative to our expansion into aluminum, as I said the responses from existing and new customers across all markets is absolutely incredible. We are developing the site. We purchased some 2,600 acres, I do believe, but we're developing it for the colocation of customers with the rolling mill as we successfully did in Sinton. We're seeing a number of customers who are already indicating strong interest in that model because it provides a sustainable, competitive model for all of us. To recap the project, the 650,000 metric ton flat rolled facility, the rolling mill will be located in Columbus, Mississippi, state-of-the-art facility, serving the sustainable beverage and packaging, automotive and industrial sectors. Approximately 300,000 metric tons will be canned, 200,000 tons auto and 150,000 industrial. We have onsite mill and cast slab capacity in Columbus of around 600,000 metric tons and the project will be supported by two satellite recycled aluminum slab casting centers one in central Mexico and one in Arizona to capture scrap close to its source. We'll have two cast lines, coating lines, and downstream processing and packaging lines to fully support our customer base. Startup plans are still anticipated for mid-2025 start for the rolling mill. Mexico slab center should start up late 2024, perhaps January 2025, and the Arizona slab center in the first quarter of 2025. So the project cost, including all recycled slab centers, is around $2.5 billion, 100% to be funded with cash. As we stated in the past, we expect a through cycle annual EBITDA of around about $650 million to $700 million from the aluminum portion, and the support of OmniSource will draw another $40 million to $50 million for them. I think the market from an investment premise perspective, what excites me is the market environment is very similar to the domestic steel industry when we started SDI 30 years ago. The industry generally has older assets, had a tough time earning its cost of capital. There's been little reinvestment over the last 45 years. It has heavy legacy costs, tends to be inefficient in high cost operations. Again parallels the situation we saw within the steel industry 30 years ago. According that we see a definite deficiency in supply that is exists in North America. And that deficiencies expected to grow even with our and second competitor's new facility. From our perspective, it is an adjacent industry to us. It leverages our ability to design and build commission ramp up the large capital assets and operate those assets very effectively, efficiently, at low cost through our performance and incentivized innovated and very effective culture. In closing, we're excited and impassioned and we always are, and we continue to be by our future growth opportunities as they will continue to the high returning growth momentum we have consistently demonstrated over the years. Culture and business model continue to positively differentiate our performance leading to best-in-class financial metrics, allowing a balanced cash allocation strategy that has rewarded our shareholder by top-notch in class returns. We're no longer a pure steel company, but an integrated metals business providing an enhanced supply chain solutions to the industry. In return [ph], mitigating volatility and cash flow generation through all market cycles. Our teams are a foundation. I thank each and every one of them for their passion and their dedication. We're committed to them. As I remind those listening today, that safety for yourselves, your families, and for each other is the highest of priorities, but competitively position and continue to focus on providing superior value for our company, our customers, team members, our shareholders alike. Thank you. Thank you for joining us again today. And Holly, we would love to turn it over to questions. Good morning. Relative to the pricing, it's -- the market actually has been a little confounding because since mid-July, we have seen the market being very, very strong, very solid. In fact, order input rate has been great. You have a situation where people -- it was more emotional there. There's no main structural change in demand that allowed, or pushed pricing down. It was more emotion relative to the strike. Mid-September when people recognized that it's sort of already been baked into the price, when they saw that inventories are very, very, very low and the supply chain, they see that lead times are stretch -- already stretching out, that we've seen an inflection and that there is definitely an upward momentum in collaborative pricing today. It's our anticipation and the anticipation of others that there's going to be quite a market increase in pricing once there's a resolution to that strike. Looking forward, we see a very positive -- very positive constructive market environment. Yeah. No. That's fine. We probably have not done an elegant job of explaining that. The 70% is just the run rate at the end of this year, Timna. Again, we'll continue to ramp up. We expect to be 2.4 million tons total production next year, which I think is around over 80% of the 3 million. And then we'll continue to ramp up from there. There's absolutely no doubt that the plant capability can exceed the 3 million ton nameplate that we've advertised in the past. Well, I guess we don't have the same intelligence that others have from our folks on the hill and just conversations. It really seems still up in the air. The European position and the US position are totally at odds, and not much progress has been made, but maybe you are wrong. That said, obviously the tariffs today, a lot of that has been negotiated away in only probably 25% or so of incoming, steel imports are affected by that. And obviously quotas are in place with Brazil and here and others. I would imagine that they will remain in place in some form of fashion. European tariffs maybe that is a little different, but Europe is not really a influence on our market, in all honesty. If you look at the straightforward arbitrage today between -- well, Asian pricing and European pricing, not that that attractive. We don't necessarily see a big influence there. We do feel strongly that any tariff and quota type activity will transition into some form of carbon tax on border tax. Actually, in the long run will likely be a lot more effective than the perhaps was in place today. Again, we need to remember and highlight that the principal trade constraints, the countervailing duty anti-dumping cases that were brought in 2015 went through sunset last summer and got continued. I think it's another five years. Those are legislative in nature. They won't change. They firmly, firmly, or eliminate these imports, for instance, certainly in addition with, or in concert with the kind availing duty. Well, for us, we don't really see a major change in volume from an automotive perspective in the fourth quarter for us. As I mentioned in my notes, we have a large percentage of our auto book is European and Asian. They are not impacted by the strike as of now. We are -- we do have some business with Aymium and with Ford. But again, on a percentage basis, it's not going to be monumental to our book volume or earnings. Well, I think from a -- we got some feedback going on here, but the -- we're talking principally fabrication here. Yeah. I think it -- when -- again, all we can do John, is look through our book order book or lands, but obviously the distribution warehouse arena has come off, not stopped. It's not -- Amazon obviously came out very publicly and sort of almost holding the development because they over bill, but that's not the case with other distributors. It's still ongoing market for us. All of them is there. But I think we picked it up education, healthcare has been positive and the just manufacture -- manufacturing facilities, the battery plants, the chip plants are picking up. Not at the rate to offset, totally offset that distribution base, but nonetheless, it's picking up strongly and we would anticipate continued growth next year. Just the infrastructure, the IRA spending that certainly will bolster our order book there and give it some support. Well, I think the biggest impact is the reduced level of speculation in the supply chain. In fact, it's not a reduced level of speculation. People just don't speculate anymore. So you see people that's kind of hand in mouth. They tend to be ordering and buying on as needed basis that, that allows consistent shipping since July, mid-July, where we've seen very, very, very consistent order input rates and deliveries. Even as pricing came off the pricing this time and just as it was last year, last year with had a similar story with a very constructive outlook for 2023, which in all honesty came to fruition. The emotion last year was [indiscernible] us, we're headed for a recession and we got high interest rates, inflation, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. There was no change, no structural change in underlying demand in the fourth quarter of last year. We're seeing the same thing today. Demand is very, very solid across virtually every market sector that we have. Yet we see -- saw that softness strike related emotional. People are starting to see lead time stretch out. They're starting to see, or get a little worried. We're booked out. And essentially our order book is closed for November. And given the interest, we see for December, we haven't opened that book yet., We're not so sure we will be able to satisfy the total appetite there. So it's a positive market momentum going into 2024. Thank you. Stay that way."

            "name": "Theresa Wagler",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Mark. Add my sincere appreciation to our teams for a really solid performance in the third quarter. Our third quarter 2023 net income was $577 million or $3.47 per diluted share with adjusted EBITDA of $876 million. Third quarter 2023 revenues of $4.6 billion and operating income of $734 million were lower than sequential second quarter results driven by lower realized steel and steel fabrication pricing. We see solid industry fundamentals for the rest of this year and beyond, and we're focused on our continued transformational growth initiatives. Our steel operations generated operating income of $474 million in the third quarter lower than sequential second quarter results due to flat rolled steel pricing metal spray compression as realized pricing declined more than average scrap costs. Our steel shipments remain steady at 3.1 million tons, excluding the lost volume of approximately 90,000 tons related to Sinton's unplanned July outage. We expect our four new flat rolled coating lines to begin operating in the first quarter of 2024 at both Sinton and Heartland increasing our value added mix by additional 1 million tons making so that our total coating capacity will be 6.9 million tons going forward. For those that track our detailed flat rolled shipments, in the third quarter, we had hot rolled and P&O shipments of 858,000 tons; cold rolled shipments of 132,000 tons; and coated shipments of 1,202,000 tons. Operating income from our mills recycling operations was $19 million, significantly lower than second quarter results due to non-ferrous and ferrous metal spray compression. Ferrous scrap demand was also reduced as numerous domestic steel mills had maintenance outages in the quarter. We are the largest North American metals recycler, processing and consuming ferrous scrap and non-ferrous aluminum, copper, and other metals. The team continues to lever our circular manufacturing operating model, providing higher quality lower cost scrap to our still mills, which improves furnace efficiency and reduces company-wide working capital requirements.  Our steel fabrication operations achieved operating income of $330 million in the third quarter lower than sequential second quarter results, yet historically strong as average realized pricing declined 11% and volumes declined 16,000 tons. Our steel joist and deck demand remains solid with good order activity. Our backlog extends through the first quarter of 2024. The backlog has contracted from record highs experienced in 2022 as shipments have outpaced spot order activity. Forward backlog pricing remains very strong and spot pricing resilient. Based on our backlog, customer sentiment and manufacturing momentum, we expect steel fabrication earnings to remain solid in the fourth quarter, but below third quarter levels based on seasonally lower volumes. Infrastructure, Inflation Reduction Act, Department of Energy decarbonization support and manufacturing onshoring are expected to support domestic fixed asset investment in related steel and joists and deck consumption in the coming years. Our cash generation continues to be strong based on our differentiated circular business model and variable cost structure. During the third quarter of 2023, we generated strong cash flow from operations of $1.1 billion and generated $2.7 billion on a year-to-date basis. At September 30th, we achieved record liquidity of $3.7 billion inclusive of cash, liquid investments and our unsecured $1.2 billion revolver. Year-to-date of 2023 we've invested $1.1 billion in capital investments. For the fourth quarter, we estimate capital investments will be in the range of $500 million to $550 million, of which around $350 million is related to our aluminum flat rolled investments. Much of the remaining capital is related to the completion of our four new value added coded lines. In February, we increased our cash dividend 25% to $0.425 per common share. Year-to-date 2023 we've also repurchased $1.1 billion of our common stock, representing almost 6% of our outstanding shares. At September 30th, $278 million remained authorized for repurchase under our existing $1.5 billion authorized plan. Since 2017, we've increased our dividend per share by 174% and repurchase $5.2 billion of our common stock, representing over 40% of our outstanding shares. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes high return growth with shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that's complimented with a variable share repurchase program. We remain dedicated to preserving our investment grade credit designation at the same time. Our free cash flow profile has fundamentally changed over the last five years, generating from an annual average of $540 million to $2.6 billion today. We've placed ourselves in a position of strength to have a sustainable capital foundation that provides the opportunity for meaningful strategic growth and strong shareholder returns while maintaining investment grade metrics. Our aluminum growth strategy is consistent with this philosophy. We will readily fund our flat rolled aluminum investments with available cash and cash flow from operations. We also plan to continue strong and responsible shareholder distributions as we've clearly demonstrated, we're squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable, optimized long-term value creation. Sustainability is also a significant part of our long-term value creation strategy, and we're dedicated to our people, our communities, and our environment. We're committed to operating our business with the highest integrity. In that regard, we remain excited about our joint venture with Aymium, a leading producer of renewable biocarbon products. We believe our first joint venture facility could decrease our still scope one greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 35%, and we currently expect to have the facility operating in the second half of 2024. We have an actual path toward carbon neutrality that is more manageable and we believe considerably less expensive than may lay ahead for many of our industry peers. Our sustainability and carbon reduction strategy is an ongoing journey, and we're moving forward with its intention to make a positive difference. And again, before I turn the call back over to Mark, I just want to thank the teams for a great performance. Mark? Good morning, Martin. It's Theresa. Great question and observation. It really didn't have anything to do with the change in substrate mix, but that can have an impact. But there's two things that I would point to. One is the fact that because Sinton didn't operate all of July, the way that you're calculating your conversion costs, that lack of volume does have a pretty significant impact. It's not that there was additional costs, the costs were pretty de minimis. It's just that lost volume affecting the denominator. It's really affecting your conversion costs on a per ton basis, a little bit on an outsized way. The second thing is that we are preparing to start the value added lines in Heartland and then Sinton will follow thereafter in the coming months. And there's some additional costs related to that as well. But nothing to point to that would be systemic of higher conversion costs going forward. No. So Martin, with the advent of Sinton now operating and not being a part of that outage, you're going to have that incremental volume, which is going to really make that conversion cost get back in line with what you're used to seeing. But the value added line, there is some incremental cost. It's nothing that is necessarily significant that you'll have to try to figure out for the fourth quarter. We have two of the lines coming line maybe even before the end of the year with the remaining two for the first, probably first couple months in the first quarter. Yeah. So you're spot on, Martin. We would expect to see normal seasonality within the steel operations, but as you have now Sinton ramping up and operating for the full fourth quarter, you will see some benefit from that additional volume. That's correct. Thanks Martin. Martin, I'm sorry. You cut out. Carlos, we can't give -- we won't give specific guidance on the earnings associated with Sinton. We are giving updated items on volume so that you can understand from a modeling perspective. So we would expect to see a significant improvement from the third quarter given the fact that we weren't operating all of July. But that being said, I really can't give you any guidance specific to what the EBITDA will be at Sinton. No, that's okay. It has to do with fabrication the pricing in the backlog. So from a historical basis and even from recent 2023, the pricing in the backlog is very strong. Much higher than previous historical peaks. We've seen that be maintained the spot market, where the order activity isn't as strong as it was in 2022. It's still really good from the -- a historical basis, but that is contracting the backlog somewhat. So now it extends through the first quarter of 2024. And I think something else that we just -- I want to keep in perspective. Mark mentioned it on his opening notes, but I want to reiterate it because I think it's really important. We've been talking about the IRA monies, the Department of Energy monies, monies that are coming from the administration for public dollars. It's our estimate. And others would agree that there's likely not even 5% to 10% of that money that's been allocated or awarded yet. It's going much slower than anyone had expected and much slower than the administrative -- administration had indicated that it would. So those projects aren't benefiting the elongation of construction, steel consumption success, asset investment, steel joist, and deck demand as well. We're fully expecting, and what we're hearing from the administration and from others is that those dollars will start flowing in the first half of 2024. So right now there's a bit of a gap in funding and I think you're seeing that in the volumes, but we fully expect that to pick up and improve in 2024 and 2025. From a modeling perspective, just from a volume, I mentioned in my opening notes that we do expect to see some regular seasonality in the steel fabrication volume as well. So sequentially we would expect it to be modestly lower than what you would've seen the third quarter. But again, we're not attesting that to -- I think I addressed the consumption question when I responded to Carlos. As it relates to average pricing. Again, the backlog's very strong. If you're having seasonally lower volumes, I think it's a reasonable expectation to think pricing will be down somewhat, but we don't see it being in the same magnitude as the sequential second to third quarter, it'll be somewhat less than that. Tristan, we can't confirm that. So from a growth perspective, we're very transparent on capital allocation. Our primary focus is for high return growth, and that can be both organically and it can be transactional. We are very much focused on the aluminum strategy and that will be a priority. We are sitting with record liquidity at the end of the quarter of $3.7 billion. So we really have, I think, the luxury and we don't take it for granted, it's because of the performance of the teams, which is incredible, the luxury to be able to both invest organically, transactionally if there was something that were to fit into our long-term strategy as well as continue with the strong shareholder returns. And that at this point in time is our full intent, is to be able to accomplish that. Hey, good morning, Timna. And I guess just to bring a little bit more clarity to that. We would expect to be operating around that full capacity by the middle of 2024, Mark's just giving a total year view. Yeah. It probably should have been updated in the investor deck. I'm guessing that's what you're pointing toward. We're planning to have the Heartland paint line and the Heartland galvanizing line running first, which could be towards the end of 2023. But probably moving into that first month and a half in 2024 and then very closely thereafter, Sinton's additional paint line and galvanizing line will be starting as well still within the first quarter of 2024. You're welcome, Timna. Actually, we're in the middle of planning for 2024 on the capital investment side right now. It looks like it's going to be closer to $1.8 billion to possibly $2 billion. I'll be able to put a finer point on that as we get through the first quarter, but it's primarily comprised of a little bit more on the aluminum side just from a timing perspective, not a total investment. So aluminum may be as much as $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion next year. We also have the construction and startup of the biocarbon facility, which could be as much as $150 million to $175 million. And then we have some tail to the four value added lines as well of maybe a $100 million. So I will be putting a finer point on that, but right now I'd say it's probably in the range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion."

Please go ahead.\nDavid Lipschitz: Thank you, Holly. Good morning and welcome to Steel Dynamics second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. As a reminder, today’s call is being recorded and will be available on our website for replay later today. Leading today’s call are Mark Millett, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Steel Dynamics; Theresa Wagler, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Barry Schneider, President and Chief Operating Officer. Other members of our senior leadership team are joining us on the call individually.

They are intended to be protected by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 should actual results turn out differently. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties related to integrating or starting out new assets in the aluminum industry, the use of estimates and assumptions in connection with anticipated project returns and our steel metal recycling and fabrication businesses as well as to general business and economic conditions. Examples of these are described in the related press release as well as in our annual filed SEC Form 10-K under the heading Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors and on the Internet at www.sec.gov, and if applicable, in any later SEC Form 10-Q. You also find any referenced non-GAAP financial measures reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the press release issued yesterday entitled Steel Dynamics Reports Second Quarter 2023 Results. And now, I am pleased to turn the call over to Mark.\nMark Millett: Thank you, David and good morning everybody. Thank you for being with us on our second quarter earnings call. Once again, our teams achieved a solid financial and operational quarter. Highlights included continued safety improvement, 81% of our facilities were incident free through the quarter, our cash from operations of $808 million and EBITDA generation of $1.2 billion. We also received improved investment-grade credit ratings, providing further third-party confirmation of the strength of our business model. We are also making significant progress on our aluminum flat-rolled investments. There is great excitement within the prospective customer base for new and innovative supply chain solutions from a differentiated supplier. I am incredibly proud of our teams. They are the foundation of our company and they drive our success. Is their culture of excellence, combined with our meaningful value-added growth, diversification and supply chain positioning that is resulting in our earnings strength in all market cycles? However, as I have often said, great financial performance is of no importance without safety for our SDI family. We are focused on providing the very best for their health, safety and welfare. We are actively engaged in safety at all times and at every level, keeping it top of mind and an active conversation. Our focus, as I said, the team’s safety performance further improved in the second quarter, way ahead of industry averages. There is more to do, we will not rest until we consistently achieve our goal of zero injuries. But before I continue, Theresa, would you like to give us some financial color.\nTheresa Wagler: Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. I add my sincere appreciation and congratulations to the entire team for another strong performance. Our second quarter 2023 net income was $812 million or $4.81 per diluted share with, as Mark mentioned, EBITDA of $1.1 billion. Second quarter 2023 revenues of $5.1 billion were higher than sequential first quarter results, driven by increased realized steel selling values. Our second quarter operating income of $1.1 billion was 27% higher than first quarter results as a result of significantly expanded steel metal spread. As we discuss our business this morning, we are positive with industry fundamentals for the remainder of 2023 and beyond and we are focused toward our continued transformational growth. Our steel operations generated strong operating income of $706 million in the second quarter due to metal spread expansion and near-record shipments of 3.2 million tons. High realized pricing more than offset moderately higher scrap costs in the quarter. We realized increased pricing and metal spread across both our flat-rolled and our long product steel operations. As a reminder, we are the primary domestic steel supplier into the railroad rail market as well as a producer of all other long steel products, including structural steel, special bar quality, merchant shapes, specialty shapes and reinforcing bar with over 4.5 million tons of annual capacity. Operating income from our metals recycling operations was $40 million, consistent with sequential first quarter results due to increased shipments being offset by lower metal spreads. The team continues to lever our circular manufacturing model benefiting us by providing high-quality, lower cost scrap, which improves furnace efficiency and reduces company-wide working capital. Our Mexico recycling operations also provide a competitive advantage for reliable supply as well as for future increased scrap aluminum collection. We are the largest North American metals recycler today processing and using ferrous scrap and non-ferrous aluminum, copper and other metals. Our steel fabrication operations achieved operating income of $462 million in the second quarter lower than first quarter results, but historically strong as average pricing decreased 13% and volumes were steady. Our steel joist and deck order backlog extends into the first quarter of 2024. It has contracted from record highs experienced in 2022 as shipments have outpaced spot order activity. However, forward backlog pricing remains very strong and price – spot pricing remains very resilient. Based on our backlog, customer sentiment and manufacturing momentum, we expect steel fabrication earnings to remain strong, but slightly lower than the first half of 2023 levels for the second half of the year. Infrastructure Inflation Reduction Act, Department of Labor, decarbonization support and manufacturing onshoring are expected to support not only fixed asset investment in steel consumption, but also steel joist index demand in the coming years. Our cash generation continues to be strong based on our differentiated circular business model and variable cost structure. At June 30, our liquidity was $3.5 billion, inclusive of our recently renewed unsecured $1.2 billion revolver. I’d like to congratulate the team. They actually refinanced revolver yesterday. So thank you to Rick and Dominic. During the second quarter of 2023, we generated cash flow from operations of $808 million and $1.5 billion for the first half of the year. During the first half, we invested $585 million in fixed asset investments. We believe capital investments for the second half of the year will be in the range of $1 billion, the vast majority relating to our aluminum flat-rolled investments and the completion of our four flat-rolled steel coating lines by the end of 2023. In February, we increased our cash dividend 25% and repurchased $734 million or 3.9% of our outstanding shares in 2023. At June 30, $606 million remained authorized for repurchase under our existing $1.5 billion program that we put in place during November of 2022. Since 2017, we have increased our cash dividend 174% and repurchased $4.8 million of our common stock, representing 39% of our outstanding shares. And recognition of our growth, strong balance sheet profile and consistent free cash flow generation capability, last month, we received upgrades, as Mark mentioned, to our investment grade credit designation from both Moody’s and from S&P. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes high-return growth with shareholder distributions comprised of a positive base dividend that’s complemented with a variable share repurchase program, while we remain dedicated to our investment-grade credit designation. We have placed ourselves in a position of strength to have a sustainable capital foundation that supports meaningful strategic growth strong shareholder returns and investment grade metrics. Our free cash flow profile has fundamentally increased over the last 5 years from an annual average of $580 million to $2.6 billion currently. Our aluminum growth strategy is consistent with this strategy. We will readily fund our flat-rolled aluminum investments with available cash and cash flow from operations. We also plan to continue strong and responsible shareholder distributions as we have clearly demonstrated. We are squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable optimized long-term value creation. Sustainability is also a significant part of our long-term value creation strategy and we are dedicated to our people, our communities and our environment. We are committed to operating our businesses with the highest integrity. We have an actionable path towards carbon neutrality that is more manageable and we believe considerably less expensive than they may lay ahead for many of our industry and other peers. Our sustainability and carbon reduction strategy is an ongoing journey and we are moving forward with the intention to make a positive difference playing a leadership role. For those of you on the call, I’d like to track the product differentiation among our flat-rolled shipments. For the second quarter, our hot-rolled shipments were 972,000 tons, our cold-rolled shipments were 149,000 tons, and our coated shipments were 1,150,000 tons. With that, I will turn the call back over to Mark.\nMark Millett: Thank you, Theresa. And hopefully, folks can hear us, I know it’s – I guess is not quite up to snuff today, so I apologize for that. But nonetheless, our steel fabrication platform turned in another strong quarter. The team continues to do an absolutely phenomenal job there, one second. Everyone apologies, but it appears that many folks can’t hear us, hear the call. I would ask you to hang up and call back in and we will just pause the call for a second. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, apologies. Please remain connected. David, we will dial out to you and reconnect on your line. Ladies and gentlemen, participants please remain connected. We will reconnect the speaker line. David, we will dial out to you momentarily. Thank you for holding, ladies and gentlemen. We do apologize. Please remain on the line. The Steel Dynamics conference call will resume shortly. And the speaker line is now reconnected.\nDavid Lipschitz: Sorry about that, folks. We will just continue from where you were.\nMark Millett: Well, good morning again. Apparently, I believe you heard everything that’s been said, but it’s very, very choppy. So obviously, we will clarify things in the Q&A that perhaps you didn’t hear. I was just kicking off our steel fabrication platform turned in another strong quarter. That team continues to do an absolutely phenomenal job. So thank you to each and every one of them. We continue to have high expectations for that business and we believe non-residential construction markets will continue to be strong in the coming years. Non-residential starts and build rates are forecast to remain strong through the rest of this year and into ‘24 and related spending has been higher in 2023 compared to last year at this time. Continued onshoring of manufacturing businesses, coupled with infrastructure spending and fixed asset investment related to the IRA programs, should provide momentum for additional construction spending and extend the whole non-residential construction cycle. Equally important, our customers tell us demand remains solid and share our perspective. Our steel fabrication order backlog has shortened from its all-time high of over 12 months achieved in 2022, but it remains very strong from a historical perspective, extending into January of 2024 with a strong pricing profile. Current order entry pricing remains resilient, and we expect second half ‘23 volumes to be comparable to the first half 2023 shipments. We also believe average pricing will remain elevated, but possibly drift 10% to 15% lower than average for the first half of the year. Not only a significant contributor itself, our fabrication platform provides meaningful pull-through volume for our steel mills, particularly important in softer markets, allowing for higher through-cycle utilization rates compared to our peers. It also provides an effective natural hedge to lower steel prices. Our metals recycling platform achieved a strong second quarter despite price declines. After rising in the first quarter, scrap prices pulled back May through July with shredded scrap prices falling almost $100 a ton. We expect scrap pricing to fluctuate modestly during the second half of the year, perhaps seasonally rising somewhat in the third quarter and moderating again in the fourth. Our metals recycling geographic footprint provides a strategic competitive advantage for our electric arc furnace steel mills and our scrap generating customers. In particular, our Mexican volumes competitively advantaged our Columbus and Sinton raw material positions. They will also strategically support aluminum scrap procurement for our future flat-rolled aluminum investments. Our metals recycling team is partnering even more closely with both our steel and aluminum teams to expand scrap segregation capabilities through process and technology solutions. This will preclude prime first scrap supply issues in the future. It will also provide margin enhancement from the aluminum scrap streams and materially increased recycled content of our aluminum sheet products. Our steel operations achieved near record shipments of 3.2 million tons and solid financial results in the second quarter. Our steel production utilization rate, excluding Sinton, was 93% compared to a domestic industry rate of 76%. Our higher utilization rates have been clearly demonstrated throughout all market cycles and is manifested by our value-added diversified product offerings, which amount to about 70% of our sales today, competitive advantage supply chain solutions, which is driving customer preference and mitigating price volatility, and the support of internal pull-through manufacturing volume. Our higher through-cycle utilization rate is a key differentiator and supports our strong and growing through-cycle cash generation capability and best-in-class financial metrics. Looking forward, backlogs are strong and the customer order entry is good. Auto production is good with expectations of higher output in 2023 relative to 2022 rates and dealer inventories have improved, but still remain below historical norms. Non-residential construction remains strong. Our long product steel backlogs are solid. Onshoring and infrastructure spending should provide further meaningful support in the coming years. The turndown in residential construction seems to be abating. Oil and gas activity is strong, driving improved orders for OCTG and solar continues to grow substantially. At Sinton, the team achieved positive EBITDA for the second quarter and produced shy of 390,000 tons, which is about 52% of full capacity, which is obviously lower than we had planned. But that said, the team has done a phenomenal job to get to that EBITDA positive position. Some of that lack of utilization was being on a single electrical furnace for a portion of the quarter. As we announced on July 1, we experienced equipment issues with the cast this year. Repairs are well underway, and we should be restarting within the next few days. Once we started, we fully expect to progressively ramp up month-over-month to an 80% run rate by the end of the year. The team has demonstrated the key competitive advantages of the mill. We have four product dimensional capability. That has been proven all the way out to 84-inch down to the 057 and up to 1-inch think. Customers are reporting surface quality to be exceptional. Our strip mill design has allowed for the thermal mechanical rolling, allowing the production of higher strength grades with lower alloy content and thus lower costs. Grade 80, grade 100 have been achieved, and we’ve been approved on and shipped some API grades. And it affirms our technical process choices, and there is no doubt that this is the next-generation electric arc furnace flat-rolled steel technology of choice. We have gained strong market acceptance and can sell everything we make and then sell. Our exceptional through-cycle operating and financial performance continues to support our cash generation and growth investment strategies relative to our expansion into aluminum, responses from both current and new customers across all market sectors remains incredible. We are developing the mill site to co-locate processing and consuming operations as we have successfully done in Sinton, and we have a number of customers already speaking with us about such opportunities, which would be a competitive and sustainably competitive model for all of us. To recap the project. It’s a 650,000 metric ton aluminum flat roll facility, which will be located in Columbus, Mississippi, right across the highway essentially from our steel mill there. State-of-the-art facility serving the sustainable beverage and packaging markets, both including body and the automotive arena and industrial sectors. Specifically, we’re targeting 300,000 tons of can, 200,000 tons of auto and 150,000 tons of industrial product. The on-site melt slab capacity of 600,000 metric tons will be supported by two satellite recycled aluminum slab casting centers. We are purchasing and we should be closing on land, both in San Luis Policy-central Mexico and also in the Southwest U.S. in the next 2 or 3 weeks. The mill includes two cash lines for automotive, coating line, downstream processing and packaging lines. We expanded the project scope to include additional scrap processing and treatment to maximize aluminum recycled content. All the principal equipment has been ordered, we anticipate rolling mill start up around mid ‘25. The Mexico slabs center should be January 1, the ‘25 and the Southwest U.S. slab center sometime in the first quarter of the ‘25. Total project cost, including the recycled slab centers should be $2.5 billion. 100% of that is going to be funded with cash. We expect to add $650 million to $700 million of through-cycle annual EBITDA to the company through that investment, plus around $40 million to $50 million of additional earnings from the Omni recycling platform. And from an investment premise perspective, we just see a market environment not unlike that in the steel industry when we started SDI 30 years ago. Old assets, little reinvestment, heavy legacy costs, inefficiency and high-cost operations. significant aluminum flat rolled supply deficit is existing today in North America and is expected to grow in the coming years. And we see a real business alignment whereby we can leverage our core competencies of construction strength on operational know-how and our culture to truly leverage and exploit the technology. We also will be able to leverage Omni’s recyclement footprint and maximize recycled content of the product. We believe it’s a very, very cost-effective, high return growth for us. And again, the existing and new customer interest and support is quite unbelievable. In closing, we are excited. We’re impassioned by the future growth opportunities as they will continue the high returning growth momentum we’ve consistently demonstrated over the years. And we’re celebrating our 30th year in business this August, and there are only better things to come. Our teams are our foundation, and I thank each of them for their passion and their dedication and their commitment. And we are committed to them. I remind those listening today that safety for yourselves, your families and each other is our highest priority. There is nothing more important. Our culture and business model continue to positively differentiate our performance leading to best-in-class financial metrics. As I said, I think, on the last call, we’re no longer a pure steel company, but an integrated metals business providing an enhanced supply chain solutions to the industry, which in turn, mitigates volatility in cash flow generation through all market cycles. We’re competitively positioned and continue to focus on providing superior value for our company, customers, team members and shareholders alike. We look forward to creating new opportunities for all of us today and in the years ahead. So with that said, Holly, we would love to hand the call over to you and start the Q&A session.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Curt Woodworth at Credit Suisse.\nCurt Woodworth: Yes, thanks. Good morning, Mark and Theresa.\nMark Millett: Good morning.\nCurt Woodworth: Mark, you talked about fab pricing. You said to be roughly 10% to 15% lower in the back half of the year versus the first half, which seems to put realized pricing around the $4,100 per ton level. Can you help us understand maybe the cadence of how that would shake out between 3Q and 4Q? And then you noted the backlog for fabrication is extending into 2024. Are you seeing any evidence of price stabilization at this point in terms of how the backlog is shaping up in the early part of next year.\nTheresa Wagler: Thanks, Curt. This is Theresa. So I appreciate the question. When Mark said that the average pricing was expected to be down 10% to 15%, that was just for clarity for everyone on the call, that was measuring the first half of 2023 to the second half of 2023. So it wasn’t specific to a point in time or specific to the second quarter itself. And we would say that we expect the cadence to be pretty equal from that step down in the third quarter and then stepping down a bit finally into the fourth quarter. Pricing is stable. It’s been very – I think the term we keep using is resilient, and that’s something that we pointed to in the past. We think there is been a structural shift in pricing for steel fabrication as there is really a lack of substitutability when you think about steel joist and deck and there is a very good demand today and we think increasing demand with the momentum behind manufacturing for all the different reasons that we pointed to this morning. The backlog has a good pricing, very strong pricing from a historical perspective. And I think that we see that heading very favorably into the first quarter. And frankly, we were just talking about it this morning, as you think about a lot of the public monies in those programs, those are being awarded, especially with the IRA and some of the Department of Labor dollars. Those are getting awarded sometime this fall kind of call it late third quarter, early fourth quarter. So that should really benefit 2024 and 2025 as you think about manufacturing and construction. And definitely, steel fabrication will benefit from that.\nCurt Woodworth: Okay. And then in terms of the volume guidance, it seems like volumetrically you’re still expecting year-on-year decline in kind of the 15% to 20% level and you noted some project delays. Can you just kind of comment on within the backlog, or I guess, projects that have been burning off? Are there certain pockets of weakness you’re seeing that are greater than others. Obviously, there is been kind of a lot of talk on some of the warehouse spending dying down, but data centers and other areas seem to be really strong. So any color you can give on that would be helpful. And then just as a follow-up, can you give a comment on what you think capital spending for 2024 would be. Thank you very much.\nTheresa Wagler: Thanks, Curt. Yes. So as it relates to the mix of the backlog and I would say more so even in the current order intake activity. We have seen – and I think it’s positive for the economy in general. We’ve seen a more projects coming in from, whether it be education, healthcare, definitely manufacturing. So we’re starting to even see the electric vehicle batteries. We’ve seen the chips we’ve seen a lot of advent and manufacturing from onshoring new things that we’ve talked about. So there is a mix towards those type of projects and away from just purely retail warehouses, which we’ve been seeing and talking about for a while now, probably 6 to 9 months. As it relates to capital spending for 2024, we expect to have capital spending for the aluminum project this year is likely to be somewhere between $900 million and $950 million in total. Next year for the aluminum project is likely to be about $1.2 billion. So when you combine that with additional growth projects as well as a minimal amount of maintenance capital. We’re likely to have total capital spending in 2024 from what we can see today, still around that $1.5 billion for the year.\nCurt Woodworth: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Cleveland Rueckert at UBS Securities.\nCleveland Rueckert: Great. Good morning, thanks for taking my question. Maybe just one sort of on the aluminum side. I guess just looking at your budget and sort of outlook for demand there. Recently, there is been a downturn in aluminum can demand and that industry has been, I guess, a little bit disrupted. I’m wondering if that’s at all concerning to you and if you’ve adapted your demand forecast at all.\nMark Millett: Absolutely not. We remain very, very bullish now. If you go back like a year now, perhaps the folks were projecting that demand would grow and you need four new aluminum mills. We didn’t believe that then. We don’t believe that now. But we certainly feel there is more space than to satisfy our market share for sure. The kind of the – sort of the pull back, I would say, is more an inventory standpoint. There is a lot of inventory people panicked a lot last year. That inventory has to flow through the system. And there is absolutely no doubt that it is doing so today. And in all honesty, when our mill comes up, I think that the marketplace is going to be in a beautiful place for us to receive product. Are you going to look longer-term, there definitely is a social change away from POC plastic bottles that will continue. It’s not just beer, it’s water, it’s all fluids. And then when you look at the automotive arena, we believe and we’ve – with our communications with virtually all the automotive folks, they have been restrained from developing greater volumes of aluminum through the lack of availability. We’re providing that availability going forward. And I think we – just as we’ve done in steel, we will gain market share quite rapidly. So from a market perspective, we are still very bullish that the amount of interest we have across the aluminum space is incredible. And I think I said it on our last call, in steel, we’ve never entered a market that is underserved. Every market we’ve gone into, we’ve had to differentiate ourselves to gain market share. It’s refreshing for us that people are actually coming to us and when you combine that need with our ability to change the supply chain to provide much greater value to the customer base, I think we’re confident to gain that market share quite rapidly.\nTheresa Wagler: Cleve, just as a quick reminder. In the last several years, they have had domestically the consumers of aluminum sheet actually had to import about 20% of their needs, and that had high tariffs associated with that imported costs. So there is definitely room for just 630,000 tons of additional supply.\nCleveland Rueckert: Good. Got it. I appreciate the confidence. And if I may just sneak in one follow-up question on Sinton. I think you had to replace a bearing on the caster. I’m just wondering if you’ve got – I didn’t hear it in the prepared remarks that maintenance work has been done and back on schedule.\nBarry Schneider: Yes, this is Barry. I’d just like to comment that those bearing issues we talked about at the tail end of last year, our teams mitigated most of the effects of that. We have a supply chain now that is both a more robust design and a more robust supply chain. So we’re really excited about the quality improvements and really the reliability of those casting segment parts. We believe our long-term plans, we kind of approached it with several different prongs. And all of them are really being successful and it’s to the point now that we can manage it very well and we’re operating at full capacity, as Marc spoke, all capabilities of the machine right now are in place. So we believe long-term, that’s going to be not an issue going forward that it will just continue to be high reliability and continuing high quality.\nCleveland Rueckert: Thanks, Barry. But didn’t – wasn’t there an unplanned outage very recently?\nBarry Schneider: Yes, that – we had a caster sheer issue just here at the beginning of July, not related to the bearing issue, perhaps as you mentioned with the casting machine. And it’s kind of a technical issue with the caster sheer. And suffice to say it’s large parts that we wanted to make sure we had put in properly and we are taking this opportunity to address a couple of other issues, but we anticipate that facility being up and operational in the next few days. Our team has done a phenomenal job for working together and getting the scope of a project. We’re super excited. Mark and I were down there for moral support, definitely not getting in the way of the guys making the repairs. But great to see this team just really owning their technology and bringing it forward. So we anticipate this problem to be behind us. And we think we’ve put in really good things to mitigate any future failures that are similar to this.\nCleveland Rueckert: Okay, got it. Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Tristan Gresser with Exane BNP Paribas.\nTristan Gresser: Yes. Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one is maybe on the steel side. Can you tell us a little bit about the volume outlook into Q3 I noticed loan volumes were down on a year-on-year basis in Q2. So should we expect some pickup there? And with the symptom outage, how should we think, generally speaking, for steel shipments into Q3? That’s my first question. Thank you.\nTheresa Wagler: Tristan, this is Theresa. Thanks for the question. So we – generally, we don’t give guidance as it relates to specifics on shipments. And if you look historically, the third quarter is going to be generally the strongest shipment quarter. that we have in shipments for steel simply because of seasonality. Sinton is going to be down for July. We are still running the coal mill and the value add lines, which will help to place some of the lost volume. But we’re likely to have lost volume of anywhere between 50,000 and 70,000 tons of total steel shipments as it relates to the sheer outage in July. Other than that, we really can’t give you any additional guidance, but as Mark mentioned, the backlogs across the steel platform are very strong and order activity has been very good.\nTristan Gresser: Okay. No, that’s helpful. And maybe a quick follow-up just on the fabrication business. You mentioned that joist and deck spot prices have stopped falling, at which level exactly you are seeing them now.\nTheresa Wagler: Tristan, we can’t give specific pricing related to the commercial teams would be after me. So, I think what we have said about pricing for fabrication is that the pricing has been very resilient. We have strong pricing in the backlog, but we did mention that there are expectations that pricing on average from – compared to the first half of the year, pricing on average for the second half of the year is likely to be down 10% to 15%, but we do believe pricing is stable, and it’s been very resilient.\nTristan Gresser: Okay. I appreciate the color. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Carlos De Alba at Morgan Stanley.\nCarlos De Alba: Thank you very much. Good morning. So, just on pricing as well. Maybe you can provide some color even without giving those details. What we have seen in the benchmark information is how deep galvanized prices have been recently below the substrate cold-rolled coil prices, which is a little bit weird and obviously not sustainable. But can you provide some color as to whether you are also seeing that in your realized prices for these products? And one might explain the initial situation?\nMark Millett: Yes. Carlos, thanks for the question. The marketplace is a little frothy right now. I would say the recent – the most recent change here in the CRU downward here yesterday or the day before in our mind doesn’t represent the market dynamics that’s going on at the time.\nCarlos De Alba: Alright. Okay. Thanks Mark. And then just on Sinton, I wanted to confirm that you still expect the cost of the recent outage to be around $1 million, which is pretty insignificant. And when would you expect to reach closer to 100% capacity utilization, if that is your intent or do you believe or you want to stay around 80% that you will reach towards the end of the year?\nMark Millett: Well, the – actually, the outage – the actual specific cost it was well under $1 million. It – as Barry said, the issue was just getting parts and just the size of the equipment involved, it wasn’t necessarily a large expense to repair. And the second part of that, sorry. Well, again, as you saw or as you heard from our comments, we are just tempering our expectations. We have always had higher expectations. And we just believe once we get up and running here in the next few days, we were at – when we shutdown 52%, 55% or thereabouts, we are just suggesting now that month-over-month we are going to progressively ramp up to that 80% by the end of the year. And then into next year, we will continue to incrementally ramp up to full production through ‘24.\nCarlos De Alba: Got it. So, in the second half of next year, fourth quarter next year is when you expect to get full capacity then?\nTheresa Wagler: No, Carlos. I would say that Mark – what Mark said is that we are going to have kind of an even pace we expect of ramp-up in the second half of this year for 2023 to get up to that 80%. But then we will reach the 100% of capacity very quickly in 2024.\nCarlos De Alba: Alright. Got it. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nTheresa Wagler: You’re welcome.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Timna Tanners at Wolfe Research.\nTimna Tanners: Yes. Hey, good morning.\nMark Millett: Good morning Timna.\nTimna Tanners: Wanted to just ask a little bit more about the cadence of added supply that you have outlined on the new coating and painting lines. Like should we start modeling contribution immediately in the third quarter? Will that be more fourth quarter and first quarter weighted? And then I have a second question. Thanks.\nBarry Schneider: Timna, this is Barry. We are anticipating bringing the new coding and the galvanizing lines, paint lines on at the end of the year. But I wouldn’t expect any kind of a significant contribution to shipment still going into 2024. But the lines are constructing very well. There continues to be supply chain issues with certain parts of the construction, but we are resolving those and mitigating them and moving stuff, teams are very active in manned up. So, we look forward to bringing these lines on, but it will be near the end of the year.\nTimna Tanners: Okay. Helpful. Appreciate that. And then my only other question was just an update on your export activity and just how that’s trending. I know you have been pretty active shipping to Mexico, just wondering if there is anything new there.\nMark Millett: From – other than a small little bit of non-ferrous, we have no export activity other than Mexico.\nBarry Schneider: Yes. Timna, this is Barry again. We have been doing quite a bit of shipments into Mexico this year. Sin is uniquely – the capabilities of Sin are sitting are unique for what the Mexican markets are. So, being able to get some heavier gauge products and wider products down there has been a very good place for us to develop relationships. So, we have been down in shipping to Mexico for a long time, but significantly so in the first half of this year and we continue to do more of that, especially through our campus partners at the Sinton facility. So, we see that as a really good business and continuing to grow forward.\nTimna Tanners: Okay. Thanks again.\nMark Millett: We certainly capitalized a little on the AMSA situation down there. And even as they restart, and obviously, there is a lot of projections as to how quickly they restart, if they restart. But we are quite confident that the customer base there around AMSA certainly in Monclova has recognized that single sourcing is a huge mistake. And even with an arms of startup, we are going to continue to secure a lot of that business that we have and market share that we have gained.\nTimna Tanners: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Bill Peterson at JPMorgan.\nBill Peterson: Yes. Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask you about the decarbonization strategy. You put some information on the about carbon initiatives. I mean you discussed the operations by early 2024, but just to confirm, I guess is the plant construction begun, or are there any other areas to prove out or technical readiness issues to address? That’s the first question.\nTheresa Wagler: Thanks Bill. So, the biocarbon facility is actually going really well. The teams have done a lot of groundwork already. The major equipment is either has been ordered or is on order and some of it is actually going to be received fairly shortly. So, the team is doing a phenomenal job. I am very proud of them in Mississippi and the expectations are that it will start before the end of 2024. There is nothing left to prove as far as the product itself. There is a facility in Marquette, Michigan that Aymium operates, which is the technology provider. And we have tested the product extensively, both for injection and charge carbon. So, we don’t have any expectations for anything other than a wonderful product that we can replace eventually 100% or a very large portion thereof of our anthracite usage going forward. So, everything is going really, really well.\nBill Peterson: Yes, appreciate that. And I forgot to ask what do you expect in terms of the cost on that, but compared to traditional? But I guess my second question is, as we think about this additional galvanized capacity, you have mentioned this kind of end of the year and then more contribution for next year. But I guess how is your view given that there is also another – a lot of other plant capacity coming to market? What’s the risk you might see in terms of lower prices longer term with the additional capacity from competitors in the space in and so would that kind of – and for me to wrap up?\nTheresa Wagler: Let me address the cost of the bio facility and then Barry and Mark can take the galvanizing pricing question. We believe that we are still kind of fine point on it, but it’s likely to cost somewhere between $200 million and $230 million for the entire project. But remember, it is a joint venture that we have with Aymium. And so we have 75% ownership of the facility and Aymium has 25% of the facility.\nBill Peterson: Okay. Thanks.\nMark Millett: And relative to the concern of overcapacity in almost over the years now, perhaps I have been in the industry too long. But everyone is – it wasn’t so long ago that there was going to be overcapacity in the iron ore business and it’s going to go down to $35 a ton. And then it was the sheet issue where I think everyone is recognizing now that with the continued shutdown of the old inefficient high-cost assets in the integrated business in the country. The desire for low-carbon products that we are not going to see a material impact to any increase in the sheet market. And I think the same with coated people are gravitating to produce their parts with more coated. I can remember cause a not so long ago, the outside skin was just galvanized and now you look at a car today and almost every single piece is galvanized. So, demand is increasing for sure. The world is getting lighter gauge galvanized so the line time of – goes up and thus the actual sort of effective throughput of the line is – lines are going down today. So, we are not overly concerned.\nBill Peterson: Appreciate the color. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from John Tumazos at Very Independent Research.\nJohn Tumazos: Thank you. In planning Sinton, you have 1.8 million tons of customers on your campus. The buy end to the distributor based in Houston, for coating lines as well as the customer opportunities in Mexico, you were describing more than the 3 million-ton capacity. As you are ramping up, how are you allocating the volume among those customers? It appears as though there is more customers and China output. What specifications have you been not yet gotten to melting and casting and rolling in terms of chemistries, gauges, widths, etcetera?\nBarry Schneider: John, this is Barry. As far as product dimensions, we have explored everything that we believe we needed to do. So, we are doing light gauge to heavy stuff, full with the products. We have done many different of the metallurgical needs from vacuum degas products all the way up through the range of different steels we would make. We are minded to do automotive there, but those types of trials require us to really get an idea of what our line capabilities are. So, we are doing those. We are doing the same with the API type products. And that requires us to have confidence in the data so that we design the best products to go into trials. We do have customers in both areas taking material. So, we are doing it in a very controlled manner to make sure that again, we are understanding the unique capabilities that Sinton has. So, at this point, the broad swath of products, we have done something for almost every single thing we hope to sell. And it’s more about getting more data, getting more characteristics from how we produce those things. And at the same time, establishing those internal, how we process things is very important. Just this week, the ISO certification audits are going on. So, it’s very important that we do this as our customers expect. But right now, good progress. We are excited by it and we will look to optimize each of our units. So, we have always had a very diverse order book so that we have many small markets that we can participate in. So, we are focused on making sure that we are feeding all of the different buckets, keeping all of our lines operational as we ramp up and bring these new coating lines online. So, it’s a very controlled structure, and we are trying to be very respected to the customer base that’s very anxious to receive these products.\nMark Millett: Yes, John, I guess we remain – this is what is happening. Hopefully, you can hear us still. But we remain incredibly excited by what we have seen in Sinton. As I have said earlier, we can sell everything we can make and a whole bunch more. We are really excited about the additional galv line and pre-paint line down there that will allow us to, as we have done at Columbus and at Butler diversify the product mix and bring even more value add to it. The energy products, the ability to thermal mechanical roll produce those higher strength grades, the high tough grades at lower cost is working incredibly well. And that’s going to be a great market for us down there. And those products are value-add. It may be hot band, but you accrue a good premium for those products. And we are also seeing in the plate arena, great potential then. One of the on-site processes that you mentioned that we co-locate is a real heavy plate cutter length line. And we feel there is going to be massive opportunity there, particularly as the infrastructure growth occurs and plate is going to be a big component in that. So Sinton, it’s incredible. One needs to go there to really experience it. The equipment reliability issues are frustrating, but it’s absolutely a state-of-the-art mill. The team is excited. They will get that thing running for blast in time. And it will be the technology of choice going forward.\nOperator: That concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Millett for any closing remarks.\nMark Millett: Well, thank you. And for those still on the call, our employees, in particular, thank you for what you do each and every day. You do drive a success. We can’t do things without you. Our customers, thank you for your loyal support. And our shareholders, thank you those that are invested in us. We will continue to treat your dollars just like they are our own. We are going to continue to grow them. And we have a huge bright future ahead of us, Sinton kicking in the aluminum going forward, the growth momentum continues. So, thank you.\nOperator: Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today’s call. Thank you for your participation, and have a great and safe day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mark Millett",
            "content": "Thank you, David and good morning everybody. Thank you for being with us on our second quarter earnings call. Once again, our teams achieved a solid financial and operational quarter. Highlights included continued safety improvement, 81% of our facilities were incident free through the quarter, our cash from operations of $808 million and EBITDA generation of $1.2 billion. We also received improved investment-grade credit ratings, providing further third-party confirmation of the strength of our business model. We are also making significant progress on our aluminum flat-rolled investments. There is great excitement within the prospective customer base for new and innovative supply chain solutions from a differentiated supplier. I am incredibly proud of our teams. They are the foundation of our company and they drive our success. Is their culture of excellence, combined with our meaningful value-added growth, diversification and supply chain positioning that is resulting in our earnings strength in all market cycles? However, as I have often said, great financial performance is of no importance without safety for our SDI family. We are focused on providing the very best for their health, safety and welfare. We are actively engaged in safety at all times and at every level, keeping it top of mind and an active conversation. Our focus, as I said, the team's safety performance further improved in the second quarter, way ahead of industry averages. There is more to do, we will not rest until we consistently achieve our goal of zero injuries. But before I continue, Theresa, would you like to give us some financial color. Thank you, Theresa. And hopefully, folks can hear us, I know it's – I guess is not quite up to snuff today, so I apologize for that. But nonetheless, our steel fabrication platform turned in another strong quarter. The team continues to do an absolutely phenomenal job there, one second. Everyone apologies, but it appears that many folks can't hear us, hear the call. I would ask you to hang up and call back in and we will just pause the call for a second. Thank you. Well, good morning again. Apparently, I believe you heard everything that's been said, but it's very, very choppy. So obviously, we will clarify things in the Q&A that perhaps you didn't hear. I was just kicking off our steel fabrication platform turned in another strong quarter. That team continues to do an absolutely phenomenal job. So thank you to each and every one of them. We continue to have high expectations for that business and we believe non-residential construction markets will continue to be strong in the coming years. Non-residential starts and build rates are forecast to remain strong through the rest of this year and into ‘24 and related spending has been higher in 2023 compared to last year at this time. Continued onshoring of manufacturing businesses, coupled with infrastructure spending and fixed asset investment related to the IRA programs, should provide momentum for additional construction spending and extend the whole non-residential construction cycle. Equally important, our customers tell us demand remains solid and share our perspective. Our steel fabrication order backlog has shortened from its all-time high of over 12 months achieved in 2022, but it remains very strong from a historical perspective, extending into January of 2024 with a strong pricing profile. Current order entry pricing remains resilient, and we expect second half ‘23 volumes to be comparable to the first half 2023 shipments. We also believe average pricing will remain elevated, but possibly drift 10% to 15% lower than average for the first half of the year. Not only a significant contributor itself, our fabrication platform provides meaningful pull-through volume for our steel mills, particularly important in softer markets, allowing for higher through-cycle utilization rates compared to our peers. It also provides an effective natural hedge to lower steel prices. Our metals recycling platform achieved a strong second quarter despite price declines. After rising in the first quarter, scrap prices pulled back May through July with shredded scrap prices falling almost $100 a ton. We expect scrap pricing to fluctuate modestly during the second half of the year, perhaps seasonally rising somewhat in the third quarter and moderating again in the fourth. Our metals recycling geographic footprint provides a strategic competitive advantage for our electric arc furnace steel mills and our scrap generating customers. In particular, our Mexican volumes competitively advantaged our Columbus and Sinton raw material positions. They will also strategically support aluminum scrap procurement for our future flat-rolled aluminum investments. Our metals recycling team is partnering even more closely with both our steel and aluminum teams to expand scrap segregation capabilities through process and technology solutions. This will preclude prime first scrap supply issues in the future. It will also provide margin enhancement from the aluminum scrap streams and materially increased recycled content of our aluminum sheet products. Our steel operations achieved near record shipments of 3.2 million tons and solid financial results in the second quarter. Our steel production utilization rate, excluding Sinton, was 93% compared to a domestic industry rate of 76%. Our higher utilization rates have been clearly demonstrated throughout all market cycles and is manifested by our value-added diversified product offerings, which amount to about 70% of our sales today, competitive advantage supply chain solutions, which is driving customer preference and mitigating price volatility, and the support of internal pull-through manufacturing volume. Our higher through-cycle utilization rate is a key differentiator and supports our strong and growing through-cycle cash generation capability and best-in-class financial metrics. Looking forward, backlogs are strong and the customer order entry is good. Auto production is good with expectations of higher output in 2023 relative to 2022 rates and dealer inventories have improved, but still remain below historical norms. Non-residential construction remains strong. Our long product steel backlogs are solid. Onshoring and infrastructure spending should provide further meaningful support in the coming years. The turndown in residential construction seems to be abating. Oil and gas activity is strong, driving improved orders for OCTG and solar continues to grow substantially. At Sinton, the team achieved positive EBITDA for the second quarter and produced shy of 390,000 tons, which is about 52% of full capacity, which is obviously lower than we had planned. But that said, the team has done a phenomenal job to get to that EBITDA positive position. Some of that lack of utilization was being on a single electrical furnace for a portion of the quarter. As we announced on July 1, we experienced equipment issues with the cast this year. Repairs are well underway, and we should be restarting within the next few days. Once we started, we fully expect to progressively ramp up month-over-month to an 80% run rate by the end of the year. The team has demonstrated the key competitive advantages of the mill. We have four product dimensional capability. That has been proven all the way out to 84-inch down to the 057 and up to 1-inch think. Customers are reporting surface quality to be exceptional. Our strip mill design has allowed for the thermal mechanical rolling, allowing the production of higher strength grades with lower alloy content and thus lower costs. Grade 80, grade 100 have been achieved, and we've been approved on and shipped some API grades. And it affirms our technical process choices, and there is no doubt that this is the next-generation electric arc furnace flat-rolled steel technology of choice. We have gained strong market acceptance and can sell everything we make and then sell. Our exceptional through-cycle operating and financial performance continues to support our cash generation and growth investment strategies relative to our expansion into aluminum, responses from both current and new customers across all market sectors remains incredible. We are developing the mill site to co-locate processing and consuming operations as we have successfully done in Sinton, and we have a number of customers already speaking with us about such opportunities, which would be a competitive and sustainably competitive model for all of us. To recap the project. It's a 650,000 metric ton aluminum flat roll facility, which will be located in Columbus, Mississippi, right across the highway essentially from our steel mill there. State-of-the-art facility serving the sustainable beverage and packaging markets, both including body and the automotive arena and industrial sectors. Specifically, we're targeting 300,000 tons of can, 200,000 tons of auto and 150,000 tons of industrial product. The on-site melt slab capacity of 600,000 metric tons will be supported by two satellite recycled aluminum slab casting centers. We are purchasing and we should be closing on land, both in San Luis Policy-central Mexico and also in the Southwest U.S. in the next 2 or 3 weeks. The mill includes two cash lines for automotive, coating line, downstream processing and packaging lines. We expanded the project scope to include additional scrap processing and treatment to maximize aluminum recycled content. All the principal equipment has been ordered, we anticipate rolling mill start up around mid ‘25. The Mexico slabs center should be January 1, the ‘25 and the Southwest U.S. slab center sometime in the first quarter of the ‘25. Total project cost, including the recycled slab centers should be $2.5 billion. 100% of that is going to be funded with cash. We expect to add $650 million to $700 million of through-cycle annual EBITDA to the company through that investment, plus around $40 million to $50 million of additional earnings from the Omni recycling platform. And from an investment premise perspective, we just see a market environment not unlike that in the steel industry when we started SDI 30 years ago. Old assets, little reinvestment, heavy legacy costs, inefficiency and high-cost operations. significant aluminum flat rolled supply deficit is existing today in North America and is expected to grow in the coming years. And we see a real business alignment whereby we can leverage our core competencies of construction strength on operational know-how and our culture to truly leverage and exploit the technology. We also will be able to leverage Omni's recyclement footprint and maximize recycled content of the product. We believe it's a very, very cost-effective, high return growth for us. And again, the existing and new customer interest and support is quite unbelievable. In closing, we are excited. We're impassioned by the future growth opportunities as they will continue the high returning growth momentum we've consistently demonstrated over the years. And we're celebrating our 30th year in business this August, and there are only better things to come. Our teams are our foundation, and I thank each of them for their passion and their dedication and their commitment. And we are committed to them. I remind those listening today that safety for yourselves, your families and each other is our highest priority. There is nothing more important. Our culture and business model continue to positively differentiate our performance leading to best-in-class financial metrics. As I said, I think, on the last call, we're no longer a pure steel company, but an integrated metals business providing an enhanced supply chain solutions to the industry, which in turn, mitigates volatility in cash flow generation through all market cycles. We're competitively positioned and continue to focus on providing superior value for our company, customers, team members and shareholders alike. We look forward to creating new opportunities for all of us today and in the years ahead. So with that said, Holly, we would love to hand the call over to you and start the Q&A session. Good morning. Absolutely not. We remain very, very bullish now. If you go back like a year now, perhaps the folks were projecting that demand would grow and you need four new aluminum mills. We didn't believe that then. We don't believe that now. But we certainly feel there is more space than to satisfy our market share for sure. The kind of the – sort of the pull back, I would say, is more an inventory standpoint. There is a lot of inventory people panicked a lot last year. That inventory has to flow through the system. And there is absolutely no doubt that it is doing so today. And in all honesty, when our mill comes up, I think that the marketplace is going to be in a beautiful place for us to receive product. Are you going to look longer-term, there definitely is a social change away from POC plastic bottles that will continue. It's not just beer, it's water, it's all fluids. And then when you look at the automotive arena, we believe and we've – with our communications with virtually all the automotive folks, they have been restrained from developing greater volumes of aluminum through the lack of availability. We're providing that availability going forward. And I think we – just as we've done in steel, we will gain market share quite rapidly. So from a market perspective, we are still very bullish that the amount of interest we have across the aluminum space is incredible. And I think I said it on our last call, in steel, we've never entered a market that is underserved. Every market we've gone into, we've had to differentiate ourselves to gain market share. It's refreshing for us that people are actually coming to us and when you combine that need with our ability to change the supply chain to provide much greater value to the customer base, I think we're confident to gain that market share quite rapidly. Yes. Carlos, thanks for the question. The marketplace is a little frothy right now. I would say the recent – the most recent change here in the CRU downward here yesterday or the day before in our mind doesn't represent the market dynamics that's going on at the time. Well, the – actually, the outage – the actual specific cost it was well under $1 million. It – as Barry said, the issue was just getting parts and just the size of the equipment involved, it wasn't necessarily a large expense to repair. And the second part of that, sorry. Well, again, as you saw or as you heard from our comments, we are just tempering our expectations. We have always had higher expectations. And we just believe once we get up and running here in the next few days, we were at – when we shutdown 52%, 55% or thereabouts, we are just suggesting now that month-over-month we are going to progressively ramp up to that 80% by the end of the year. And then into next year, we will continue to incrementally ramp up to full production through ‘24. Good morning Timna. From – other than a small little bit of non-ferrous, we have no export activity other than Mexico. We certainly capitalized a little on the AMSA situation down there. And even as they restart, and obviously, there is a lot of projections as to how quickly they restart, if they restart. But we are quite confident that the customer base there around AMSA certainly in Monclova has recognized that single sourcing is a huge mistake. And even with an arms of startup, we are going to continue to secure a lot of that business that we have and market share that we have gained. And relative to the concern of overcapacity in almost over the years now, perhaps I have been in the industry too long. But everyone is – it wasn't so long ago that there was going to be overcapacity in the iron ore business and it's going to go down to $35 a ton. And then it was the sheet issue where I think everyone is recognizing now that with the continued shutdown of the old inefficient high-cost assets in the integrated business in the country. The desire for low-carbon products that we are not going to see a material impact to any increase in the sheet market. And I think the same with coated people are gravitating to produce their parts with more coated. I can remember cause a not so long ago, the outside skin was just galvanized and now you look at a car today and almost every single piece is galvanized. So, demand is increasing for sure. The world is getting lighter gauge galvanized so the line time of – goes up and thus the actual sort of effective throughput of the line is – lines are going down today. So, we are not overly concerned. Yes, John, I guess we remain – this is what is happening. Hopefully, you can hear us still. But we remain incredibly excited by what we have seen in Sinton. As I have said earlier, we can sell everything we can make and a whole bunch more. We are really excited about the additional galv line and pre-paint line down there that will allow us to, as we have done at Columbus and at Butler diversify the product mix and bring even more value add to it. The energy products, the ability to thermal mechanical roll produce those higher strength grades, the high tough grades at lower cost is working incredibly well. And that's going to be a great market for us down there. And those products are value-add. It may be hot band, but you accrue a good premium for those products. And we are also seeing in the plate arena, great potential then. One of the on-site processes that you mentioned that we co-locate is a real heavy plate cutter length line. And we feel there is going to be massive opportunity there, particularly as the infrastructure growth occurs and plate is going to be a big component in that. So Sinton, it's incredible. One needs to go there to really experience it. The equipment reliability issues are frustrating, but it's absolutely a state-of-the-art mill. The team is excited. They will get that thing running for blast in time. And it will be the technology of choice going forward. Well, thank you. And for those still on the call, our employees, in particular, thank you for what you do each and every day. You do drive a success. We can't do things without you. Our customers, thank you for your loyal support. And our shareholders, thank you those that are invested in us. We will continue to treat your dollars just like they are our own. We are going to continue to grow them. And we have a huge bright future ahead of us, Sinton kicking in the aluminum going forward, the growth momentum continues. So, thank you."

            "name": "Theresa Wagler",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. I add my sincere appreciation and congratulations to the entire team for another strong performance. Our second quarter 2023 net income was $812 million or $4.81 per diluted share with, as Mark mentioned, EBITDA of $1.1 billion. Second quarter 2023 revenues of $5.1 billion were higher than sequential first quarter results, driven by increased realized steel selling values. Our second quarter operating income of $1.1 billion was 27% higher than first quarter results as a result of significantly expanded steel metal spread. As we discuss our business this morning, we are positive with industry fundamentals for the remainder of 2023 and beyond and we are focused toward our continued transformational growth. Our steel operations generated strong operating income of $706 million in the second quarter due to metal spread expansion and near-record shipments of 3.2 million tons. High realized pricing more than offset moderately higher scrap costs in the quarter. We realized increased pricing and metal spread across both our flat-rolled and our long product steel operations. As a reminder, we are the primary domestic steel supplier into the railroad rail market as well as a producer of all other long steel products, including structural steel, special bar quality, merchant shapes, specialty shapes and reinforcing bar with over 4.5 million tons of annual capacity. Operating income from our metals recycling operations was $40 million, consistent with sequential first quarter results due to increased shipments being offset by lower metal spreads. The team continues to lever our circular manufacturing model benefiting us by providing high-quality, lower cost scrap, which improves furnace efficiency and reduces company-wide working capital. Our Mexico recycling operations also provide a competitive advantage for reliable supply as well as for future increased scrap aluminum collection. We are the largest North American metals recycler today processing and using ferrous scrap and non-ferrous aluminum, copper and other metals. Our steel fabrication operations achieved operating income of $462 million in the second quarter lower than first quarter results, but historically strong as average pricing decreased 13% and volumes were steady. Our steel joist and deck order backlog extends into the first quarter of 2024. It has contracted from record highs experienced in 2022 as shipments have outpaced spot order activity. However, forward backlog pricing remains very strong and price – spot pricing remains very resilient. Based on our backlog, customer sentiment and manufacturing momentum, we expect steel fabrication earnings to remain strong, but slightly lower than the first half of 2023 levels for the second half of the year. Infrastructure Inflation Reduction Act, Department of Labor, decarbonization support and manufacturing onshoring are expected to support not only fixed asset investment in steel consumption, but also steel joist index demand in the coming years. Our cash generation continues to be strong based on our differentiated circular business model and variable cost structure. At June 30, our liquidity was $3.5 billion, inclusive of our recently renewed unsecured $1.2 billion revolver. I'd like to congratulate the team. They actually refinanced revolver yesterday. So thank you to Rick and Dominic. During the second quarter of 2023, we generated cash flow from operations of $808 million and $1.5 billion for the first half of the year. During the first half, we invested $585 million in fixed asset investments. We believe capital investments for the second half of the year will be in the range of $1 billion, the vast majority relating to our aluminum flat-rolled investments and the completion of our four flat-rolled steel coating lines by the end of 2023. In February, we increased our cash dividend 25% and repurchased $734 million or 3.9% of our outstanding shares in 2023. At June 30, $606 million remained authorized for repurchase under our existing $1.5 billion program that we put in place during November of 2022. Since 2017, we have increased our cash dividend 174% and repurchased $4.8 million of our common stock, representing 39% of our outstanding shares. And recognition of our growth, strong balance sheet profile and consistent free cash flow generation capability, last month, we received upgrades, as Mark mentioned, to our investment grade credit designation from both Moody's and from S&P. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes high-return growth with shareholder distributions comprised of a positive base dividend that's complemented with a variable share repurchase program, while we remain dedicated to our investment-grade credit designation. We have placed ourselves in a position of strength to have a sustainable capital foundation that supports meaningful strategic growth strong shareholder returns and investment grade metrics. Our free cash flow profile has fundamentally increased over the last 5 years from an annual average of $580 million to $2.6 billion currently. Our aluminum growth strategy is consistent with this strategy. We will readily fund our flat-rolled aluminum investments with available cash and cash flow from operations. We also plan to continue strong and responsible shareholder distributions as we have clearly demonstrated. We are squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable optimized long-term value creation. Sustainability is also a significant part of our long-term value creation strategy and we are dedicated to our people, our communities and our environment. We are committed to operating our businesses with the highest integrity. We have an actionable path towards carbon neutrality that is more manageable and we believe considerably less expensive than they may lay ahead for many of our industry and other peers. Our sustainability and carbon reduction strategy is an ongoing journey and we are moving forward with the intention to make a positive difference playing a leadership role. For those of you on the call, I'd like to track the product differentiation among our flat-rolled shipments. For the second quarter, our hot-rolled shipments were 972,000 tons, our cold-rolled shipments were 149,000 tons, and our coated shipments were 1,150,000 tons. With that, I will turn the call back over to Mark. Thanks, Curt. This is Theresa. So I appreciate the question. When Mark said that the average pricing was expected to be down 10% to 15%, that was just for clarity for everyone on the call, that was measuring the first half of 2023 to the second half of 2023. So it wasn't specific to a point in time or specific to the second quarter itself. And we would say that we expect the cadence to be pretty equal from that step down in the third quarter and then stepping down a bit finally into the fourth quarter. Pricing is stable. It's been very – I think the term we keep using is resilient, and that's something that we pointed to in the past. We think there is been a structural shift in pricing for steel fabrication as there is really a lack of substitutability when you think about steel joist and deck and there is a very good demand today and we think increasing demand with the momentum behind manufacturing for all the different reasons that we pointed to this morning. The backlog has a good pricing, very strong pricing from a historical perspective. And I think that we see that heading very favorably into the first quarter. And frankly, we were just talking about it this morning, as you think about a lot of the public monies in those programs, those are being awarded, especially with the IRA and some of the Department of Labor dollars. Those are getting awarded sometime this fall kind of call it late third quarter, early fourth quarter. So that should really benefit 2024 and 2025 as you think about manufacturing and construction. And definitely, steel fabrication will benefit from that. Thanks, Curt. Yes. So as it relates to the mix of the backlog and I would say more so even in the current order intake activity. We have seen – and I think it's positive for the economy in general. We've seen a more projects coming in from, whether it be education, healthcare, definitely manufacturing. So we're starting to even see the electric vehicle batteries. We've seen the chips we've seen a lot of advent and manufacturing from onshoring new things that we've talked about. So there is a mix towards those type of projects and away from just purely retail warehouses, which we've been seeing and talking about for a while now, probably 6 to 9 months. As it relates to capital spending for 2024, we expect to have capital spending for the aluminum project this year is likely to be somewhere between $900 million and $950 million in total. Next year for the aluminum project is likely to be about $1.2 billion. So when you combine that with additional growth projects as well as a minimal amount of maintenance capital. We're likely to have total capital spending in 2024 from what we can see today, still around that $1.5 billion for the year. Cleve, just as a quick reminder. In the last several years, they have had domestically the consumers of aluminum sheet actually had to import about 20% of their needs, and that had high tariffs associated with that imported costs. So there is definitely room for just 630,000 tons of additional supply. Tristan, this is Theresa. Thanks for the question. So we – generally, we don't give guidance as it relates to specifics on shipments. And if you look historically, the third quarter is going to be generally the strongest shipment quarter. that we have in shipments for steel simply because of seasonality. Sinton is going to be down for July. We are still running the coal mill and the value add lines, which will help to place some of the lost volume. But we're likely to have lost volume of anywhere between 50,000 and 70,000 tons of total steel shipments as it relates to the sheer outage in July. Other than that, we really can't give you any additional guidance, but as Mark mentioned, the backlogs across the steel platform are very strong and order activity has been very good. Tristan, we can't give specific pricing related to the commercial teams would be after me. So, I think what we have said about pricing for fabrication is that the pricing has been very resilient. We have strong pricing in the backlog, but we did mention that there are expectations that pricing on average from – compared to the first half of the year, pricing on average for the second half of the year is likely to be down 10% to 15%, but we do believe pricing is stable, and it's been very resilient. No, Carlos. I would say that Mark – what Mark said is that we are going to have kind of an even pace we expect of ramp-up in the second half of this year for 2023 to get up to that 80%. But then we will reach the 100% of capacity very quickly in 2024. You're welcome. Thanks Bill. So, the biocarbon facility is actually going really well. The teams have done a lot of groundwork already. The major equipment is either has been ordered or is on order and some of it is actually going to be received fairly shortly. So, the team is doing a phenomenal job. I am very proud of them in Mississippi and the expectations are that it will start before the end of 2024. There is nothing left to prove as far as the product itself. There is a facility in Marquette, Michigan that Aymium operates, which is the technology provider. And we have tested the product extensively, both for injection and charge carbon. So, we don't have any expectations for anything other than a wonderful product that we can replace eventually 100% or a very large portion thereof of our anthracite usage going forward. So, everything is going really, really well. Let me address the cost of the bio facility and then Barry and Mark can take the galvanizing pricing question. We believe that we are still kind of fine point on it, but it's likely to cost somewhere between $200 million and $230 million for the entire project. But remember, it is a joint venture that we have with Aymium. And so we have 75% ownership of the facility and Aymium has 25% of the facility."

            "name": "Barry Schneider",
            "content": "Yes, this is Barry. I'd just like to comment that those bearing issues we talked about at the tail end of last year, our teams mitigated most of the effects of that. We have a supply chain now that is both a more robust design and a more robust supply chain. So we're really excited about the quality improvements and really the reliability of those casting segment parts. We believe our long-term plans, we kind of approached it with several different prongs. And all of them are really being successful and it's to the point now that we can manage it very well and we're operating at full capacity, as Marc spoke, all capabilities of the machine right now are in place. So we believe long-term, that's going to be not an issue going forward that it will just continue to be high reliability and continuing high quality. Yes, that – we had a caster sheer issue just here at the beginning of July, not related to the bearing issue, perhaps as you mentioned with the casting machine. And it's kind of a technical issue with the caster sheer. And suffice to say it's large parts that we wanted to make sure we had put in properly and we are taking this opportunity to address a couple of other issues, but we anticipate that facility being up and operational in the next few days. Our team has done a phenomenal job for working together and getting the scope of a project. We're super excited. Mark and I were down there for moral support, definitely not getting in the way of the guys making the repairs. But great to see this team just really owning their technology and bringing it forward. So we anticipate this problem to be behind us. And we think we've put in really good things to mitigate any future failures that are similar to this. Timna, this is Barry. We are anticipating bringing the new coding and the galvanizing lines, paint lines on at the end of the year. But I wouldn't expect any kind of a significant contribution to shipment still going into 2024. But the lines are constructing very well. There continues to be supply chain issues with certain parts of the construction, but we are resolving those and mitigating them and moving stuff, teams are very active in manned up. So, we look forward to bringing these lines on, but it will be near the end of the year. Yes. Timna, this is Barry again. We have been doing quite a bit of shipments into Mexico this year. Sin is uniquely – the capabilities of Sin are sitting are unique for what the Mexican markets are. So, being able to get some heavier gauge products and wider products down there has been a very good place for us to develop relationships. So, we have been down in shipping to Mexico for a long time, but significantly so in the first half of this year and we continue to do more of that, especially through our campus partners at the Sinton facility. So, we see that as a really good business and continuing to grow forward. John, this is Barry. As far as product dimensions, we have explored everything that we believe we needed to do. So, we are doing light gauge to heavy stuff, full with the products. We have done many different of the metallurgical needs from vacuum degas products all the way up through the range of different steels we would make. We are minded to do automotive there, but those types of trials require us to really get an idea of what our line capabilities are. So, we are doing those. We are doing the same with the API type products. And that requires us to have confidence in the data so that we design the best products to go into trials. We do have customers in both areas taking material. So, we are doing it in a very controlled manner to make sure that again, we are understanding the unique capabilities that Sinton has. So, at this point, the broad swath of products, we have done something for almost every single thing we hope to sell. And it's more about getting more data, getting more characteristics from how we produce those things. And at the same time, establishing those internal, how we process things is very important. Just this week, the ISO certification audits are going on. So, it's very important that we do this as our customers expect. But right now, good progress. We are excited by it and we will look to optimize each of our units. So, we have always had a very diverse order book so that we have many small markets that we can participate in. So, we are focused on making sure that we are feeding all of the different buckets, keeping all of our lines operational as we ramp up and bring these new coating lines online. So, it's a very controlled structure, and we are trying to be very respected to the customer base that's very anxious to receive these products."

As you read, once again our teams achieved a solid financial and operational quarter. It was highlighted by most importantly, a consecutive quarter of significant safety improvement. 82% of our facilities were incident free and most importantly, our piece of focus appears to be minimizing severity rate. We had record steel shipments of 3.3 million tons and adjusted EBITDA generation of a strong $950 million. Sinton's performance is showing improvement with a clear path to profitability in the second quarter '23 given the expectation of increased volumes. And we are also making great progress on our aluminum flat rolled investment. There's great excitement within the prospective customer base for a new and innovative supply chain solution. As always, I'm incredibly proud of our teams. They are the foundation of our company and they drive our success. It is their culture of excellence and the intentional diversification of our product portfolio that allows us to maintain higher utilization rates and maximize opportunities, resulting in higher lows and higher highs through all market cycles and producing superior financial metrics. However, for safety, great financial performance is of no import without having our team safe. Often, employees are described as a company's most important resource. But for us, for Steel Dynamics they're more than that, they're family. And now we number over 12,000 strong. We're focused to provide the very best for their health, safety and welfare. We're actively engaged in safety at all times, keeping it top of mind and an active conversation at every level of the organization. With that focus, as I mentioned, the teams safety performance further improved in the first quarter '23. But there's more to do, and we will not rest until we consistently achieve our goal of zero injuries throughout our organization. So with that said, and before I pursue the quarter, Theresa.\nTheresa Wagler: Good morning, everyone. It's great to join you. I had my sincere appreciation and congratulations to the entire team for another strong operational and financial performance this quarter. Our first quarter 2023 net income was $637 million or $3.70 per diluted share, which includes costs of about $77 million, or $0.31 per diluted share associated with the startup of our Sinton Texas flat-rolled steel mill. Excluding those costs, first quarter 2023 adjusted net income was $691 million or $4.01 per diluted share. First quarter 2023 revenues of $4.9 billion were slightly higher than sequential fourth quarter results driven by record steel volume and increased metals recycling prices. Our first quarter operating income of $835 million was 10% higher than fourth quarter results driven by record steel volume. As we discussed our business this morning, we see positive industry fundamentals for 2023 and beyond, and we're focused toward a continued transformational growth initiative. Our steel operations generated strong operating income of $345 million in the first quarter. As record shipments of 3.3 million tons were partially offset by lower realized selling values. I also want to say congratulations to our structural and rail division, as they had another record earnings quarter supported by a strong construction market. Our flat-rolled steel mills were negatively impacted during the quarter with high cost pig iron that was purchased in early 2022 during the early stages of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Based on current pig iron prices, earnings were impacted by approximately $50 million in the first quarter, but we have worked through that higher priced inventory now. Operating income from more metals recycling operations was $43 over threefold fourth quarter results due to increased demand, driving higher prices and volume. Our Mexican recycling operations have proven to be a strategic key for both sourcing scrap for our southern steel mills and driving profitability. Thanks to the Zimmer and Roka teams. We appreciate you. The team continues to effectively lever the strength of our circular manufacturing operating model benefiting both our steel and metals recycling operations by providing higher quality scrap, which improves furnace efficiency and by reducing companywide working capital requirements. Our steel fabrication operations achieved strong operating income in the quarter of $551 million, but lower than record fourth quarter results due primarily to seasonally lower shipments. Steel joists and deck demand remains very strong as evidenced by continued robust order activity. Specifically, our March order activity was extraordinarily strong. This is resulting in a strong order backlog extending into October and November of 2023. Based on our backlog, customer sentiment and manufacturing momentum, we expect steel fabrication earnings to remain strong throughout the year, including the second half. Our cash generation continues to be strong based on our differentiated circular business model and highly variable cost structure. At March 31, we had record liquidity of $3.5 billion, comprised of cash and short-term investments of $2.3 billion, and our fully available unsecured revolver of $1.2 billion. During the first quarter of 2023, we generated cash from operations of $734 million. We spent approximately $226 million on capital expenditures. We believe for the full-year of 2023, capital investments will be in the range of $1.5 billion, the majority of which relates to our aluminum flat-roll mill investments. In February, we increased our cash dividend 25% to $0.425 per common share. Based on our ability to consistently generate strong cash flow and aligned with our growth strategy. We also purchased $354 million of our common stock, representing approximately 2% of our outstanding shares. At March 31, $980 million remained authorized for repurchase under our new plan. Since 2017, we've increased our cash dividend per share by 174%, and we've repurchased $4.5 billion of our common stock, representing over 30% of our outstanding shares. These actions reflect the strength of our capital foundation and the consistently strong cash flow generation capability. We continue to be optimistic and confident in our future. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes high-return strategic growth with shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that's complemented with a variable share repurchase program. While we remain dedicated to preserving our investment-grade credit designation. We've strategically placed ourselves in a position of strength to have a sustainable capital foundation that provides the opportunity for meaningful strategic growth and strong shareholder returns, while maintaining investment grade metrics. Our free cash flow profile has fundamentally changed over the last five years from an annual average of $580 million to today's average of $2.6 billion. Our aluminum growth strategy is consistent with our unchanged capital allocation philosophy. We will readily fund our flat-rolled aluminum investments with available cash and cash flow from operations. We also plan to continue strong and responsible shareholder distribution as we have clearly demonstrated. We're squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable optimized long-term value creation. Sustainability is also a significant part of our long-term value creation strategy, and we're dedicated to our people, our communities, and our environment. We are committed to operating our business with the highest integrity. In that regard, we will remain excited about our joint venture with Aymium, a leading producer of renewable biocarbon products. We believe our first joint facility could decrease our steel Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 35%. And I want to specifically thank the biocarbon solutions team in Columbus, Mississippi that are doing a fantastic job and we still hope to start operating this facility in early 2024. We have an actionable path towards carbon neutrality that is more manageable and we believe considerably less expensive than what may lay ahead for many of our industry peers. Our sustainability and carbon reduction strategy is an ongoing journey and we're moving forward with the intention to make a positive difference. We plan to continue to address these matters and to play a leadership role moving forward. Before I hand the call back to Mark, for those of you that keep specific track of our flat-rolled shipments in the first quarter, we had hot-rolled and P&O shipments of 1,006,000. We had cold-rolled shipments of 132,000 and coated shipments of 1,192,000 tons. Mark?\nMark Millett: Thank you, Theresa. Although there was some seasonality in shipping volume for fabrication, we saw yet another strong quarter driven by the sustained market strength and an absolutely extraordinary execution by our team. Productivity of our operations is incredible. So thank you for all for the great job you all are doing up there. We continue to have high expectations for the fabrication business. We believe non-residential construction markets will continue to be robust in the coming years. Non-residential starts and build rates are forecast to remain strong throughout '23 and related spending has been significantly higher so far in '23 compared to last year at this time. There'll be continued onshoring of manufacturing businesses and infrastructure spending programs should provide momentum for additional incremental construction spending. More real time, our customers tell us demand remains solid, as confirmed by strong order entry rates, especially the most recent March order activity. Steel fabrication order backlog as Theresa suggested, extends seven to eight months into October, November with strong pricing dynamics. Not only a significant contributor onto itself, our fabrication platform provides meaningful pull through volume for our steel mills, particularly important in softer markets, allowing for higher through-cycle utilization rates. It also provides an effective natural hedge to lower steel price. Our metals recycling platform achieved a strong first quarter. Congratulations to them. They are on a path to higher volumes and increased metal margin. After seven consecutive months of declining pricing in '22 ferrous scrap prices improved in December and throughout the first quarter. Increasing well over a $100 per gross ton. We expect scrap pricing to remain fairly steady at these higher levels based on increased seasonal North American steel mill demand in Q2 and Q3. Our metals recycling geographic footprint provides a strategic competitive advantage for our steel mills and our scrap generating customers. In particular, our growing Mexican volumes enhance our Columbus and Sinton raw material positions. It will also strategically support aluminum scrap procurement for our future flat-rolled aluminum investments. Our metals recycling team is working closely with both our steel and aluminum teams to expand scrap separation capabilities through process and technology solutions. Our low residual shred 1 is just one example of that. The impact of these efforts, along with others in the industry is demonstrated that innovation will provide ample ferrous and nonferrous scrap supply in the years ahead. Our steel operations achieved record quarterly shipments of 3.3 million tons and solid financial results in the first quarter. Steel production utilization rate excluding Sinton was 94% compared to a domestic industry rate of 75%. Our higher utilization rates are clearly demonstrated throughout all market cycles. Value-added diversified product offerings provide broad optionality across all market segments. Enhanced supply chain solutions is driving customer preference and were supported by the internal pull through manufacturing volume. Our higher through cycle utilization rate is a key differentiator and supports our strong and growing through-cycle cash generation capability and best-in-class financial metrics. Looking forward, customer order entry is good and backlogs are solid. March in particular was a very strong booking month for the steel platform. Auto is solid. Auto production is expected to increase in '23 over '22 rates and dealer inventories have improved but still remain below historical norms. Build rate in '22 was some 14.3 million units, and we expect '23 to show 15.1 and a little higher in '24. Nonresidential construction remains strong, as evidenced by strong fabrication backlog and long product steel volumes. Our long products are seasonally solid from a backlog perspective and onshoring and infrastructure spending should provide further meaningful support in the coming years. Residential construction has softened to some degree, but that erosion appears to be easing a little, but that segment tends to be a small part of our overall portfolio. Oil and gas activity is very strong, driving improved orders for OCTG and line pipe and solar continues to grow appreciably. At Sinton, we produced 420,000 tons of hot band in the quarter, which is 56% of eventual capacity. Fifth and daily records were achieved in March, clearly demonstrating the mill's ability to reach the 3 million tons. As we discussed in our first quarter call, production through the quarter was impacted by certain supply chain issues related to bearings and rolls needed for the caster. This issue has now been resolved, and we expect a significant advance in productivity and earnings in Q2 and we should see the mill being EBITDA positive in Q2 for sure. We believe full-year capacity utilization could be in the range of 80% of rated capacity. The team has clearly demonstrated the key competitive advantages of the Texas Steel Mill. Full product dimensional capability has been proven. We have gone down to 50-ish and all the way up to one inch and all the way out to 84 inch width. The customers are reporting that the surface quality is absolutely exceptional. The hot strip mill design has allowed for thermal mechanical rolling, which allows the production of higher strength grades with lower alloy content with a significant reduction in production cost. Grade 80, Grade 100 has been achieved and we've already been approved and shipped some API grades. In my mind, this affirms our technical and process choices. And there's no doubt that this is the next generation electric arc furnace flat rolled steel technology of choice. We certainly have gained strong market acceptance. Commercially, we can sell everything we make and then some. With the Caster segment issue resolved, we're able now to fully lever our heavy gauge wide capability. Our onsite customers are busy with two of them already expanding their capabilities. Our exceptional through-cycle operating financial performance continues to support our cash generation and growth investment strategies. Relative to our expansion into aluminum, the market response from both current and new customers across our targeted market segments has been incredible. But to recap the project, that's a 650,000 metric ton aluminum flat rolled facility that will be located in Columbus, Mississippi. State-of-the-art facility serving the sustainable beverage and packaging, automotive and industrial sectors reproduces roughly 300,000 metric tons of can sheet, 200,000 metric tons of auto and 150,000 metric tons of industrial alloy. On-site melt cast slab capacity will be 600,000 metric tons, and that'll be supported by two satellite recycled aluminum slab casting centers, one in Central Mexico. We've already purchased the property there, and we're pursuing a Southwest U.S. site as we speak. Technology will include two cast lines, coating lines, and dense stream processing and packaging. We've expanded the project scope to include additional scrap processing and treatment to maximize aluminum recycle content. All the principal equipment is already on order, and we expect the roller mill to start up mid-'25, the Mexico Slab Center second half of '24 and the Southwest Slab Center probably the first quarter of '25. Total project cost, including the recycled slab centers is expected to be $2.5 billion, 100% to be funded with available cash and cash flow from operations. As we've said in the past, the expectation is to add somewhere between $650 million to $700 million of through-cycle annual EBITDA for the aluminum project, plus likely $40 million to $50 million for Omni. I think it's a very, very compelling investment premise. We see a market environment not unlike that in the steel industry when we started SDI 30 years ago. It's predominantly owed assets, little reinvestment, heavy legacy costs is inefficient with high cost operations. A significant aluminum flat roll supply deficit exists in North America and is expected to grow in the coming years. There is business alignment, we can leverage our core competencies of our construction strength and operational know how and also lever Omni's recycling footprint as Omni is the largest North American aluminum scrap recycler today. SDI culture will drive high efficiency and low cost and throughout the industry, there's a very steep cost curve which is going to support margin, a very, very cost effective, high return growth initiative. We're excited and impassioned by our future growth opportunities as they will continue the high returning growth momentum we have consistently demonstrated over the years. We were added to the S&P 500 Index in '22. We are arguably one of the top five steel producers in the world as measured by market cap and the third largest in North America relative to capacity. All these achievements in a relatively short time frame. We celebrate our 30th year in our business in '23 and there are only better things to come. Our teams are our foundation and I thank each of them for their passion and their dedication and we are committed to them. And I remind those listening today that safety for yourselves, your families and each other is our highest priority. Our culture and business model continue to positively differentiate our performance, leading to best-in-class financial metrics. We're no longer a pure steel company, but an integrated metals business, providing enhanced supply chain solutions to the industry, in turn mitigating volatility and cash flow generation through all market cycles. We're competitively positioned and continue to focus on providing superior value for our company, customers, team members and shareholders alike. And we look forward to creating new opportunities for all of us today and in the many years ahead. So, with that all said, I'd like to open the floor up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question is coming from Emily Chieng from Goldman Sachs. Your line is live.\nEmily Chieng: Good morning, Mark and Theresa. Thank you for taking my questions this morning. I wanted to ask a bit about the fabrication volume expectation there and just trying to take a look at the 1Q number. It certainly was a little weaker than anticipated. You mentioned that there was some seasonality and some customer supply chain constraints there. Can you provide some color as to what they were? And how we move past this and anything you'd highlight as we look forward to the rest of the year as to what that volume trajectory could look like?\nTheresa Wagler: Thanks, Emily. It's a great question. And there was seasonality in the first quarter, but there was also some movement because some of the customers are experiencing supply chain constraints as it relates to construction labor and as it relates to materials. And so it's just simply pushing out orders. It's not changing the entirety of the volume itself. So the order backlog with some of these projects has actually pushed out even further than into that October, November time frame. So it's a shifting of volume, I guess is how I would phrase it. As Mark mentioned, and I mentioned in my notes as well, March was an extraordinary order entry for our steel and joists deck business. And that really is, I think a testament to the strength of that market today. And if you think about the benefits that are kind of outside of just normal construction arena, if you think about manufacturing that has momentum behind it because of the Inflation Reduction Act, because of the infrastructure program, manufacturing onshoring et cetera, we really expect our fabrication business to experience very strong volumes this year as it's supported by those extraneous additional tailwinds, if you will.\nEmily Chieng: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Curt Woodworth from Credit Suisse. Your line is live.\nCurt Woodworth: Thank you. Good morning, Mark and Theresa. A follow-up question on fabrication as well for me. In the past, you've talked about backlog pricing in the $5,000 per ton level. We've been hearing that price has definitely come in a lot from kind of peak levels last year. So I just wanted to get a sense for if you could comment on pricing you're seeing in the market. And then you talked about the March order entry being very good. Can you give us a sense of what the makeup of that backlog or that order entry is? And then if you give any comments on EBITDA per ton expectations?\nTheresa Wagler: Curt, you're trying to be tricky. You know, we won't give EBITDA per ton, but I appreciate you trying. As it relates to the order activity, to give you a sense of it, it was well more than double the order activity that we've seen kind of in the more recent time frame, January, February, December time frame. So it was incredibly robust. And most of that activity came from what I'm going to call industrial and manufacturing related business. So I think one needs to keep in mind when people talk about nonresidential construction, I think they like to hone in on office space. And there's many other categories as it relates to what would impact steel joists and deck demand. And that's where we're seeing a lot of momentum. So that order activity for us is very much focused on those larger projects. And I think that's where the funding from those projects, a lot of the times are actually already funded. They're not bank funded, but they're project oriented funding from large corporations themselves or now there's public funding support as it relates to decarbonization efforts and the Department of Energy and the excess funds that will be coming in those arenas as well. So there's a lot of extra things, I think that will support the volume going forward. But for us, it's primarily in that industrial manufacturing base at this point in time. As it relates to pricing, the commercial teams would be very upset with me. Barry is laughing, if I were to try to give any commercial guidance at this point, I would tell you that as we've said in the past, the average price in the entirety of the order backlog is still very high from a historic perspective. It's not at the peak pricing that we saw, but it's very much aligned with what we have seen for the entirety of last year as an average.\nCurt Woodworth: Okay, that's helpful.\nMark Millett: And just for clarity, when we say that the backlog isn't peak pricing, the sustained backlog, that's kind of extending out is at very, very, very good past pricing. The new pricing coming in, as you mentioned, is off a little from that for sure, but relative to a historic basis, it is way, way higher than historic norm.\nCurt Woodworth: Okay, and then just a quick follow-up on Sinton, as we think about that asset running 56% utilization, but having a net loss of $70 million. We would think that given where metal spreads are today, if that asset could be 70% utilized in the second quarter, it theoretically should make a lot of money, right, but it seems like there's still some kind of lingering startup issues, and you talked about some of the supply chain constraints. So can you help us understand a little bit about maybe the earnings power of that asset later this year or any frame of reference in terms of 2Q, in terms of what you think utilization rates could look like? Thank you.\nMark Millett: Certainly. Great question. I'd say if you look at the first quarter and certainly the fourth quarter, you had -- you might say a couple of extraneous impacts from a cost perspective. We obviously have higher price pig iron coming through, given our order early last year, second quarter of last year with the Russia and Ukraine sort of crisis. So that is peeling out now through the first quarter and a little bit in April. In anticipation of early startup of the downstream lines, we bought substrate, and again, that was at higher pricing, and that had to come through the system, and that is essentially sort of out of the system today. So we were carrying that sort of burden in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter, and some of it will come into the second, but it's substantially reduced. Obviously, the main principal driver is volume. Volume, volume, volume drives the successful performance of any major capital asset, and certainly a startup asset such as this. We were at 56%. And our confidence in the technology, I think at least for me, is driven by windows of absolute amazing performance. Where we've had shifts, we've had weeks. We're at 75%, 80% of capability already. If you look at sequence lengths, which we and our industry for sure is an indication of the effectiveness of the teams and the equipment. We're averaging, I think a little over 13 heats sequence. We've been as high as 22 heats, 23 heats, and each heat is whatever 200, 210 tons per heat. My mind amplifies the capability of the asset. We just have to get the reliability of all the equipment. And again, as you know, Curt, it's in line. So the melt shop, the ladle furnace, the caster, the rock and mill, the finishing mill, everything has to be running in unison. And we're getting there with the segment bearing and role issue behind us, not hindering us. I think we're looking for a sort of a step function improvement here in the next month or two.\nTheresa Wagler: Just as a reminder, on through cycle basis, we still believe very strongly that sitting, when it has four of the value added lines operating, we'll have a through cycle EBITDA in the range of $450 to $500 million per year. So that outlook hasn't changed. So it is a significant benefit long-term. It's just a matter of this year.\nCurt Woodworth: Okay. Thanks. Best of luck.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Carlos De Alba from Morgan Stanley. Your line is live.\nCarlos De Alba: Great. Thank you. I'm just going to try it in a different way without maybe discussing the absolute levels. It is clear that the EBITDA per ton and the profitability of the fabrication business is extraordinary relative to history. It actually started based on what I've seen before the pandemic, but it exploded throughout the pandemic and it has remained at those levels. How do you see the normalization relative to say 2019 or 2017 to '19 average? Do you expect to be able to sustain a significantly higher profitability relative to that '17 to '19 average, even if it is lower than what we're experiencing today? I mean you probably understand that we're trying to figure it out what is a much more normal potential run rate of profitability in that business, just given how extraordinary the results have been? Thank you.\nTheresa Wagler: Carlos. Thanks. I know everyone's trying to figure that out. And what I would say to that is, yes, we do believe that going forward, we're going to have -- there has been a structural shift and change in how the commercial aspect of the steel joist and deck business has materialized in the last two years, if I would say it that way. And the change is that, first of all, there's considerable volume and we believe that demand is going to stay in place for a considerable amount of time. There's limited supply. So in today's environment, and I think in the future environment, it's not so much as looking at just a product itself. But this is a highly engineered product, so it's looking at a product as well as a service. And that service is requiring time on the mill or time in the facility itself. And that has a value. And that's what now has come to the force that the customers understand there's a time element and a service element, as well as a very highly engineered product set. So we believe those are structural changes. And I think that that came to bear and was proven in the second half of 2022 when steel prices actually were being reduced pretty significantly. And we think an overcorrection. And yet we had increasing pricing within our steel joist and deck facilities themselves. So we do believe there's a structural change. I can't help you more than that. I would tell you that we expect very strong volumes this year to be comparable to last year. And I think that we've told you we've got an order backlog that goes out into October, November, and it has a significantly higher price. And that price is not too far off of what the average pricing would have been for 2022. So I think we've given you a lot of data points to hopefully help you with your estimates.\nCarlos De Alba: That's great color, Theresa. Thank you very much. And if I may squeeze one more, maybe Mark, could you comment as to how you see right now obviously, that could change. But right now, how do you see the ramp up profile in terms of capacity utilization of the flat-rolled ali project?\nMark Millett: Slowly, I think the -- again, as I said earlier, I'm expecting a step function improvement in the second. I'm sorry.\nCarlos De Alba: Yes, the ali, the aluminum project. Yes, Sinton you mentioned. Yes.\nMark Millett: I would suggest that it's and that's a great question in honesty, because we're wrestling with that. Ourselves right now to be honest, and trying to understand fully the -- some of the approval certification process of can sheet as opposed to auto sheet. The fact that we're creating slab ahead of time will aid that, and the fact that we have on the automotive side some very, very good relationships with two or three key auto producers that are seeking our aluminum. And I think that will accelerate that certification process. So, from the standpoint of actual ramp, it would imagine it wouldn't be too much different than you would expect for any facility. Sort of 50% for the first 12 months, 80% for the second 12 months, and then ramping up thereafter. That would be probably as good estimation as I would suggest to you.\nCarlos De Alba: Great. Thank you very much, Mark.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Timna Tanners from Wolfe Research. Your line is live.\nTimna Tanners: Hey, good morning, everyone. Wanted to start off and ask a little bit more color on garage doors. I know you have a great position in garage doors and also on the warehousing side, if you could provide some more color on those end markets?\nMark Millett: Certainly garage door is off a little, Timna, for sure, in concert or in parallel with the residential erosion. But typically, as you see -- typically as you see the housing market come off. You see the replacement business go up. So it's not one for one, but it is off a little bit. The warehouse market. I think when you're talking about warehouse market, I'm assuming you're looking at the sort of distribution warehouse type facilities.\nTimna Tanners: All right.\nMark Millett: Obviously there's been a lot of focus on the fact that Amazon overbuilt. Amazon wasn't a principal customer of ours. The other warehouse distribution organizations are not off to that same degree. That said, cloud computing pharma is very, very, very strong. And as Theresa mentioned, you're starting to see true sort of reshoring sort of industrial manufacturing growth, the Tesla's of the world, the battery facilities, that sort of thing.\nTimna Tanners: Okay, that's helpful. Thanks. I wanted to follow-up on sitting a little bit to think about the cadence of when we're going to see some of these mix shifts or improvement in the mix with the value add. So just I know you talked about the galv lines coming on, and I also wanted to think about when we might see some more inroads into auto, given your ability to make the thicker slabs and perhaps penetrate that market earlier than other Minnie mills. Can you talk a little bit more about when we should start to see, first, the galvanized capacity ramp up within sitting and also the potential for penetrating exposed auto in the next several years?\nMark Millett: We're really excited with the ramp up of the galvanizing down at Sinton. We do have to feed our paint lines right now, so we are working automotive discussions and trials into our production plants, but we're also anxious on making sure the whole plants operational. All these units starting together. We want to feed the paint line, we want to feed our broader range of customers in the galvanized. We're really excited about the capabilities that we've seen in the galv line itself, paired with our technology on the hot side. So we are excited about the surface quality especially. That was one of the big decision makers for us. And to this point, we're really excited. We have not begun actually putting material into automotive plants, but we're engaging with customers that have entrusted our future with them and they're excited they come to the shop and they see a path. So our technical teams are very much in discussions there and very much complemented with our Columbus operations that are doing the workhorse of the automotive today. So we're excited to see it, and I think it has to happen at a pace that technical people are comfortable with, so that we can -- once we earn that business, we can entrust it with them that we're going to be shipping a good product into them. And obviously, Timna, the -- my watch has gone off, sorry? My ears are such that I don't hear high pitched voices. Well, definitely voices, but any sound. So if you heard my watch alarm, I apologize. But Timna, I think the auto penetration is going as planned, though. And if you look at the strength of our business model, the strength of Sinton itself, it's a very, very, very diversified product portfolio. And we can leverage different market segments and give us greater optionality. So currently the energy is incredibly strong. OCTG market line pipe is strong, and that will continue. I think, for the rest of this year, going into the next year, particularly with the infrastructure build out. And we're seeing actually, and it's surprising us a little bit, perhaps, but the energy markets for heavy plate or heavier plate, heavier products anyway, that we produce at any of our other mills, that is something that we're starting to leverage, particularly now we've got the caster issue behind us and can go up to full 1-inch thick. So we can sort of dance and work through or work around the different market segments. To be honest, that's the strength of Sinton. It's the strength of all of our flat-rolled facilities.\nTimna Tanners: If I could sneak one in on Sinton. I forgot to ask about the Mexican exports. I've been hearing, actually, that's been a big advantage for sitting in and other mills in the south. Do you think that's more sticky than taking a share from AMSA being closed, or how much do you expect that could stick, assuming AMSA restarts?\nMark Millett: Well, I think the AMSA situation certainly is aided both not just the Mexican market, but the U.S. market, because Mexican output and capability has been sort of focused or redirected squarely within the Mexican market itself. So that's helped us. I think the customer base of AMSA is when you go through a shockwave like this, you sort of reflect on your future. And I think they see a need for optionality. But even when AMSA comes back, I think we're confident, in all honesty, of maintaining a lot of that business. So it's been very fortuitous for us.\nTimna Tanners: Makes sense. Okay. Thanks for the detail.\nMark Millett: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Tristan Gresser from BNP Paribas Exane. Your line is live.\nTristan Gresser: Yes, hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. The first one, and I apologize, it's again about the fabrication outlook. You flagged that you're targeting volumes of last year. So strong volumes, is that fair then to assume a strong pickup than in volumes into Q2? And also the second part to that question is maybe on the moving pieces there for the outlook. It's also on the cost side, can you discuss a little bit the cost side there especially into Q2? I mean, we've seen flat steel prices double over the past month. The backlog is kind of locked. So anything you can say there in terms of potential cost pressure into Q2 that would be helpful.\nTheresa Wagler: Thanks, Tristan for the question. Yes, as it relates to volume, I mean traditionally, you're always going to have your strongest construction months and project months and quarters in the second and third quarter. So we absolutely would expect to see stronger volumes in that time frame for our fabrication business, as well. As it relates to cost, we generally sometimes it changes, but we generally keep around eight weeks or so of steel on the ground for our fabrication business, uniquely, we use primarily flat rolled steels, a little bit of merchant steels in the process. So if you can kind of follow that bouncy ball with how you feel the pricing will look going forward and what's done in the recent past, and that should give you some inclination of how the metal margin will move pushing forward into the second quarter.\nTristan Gresser: All right, that's helpful. So the price increase we've seen has not been reflected at all.\nTheresa Wagler: Yes, it lags about eight -- it would lag around eight to 10 weeks.\nTristan Gresser: All right.\nMark Millett: I want to emphasize the obvious here, because we all tend to sometimes focus near-term, but the New Millennium fabrication business as a whole is incredibly important, A, for pull-through volume, particularly in softer markets, as we said earlier, allowing the higher utilization rate through our steel mill. But it's also in this environment, maybe as steel pricing comes up, you get a little bit of squeeze and vice versa on the other side, opposite side. But there's a very strong natural hedge to our business here, and we've been very intentional with our growth into sort of value add, sort of diversification of our portfolio and the businesses that we grow to try and mitigate that volatility of through-cycle cash generation and not be as cyclical as we once were maintaining higher highs and higher lows, for sure.\nTristan Gresser: Okay, that makes sense. And maybe a quick follow-up on working capital, we've seen quite a good release in Q1, how would you see that evolve moving forward?\nTheresa Wagler: Yes, so as we talked about it, there was a lot, there was a significant amount of working capital build in 2022. Much of that was not structural. It had to do with us layering on some additional raw materials with pig iron, some additional substrate that Mark mentioned. So we have been able to work through most, if not all of that. We still expect to have some working capital give back as we head into the second quarter, as we kind of still right size some of our inventory levels, et cetera. So it may not be as significant of a benefit as you've seen in the last two quarters, but we definitely think working capital will be a funding source heading into the second quarter.\nTristan Gresser: Okay, perfect. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Andreas Bokkenheuser from UBS. Your line is live.\nAndreas Bokkenheuser: Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. Two quick questions for me. One on steel and one on ali. On steel, you're very obviously growing your volumes both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year, and it certainly looks to be faster than the market. So you guys seem to be capturing market share. Assuming you agree with that, can you give us a little bit of color on where specifically you're capturing market share from peers? Is it non-res? Is it autos? Is it energy, possibly all of the above. But is anything kind of standing out? And maybe also why you're able to capture that market share, obviously. And then secondly, on the ali question, obviously you're targeting automotive, among other sub-industries. Where specifically will the ali go in automotive? Is this going into auto body sheet that historically has been dominated by steel and especially steel supplied by the blast furnaces? Is that where you envision the aluminum to go? Those are my two questions. Thank you very much.\nMark Millett: Okay. Well, for the standpoint of our increase in volumes, I would say yes, we are picking up market share. The geographic location of the Sinton, Texas plant is pivotal. Obviously, that was an underserved market. We have access into Mexico now much, much, much cheaper than any other U.S. mill to the tune of, well, we can get it down there for $40 -- $30. Yes, $30 sorry whereas if you're bringing it down from Northern Indiana, it's probably $100 plus. So there's massive geographic sort of advantage for that mill. And we're picking up, as I said, Mexican market. We're picking up energy again because of that location, OCTG and line pipe. So that is one sort of driver, the second driver, I think and I got to applaud the automotive team. They've done a phenomenal job over the last two or three years. The traction there is amazing, particularly with the European auto producers and we're favored because of our carbon footprint and our sustainability sort of profile. Our mills will be, they report, not us, but they report that our Columbus facility for instance, and our Butler facility are probably some of the lowest facilities or carbon producing facilities in the world. We're gaining a lot of market share from that. I think that those are probably the principal gains there. And then on the aluminum, firstly, there is a substantial supply deficit. That industry in can sheet and aluminum is reliant on a very, very large portion of imports today. So we would intend or believe that our low cost position, our efficiency and our commercial approach will be very, very well received and will offset A, some of those imports and B, pick up the share of growth in that industry. You mentioned kind of the steel aspect. Having aluminum in our portfolio gives us the advantage, I guess, if there is a steel decline in any one area with a pickup in aluminum, we can we can penetrate that or take advantage of that.\nAndreas Bokkenheuser: That is clear. Thank you very much.\nMark Millett: Sorry, sorry, sorry, where is it going? Again, the facility is not -- in this case, unlike our start in and steel, we're not revolutionizing the technology necessarily. It's absolute state-of-the-art technology for sure. But it will have the same capability of any high class new aluminum facility in the world. So both unexposed and exposed.\nAndreas Bokkenheuser: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from John Tumazos from Tumazos Independent Research. Your line is live.\nJohn Tumazos: Thank you.\nMark Millett: Good morning, John.\nJohn Tumazos: Congratulations on all the progress. I'm looking at your almost $1 billion of cash flow for uses in the quarter, it's just so large and formidable without Sinton at a positive EBITDA and sheet prices were a little low. The numbers are just so big. My first question is, what will you do with all the money? Would you perhaps invest more in scrap? Ferrous scrap, non-ferrous iron ore, lots of opportunities and raw materials or resources. And second, you had a $418 million deduction from cash flow for accrued expenses. I was just curious, what was such a big accrual?\nTheresa Wagler: John, I'll take the last one. That's a simple one. We have a companywide profit sharing plan. That's how we provide for retirement for all of our 12,000 people. And it's simply 8% of pretax earnings. And since we had a record 2022, we were able to give all the employees $422 million in total. And that payment went out in March. So that's the reason for the significant change.\nJohn Tumazos: So it should really be almost amortized uniformly over the quarters from the standpoint of forecasting cash flow?\nTheresa Wagler: Yes. Well, I mean, you could do it that way, but in actuality, it comes out in March. But, yes, you could look at it that way.\nJohn Tumazos: The first quarter had that big deduction from it, and it was still a lot of money?\nTheresa Wagler: That's correct.\nMark Millett: And actually, John, if you're within about 100 miles of any of our facilities on March the 15th, you would have heard the shout and screaming and the crying as to the amazing thing that is and it's massive, massive, massive boost to our employees. And as I tell each and every one of them, it is not a gift. Each and every one of them has earned that profit sharing check. So sorry that's profit sharing. Relative to investing our wealth, so to speak, scrap iron sort of backwardly integrating is not a primary target, certainly iron is certainly not a target at this moment in time. We will and we are looking at options for during a strategic supply of our own pig iron, a green supply, so that's ongoing but not a massive capital expenditure once we move forward with that. On the scrap side, we are spending money on segregation, different ways of cleaning up all the different scrap flows to maximize, a recycled content in the aluminum business and also to reduce the residual level of the obsolete flow again to supplant some of the prime scrap. And that's working out incredibly well, particularly when there's a good spread between obsolete and prime. Not only are you securing a flow of prime scrap, but the cost impact is very, very, very significant reduction in cost or savings. But again we are -- smaller, smaller investments in segregation there, you see us spend a few dollars expanding our scrap footprint in the Southwest, but we're not talking about anything that's going to impact the balance sheet. In all honesty, we expect that that cash flow to continue. And we will continue, I think just the same cash allocation strategy that we've had in the past with a strong balance sheet, huge liquidity, it allows us to have a balanced perspective. We'll continue to have a positive dividend profile. You saw us increase, was it 25% here earlier this year. We'll continue to repurchase our shares. We think it's still at an incredible value today, sure. We're continuing with the organic growth. We got the four coating lines going in, start up later this year. We got the aluminum project and the team for 30 years have continually found good, cost effective, high returning organic growth projects. And there's a bunch in the pipeline there. And obviously, we continue to review the sort of M&A activity as it comes across our desk. So we're very, very blessed for sure.\nJohn Tumazos: Thank you. And congratulations.\nMark Millett: Thank you, John.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for any closing remarks.\nMark Millett: Super, thank you. Well, again for those that are still on the call, I just want to appreciate your time today. Appreciate your support for our customers. Thank you, thank you, thank you. We can't do it without you. And to our sure, our team, each and every one of you, you do an absolutely phenomenal job each and every day. And just do one thing for us and me personally, be safe, look after each other. Have a good day. Bye-bye.\nOperator: Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation and have a great and safe day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mark Millett",
            "content": "Thank you, David. Good morning, everybody. We certainly appreciate you all joining us for our first quarter earnings call today. As you read, once again our teams achieved a solid financial and operational quarter. It was highlighted by most importantly, a consecutive quarter of significant safety improvement. 82% of our facilities were incident free and most importantly, our piece of focus appears to be minimizing severity rate. We had record steel shipments of 3.3 million tons and adjusted EBITDA generation of a strong $950 million. Sinton's performance is showing improvement with a clear path to profitability in the second quarter '23 given the expectation of increased volumes. And we are also making great progress on our aluminum flat rolled investment. There's great excitement within the prospective customer base for a new and innovative supply chain solution. As always, I'm incredibly proud of our teams. They are the foundation of our company and they drive our success. It is their culture of excellence and the intentional diversification of our product portfolio that allows us to maintain higher utilization rates and maximize opportunities, resulting in higher lows and higher highs through all market cycles and producing superior financial metrics. However, for safety, great financial performance is of no import without having our team safe. Often, employees are described as a company's most important resource. But for us, for Steel Dynamics they're more than that, they're family. And now we number over 12,000 strong. We're focused to provide the very best for their health, safety and welfare. We're actively engaged in safety at all times, keeping it top of mind and an active conversation at every level of the organization. With that focus, as I mentioned, the teams safety performance further improved in the first quarter '23. But there's more to do, and we will not rest until we consistently achieve our goal of zero injuries throughout our organization. So with that said, and before I pursue the quarter, Theresa. Thank you, Theresa. Although there was some seasonality in shipping volume for fabrication, we saw yet another strong quarter driven by the sustained market strength and an absolutely extraordinary execution by our team. Productivity of our operations is incredible. So thank you for all for the great job you all are doing up there. We continue to have high expectations for the fabrication business. We believe non-residential construction markets will continue to be robust in the coming years. Non-residential starts and build rates are forecast to remain strong throughout '23 and related spending has been significantly higher so far in '23 compared to last year at this time. There'll be continued onshoring of manufacturing businesses and infrastructure spending programs should provide momentum for additional incremental construction spending. More real time, our customers tell us demand remains solid, as confirmed by strong order entry rates, especially the most recent March order activity. Steel fabrication order backlog as Theresa suggested, extends seven to eight months into October, November with strong pricing dynamics. Not only a significant contributor onto itself, our fabrication platform provides meaningful pull through volume for our steel mills, particularly important in softer markets, allowing for higher through-cycle utilization rates. It also provides an effective natural hedge to lower steel price. Our metals recycling platform achieved a strong first quarter. Congratulations to them. They are on a path to higher volumes and increased metal margin. After seven consecutive months of declining pricing in '22 ferrous scrap prices improved in December and throughout the first quarter. Increasing well over a $100 per gross ton. We expect scrap pricing to remain fairly steady at these higher levels based on increased seasonal North American steel mill demand in Q2 and Q3. Our metals recycling geographic footprint provides a strategic competitive advantage for our steel mills and our scrap generating customers. In particular, our growing Mexican volumes enhance our Columbus and Sinton raw material positions. It will also strategically support aluminum scrap procurement for our future flat-rolled aluminum investments. Our metals recycling team is working closely with both our steel and aluminum teams to expand scrap separation capabilities through process and technology solutions. Our low residual shred 1 is just one example of that. The impact of these efforts, along with others in the industry is demonstrated that innovation will provide ample ferrous and nonferrous scrap supply in the years ahead. Our steel operations achieved record quarterly shipments of 3.3 million tons and solid financial results in the first quarter. Steel production utilization rate excluding Sinton was 94% compared to a domestic industry rate of 75%. Our higher utilization rates are clearly demonstrated throughout all market cycles. Value-added diversified product offerings provide broad optionality across all market segments. Enhanced supply chain solutions is driving customer preference and were supported by the internal pull through manufacturing volume. Our higher through cycle utilization rate is a key differentiator and supports our strong and growing through-cycle cash generation capability and best-in-class financial metrics. Looking forward, customer order entry is good and backlogs are solid. March in particular was a very strong booking month for the steel platform. Auto is solid. Auto production is expected to increase in '23 over '22 rates and dealer inventories have improved but still remain below historical norms. Build rate in '22 was some 14.3 million units, and we expect '23 to show 15.1 and a little higher in '24. Nonresidential construction remains strong, as evidenced by strong fabrication backlog and long product steel volumes. Our long products are seasonally solid from a backlog perspective and onshoring and infrastructure spending should provide further meaningful support in the coming years. Residential construction has softened to some degree, but that erosion appears to be easing a little, but that segment tends to be a small part of our overall portfolio. Oil and gas activity is very strong, driving improved orders for OCTG and line pipe and solar continues to grow appreciably. At Sinton, we produced 420,000 tons of hot band in the quarter, which is 56% of eventual capacity. Fifth and daily records were achieved in March, clearly demonstrating the mill's ability to reach the 3 million tons. As we discussed in our first quarter call, production through the quarter was impacted by certain supply chain issues related to bearings and rolls needed for the caster. This issue has now been resolved, and we expect a significant advance in productivity and earnings in Q2 and we should see the mill being EBITDA positive in Q2 for sure. We believe full-year capacity utilization could be in the range of 80% of rated capacity. The team has clearly demonstrated the key competitive advantages of the Texas Steel Mill. Full product dimensional capability has been proven. We have gone down to 50-ish and all the way up to one inch and all the way out to 84 inch width. The customers are reporting that the surface quality is absolutely exceptional. The hot strip mill design has allowed for thermal mechanical rolling, which allows the production of higher strength grades with lower alloy content with a significant reduction in production cost. Grade 80, Grade 100 has been achieved and we've already been approved and shipped some API grades. In my mind, this affirms our technical and process choices. And there's no doubt that this is the next generation electric arc furnace flat rolled steel technology of choice. We certainly have gained strong market acceptance. Commercially, we can sell everything we make and then some. With the Caster segment issue resolved, we're able now to fully lever our heavy gauge wide capability. Our onsite customers are busy with two of them already expanding their capabilities. Our exceptional through-cycle operating financial performance continues to support our cash generation and growth investment strategies. Relative to our expansion into aluminum, the market response from both current and new customers across our targeted market segments has been incredible. But to recap the project, that's a 650,000 metric ton aluminum flat rolled facility that will be located in Columbus, Mississippi. State-of-the-art facility serving the sustainable beverage and packaging, automotive and industrial sectors reproduces roughly 300,000 metric tons of can sheet, 200,000 metric tons of auto and 150,000 metric tons of industrial alloy. On-site melt cast slab capacity will be 600,000 metric tons, and that'll be supported by two satellite recycled aluminum slab casting centers, one in Central Mexico. We've already purchased the property there, and we're pursuing a Southwest U.S. site as we speak. Technology will include two cast lines, coating lines, and dense stream processing and packaging. We've expanded the project scope to include additional scrap processing and treatment to maximize aluminum recycle content. All the principal equipment is already on order, and we expect the roller mill to start up mid-'25, the Mexico Slab Center second half of '24 and the Southwest Slab Center probably the first quarter of '25. Total project cost, including the recycled slab centers is expected to be $2.5 billion, 100% to be funded with available cash and cash flow from operations. As we've said in the past, the expectation is to add somewhere between $650 million to $700 million of through-cycle annual EBITDA for the aluminum project, plus likely $40 million to $50 million for Omni. I think it's a very, very compelling investment premise. We see a market environment not unlike that in the steel industry when we started SDI 30 years ago. It's predominantly owed assets, little reinvestment, heavy legacy costs is inefficient with high cost operations. A significant aluminum flat roll supply deficit exists in North America and is expected to grow in the coming years. There is business alignment, we can leverage our core competencies of our construction strength and operational know how and also lever Omni's recycling footprint as Omni is the largest North American aluminum scrap recycler today. SDI culture will drive high efficiency and low cost and throughout the industry, there's a very steep cost curve which is going to support margin, a very, very cost effective, high return growth initiative. We're excited and impassioned by our future growth opportunities as they will continue the high returning growth momentum we have consistently demonstrated over the years. We were added to the S&P 500 Index in '22. We are arguably one of the top five steel producers in the world as measured by market cap and the third largest in North America relative to capacity. All these achievements in a relatively short time frame. We celebrate our 30th year in our business in '23 and there are only better things to come. Our teams are our foundation and I thank each of them for their passion and their dedication and we are committed to them. And I remind those listening today that safety for yourselves, your families and each other is our highest priority. Our culture and business model continue to positively differentiate our performance, leading to best-in-class financial metrics. We're no longer a pure steel company, but an integrated metals business, providing enhanced supply chain solutions to the industry, in turn mitigating volatility and cash flow generation through all market cycles. We're competitively positioned and continue to focus on providing superior value for our company, customers, team members and shareholders alike. And we look forward to creating new opportunities for all of us today and in the many years ahead. So, with that all said, I'd like to open the floor up for questions. And just for clarity, when we say that the backlog isn't peak pricing, the sustained backlog, that's kind of extending out is at very, very, very good past pricing. The new pricing coming in, as you mentioned, is off a little from that for sure, but relative to a historic basis, it is way, way higher than historic norm. Certainly. Great question. I'd say if you look at the first quarter and certainly the fourth quarter, you had -- you might say a couple of extraneous impacts from a cost perspective. We obviously have higher price pig iron coming through, given our order early last year, second quarter of last year with the Russia and Ukraine sort of crisis. So that is peeling out now through the first quarter and a little bit in April. In anticipation of early startup of the downstream lines, we bought substrate, and again, that was at higher pricing, and that had to come through the system, and that is essentially sort of out of the system today. So we were carrying that sort of burden in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter, and some of it will come into the second, but it's substantially reduced. Obviously, the main principal driver is volume. Volume, volume, volume drives the successful performance of any major capital asset, and certainly a startup asset such as this. We were at 56%. And our confidence in the technology, I think at least for me, is driven by windows of absolute amazing performance. Where we've had shifts, we've had weeks. We're at 75%, 80% of capability already. If you look at sequence lengths, which we and our industry for sure is an indication of the effectiveness of the teams and the equipment. We're averaging, I think a little over 13 heats sequence. We've been as high as 22 heats, 23 heats, and each heat is whatever 200, 210 tons per heat. My mind amplifies the capability of the asset. We just have to get the reliability of all the equipment. And again, as you know, Curt, it's in line. So the melt shop, the ladle furnace, the caster, the rock and mill, the finishing mill, everything has to be running in unison. And we're getting there with the segment bearing and role issue behind us, not hindering us. I think we're looking for a sort of a step function improvement here in the next month or two. Slowly, I think the -- again, as I said earlier, I'm expecting a step function improvement in the second. I'm sorry. I would suggest that it's and that's a great question in honesty, because we're wrestling with that. Ourselves right now to be honest, and trying to understand fully the -- some of the approval certification process of can sheet as opposed to auto sheet. The fact that we're creating slab ahead of time will aid that, and the fact that we have on the automotive side some very, very good relationships with two or three key auto producers that are seeking our aluminum. And I think that will accelerate that certification process. So, from the standpoint of actual ramp, it would imagine it wouldn't be too much different than you would expect for any facility. Sort of 50% for the first 12 months, 80% for the second 12 months, and then ramping up thereafter. That would be probably as good estimation as I would suggest to you. Certainly garage door is off a little, Timna, for sure, in concert or in parallel with the residential erosion. But typically, as you see -- typically as you see the housing market come off. You see the replacement business go up. So it's not one for one, but it is off a little bit. The warehouse market. I think when you're talking about warehouse market, I'm assuming you're looking at the sort of distribution warehouse type facilities. Obviously there's been a lot of focus on the fact that Amazon overbuilt. Amazon wasn't a principal customer of ours. The other warehouse distribution organizations are not off to that same degree. That said, cloud computing pharma is very, very, very strong. And as Theresa mentioned, you're starting to see true sort of reshoring sort of industrial manufacturing growth, the Tesla's of the world, the battery facilities, that sort of thing. We're really excited with the ramp up of the galvanizing down at Sinton. We do have to feed our paint lines right now, so we are working automotive discussions and trials into our production plants, but we're also anxious on making sure the whole plants operational. All these units starting together. We want to feed the paint line, we want to feed our broader range of customers in the galvanized. We're really excited about the capabilities that we've seen in the galv line itself, paired with our technology on the hot side. So we are excited about the surface quality especially. That was one of the big decision makers for us. And to this point, we're really excited. We have not begun actually putting material into automotive plants, but we're engaging with customers that have entrusted our future with them and they're excited they come to the shop and they see a path. So our technical teams are very much in discussions there and very much complemented with our Columbus operations that are doing the workhorse of the automotive today. So we're excited to see it, and I think it has to happen at a pace that technical people are comfortable with, so that we can -- once we earn that business, we can entrust it with them that we're going to be shipping a good product into them. And obviously, Timna, the -- my watch has gone off, sorry? My ears are such that I don't hear high pitched voices. Well, definitely voices, but any sound. So if you heard my watch alarm, I apologize. But Timna, I think the auto penetration is going as planned, though. And if you look at the strength of our business model, the strength of Sinton itself, it's a very, very, very diversified product portfolio. And we can leverage different market segments and give us greater optionality. So currently the energy is incredibly strong. OCTG market line pipe is strong, and that will continue. I think, for the rest of this year, going into the next year, particularly with the infrastructure build out. And we're seeing actually, and it's surprising us a little bit, perhaps, but the energy markets for heavy plate or heavier plate, heavier products anyway, that we produce at any of our other mills, that is something that we're starting to leverage, particularly now we've got the caster issue behind us and can go up to full 1-inch thick. So we can sort of dance and work through or work around the different market segments. To be honest, that's the strength of Sinton. It's the strength of all of our flat-rolled facilities. Well, I think the AMSA situation certainly is aided both not just the Mexican market, but the U.S. market, because Mexican output and capability has been sort of focused or redirected squarely within the Mexican market itself. So that's helped us. I think the customer base of AMSA is when you go through a shockwave like this, you sort of reflect on your future. And I think they see a need for optionality. But even when AMSA comes back, I think we're confident, in all honesty, of maintaining a lot of that business. So it's been very fortuitous for us. You're welcome. I want to emphasize the obvious here, because we all tend to sometimes focus near-term, but the New Millennium fabrication business as a whole is incredibly important, A, for pull-through volume, particularly in softer markets, as we said earlier, allowing the higher utilization rate through our steel mill. But it's also in this environment, maybe as steel pricing comes up, you get a little bit of squeeze and vice versa on the other side, opposite side. But there's a very strong natural hedge to our business here, and we've been very intentional with our growth into sort of value add, sort of diversification of our portfolio and the businesses that we grow to try and mitigate that volatility of through-cycle cash generation and not be as cyclical as we once were maintaining higher highs and higher lows, for sure. Okay. Well, for the standpoint of our increase in volumes, I would say yes, we are picking up market share. The geographic location of the Sinton, Texas plant is pivotal. Obviously, that was an underserved market. We have access into Mexico now much, much, much cheaper than any other U.S. mill to the tune of, well, we can get it down there for $40 -- $30. Yes, $30 sorry whereas if you're bringing it down from Northern Indiana, it's probably $100 plus. So there's massive geographic sort of advantage for that mill. And we're picking up, as I said, Mexican market. We're picking up energy again because of that location, OCTG and line pipe. So that is one sort of driver, the second driver, I think and I got to applaud the automotive team. They've done a phenomenal job over the last two or three years. The traction there is amazing, particularly with the European auto producers and we're favored because of our carbon footprint and our sustainability sort of profile. Our mills will be, they report, not us, but they report that our Columbus facility for instance, and our Butler facility are probably some of the lowest facilities or carbon producing facilities in the world. We're gaining a lot of market share from that. I think that those are probably the principal gains there. And then on the aluminum, firstly, there is a substantial supply deficit. That industry in can sheet and aluminum is reliant on a very, very large portion of imports today. So we would intend or believe that our low cost position, our efficiency and our commercial approach will be very, very well received and will offset A, some of those imports and B, pick up the share of growth in that industry. You mentioned kind of the steel aspect. Having aluminum in our portfolio gives us the advantage, I guess, if there is a steel decline in any one area with a pickup in aluminum, we can we can penetrate that or take advantage of that. Sorry, sorry, sorry, where is it going? Again, the facility is not -- in this case, unlike our start in and steel, we're not revolutionizing the technology necessarily. It's absolute state-of-the-art technology for sure. But it will have the same capability of any high class new aluminum facility in the world. So both unexposed and exposed. Good morning, John. And actually, John, if you're within about 100 miles of any of our facilities on March the 15th, you would have heard the shout and screaming and the crying as to the amazing thing that is and it's massive, massive, massive boost to our employees. And as I tell each and every one of them, it is not a gift. Each and every one of them has earned that profit sharing check. So sorry that's profit sharing. Relative to investing our wealth, so to speak, scrap iron sort of backwardly integrating is not a primary target, certainly iron is certainly not a target at this moment in time.

Well, again for those that are still on the call, I just want to appreciate your time today. Appreciate your support for our customers. Thank you, thank you, thank you. We can't do it without you. And to our sure, our team, each and every one of you, you do an absolutely phenomenal job each and every day. And just do one thing for us and me personally, be safe, look after each other. Have a good day. Bye-bye."

            "name": "Theresa Wagler",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. It's great to join you. I had my sincere appreciation and congratulations to the entire team for another strong operational and financial performance this quarter. Our first quarter 2023 net income was $637 million or $3.70 per diluted share, which includes costs of about $77 million, or $0.31 per diluted share associated with the startup of our Sinton Texas flat-rolled steel mill. Excluding those costs, first quarter 2023 adjusted net income was $691 million or $4.01 per diluted share. First quarter 2023 revenues of $4.9 billion were slightly higher than sequential fourth quarter results driven by record steel volume and increased metals recycling prices. Our first quarter operating income of $835 million was 10% higher than fourth quarter results driven by record steel volume. As we discussed our business this morning, we see positive industry fundamentals for 2023 and beyond, and we're focused toward a continued transformational growth initiative. Our steel operations generated strong operating income of $345 million in the first quarter. As record shipments of 3.3 million tons were partially offset by lower realized selling values. I also want to say congratulations to our structural and rail division, as they had another record earnings quarter supported by a strong construction market. Our flat-rolled steel mills were negatively impacted during the quarter with high cost pig iron that was purchased in early 2022 during the early stages of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Based on current pig iron prices, earnings were impacted by approximately $50 million in the first quarter, but we have worked through that higher priced inventory now. Operating income from more metals recycling operations was $43 over threefold fourth quarter results due to increased demand, driving higher prices and volume. Our Mexican recycling operations have proven to be a strategic key for both sourcing scrap for our southern steel mills and driving profitability. Thanks to the Zimmer and Roka teams. We appreciate you. The team continues to effectively lever the strength of our circular manufacturing operating model benefiting both our steel and metals recycling operations by providing higher quality scrap, which improves furnace efficiency and by reducing companywide working capital requirements. Our steel fabrication operations achieved strong operating income in the quarter of $551 million, but lower than record fourth quarter results due primarily to seasonally lower shipments. Steel joists and deck demand remains very strong as evidenced by continued robust order activity. Specifically, our March order activity was extraordinarily strong. This is resulting in a strong order backlog extending into October and November of 2023. Based on our backlog, customer sentiment and manufacturing momentum, we expect steel fabrication earnings to remain strong throughout the year, including the second half. Our cash generation continues to be strong based on our differentiated circular business model and highly variable cost structure. At March 31, we had record liquidity of $3.5 billion, comprised of cash and short-term investments of $2.3 billion, and our fully available unsecured revolver of $1.2 billion. During the first quarter of 2023, we generated cash from operations of $734 million. We spent approximately $226 million on capital expenditures. We believe for the full-year of 2023, capital investments will be in the range of $1.5 billion, the majority of which relates to our aluminum flat-roll mill investments. In February, we increased our cash dividend 25% to $0.425 per common share. Based on our ability to consistently generate strong cash flow and aligned with our growth strategy. We also purchased $354 million of our common stock, representing approximately 2% of our outstanding shares. At March 31, $980 million remained authorized for repurchase under our new plan. Since 2017, we've increased our cash dividend per share by 174%, and we've repurchased $4.5 billion of our common stock, representing over 30% of our outstanding shares. These actions reflect the strength of our capital foundation and the consistently strong cash flow generation capability. We continue to be optimistic and confident in our future. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes high-return strategic growth with shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that's complemented with a variable share repurchase program. While we remain dedicated to preserving our investment-grade credit designation. We've strategically placed ourselves in a position of strength to have a sustainable capital foundation that provides the opportunity for meaningful strategic growth and strong shareholder returns, while maintaining investment grade metrics. Our free cash flow profile has fundamentally changed over the last five years from an annual average of $580 million to today's average of $2.6 billion. Our aluminum growth strategy is consistent with our unchanged capital allocation philosophy. We will readily fund our flat-rolled aluminum investments with available cash and cash flow from operations. We also plan to continue strong and responsible shareholder distribution as we have clearly demonstrated. We're squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable optimized long-term value creation. Sustainability is also a significant part of our long-term value creation strategy, and we're dedicated to our people, our communities, and our environment. We are committed to operating our business with the highest integrity. In that regard, we will remain excited about our joint venture with Aymium, a leading producer of renewable biocarbon products. We believe our first joint facility could decrease our steel Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 35%. And I want to specifically thank the biocarbon solutions team in Columbus, Mississippi that are doing a fantastic job and we still hope to start operating this facility in early 2024. We have an actionable path towards carbon neutrality that is more manageable and we believe considerably less expensive than what may lay ahead for many of our industry peers. Our sustainability and carbon reduction strategy is an ongoing journey and we're moving forward with the intention to make a positive difference. We plan to continue to address these matters and to play a leadership role moving forward. Before I hand the call back to Mark, for those of you that keep specific track of our flat-rolled shipments in the first quarter, we had hot-rolled and P&O shipments of 1,006,000. We had cold-rolled shipments of 132,000 and coated shipments of 1,192,000 tons. Mark? Thanks, Emily. It's a great question. And there was seasonality in the first quarter, but there was also some movement because some of the customers are experiencing supply chain constraints as it relates to construction labor and as it relates to materials. And so it's just simply pushing out orders. It's not changing the entirety of the volume itself. So the order backlog with some of these projects has actually pushed out even further than into that October, November time frame. So it's a shifting of volume, I guess is how I would phrase it. As Mark mentioned, and I mentioned in my notes as well, March was an extraordinary order entry for our steel and joists deck business. And that really is, I think a testament to the strength of that market today. And if you think about the benefits that are kind of outside of just normal construction arena, if you think about manufacturing that has momentum behind it because of the Inflation Reduction Act, because of the infrastructure program, manufacturing onshoring et cetera, we really expect our fabrication business to experience very strong volumes this year as it's supported by those extraneous additional tailwinds, if you will. Curt, you're trying to be tricky. You know, we won't give EBITDA per ton, but I appreciate you trying. As it relates to the order activity, to give you a sense of it, it was well more than double the order activity that we've seen kind of in the more recent time frame, January, February, December time frame. So it was incredibly robust. And most of that activity came from what I'm going to call industrial and manufacturing related business. So I think one needs to keep in mind when people talk about nonresidential construction, I think they like to hone in on office space. And there's many other categories as it relates to what would impact steel joists and deck demand. And that's where we're seeing a lot of momentum. So that order activity for us is very much focused on those larger projects. And I think that's where the funding from those projects, a lot of the times are actually already funded. They're not bank funded, but they're project oriented funding from large corporations themselves or now there's public funding support as it relates to decarbonization efforts and the Department of Energy and the excess funds that will be coming in those arenas as well. So there's a lot of extra things, I think that will support the volume going forward. But for us, it's primarily in that industrial manufacturing base at this point in time. As it relates to pricing, the commercial teams would be very upset with me. Barry is laughing, if I were to try to give any commercial guidance at this point, I would tell you that as we've said in the past, the average price in the entirety of the order backlog is still very high from a historic perspective. It's not at the peak pricing that we saw, but it's very much aligned with what we have seen for the entirety of last year as an average. Just as a reminder, on through cycle basis, we still believe very strongly that sitting, when it has four of the value added lines operating, we'll have a through cycle EBITDA in the range of $450 to $500 million per year. So that outlook hasn't changed. So it is a significant benefit long-term. It's just a matter of this year. Carlos. Thanks. I know everyone's trying to figure that out. And what I would say to that is, yes, we do believe that going forward, we're going to have -- there has been a structural shift and change in how the commercial aspect of the steel joist and deck business has materialized in the last two years, if I would say it that way. And the change is that, first of all, there's considerable volume and we believe that demand is going to stay in place for a considerable amount of time. There's limited supply. So in today's environment, and I think in the future environment, it's not so much as looking at just a product itself. But this is a highly engineered product, so it's looking at a product as well as a service. And that service is requiring time on the mill or time in the facility itself. And that has a value. And that's what now has come to the force that the customers understand there's a time element and a service element, as well as a very highly engineered product set. So we believe those are structural changes. And I think that that came to bear and was proven in the second half of 2022 when steel prices actually were being reduced pretty significantly. And we think an overcorrection. And yet we had increasing pricing within our steel joist and deck facilities themselves. So we do believe there's a structural change. I can't help you more than that. I would tell you that we expect very strong volumes this year to be comparable to last year. And I think that we've told you we've got an order backlog that goes out into October, November, and it has a significantly higher price. And that price is not too far off of what the average pricing would have been for 2022. So I think we've given you a lot of data points to hopefully help you with your estimates. Thanks, Tristan for the question. Yes, as it relates to volume, I mean traditionally, you're always going to have your strongest construction months and project months and quarters in the second and third quarter. So we absolutely would expect to see stronger volumes in that time frame for our fabrication business, as well. As it relates to cost, we generally sometimes it changes, but we generally keep around eight weeks or so of steel on the ground for our fabrication business, uniquely, we use primarily flat rolled steels, a little bit of merchant steels in the process. So if you can kind of follow that bouncy ball with how you feel the pricing will look going forward and what's done in the recent past, and that should give you some inclination of how the metal margin will move pushing forward into the second quarter. Yes, it lags about eight -- it would lag around eight to 10 weeks. Yes, so as we talked about it, there was a lot, there was a significant amount of working capital build in 2022. Much of that was not structural. It had to do with us layering on some additional raw materials with pig iron, some additional substrate that Mark mentioned. So we have been able to work through most, if not all of that. We still expect to have some working capital give back as we head into the second quarter, as we kind of still right size some of our inventory levels, et cetera. So it may not be as significant of a benefit as you've seen in the last two quarters, but we definitely think working capital will be a funding source heading into the second quarter. John, I'll take the last one. That's a simple one. We have a companywide profit sharing plan. That's how we provide for retirement for all of our 12,000 people. And it's simply 8% of pretax earnings. And since we had a record 2022, we were able to give all the employees $422 million in total. And that payment went out in March. So that's the reason for the significant change. Yes. Well, I mean, you could do it that way, but in actuality, it comes out in March. But, yes, you could look at it that way. That's correct."

Please be advised that this call is being recorded today, October 17, 2024, and your participation implies consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree to these terms, please disconnect. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to David Lipschitz, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDavid Lipschitz : Thank you, Kelly. Good morning, and welcome to Steel Dynamics' Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded and will be available on our website for replay later today. Leading today's call are Mark Millett, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Steel Dynamics; Theresa Wagler, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Barry Schneider, President and Chief Operating Officer. The other members of our senior leadership team are joining us on the call individually. Some of today's statements, which speak only as of this date, may be forward-looking and predictive, typically preceded by believe, expect, anticipate or words of similar meaning. They are intended to be protected by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and should actual results turn out differently. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties related to integrating or starting up new assets, the aluminum industry, the use of estimates and assumptions in connection with our anticipated project returns in our steel, metals recycling and fabrication businesses as well as to general business and economic conditions. Examples of these are described in the related press release as well as in our annually filed SEC Form 10-K under the headings Forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors, found on the Internet at www.sec.gov, and if applicable, in any later SEC Form 10-Q. You will also find any referenced non-GAAP financial measures reconciled to the most directly compared GAAP measures in the press release issued yesterday entitled Steel Dynamics Reports Third Quarter 2021 Results.\nMark Millett: Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our third quarter '24 earnings call. As you have read and seemingly many have concluded, our teams executed well through the quarter, achieving another solid financial and operational performance. Most gratifying to us to me, in particular, was achieving another great quarter for safety. The ramp-ups of our 4 new value-add flat-rolled steel coating lines have been an unqualified success with the expectation of full earnings benefit in 2025. These lines represent an additional 1.1 million tons of higher-margin product diversification for us. In Texas, despite a couple of challenges early in the quarter, the Sinton team gained considerable momentum, running at a 72% utilization rate of scheduled run time in September. We had extended periods in excess of 90%, and were achieved during that quarter. And I think it proves the mill's ultimate capability. Steel shipments were 3.2 million tonnes, third quarter revenues, $4.3 billion. Adjusted EBITDA was $557 million and cash flow from operations of $760 million. As I stated, we had a great quarter in terms of safety. Historically, the summer months can be a challenging period, but the teams reversed that trend this year with an excellent performance. Not only was that trend reversed that both our total recordable incident rate and lost time rates were the lowest in our history. Our employee dedication to our tape controller safety program is extraordinary. Our core safety teams visited 30 facilities in the third quarter alone, which is, I think, a clear testament to their commitment to keep each other safe. We continue to build a world-class safety culture and the positive results have been clearly demonstrated. 84% of our locations in the third quarter did not have a recordable injury. That's 104 locations out of our 124 and 94% of them did not have a lost time incident. I'm continually inspired by the commitment of our team members have for one another. They really truly consider themselves family and challenge the status quo every day to do better in every way. That's why we are so focused on providing the very best for the health, the safety and their welfare. That said, there's still a lot of work to do as we strive toward a 0 incident environment. But with that, I will pause for Theresa first and then Barry to add color for the quarter.\nTheresa Wagler: Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. We really do appreciate you taking the time to be on the call with us this morning. And I want to add my thanks to our teams for a really solid performance this quarter. As Mark suggested, our third quarter 2024 net income was $318 million or $2.05 per diluted share with adjusted EBITDA of $557 million. Third quarter 2024 revenue of $4.3 billion was below sequential second quarter results due to lower realized flat-rolled steel pricing tied to lagging contractual volume. Our third quarter operating income of $395 million, was 29% lower than sequential second quarter results driven by steel metal spread contraction as average realized pricing declined more than scrap raw material costs in the quarter. Our steel operations generated operating income of $305 million in the third quarter, lower than sequential results due to average realized pricing declining $79 and to $1,059 per ton, while total shipments were steady as increased flat-rolled volume offset lower structural and SBQ volume. For those of you that track our individual flat-rolled shipments quarter-by-quarter, in the third quarter, hot-rolled shipments were 942,000 tons. Cold-rolled shipments were 118,000 tons and coated shipments were 1,335 000 tons. For metals recycling operating income was $12 million, lower than sequential second quarter results due to lower realized pricing and volume. In addition, we had an unrealized noncash copper hedging loss of $10 million in September. We're the largest North American metals recycler processing and consuming ferrous scrap and nonferrous aluminum, copper and other metals, and we're growing in support of our increased steel and planned aluminum production investments through new and expanded relationships and through the use of innovative new separation technologies, I'm really proud of the team. They're also reducing operating costs very effectively. Our steel fabrication team achieved strong operating income of $166 million in the third quarter lower than second quarter results as a 5% decrease in realized pricing offset steady shipments. Order activity in the third quarter was the strongest we've seen this year, supporting our Joist Index backlog extending through the first quarter of 2025. As interest rates decline in public funding begins to be distributed post election and into 2025 and we expect to see increased fixed asset investment and corresponding demand drivers for steel and steel fabrication products next year. Regarding our aluminum investments, as a reminder, as we construct the aluminum facilities, non-capitalizable expenses are required to flow through SG&A until startup. As a result, our SG&A will be higher until we start operations in 2025. You have visibility to this amount provided in our supplemental data schedule for the third quarter, it was $24 million. We have expectations for aluminum investments to be EBITDA positive in the second half of 2025 and plan to operate the rolling mill at approximately 75% of its capacity in 2026. Mark is going to provide more details related to our ramp and product mix expectations later on the call as well as define our differentiated cost expectations. The construction of the rolling mill and the San Luis Potosi recycled slab center is going extremely well. Approximately $1.9 billion has already been invested through September of 2024, with expectations of funding between $350 million to $400 million in the fourth quarter and the remainder then to be spent in the first half of 2025. Our cash generation continues to be strong based on our differentiated circular business model and highly variable cost structure. During the third quarter of 2024, we generated cash from operations of $760 million. We ended the quarter with strong liquidity of $3.1 billion, comprised of cash and short-term investments of $1.9 billion and our fully available unsecured revolver of $1.2 billion. For the fourth quarter of '24, we believe capital investments will be in the range of $500 million to $550 million. Preliminarily, we believe 2025 capital investments will be in the range of $700 million to $800 million. We repurchased $970 million of our common stock year-to-date 2024, representing 4.5% of our outstanding shares and as of September 30, we have $486 million remaining available for share repurchases. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes high-return strategic growth with shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that's complemented with a variable share repurchase program while we remain dedicated to preserving our investment-grade credit designation. Our track record has proven achieving 5-year after-tax return on invested capital of 24% during a period of transformational growth and strong shareholder returns. Our free cash flow profile has fundamentally changed over the last 5 years from an annual average of $540 million to $2.9 billion, excluding our large strategic Sinton and aluminum investments. In July, we successfully issued $600 million of investment-grade notes with a 10-year tenure in anticipation of repaying $400 million of our notes that are due this December. Before I conclude, I want to thank the decarbonization and biocarbon teams. I'm proud of them and excited about the recent announcement concerning our new certified science-based greenhouse gas emissions intensity targets for our steel mills, which are aligned with the 1.5-degree Celsius scenario set forth in the Paris agreement. In fact, our steel mills are already well ahead of that curve. We recently set both 2050 emissions intensity target, which is aligned with the International Energy Agency's net 0 by 2050 industry targets. And an interim 2030 target, which represents a 15% reduction in our greenhouse gas intensity. These targets were established using the Global Steel Climate Council's steel climate standard of which we are a founding member. The biocarbon project is also going incredibly well with expectations for a first quarter 2025 start. Sustainability is a significant part of our long-term value creation strategy, and we're dedicated to our people, our communities and our environment. We're committed to operating our business with the highest integrity. We uniquely have an actionable path toward carbon neutrality that is more manageable and we believe considerably less expensive that may lay ahead for many of our industry peers. Our sustainability and carbon reduction strategy is an ongoing journey, and we're moving forward with the intention to make a positive difference. Thank you. Barry?\nBarry Schneider: Thank you, Theresa. Our steel fabrication operations performed well in the third quarter, achieving historically strong earnings and steady volume in the quarter. Our steel fabrication order backlog remains at a healthy level, extending through the first quarter of 2025. We remain optimistic as it relates to demand for the steel joist and deck markets over the next number of years. Based on a moderating interest rate environment, continued manufacturing onshoring, and public funding for infrastructure and other fixed asset investment programs. The uplift from this macro environment could be considerable for this platform as well as our steel operations. Our steel fabrication platform also provides meaningful volume support for our steel operations, which allows us to constantly operate at a higher through-cycle utilization rate. It also mitigates the financial risk of lower steel prices. The metals recycling team did a good job navigating a challenging marketing -- market environment in the third quarter. There were a number of domestic steel outages, which decreased ferrous scrap demand coupled with pricing volatility. Ferrous scrap prices have stabilized, and we believe should remain relatively stable through the rest of the year subject to seasonal moves. The North American geographic footprint of our metals recycling platform provides a strategic competitive advantage for our steel mills and for our scrap generating customers. Our Mexican recycling locations competitively advantage our Columbus and Sinton raw material positions. They also strategically support increased procurement of aluminum scrap for our future flat-rolled aluminum operations. Our metals recycling team is partnering even more closely with both steel and aluminum teams to expand scrap separation capabilities through process and technology solutions. This helps mitigate potential prime ferrous scrap supply issues in the future. It also provides us with a significant advantage to increase the recycled content in our aluminum flat rolled products and increase our earnings opportunities. The steel team also had a solid quarter, achieving steady shipments of 3.2 million tons. During the third quarter of 2024, the domestic steel industry operated at an estimated production utilization rate of 78% while our steel mills operated at a rate of 86%, excluding our Sinton operation. We consistently operated at higher utilization rates due to our value-added steel product diversification, our differentiated customer supply chain solutions and the support of our internal manufacturing business. The higher through-cycle utilization of our steel mills is one of our key competitive advantages, supporting our strong and growing cash generation capability and best-in-class financial metrics. Our realized average flat-rolled steel price declined in the quarter due to contract lags, but prices stabilized and improved in the quarter. Positively, value-added flat-rolled steel pricing spreads remained resilient, supporting our earnings as we are the largest producer of these products in North America and growing. Our activity is solid heading into the fourth quarter with normal seasonal trends expected, in general, our flat-rolled steel mill lead times are actually at levels higher than we've seen over the last 6 months. Underlying steel demand remains steady, but a surge in steel imports put pressure on the supply dynamics in certain product areas, specifically for coated flat-rolled steel products. In response, we levied a trade case, and we expect to get a preliminary ruling from the ITC in a few weeks. Our Sinton, Texas, flat-rolled steel mill team successfully completed needed changes early in the quarter to access 100% of the mills north capacity. The team experienced some difficulty ramping back up after the outage. However, the reliability of the mill improved dramatically in September, and the company believes Sinton's product utilization rate will increase around 75% for the fourth quarter of 2024. Also, the additional 2 new value-added coating lines were successfully commissioned and have commenced operations, improving the mills value-add product mix and through cycle earning capability. Regarding the steel mill market environment, North American automotive production estimates for 2024, where we recently revised to stable production over the next several years. Automotive dealer inventories also continue to remain below historical norms. Nonresidential construction remained stable with slowdowns across some industries. However, we believe moderating interest rates will unlock pent-up project work and create new opportunities in 2025. Additionally, onshoring and infrastructure spending should provide further support to fixed asset investment and related construction oriented products. As for the energy market, the solar industry continues to grow and be a meaningful part for both our Flat Rolled Products and structural sections. Oil and gas also remained steady. Looking forward, we are optimistic regarding steel demand and pricing dynamics as we end 2024 and get ready to enter 2025.\nMark Millett : Super. Thanks Theresa. Thank you, Barry. Well it's more than evident that our performance-driven employee-centric culture in combination with a proven highly diversified value-added business model drives superior through-cycle financial metrics. Our consistently strong operating and financial performance continues to support our cash generation and growth investment strategies, allowing a balanced cash allocation strategy that has consistently delivered best-in-class shareholder returns. For instance, our investment strategy achieved a 3-year return on invested capital of 32% from '21 through '23 compared to only 12% per the S&P 500. And our disciplined high-return investment approach continues. As I said, the 4 value-added flat-rolled steel coating lines are increasing volume and performing very well from a quality perspective. These types of high-return investments are key to our value-added product and supply chain differentiation strategies. As I mentioned also, Sinton continues to improve its operational reliability, with expectations for strong production capability in 2025. Our recent aluminum growth strategy is especially compelling. The market environment in aluminum is not unlike the steel industry was when we started SDI 30-plus years ago. It has older assets, heavy legacy costs, a lot of the facilities are inefficient and high cost, and they've had -- the industry in general has had a difficulty in earning the cost of capital. And hence, there's been little investment in facilities and new technologies in recent years. But unlike our steel entry, the one huge positive is that the -- there's a significant deficit in aluminum, just in North America in general. And that deficit is expected to grow considerably. There's a clear business alignment, they leverage our core competencies. Core competency of construction and operational know-how. And one only asked to look at the drone video on our website to see the extraordinary progress the team has made to constructing the new mills. It also will leverage our performance-driven culture, driving higher efficiency and lower cost operations. It also level Omni's recycling footprint. As Theresa suggested, we're the largest North American aluminum scrap recycler. And we also are developing some in-house new technologies to separate the 5,000 and 6,000 series alloys. It's a very, very cost-effective and a high-return growth opportunity for us. Construction of the expansive rolling mill in Columbus, Mississippi, as I said, is proceeding at an extraordinary pace. And I believe the aluminum industry is now recognizing that we truly will be a force to be reckoned with. The future customer base across all sectors is excited to have a new market entrant that is known to be innovative, customer-centric and responsive to their needs. Commercial arrangements are being put in place to match an order book to our ramp-up needs in 2025. Responses from existing and new customers across the markets remains incredible as the first for new supply. As in Sinton, we are developing an on-site industrial part to locate aluminum processing and consuming facilities. The arrangements are currently being negotiated that would create approximately 100,000 tons of annual tonne of processing capability per year. And as our project has become a visible reality and our reputation permeates the aluminum industry, aluminum professionals have been knocking at our door. And we've been building on a phenomenal team with an in-depth knowledge of aluminum operations, commercial markets, process technology and customer service. For those that may not have heard in our last call, the scope of the facility. It's a state-of-the-art 650,000 metric tonne a year aluminum flat road facility located in Columbus, Mississippi. We'll have an optimized mix of 300,000 tonnes of can start, 230,000 tonnes of auto and 130,000 tons of industrial and construction products when we're up fully running. The actual site in Columbus, Mississippi has a melt cash and lab capacity of 600,000 metric tons, and it's going to be supported by 2 satellite recycled aluminum slab casting centers located in UBC scrap rich regions. We expanded the project scope to include, as I said, additional scrap processing and segregation technologies to maximize aluminum recycled content. These in-house developed technologies are currently operating successfully separating the 5000 and 6000 series alloys on a commercial basis every day. The team plans to begin production of slabs in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, in the first quarter of 2025. We will commission the Columbus cash outs in the first quarter, downstream lines in the second quarter, with commercial shipments in mid-2025 and that is absolutely on schedule. In 2025, we plan to begin production with a product mix weighted to industrial and construction products as we qualify our Can sheet in 25 and auto products into 26. We anticipate production to grow to 50% of our annual rate by the end of 2025 and expect 75% capacity in 2026. The project is expected to add $650 million to $700 million of through-cycle annual EBITDA, and we should generate approximately $40 million to $50 million through the resegment platform in addition to that. Although this computes to a higher EBITDA per tonne than the industry has experienced in the past, we're confident in that projection. And the most significant savings are in 4 key areas: labor, recycled content, yield and logistics. Labor, we should have a reduced workforce of perhaps 700 to 750 people versus perhaps 1,200 or more in a conventional facility of this size. We have optimized plant layout and material flow. We'll have a centralized automated storage system, so there'll be no touch from slab to truck and our proven performance-based incentive-driven culture will drive high productivity, high efficiency and low cost. And we will have no legacy costs. So for those who dare the impact, I would just ask you to look at what our teams have done throughout our steel operations over the years. Recycle content. Again, we will lever our metals recycling platform to drive higher recycled content. We have the largest nonferrous operations, recycling operations as has already been stated. -- we also have a secondary aluminum facility that has been operating for many years that will be additive. We're locating satellite facilities close to the UBC rich areas to the west and in Mexico. And again, leverage the sorting technologies. The yield will be improved. We do believe it's going to be a new facility, state-of-the-art equipment and technologies. The scalping technology is absolutely state of the arm and will minimize material removal. And we're actually processing through the facility supersized coils, produce less heads, less tails, less line stops, all adding to lower yield losses. In logistics, again, locating slab centers close to rich areas will be a huge benefit as well. So the excitement within our company and particularly at the ADI sites, continues to grow as our teams recognize their ability to help revolutionize the U.S. aluminum industry as they did in steel. We're impassioned by our current and future growth plans as they will continue to drive the high return growth momentum we have consistently demonstrated over the years. The earnings growth of these new projects is compelling. The capital spending for Sinton, the 4 value ad lines and aluminum dynamics is approximately 85% complete with an estimated collective future through-cycle annual EBITDA contribution of over $1.4 billion. As a prominent institutional portfolio manager recently pointed out to us, Steel Dynamics has grown to an incredibly resilient cash-generating business, driven by the best teams in the world. We said in the last 5 years, you've invested billions of dollars in organic strategic growth. You earned a return on invested capital of 24% compared to the S&P 500 at only 12%. You've increased your cash dividend over 90%. You repurchased over 30% of your outstanding shares or the while maintaining best-in-class investment-grade credit metrics. We said it's better than a textbook capital allocation lesson. And obviously, somewhat biased, I agree. And I'm excited as investors recognize the power and consistency of our through-cycle cash generation, combined with our consistent and high return capital allocation strategy. And it's our belief that the steel industry has undergone a paradigm shift in recent years, a shift that will further support our earnings profile. There's a pervasive sense of mercantilism, which will provide a level plan field through continued and appropriate trade relief. We have COVID-driven supply chain dislocations, which have accelerated reinsuring of manufacturing. Decarbonization should materially steepen the global cost curve, providing SDI a huge competitive advantage to gain market share and increase metal spreads as our mills have some of the lowest carbon footprints in the world. AI and cloud computing should support nonresidential construction through data center buildout. And there will be growing fixed asset investment driven by the inflation reduction chips act and other public monies. In turn, with the interest rates moderating, demand will be strong, we do believe going into and through 2025. So in closing, we've been blessed with good fortune and our people are our foundation. I thank each of them for their passion and their dedication. We're committed to them. And I remind those listening today that your safety for yourselves, your families and each other is our highest priority. Our culture and business model continue to differentiate our performance leading to best-in-class financial metrics. We're an integrated metals business, providing enhanced lower carbon supply chain solutions to our customers. in turn, mitigating volatility in our cash flow generation and providing enhanced shareholder returns and value to all participants. We truly look forward to creating new opportunities for everyone today, tomorrow and in the years ahead. So with that said, we will open up the call to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question is coming from Martin Englert with Seaport Research Partners.\nMartin Englert: You briefly touched on this in the prepared remarks, but for the greenfield aluminum project, are there any other key personnel additions that are still needed. And could you just more broadly touch on the general labor market and how you found the process of filling the needs there.\nMark Millett: Certainly, I think the there are no key folks or talent needed from a skill set of experience. We are pretty well built out, but we will always, always talk to anyone who wants to join us. So the management team, I think, is absolutely solid. It's a blend, a combination of seasoned aluminum folks, managers, leaders alongside our SDI proven leaders, and so you'll get the blend of aluminum experience and knowledge base with the cultural performance-driven sort of passion that we have within Steel Dynamics. So I'm incredibly, incredibly impressed by the team. It's actually a much better location and finding talent is not an easy thing nowadays, but compared to the challenges that we experienced in Sinton I think it's a much, much better location. Fortunately, we have one of our large flat rolled steel facilities right across the road. That's allowing again a transfer of people at all levels. And they can transfer over without moving the families and dislocating their lives. And so that is a huge benefit for us as well. So no, we're excited by the team there.\nMartin Englert: Excellent. If I could, one last one in steel fabrication with more recent sales that you've had that have been added into the backlog over the past month or 2, are you seeing any pockets of pricing strength relative to where you had been?\nTheresa Wagler: Martin, I would suggest that heading into the fourth quarter, we're going to see that normal seasonality that you typically see in anything that's tied to construction. But as we look at 2025, we definitely think that there's opportunity for not just price support, but price appreciation as we've talked about interest rate changes and additional demand coming from public funding, et cetera. So we're feeling really good with the steady aspect of what we've seen in the last 6 to 9 months. And now we'll just get through the fourth quarter seasonality and then head towards what we think is going to be a really robust 2025.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Katja Jancic with BMO Capital Markets.\nKatja Jancic: Right now, 80% of your business is contractually based. Does that change with further symptom ramp up? Or should we continue to see about 80% contractual?\nBarry Schneider: Katja, this is Barry Schneider. Contractual relationships are a big part of our value-added supply chain solutions. So as we've increased our paint lines and our coating lines, it keeps that concentration about in that 70% to 80% range. We anticipated this growth with our new lines. So I would see us being in the same kind of market, perhaps a little bit less in the future once we get the established customer bases and work out the supply chains in each region.\nMark Millett: Just to clarify, I think you recognize it, but the 80% contractual is on the flat rolled side of our business. We obviously have a whole bunch of other stuff being a very, very diversified provider, which is more in the kind of the spot day to day.\nKatja Jancic: Okay. Maybe just one quick one. Barry, I think you mentioned that Sinton had a bit of a challenge starting up after maintenance, if I'm not mistaken. What was the issue there?\nBarry Schneider: Just whenever we work with high-voltage systems, you have kind of a normal making sure everything is safe as you ramp up. So having the team – the outage was about 4 days. And it was just a little bit slow to get back up to regular running rates. It’s not unheard of in our industry. It was just worth noting because we did so much work. The team was really resolve some of those high-power problems we’ve had from the beginning, and we safely were able to do that. So all in all, I consider it a good outage the team did very well. But it wasn’t like turning a light on and off. It’s just a little bit more complicated with that high voltage.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Tristan Gresser with BNP Paribas Exane.\nTristan Gresser: First one is just on the increase in spreads in metal spreads for your long portfolio. Where did you see more strength? And maybe if you can discuss a little the differentiated outlook for your structural or shape or whatever drove that strength that would be appreciated to get your perspective on your loan product business.\nBarry Schneider: This is Barry. The scrap that we're able to move to our mills from the metals recycling platform is really beneficial because we find the best value and the timeliness of our supply chain allows us to really optimize that. So having the right material at the right time is essential for that business to really to get the value from it. As we look specifically at long products, our structural and heavy section mill in Columbia City is not just a heavy section mill, is also a railroad -- the largest railroad producer in the country. So we have a nice balance of where we tend to move our products. So as the markets tend to change over time, we're always able to optimize into the right product mix for the opportunity and make sure that we keep our regular customers invested and they understand what we're doing. So having that diversification of product across all of our business is essential when we're looking at how we're moderating quarter-to-quarter with the natural flow of business. So long products remains very resilient. We're excited about the opportunities that we see coming, particularly with the investment and reshoring opportunities.\nTristan Gresser: All right. That's helpful. And maybe a follow-up just on the update carbonized trade case you mentioned and the potential impact of that. I understand Vietnam being part of the investigation, but I think there has been a push to include certain countries like Canada and also Mexico. And given your exposure to Mexico, can you explain a little bit the rationale behind including those countries in the investigation?\nMark Millett: Yes, sir. The – there was actually 10 countries involved in the investigation. And each of those countries, there was very demonstrative increases in the actual tons that have surged through those various countries into American markets and the necessity of including Canada and Mexico, was because of the volume of tons that are coming through those countries. The U.S. MCA is a great treaty that we all enjoy. We do good business based on that. In that agreement, there is provisions to do just what we did, which is engage the ITC for antidumping and countervailing duties cases, the numbers are staggering. And in many cases, these tons are not melt to report in those countries, but they’re flowing from some of the other countries listed. So as there’s problems in Asia, that puts pressure on that part of the world, and they all want to flow to our shores. So this mechanism is expensive, it’s lengthy, but it’s necessary to make sure that the competitive markets that we have in our United States are truly fair trade. So I think the process will render out what the appropriate duties are in each country. And if there truly was less damage for some of those countries, the final tariff amounts will reflect that. So it is something that was absolutely necessary. And as we watch, we don’t ask for handouts or protection. We just ask for a fair field to play the game on. And this is all part of that process.\nOperator: Next question is coming from Carlos Diaba with Morgan Stanley.\nCarlos de Alba: Maybe continuing with the conversation on the antidumping case. Somewhat related, the spread between galvanizing steel and cold-rolled coil has been depressed, you low level is probably not economical. If the antidumping investigation doesn't go your way, or even if you don't see a big improvement if it does, what is the dynamics as a leader in this sector prepared to do to maybe enhance those spreads?\nBarry Schneider: Carlos, this is Barry again. We do anticipate great success with these trade cases, especially with certain of these countries that were the most egregious offenders, but we routinely evaluate how we move our flat rolled products through our process lines. So we routinely move hot rolled all the way through the process into galvanized and painted. We make those decisions about where the margins are. So we've been having very good success in dealing with these pressures over the last 12 months. And you can see from our earnings results that we're finding a solution to the problem. It has to do with -- we have so much diversity in our product mix that we respond to where we can go and be safe. So I believe the ITC will come back favorable, particularly with some of the more egregious offenders and that does create an opportunity for us to go balance into a more a product mix that is more perhaps friendly to those times.\nCarlos de Alba: If I may squeeze another one...\nMark Millett: If I could just add, you've heard us say before, we don't manage to hope nor do we manage and make strategic decisions based on, we think, trade or policy of any nature is going to go one way or the other. You have to take control of your own destiny. And I think the teams year-over-year do an absolutely phenomenal job further diversifying our product mix. I think I don't know what the recent number is 65%, 70% of our flat-rolled product mix, 65% is value add. And when we say value-add, I'm talking about really value-add. When you get into prepaint and you get into the coating developments that the teams have achieved. And most recently, they've got into this digital print stuff that literally is absolutely phenomenal. Wood grains for the Garage Door, folks and architectural. You just have to have innovation and creativity continuing to drive up the product mix. So no matter what happens, we will succeed and no matter where the trade goes, to be honest.\nTheresa Wagler: And the thing that Mark and Barry talked about, but without saying the exact words, the supply chain differentiation that we have. with all the products that you just spoke about. And so that's the key for us.\nCarlos de Alba: Right. Just if I may squeeze another one on the sea fabrication business. Any further details on pricing? I think Barry, maybe I missed this, but I think Barry talked about stable pricing from current levels from what you saw in the third quarter. But any further color there or on volumes, how you expect that going forward?\nTheresa Wagler: Yes, Carlos, thanks for the question. But again, we’re pretty consistent. We won’t talk about pricing and commercial things as it relates to that. The commercial team they would be outside my door and they’d be ready to do bad things. So we can’t do that. But from a volume perspective, we do expect regular seasonality here in the fourth quarter as it relates to the construction-related businesses, which deal fabrication is one. But we do expect to see much stronger volumes next year, which should support pricing as well.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Lawson Winder with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nLawson Winder: And thanks for the update today. Barry, maybe I think this question would be best directed to you. Could you just walk us through the path from 72% utilization at Sinton in September to your optimal utilization. What is that optimal fully ramp utilization? And what are the remaining bottlenecks and steps to resolve that? And if possible time lines when you hit that number?\nBarry Schneider: Yes. Lawson, I'll try to articulate why we have confidence in what the Sinton team is doing. And the first major thing is reducing the unplanned downtime. So when things happen, as the teams not only develop themselves as teammates, but also as competency develops, they're able to address issues that they occur. So we've been making significant strides at reducing the unplanned downtime. Necessary to make that happen is improving the reliability of the equipment in the plant. As you may know, our flat-rolled steel mills are actually coupled units where we go from the furnace to the hot rolling mill as one coupled unit. And to make that happen as various parts of the system have normal issues, it can impact the other units. So what we're seeing now and we've seen days, we've seen weeks now we've seen months of continuous reduction of unplanned downtime, better reliability of the equipment, and also just as important, making sure that all the products that are actually being produced are able to get to higher value destinations through the mill, whether it's selling it as hot rolled, cold-rolled or coated products. So as we see each of the units in the mill respond, we see the uptime increasing. We see the yields getting better and better. And as we start controlling the cost situation, we see a very good path towards this facility running well. We have had weeks that we're nearly at capacity. And that, again, is more reasons we have confidence in what we see. So we see kind of the watershed moments happening under our feet. We anticipate fourth quarter to finish strong, and it really sets the stage for 2025 to really allow this facility to show the stakeholders what they've been doing and how well they've been earning it down there. I hope that helps.\nLawson Winder: Yes. The color is definitely helpful. And then maybe if I could, just a follow up to that, I think it's probably directed toward Theresa I mean when you think of Sinton now kind of being there or close to being where you need it to be and you look at the dividend consideration for February. Could we anticipate that the dividend increase in February might be more material than we've seen more recently? And then how will the aluminum dynamics start up factor into that decision effect.\nTheresa Wagler: That is a very good question, Lawson, a very tricky question. So the Board is who determines what the dividend will be, and you’re correct. We like to keep a positive dividend profile that generally happens in the first quarter of each year. And I would anticipate the same absent any extraneous things occurring this year as well. We do expect to have certain significant EBITDA contributor next year, which it hasn’t been up to this point. So that’s a significant change in the earnings profile. That being said, we’d like to see how Sinton operates in 2025. So I would expect to see a positive dividend move, but I can’t really speak to the magnitude of that at this point in time. As it relates to the aluminum assets starting in 2025, very excited about that. As I mentioned in my prepared notes, we do expect those investments to be EBITDA positive in the second half of 2025, which is pretty extraordinary. So we’ll really start to see that benefit 2026. So I would think that would generally be kind of a time frame to think about how that contributes to through-cycle cash flow and positive possible dividend moves.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research.\nTimna Tanners: I wanted to probe a bit more of the status of the value-add lines ramp up, ramping up the 4 lines between paint and coated galv. Just looking at the volumes, it wasn't clear to me like what utilization you have those lines at and what we might have yet to see play out as they ramp up.\nBarry Schneider: Timna, this is Barry. The line -- all 4 of the new lines we added are actually operating at somewhere around 65% to 75%. As we discussed with the trade cases, we've seen some pressure in certain coated products, particularly Galvalume. So we are trying to make sure we're efficiently running those lines and making sure we don't waste money by operating it at levels that perhaps we could do with the existing lines. So what we look at is the ability to really allow each line to do the proper product mix to be very efficient and to be very good yields. So we're really excited with what we've seen. The Terre Haute operations are definitely improving the opportunity for that facility to reach more markets, diversifying that product mix there by adding a second coding opportunity with Galvalume and with the prepaying opportunity. has really opened up relationships with new customers as well as existing customers who needed those products in that region. And at Sinton, the additional lines really allow us to have a more efficient operation between our galvanized coatings and our Galvalume coatings. So it might be a bit technical, but we're really excited how the lines perform. The quality itself has been very good. And that is difficult with these type of products. These are -- a lot of this new capacity is prepainted markets, which have very demanding customer base. So we've been really excited to see how the teams have responded and the sales team continues to bring new opportunities to the mills to [indiscernible].\nTheresa Wagler: Timna, as it relates to their contribution to earnings, I would say that, that really hasn't been significantly impactful up to this point. So as a reminder, the 4 lines were about a $600 million investment. And generally, the paint and galvanizing lines for us, given our supply chain differentiation have a payback period of anywhere between 2 and 3 or 2.5 years. So pretty significant. You're going to start to really see their impact in 2025, I think as everything gets ramped up.\nMark Millett: And just one follow-up thought at Sinton. Obviously, the volume throughput on those lines is a little inhibited right now because the hot side not being at full capacity. So as you see, as we increase the throughput on the hot side, the volume through those 2 lines down there will increase in tandem.\nTimna Tanners: Okay. That's really helpful. So for modeling purposes, if we look at the, what, $1.3 million plus tons in the quarter of galvanized that represents about -- or galvanizing coated, that represents about 65% of the new capacity ramping up. So we have yet to see that remaining 1/3 or so flow through, and we would expect that conditional to the imports coming off. Is that fair?\nTheresa Wagler: So in that coated number, it’s not just our lines that you’re seeing Timna. And no, it wouldn’t show like shipments of that – at that rate because you also have our our United Steel Supply and you have other processing facilities rolling through that that aren’t really included in a lot of the benefit of the additional volume in the third quarter actually came through different avenues. So there’s – I think – I would suggest there’s more volume that still the benefit. It’s not just a 1/3.\nOperator: Next question is coming from Bill Peterson with JPMorgan.\nBill Peterson: Maybe following up some of the questions around utilization and also run the last question, too. Can you help us understand if Sinton's profitability meaningfully improved in the third quarter. I think it was around breakeven in the second quarter. And then on the 4 new coating lines, are these profitable yet? And I guess obviously related to some of the trade questions you were answering earlier, but if they're not, when would you expect them to be profitable?\nTheresa Wagler: So from the perspective of Sinton, No. In the third quarter, because we had additional outage time that Barry actually mentioned and because we had additional maintenance costs related to that. Sinton wasn't EBITDA positive in the third quarter, but we have full expectations that it will be in the fourth quarter and certainly next year. As it relates to the lines, they're really integral into the operations of the steel mills themselves. So to answer that question a little bit difficult. Again, I would tell you, as Mark mentioned earlier, Barry and now I will for a third time, we expect the value-add lines to really benefit 2025. So as you think about your modeling, I would add that as an additional benefit for us that's outside of just normal market dynamics.\nBill Peterson: Great. And on sort of the lower carbon items, and thanks for providing the color there. It looks like on the biocarbon project in particular, it looks like it's going to be a few quarters before operation. But what means to be done before operational start? And then I guess, when do you plan to introduce internally produced biocarbon into your steel production flows? Do you have -- is there -- I mean, is there a need for customer commitments for the products with this biocarbon or you do expect the premium for products coming using that product?\nTheresa Wagler: That's a good question. I would hope to have a premium, but Barry's laughing at me. So the biocarbon facility, the team is doing a great job. It's still under construction. And again, everything is pointing toward a first quarter 2025 start. We will have that product. It's already been fully tested at each of the steel mills that we'll be receiving it. We don't have enough product to satisfy all of the carbon needs at our steel mills, but a majority of it, so we'll start using that and easing that into the product mix for the steel mills as we enter the first half of next year. As far as whether or not there's premium charged to that product, that's just going to be part of our decarbonization journey. So it's going to be used as a matter of whether -- it's not for a specific customer necessarily.\nMark Millett: Yes. Theresa, I would just add on that, that we don’t need customer approvals for this product. It’s so early in the process that the use of what kind of carbon doesn’t factor into what the final steel product will actually how it will perform. And I would think of it as it’s not a binary decision or it’s one or the other. So the path towards introducing this to the mills will really flow based on how the startup goes in the proximity and how the teams respond to it. The trials that have been done have been very successful through the Aymium pilot facility. So we have a good working knowledge going into this. And the melt shop teams are regularly meeting with the biocarbon team. And we’re excited about it. It’s a beautiful plant down in Mississippi.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Andrew Jones with UBS.\nAndrew Jones: Just on the market range environment. I mean we hear the comments we've made on the positive outlook and potential for demand to recover. But just in a more pessimistic, Mark you are aware that doesn't happen, Big River 2 starts to come through. Maybe you don't get the same trade protection that you are hoping for. I mean -- what would you consider doing within your portfolio to kind of do your bit to help to balance the market? I mean, would it change your production plans in any way? Or would you be an active participant in trying to write the market? Or do you see as just a low-cost producer and you can essentially take share and expect others potentially draw out at the higher end of the curve, how do you look at 2025 in that more pessimistic store?\nMark Millett: Firstly, we're not pessimistic. We're very, very constructive on the future market in 2025. There are too many things there that will drive that. And our customer base, in general, our customer base is very, very positive for '25. You should have a lower interest rate environment that will kick start nonresidential construction. New Millennium right now, the order book, the order -- the engineering, the whole flow of things is strong. It just needs a slightly lower interest rate environment for those developers to push buttons and move forward. So again, I just want to emphasize, we're constructive on the marketplace. Just in general, and it's not a matter of 2025 or it's just a matter of any market cycle. We will produce to what our customer base requires quite simply.\nAndrew Jones: Okay.\nMark Millett: Sorry, if I can, just -- and I think one has to recognize part of our whole business model, it revolves around just that. We recognize that the markets are cyclical in our business. And so over the years since the very beginning, 30 years ago, we have always focused on a very diversified product mix. That product mix is value add, very diverse across actual products, but also markets. That allows you a huge, huge, huge flexibility as markets ebb and flow. A very, very strong part of our strategy has always also been the pull-through volume. So if you look today, New Millennium, they consume about 600,000 tonnes, I think, what they're about last year, maybe a little bit more of the products that we make. The conversion facilities at Heartland. They've got roughly 800,000 tons of capability. You have the tax, they have about 800,000 tonne capability. So in all, our internal sort of substrate requirements is well over 2 million tonnes. We supply some of that internally, but Barry and his team also procures a lot in the marketplace. So we're actually one of the strangely, and a lot of people don't recognize it, but we're one of the largest buyers sheet products in the U.S. today. That pull-through volume can flex. So if you look at our utilization rates through cycle, those utilization rates are always superior to any of our peers because of the value-add diverse product mix and also the pull-through volume that we have internally. So even if it does come off a little bit, you will see that we retain our strong cash recycle cash generation capability without that.\nAndrew Jones: Okay. Fair enough. But no major closures of higher cost lines or older lines or any sort of reaction to kind of volumes potentially displacing volumes [indiscernible] else in the portfolio, that's not on the agenda.\nMark Millett: I didn’t hear that.\nTheresa Wagler: That’s okay. You would say no. No.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question is coming from John Tumazos with John Tumazos Independent Research.\nJohn Tumazos: Looking out a couple of years, which sectors do you think are most fertile for the next big investment. This year, U.S. aluminum demand is trending up 5%. Steel has been down in apparent demand 5 out of 6 years now. Lots of companies have built a lot of steel capacity. Did we expect that aluminum or recycling or some other new area is the candidate for the next big project in 2026 or '27 or '28.\nMark Millett: Well, firstly, John, we will always take your questions, sir. The – as I look across the – our portfolio, we’re not strong on the recycled markets just in general, where there are regional focused opportunities to vulcanize our supply chains. We certainly will anticipate that or look at that. But I think we have a good recycle sort of platform. You will see us grow here and there to expand our aluminum supply chain. But that’s well, it won’t be meaningful dollars to do that. On the steel side, I think you’re correct. I don’t see the opportunity necessarily for another 3 million tonne a year greenfield site. We’re not – as you know, we’re not in business just to grow big for the sake of it. We want to differentiate our value chain. We want to always sort of diversify. – that the team has identified several value-add opportunities, products that we don’t make today. And those are sort of percolating in the background and you’ll see over time us continuing to lever those higher-value products. Aluminum is obviously new to us. We want to walk before we run. Get the first mill up. But there’s no doubt the volume growth in aluminum going forward will be much stronger than steel and gives rise to opportunity there. As you’ve seen strategy in the past in steel, the move downstream again into value-add products in aluminum, capitalize on prepaint expertise. I think you will see that also.\nOperator: That concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for any closing remarks. Well, super. Well, for any of our employees and our teams out there that are still on the call, thank you. Thank you. Thank you for what you do. You're an incredible, incredible team doing incredible things. We can't do what we do without a loyal customer base. And again, thank you. Thank you. Thank you for your support over the years. We will continue to try and bring value and create value for you. Shareholders that are on the line that own us, thank you. Those investors that don't own us, all I can say is you should. So from SDI and every employee. Thank you for all those that support us. Have a great, great, great day and be safe.\nOperator: Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mark Millett",
            "content": "Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our third quarter '24 earnings call. As you have read and seemingly many have concluded, our teams executed well through the quarter, achieving another solid financial and operational performance. Most gratifying to us to me, in particular, was achieving another great quarter for safety. The ramp-ups of our 4 new value-add flat-rolled steel coating lines have been an unqualified success with the expectation of full earnings benefit in 2025. These lines represent an additional 1.1 million tons of higher-margin product diversification for us. In Texas, despite a couple of challenges early in the quarter, the Sinton team gained considerable momentum, running at a 72% utilization rate of scheduled run time in September. We had extended periods in excess of 90%, and were achieved during that quarter. And I think it proves the mill's ultimate capability. Steel shipments were 3.2 million tonnes, third quarter revenues, $4.3 billion. Adjusted EBITDA was $557 million and cash flow from operations of $760 million. As I stated, we had a great quarter in terms of safety. Historically, the summer months can be a challenging period, but the teams reversed that trend this year with an excellent performance. Not only was that trend reversed that both our total recordable incident rate and lost time rates were the lowest in our history. Our employee dedication to our tape controller safety program is extraordinary. Our core safety teams visited 30 facilities in the third quarter alone, which is, I think, a clear testament to their commitment to keep each other safe. We continue to build a world-class safety culture and the positive results have been clearly demonstrated. 84% of our locations in the third quarter did not have a recordable injury. That's 104 locations out of our 124 and 94% of them did not have a lost time incident. I'm continually inspired by the commitment of our team members have for one another. They really truly consider themselves family and challenge the status quo every day to do better in every way. That's why we are so focused on providing the very best for the health, the safety and their welfare. That said, there's still a lot of work to do as we strive toward a 0 incident environment. But with that, I will pause for Theresa first and then Barry to add color for the quarter. Super. Thanks Theresa. Thank you, Barry. Well it's more than evident that our performance-driven employee-centric culture in combination with a proven highly diversified value-added business model drives superior through-cycle financial metrics. Our consistently strong operating and financial performance continues to support our cash generation and growth investment strategies, allowing a balanced cash allocation strategy that has consistently delivered best-in-class shareholder returns. For instance, our investment strategy achieved a 3-year return on invested capital of 32% from '21 through '23 compared to only 12% per the S&P 500. And our disciplined high-return investment approach continues. As I said, the 4 value-added flat-rolled steel coating lines are increasing volume and performing very well from a quality perspective. These types of high-return investments are key to our value-added product and supply chain differentiation strategies. As I mentioned also, Sinton continues to improve its operational reliability, with expectations for strong production capability in 2025. Our recent aluminum growth strategy is especially compelling. The market environment in aluminum is not unlike the steel industry was when we started SDI 30-plus years ago. It has older assets, heavy legacy costs, a lot of the facilities are inefficient and high cost, and they've had -- the industry in general has had a difficulty in earning the cost of capital. And hence, there's been little investment in facilities and new technologies in recent years. But unlike our steel entry, the one huge positive is that the -- there's a significant deficit in aluminum, just in North America in general. And that deficit is expected to grow considerably. There's a clear business alignment, they leverage our core competencies. Core competency of construction and operational know-how. And one only asked to look at the drone video on our website to see the extraordinary progress the team has made to constructing the new mills. It also will leverage our performance-driven culture, driving higher efficiency and lower cost operations. It also level Omni's recycling footprint. As Theresa suggested, we're the largest North American aluminum scrap recycler. And we also are developing some in-house new technologies to separate the 5,000 and 6,000 series alloys. It's a very, very cost-effective and a high-return growth opportunity for us. Construction of the expansive rolling mill in Columbus, Mississippi, as I said, is proceeding at an extraordinary pace. And I believe the aluminum industry is now recognizing that we truly will be a force to be reckoned with. The future customer base across all sectors is excited to have a new market entrant that is known to be innovative, customer-centric and responsive to their needs. Commercial arrangements are being put in place to match an order book to our ramp-up needs in 2025. Responses from existing and new customers across the markets remains incredible as the first for new supply. As in Sinton, we are developing an on-site industrial part to locate aluminum processing and consuming facilities. The arrangements are currently being negotiated that would create approximately 100,000 tons of annual tonne of processing capability per year. And as our project has become a visible reality and our reputation permeates the aluminum industry, aluminum professionals have been knocking at our door. And we've been building on a phenomenal team with an in-depth knowledge of aluminum operations, commercial markets, process technology and customer service. For those that may not have heard in our last call, the scope of the facility. It's a state-of-the-art 650,000 metric tonne a year aluminum flat road facility located in Columbus, Mississippi. We'll have an optimized mix of 300,000 tonnes of can start, 230,000 tonnes of auto and 130,000 tons of industrial and construction products when we're up fully running. The actual site in Columbus, Mississippi has a melt cash and lab capacity of 600,000 metric tons, and it's going to be supported by 2 satellite recycled aluminum slab casting centers located in UBC scrap rich regions. We expanded the project scope to include, as I said, additional scrap processing and segregation technologies to maximize aluminum recycled content. These in-house developed technologies are currently operating successfully separating the 5000 and 6000 series alloys on a commercial basis every day. The team plans to begin production of slabs in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, in the first quarter of 2025. We will commission the Columbus cash outs in the first quarter, downstream lines in the second quarter, with commercial shipments in mid-2025 and that is absolutely on schedule. In 2025, we plan to begin production with a product mix weighted to industrial and construction products as we qualify our Can sheet in 25 and auto products into 26. We anticipate production to grow to 50% of our annual rate by the end of 2025 and expect 75% capacity in 2026. The project is expected to add $650 million to $700 million of through-cycle annual EBITDA, and we should generate approximately $40 million to $50 million through the resegment platform in addition to that. Although this computes to a higher EBITDA per tonne than the industry has experienced in the past, we're confident in that projection. And the most significant savings are in 4 key areas: labor, recycled content, yield and logistics. Labor, we should have a reduced workforce of perhaps 700 to 750 people versus perhaps 1,200 or more in a conventional facility of this size. We have optimized plant layout and material flow. We'll have a centralized automated storage system, so there'll be no touch from slab to truck and our proven performance-based incentive-driven culture will drive high productivity, high efficiency and low cost. And we will have no legacy costs. So for those who dare the impact, I would just ask you to look at what our teams have done throughout our steel operations over the years. Recycle content. Again, we will lever our metals recycling platform to drive higher recycled content. We have the largest nonferrous operations, recycling operations as has already been stated. -- we also have a secondary aluminum facility that has been operating for many years that will be additive. We're locating satellite facilities close to the UBC rich areas to the west and in Mexico. And again, leverage the sorting technologies. The yield will be improved. We do believe it's going to be a new facility, state-of-the-art equipment and technologies. The scalping technology is absolutely state of the arm and will minimize material removal. And we're actually processing through the facility supersized coils, produce less heads, less tails, less line stops, all adding to lower yield losses. In logistics, again, locating slab centers close to rich areas will be a huge benefit as well. So the excitement within our company and particularly at the ADI sites, continues to grow as our teams recognize their ability to help revolutionize the U.S. aluminum industry as they did in steel. We're impassioned by our current and future growth plans as they will continue to drive the high return growth momentum we have consistently demonstrated over the years. The earnings growth of these new projects is compelling. The capital spending for Sinton, the 4 value ad lines and aluminum dynamics is approximately 85% complete with an estimated collective future through-cycle annual EBITDA contribution of over $1.4 billion. As a prominent institutional portfolio manager recently pointed out to us, Steel Dynamics has grown to an incredibly resilient cash-generating business, driven by the best teams in the world. We said in the last 5 years, you've invested billions of dollars in organic strategic growth. You earned a return on invested capital of 24% compared to the S&P 500 at only 12%. You've increased your cash dividend over 90%. You repurchased over 30% of your outstanding shares or the while maintaining best-in-class investment-grade credit metrics. We said it's better than a textbook capital allocation lesson. And obviously, somewhat biased, I agree. And I'm excited as investors recognize the power and consistency of our through-cycle cash generation, combined with our consistent and high return capital allocation strategy. And it's our belief that the steel industry has undergone a paradigm shift in recent years, a shift that will further support our earnings profile. There's a pervasive sense of mercantilism, which will provide a level plan field through continued and appropriate trade relief. We have COVID-driven supply chain dislocations, which have accelerated reinsuring of manufacturing. Decarbonization should materially steepen the global cost curve, providing SDI a huge competitive advantage to gain market share and increase metal spreads as our mills have some of the lowest carbon footprints in the world. AI and cloud computing should support nonresidential construction through data center buildout. And there will be growing fixed asset investment driven by the inflation reduction chips act and other public monies. In turn, with the interest rates moderating, demand will be strong, we do believe going into and through 2025. So in closing, we've been blessed with good fortune and our people are our foundation. I thank each of them for their passion and their dedication. We're committed to them. And I remind those listening today that your safety for yourselves, your families and each other is our highest priority. Our culture and business model continue to differentiate our performance leading to best-in-class financial metrics. We're an integrated metals business, providing enhanced lower carbon supply chain solutions to our customers. in turn, mitigating volatility in our cash flow generation and providing enhanced shareholder returns and value to all participants. We truly look forward to creating new opportunities for everyone today, tomorrow and in the years ahead. So with that said, we will open up the call to questions. Certainly, I think the there are no key folks or talent needed from a skill set of experience. We are pretty well built out, but we will always, always talk to anyone who wants to join us. So the management team, I think, is absolutely solid. It's a blend, a combination of seasoned aluminum folks, managers, leaders alongside our SDI proven leaders, and so you'll get the blend of aluminum experience and knowledge base with the cultural performance-driven sort of passion that we have within Steel Dynamics. So I'm incredibly, incredibly impressed by the team. It's actually a much better location and finding talent is not an easy thing nowadays, but compared to the challenges that we experienced in Sinton I think it's a much, much better location. Fortunately, we have one of our large flat rolled steel facilities right across the road. That's allowing again a transfer of people at all levels. And they can transfer over without moving the families and dislocating their lives. And so that is a huge benefit for us as well. So no, we're excited by the team there. Just to clarify, I think you recognize it, but the 80% contractual is on the flat rolled side of our business. We obviously have a whole bunch of other stuff being a very, very diversified provider, which is more in the kind of the spot day to day. Yes, sir. The – there was actually 10 countries involved in the investigation. And each of those countries, there was very demonstrative increases in the actual tons that have surged through those various countries into American markets and the necessity of including Canada and Mexico, was because of the volume of tons that are coming through those countries. The U.S. MCA is a great treaty that we all enjoy. We do good business based on that. In that agreement, there is provisions to do just what we did, which is engage the ITC for antidumping and countervailing duties cases, the numbers are staggering. And in many cases, these tons are not melt to report in those countries, but they're flowing from some of the other countries listed. So as there's problems in Asia, that puts pressure on that part of the world, and they all want to flow to our shores. So this mechanism is expensive, it's lengthy, but it's necessary to make sure that the competitive markets that we have in our United States are truly fair trade. So I think the process will render out what the appropriate duties are in each country. And if there truly was less damage for some of those countries, the final tariff amounts will reflect that. So it is something that was absolutely necessary. And as we watch, we don't ask for handouts or protection. We just ask for a fair field to play the game on. And this is all part of that process. If I could just add, you've heard us say before, we don't manage to hope nor do we manage and make strategic decisions based on, we think, trade or policy of any nature is going to go one way or the other. You have to take control of your own destiny. And I think the teams year-over-year do an absolutely phenomenal job further diversifying our product mix. I think I don't know what the recent number is 65%, 70% of our flat-rolled product mix, 65% is value add. And when we say value-add, I'm talking about really value-add. When you get into prepaint and you get into the coating developments that the teams have achieved. And most recently, they've got into this digital print stuff that literally is absolutely phenomenal. Wood grains for the Garage Door, folks and architectural. You just have to have innovation and creativity continuing to drive up the product mix. So no matter what happens, we will succeed and no matter where the trade goes, to be honest. And just one follow-up thought at Sinton. Obviously, the volume throughput on those lines is a little inhibited right now because the hot side not being at full capacity. So as you see, as we increase the throughput on the hot side, the volume through those 2 lines down there will increase in tandem. Yes. Theresa, I would just add on that, that we don't need customer approvals for this product. It's so early in the process that the use of what kind of carbon doesn't factor into what the final steel product will actually how it will perform. And I would think of it as it's not a binary decision or it's one or the other. So the path towards introducing this to the mills will really flow based on how the startup goes in the proximity and how the teams respond to it. The trials that have been done have been very successful through the Aymium pilot facility. So we have a good working knowledge going into this. And the melt shop teams are regularly meeting with the biocarbon team. And we're excited about it. It's a beautiful plant down in Mississippi. Firstly, we're not pessimistic. We're very, very constructive on the future market in 2025. There are too many things there that will drive that. And our customer base, in general, our customer base is very, very positive for '25. You should have a lower interest rate environment that will kick start nonresidential construction. New Millennium right now, the order book, the order -- the engineering, the whole flow of things is strong. It just needs a slightly lower interest rate environment for those developers to push buttons and move forward. So again, I just want to emphasize, we're constructive on the marketplace. Just in general, and it's not a matter of 2025 or it's just a matter of any market cycle. We will produce to what our customer base requires quite simply. Sorry, if I can, just -- and I think one has to recognize part of our whole business model, it revolves around just that. We recognize that the markets are cyclical in our business. And so over the years since the very beginning, 30 years ago, we have always focused on a very diversified product mix. That product mix is value add, very diverse across actual products, but also markets. That allows you a huge, huge, huge flexibility as markets ebb and flow. A very, very strong part of our strategy has always also been the pull-through volume. So if you look today, New Millennium, they consume about 600,000 tonnes, I think, what they're about last year, maybe a little bit more of the products that we make. The conversion facilities at Heartland. They've got roughly 800,000 tons of capability. You have the tax, they have about 800,000 tonne capability. So in all, our internal sort of substrate requirements is well over 2 million tonnes. We supply some of that internally, but Barry and his team also procures a lot in the marketplace. So we're actually one of the strangely, and a lot of people don't recognize it, but we're one of the largest buyers sheet products in the U.S. today. That pull-through volume can flex. So if you look at our utilization rates through cycle, those utilization rates are always superior to any of our peers because of the value-add diverse product mix and also the pull-through volume that we have internally. So even if it does come off a little bit, you will see that we retain our strong cash recycle cash generation capability without that. I didn't hear that. Well, firstly, John, we will always take your questions, sir. The – as I look across the – our portfolio, we're not strong on the recycled markets just in general, where there are regional focused opportunities to vulcanize our supply chains. We certainly will anticipate that or look at that. But I think we have a good recycle sort of platform. You will see us grow here and there to expand our aluminum supply chain. But that's well, it won't be meaningful dollars to do that. On the steel side, I think you're correct. I don't see the opportunity necessarily for another 3 million tonne a year greenfield site. We're not – as you know, we're not in business just to grow big for the sake of it. We want to differentiate our value chain. We want to always sort of diversify. – that the team has identified several value-add opportunities, products that we don't make today. And those are sort of percolating in the background and you'll see over time us continuing to lever those higher-value products. Aluminum is obviously new to us. We want to walk before we run. Get the first mill up. But there's no doubt the volume growth in aluminum going forward will be much stronger than steel and gives rise to opportunity there. As you've seen strategy in the past in steel, the move downstream again into value-add products in aluminum, capitalize on prepaint expertise. I think you will see that also."

            "name": "Theresa Wagler",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. We really do appreciate you taking the time to be on the call with us this morning. And I want to add my thanks to our teams for a really solid performance this quarter. As Mark suggested, our third quarter 2024 net income was $318 million or $2.05 per diluted share with adjusted EBITDA of $557 million. Third quarter 2024 revenue of $4.3 billion was below sequential second quarter results due to lower realized flat-rolled steel pricing tied to lagging contractual volume. Our third quarter operating income of $395 million, was 29% lower than sequential second quarter results driven by steel metal spread contraction as average realized pricing declined more than scrap raw material costs in the quarter. Our steel operations generated operating income of $305 million in the third quarter, lower than sequential results due to average realized pricing declining $79 and to $1,059 per ton, while total shipments were steady as increased flat-rolled volume offset lower structural and SBQ volume. For those of you that track our individual flat-rolled shipments quarter-by-quarter, in the third quarter, hot-rolled shipments were 942,000 tons. Cold-rolled shipments were 118,000 tons and coated shipments were 1,335 000 tons. For metals recycling operating income was $12 million, lower than sequential second quarter results due to lower realized pricing and volume. In addition, we had an unrealized noncash copper hedging loss of $10 million in September. We're the largest North American metals recycler processing and consuming ferrous scrap and nonferrous aluminum, copper and other metals, and we're growing in support of our increased steel and planned aluminum production investments through new and expanded relationships and through the use of innovative new separation technologies, I'm really proud of the team. They're also reducing operating costs very effectively. Our steel fabrication team achieved strong operating income of $166 million in the third quarter lower than second quarter results as a 5% decrease in realized pricing offset steady shipments. Order activity in the third quarter was the strongest we've seen this year, supporting our Joist Index backlog extending through the first quarter of 2025. As interest rates decline in public funding begins to be distributed post election and into 2025 and we expect to see increased fixed asset investment and corresponding demand drivers for steel and steel fabrication products next year. Regarding our aluminum investments, as a reminder, as we construct the aluminum facilities, non-capitalizable expenses are required to flow through SG&A until startup. As a result, our SG&A will be higher until we start operations in 2025. You have visibility to this amount provided in our supplemental data schedule for the third quarter, it was $24 million. We have expectations for aluminum investments to be EBITDA positive in the second half of 2025 and plan to operate the rolling mill at approximately 75% of its capacity in 2026. Mark is going to provide more details related to our ramp and product mix expectations later on the call as well as define our differentiated cost expectations. The construction of the rolling mill and the San Luis Potosi recycled slab center is going extremely well. Approximately $1.9 billion has already been invested through September of 2024, with expectations of funding between $350 million to $400 million in the fourth quarter and the remainder then to be spent in the first half of 2025. Our cash generation continues to be strong based on our differentiated circular business model and highly variable cost structure. During the third quarter of 2024, we generated cash from operations of $760 million. We ended the quarter with strong liquidity of $3.1 billion, comprised of cash and short-term investments of $1.9 billion and our fully available unsecured revolver of $1.2 billion. For the fourth quarter of '24, we believe capital investments will be in the range of $500 million to $550 million. Preliminarily, we believe 2025 capital investments will be in the range of $700 million to $800 million. We repurchased $970 million of our common stock year-to-date 2024, representing 4.5% of our outstanding shares and as of September 30, we have $486 million remaining available for share repurchases. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes high-return strategic growth with shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that's complemented with a variable share repurchase program while we remain dedicated to preserving our investment-grade credit designation. Our track record has proven achieving 5-year after-tax return on invested capital of 24% during a period of transformational growth and strong shareholder returns. Our free cash flow profile has fundamentally changed over the last 5 years from an annual average of $540 million to $2.9 billion, excluding our large strategic Sinton and aluminum investments. In July, we successfully issued $600 million of investment-grade notes with a 10-year tenure in anticipation of repaying $400 million of our notes that are due this December. Before I conclude, I want to thank the decarbonization and biocarbon teams. I'm proud of them and excited about the recent announcement concerning our new certified science-based greenhouse gas emissions intensity targets for our steel mills, which are aligned with the 1.5-degree Celsius scenario set forth in the Paris agreement. In fact, our steel mills are already well ahead of that curve. We recently set both 2050 emissions intensity target, which is aligned with the International Energy Agency's net 0 by 2050 industry targets. And an interim 2030 target, which represents a 15% reduction in our greenhouse gas intensity. These targets were established using the Global Steel Climate Council's steel climate standard of which we are a founding member. The biocarbon project is also going incredibly well with expectations for a first quarter 2025 start. Sustainability is a significant part of our long-term value creation strategy, and we're dedicated to our people, our communities and our environment. We're committed to operating our business with the highest integrity. We uniquely have an actionable path toward carbon neutrality that is more manageable and we believe considerably less expensive that may lay ahead for many of our industry peers. Our sustainability and carbon reduction strategy is an ongoing journey, and we're moving forward with the intention to make a positive difference. Thank you. Barry? Martin, I would suggest that heading into the fourth quarter, we're going to see that normal seasonality that you typically see in anything that's tied to construction. But as we look at 2025, we definitely think that there's opportunity for not just price support, but price appreciation as we've talked about interest rate changes and additional demand coming from public funding, et cetera. So we're feeling really good with the steady aspect of what we've seen in the last 6 to 9 months. And now we'll just get through the fourth quarter seasonality and then head towards what we think is going to be a really robust 2025. And the thing that Mark and Barry talked about, but without saying the exact words, the supply chain differentiation that we have. with all the products that you just spoke about. And so that's the key for us. Yes, Carlos, thanks for the question. But again, we're pretty consistent. We won't talk about pricing and commercial things as it relates to that. The commercial team they would be outside my door and they'd be ready to do bad things. So we can't do that. But from a volume perspective, we do expect regular seasonality here in the fourth quarter as it relates to the construction-related businesses, which deal fabrication is one. But we do expect to see much stronger volumes next year, which should support pricing as well. That is a very good question, Lawson, a very tricky question. So the Board is who determines what the dividend will be, and you're correct. We like to keep a positive dividend profile that generally happens in the first quarter of each year. And I would anticipate the same absent any extraneous things occurring this year as well. We do expect to have certain significant EBITDA contributor next year, which it hasn't been up to this point. So that's a significant change in the earnings profile. That being said, we'd like to see how Sinton operates in 2025. So I would expect to see a positive dividend move, but I can't really speak to the magnitude of that at this point in time. As it relates to the aluminum assets starting in 2025, very excited about that. As I mentioned in my prepared notes, we do expect those investments to be EBITDA positive in the second half of 2025, which is pretty extraordinary. So we'll really start to see that benefit 2026. So I would think that would generally be kind of a time frame to think about how that contributes to through-cycle cash flow and positive possible dividend moves. Timna, as it relates to their contribution to earnings, I would say that, that really hasn't been significantly impactful up to this point. So as a reminder, the 4 lines were about a $600 million investment. And generally, the paint and galvanizing lines for us, given our supply chain differentiation have a payback period of anywhere between 2 and 3 or 2.5 years. So pretty significant. You're going to start to really see their impact in 2025, I think as everything gets ramped up. So in that coated number, it's not just our lines that you're seeing Timna. And no, it wouldn't show like shipments of that – at that rate because you also have our our United Steel Supply and you have other processing facilities rolling through that that aren't really included in a lot of the benefit of the additional volume in the third quarter actually came through different avenues. So there's – I think – I would suggest there's more volume that still the benefit. It's not just a 1/3. So from the perspective of Sinton, No. In the third quarter, because we had additional outage time that Barry actually mentioned and because we had additional maintenance costs related to that. Sinton wasn't EBITDA positive in the third quarter, but we have full expectations that it will be in the fourth quarter and certainly next year. As it relates to the lines, they're really integral into the operations of the steel mills themselves. So to answer that question a little bit difficult. Again, I would tell you, as Mark mentioned earlier, Barry and now I will for a third time, we expect the value-add lines to really benefit 2025. So as you think about your modeling, I would add that as an additional benefit for us that's outside of just normal market dynamics. That's a good question. I would hope to have a premium, but Barry's laughing at me. So the biocarbon facility, the team is doing a great job. It's still under construction. And again, everything is pointing toward a first quarter 2025 start. We will have that product. It's already been fully tested at each of the steel mills that we'll be receiving it. We don't have enough product to satisfy all of the carbon needs at our steel mills, but a majority of it, so we'll start using that and easing that into the product mix for the steel mills as we enter the first half of next year. As far as whether or not there's premium charged to that product, that's just going to be part of our decarbonization journey. So it's going to be used as a matter of whether -- it's not for a specific customer necessarily. That's okay. You would say no. No."

            "name": "Barry Schneider",
            "content": "Thank you, Theresa. Our steel fabrication operations performed well in the third quarter, achieving historically strong earnings and steady volume in the quarter. Our steel fabrication order backlog remains at a healthy level, extending through the first quarter of 2025. We remain optimistic as it relates to demand for the steel joist and deck markets over the next number of years. Based on a moderating interest rate environment, continued manufacturing onshoring, and public funding for infrastructure and other fixed asset investment programs. The uplift from this macro environment could be considerable for this platform as well as our steel operations. Our steel fabrication platform also provides meaningful volume support for our steel operations, which allows us to constantly operate at a higher through-cycle utilization rate. It also mitigates the financial risk of lower steel prices. The metals recycling team did a good job navigating a challenging marketing -- market environment in the third quarter. There were a number of domestic steel outages, which decreased ferrous scrap demand coupled with pricing volatility. Ferrous scrap prices have stabilized, and we believe should remain relatively stable through the rest of the year subject to seasonal moves. The North American geographic footprint of our metals recycling platform provides a strategic competitive advantage for our steel mills and for our scrap generating customers. Our Mexican recycling locations competitively advantage our Columbus and Sinton raw material positions. They also strategically support increased procurement of aluminum scrap for our future flat-rolled aluminum operations. Our metals recycling team is partnering even more closely with both steel and aluminum teams to expand scrap separation capabilities through process and technology solutions. This helps mitigate potential prime ferrous scrap supply issues in the future. It also provides us with a significant advantage to increase the recycled content in our aluminum flat rolled products and increase our earnings opportunities. The steel team also had a solid quarter, achieving steady shipments of 3.2 million tons. During the third quarter of 2024, the domestic steel industry operated at an estimated production utilization rate of 78% while our steel mills operated at a rate of 86%, excluding our Sinton operation. We consistently operated at higher utilization rates due to our value-added steel product diversification, our differentiated customer supply chain solutions and the support of our internal manufacturing business. The higher through-cycle utilization of our steel mills is one of our key competitive advantages, supporting our strong and growing cash generation capability and best-in-class financial metrics. Our realized average flat-rolled steel price declined in the quarter due to contract lags, but prices stabilized and improved in the quarter. Positively, value-added flat-rolled steel pricing spreads remained resilient, supporting our earnings as we are the largest producer of these products in North America and growing. Our activity is solid heading into the fourth quarter with normal seasonal trends expected, in general, our flat-rolled steel mill lead times are actually at levels higher than we've seen over the last 6 months. Underlying steel demand remains steady, but a surge in steel imports put pressure on the supply dynamics in certain product areas, specifically for coated flat-rolled steel products. In response, we levied a trade case, and we expect to get a preliminary ruling from the ITC in a few weeks. Our Sinton, Texas, flat-rolled steel mill team successfully completed needed changes early in the quarter to access 100% of the mills north capacity. The team experienced some difficulty ramping back up after the outage. However, the reliability of the mill improved dramatically in September, and the company believes Sinton's product utilization rate will increase around 75% for the fourth quarter of 2024. Also, the additional 2 new value-added coating lines were successfully commissioned and have commenced operations, improving the mills value-add product mix and through cycle earning capability. Regarding the steel mill market environment, North American automotive production estimates for 2024, where we recently revised to stable production over the next several years. Automotive dealer inventories also continue to remain below historical norms. Nonresidential construction remained stable with slowdowns across some industries. However, we believe moderating interest rates will unlock pent-up project work and create new opportunities in 2025. Additionally, onshoring and infrastructure spending should provide further support to fixed asset investment and related construction oriented products. As for the energy market, the solar industry continues to grow and be a meaningful part for both our Flat Rolled Products and structural sections. Oil and gas also remained steady. Looking forward, we are optimistic regarding steel demand and pricing dynamics as we end 2024 and get ready to enter 2025. Katja, this is Barry Schneider. Contractual relationships are a big part of our value-added supply chain solutions. So as we've increased our paint lines and our coating lines, it keeps that concentration about in that 70% to 80% range. We anticipated this growth with our new lines. So I would see us being in the same kind of market, perhaps a little bit less in the future once we get the established customer bases and work out the supply chains in each region. Just whenever we work with high-voltage systems, you have kind of a normal making sure everything is safe as you ramp up. So having the team – the outage was about 4 days. And it was just a little bit slow to get back up to regular running rates. It's not unheard of in our industry. It was just worth noting because we did so much work. The team was really resolve some of those high-power problems we've had from the beginning, and we safely were able to do that. So all in all, I consider it a good outage the team did very well. But it wasn't like turning a light on and off. It's just a little bit more complicated with that high voltage. This is Barry. The scrap that we're able to move to our mills from the metals recycling platform is really beneficial because we find the best value and the timeliness of our supply chain allows us to really optimize that. So having the right material at the right time is essential for that business to really to get the value from it. As we look specifically at long products, our structural and heavy section mill in Columbia City is not just a heavy section mill, is also a railroad -- the largest railroad producer in the country. So we have a nice balance of where we tend to move our products. So as the markets tend to change over time, we're always able to optimize into the right product mix for the opportunity and make sure that we keep our regular customers invested and they understand what we're doing. So having that diversification of product across all of our business is essential when we're looking at how we're moderating quarter-to-quarter with the natural flow of business. So long products remains very resilient. We're excited about the opportunities that we see coming, particularly with the investment and reshoring opportunities. Carlos, this is Barry again. We do anticipate great success with these trade cases, especially with certain of these countries that were the most egregious offenders, but we routinely evaluate how we move our flat rolled products through our process lines. So we routinely move hot rolled all the way through the process into galvanized and painted. We make those decisions about where the margins are. So we've been having very good success in dealing with these pressures over the last 12 months. And you can see from our earnings results that we're finding a solution to the problem. It has to do with -- we have so much diversity in our product mix that we respond to where we can go and be safe. So I believe the ITC will come back favorable, particularly with some of the more egregious offenders and that does create an opportunity for us to go balance into a more a product mix that is more perhaps friendly to those times. Yes. Lawson, I'll try to articulate why we have confidence in what the Sinton team is doing. And the first major thing is reducing the unplanned downtime. So when things happen, as the teams not only develop themselves as teammates, but also as competency develops, they're able to address issues that they occur. So we've been making significant strides at reducing the unplanned downtime. Necessary to make that happen is improving the reliability of the equipment in the plant. As you may know, our flat-rolled steel mills are actually coupled units where we go from the furnace to the hot rolling mill as one coupled unit. And to make that happen as various parts of the system have normal issues, it can impact the other units. So what we're seeing now and we've seen days, we've seen weeks now we've seen months of continuous reduction of unplanned downtime, better reliability of the equipment, and also just as important, making sure that all the products that are actually being produced are able to get to higher value destinations through the mill, whether it's selling it as hot rolled, cold-rolled or coated products. So as we see each of the units in the mill respond, we see the uptime increasing. We see the yields getting better and better. And as we start controlling the cost situation, we see a very good path towards this facility running well. We have had weeks that we're nearly at capacity. And that, again, is more reasons we have confidence in what we see. So we see kind of the watershed moments happening under our feet. We anticipate fourth quarter to finish strong, and it really sets the stage for 2025 to really allow this facility to show the stakeholders what they've been doing and how well they've been earning it down there. I hope that helps. Timna, this is Barry. The line -- all 4 of the new lines we added are actually operating at somewhere around 65% to 75%. As we discussed with the trade cases, we've seen some pressure in certain coated products, particularly Galvalume. So we are trying to make sure we're efficiently running those lines and making sure we don't waste money by operating it at levels that perhaps we could do with the existing lines. So what we look at is the ability to really allow each line to do the proper product mix to be very efficient and to be very good yields. So we're really excited with what we've seen. The Terre Haute operations are definitely improving the opportunity for that facility to reach more markets, diversifying that product mix there by adding a second coding opportunity with Galvalume and with the prepaying opportunity. has really opened up relationships with new customers as well as existing customers who needed those products in that region. And at Sinton, the additional lines really allow us to have a more efficient operation between our galvanized coatings and our Galvalume coatings. So it might be a bit technical, but we're really excited how the lines perform. The quality itself has been very good. And that is difficult with these type of products. These are -- a lot of this new capacity is prepainted markets, which have very demanding customer base. So we've been really excited to see how the teams have responded and the sales team continues to bring new opportunities to the mills to [indiscernible]."

You also find any referenced non-GAAP financial measures reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the press release issued yesterday entitled Steel Dynamics Reports Second Quarter 2024 Results. Now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mark.\nMark Millett : Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Appreciate you being with us on our second quarter ‘24 earnings call. As you likely read, our teams achieved a solid second quarter financial and operational performance. I think most gratifying was achieving another great quarter for safety. Teams have been commissioning and ramping up four new value-added flat rolled steel coating lines at a record rapid pace, which is adding 1.1 million tons of higher margin product diversification. We're experiencing some challenges in the second quarter. The Sinton team continues to make progress, gaining full access to their melting capacity this past week. Steel shipments for the quarter with 3.2 million tons, revenues were $4.6 billion, adjusted EBITDA $686 million. Cash flow from operations was $383 million. I remain incredibly proud of the Steel Dynamics’ team. They are family. It's an honor and pleasure to be honest to be part of the team that looks out for one another and that strives for excellence each and every day. And that's why we're so focused on providing the very best for their health, their safety and their welfare. We're actively engaged in safety at all times and at every level, keeping it top of mind and an active conversation each and every day. That's significant impact the team continues to be deeply focused on our take controller safety program that is yielding an even better safety culture. But as I always say, there's more to do and we will not rest until we consistently achieve our goal of zero injuries. So with that said, Theresa, would you like to add some color to the quarter?\nTheresa Wagler : Thank you, Mark. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us and thanks to teams for another followed performance. Our second quarter 2024 net income was $428 million or $2.72 per diluted share with adjusted EBITDA of $686 million. Second quarter 2004 revenue of $4.6 billion was slightly below sequential first quarter results due to lower realized steel pricing. Our second quarter operating income of $559 million was 26% lower than first quarter results driven by steel metal spread contraction as pricing declined more than scrap raw material costs. Our steel operations generated operating income of $442 million, 34% lower sequentially due to average realized pricing declining $63 to $1,138 per ton, while total shipments were generally steady. Uniquely, all of our steel mills, except for Roanoke had planned maintenance outages in the second quarter, which impacted utilization and related conversion costs for the quarter. Additionally, our Sinton, Texas flat rolled steel division operated close to 60% of capacity for the quarter compared to almost 70% in the first quarter due to required outages to implement needed changes, which Barry will describe in a moment. Operating income from our mills recycling operations was $32 million, significantly higher than sequential first quarter results despite lower realized pricing as volumes increase and the team continues to gain operating efficiencies. As many of you already know, we're the largest North American metals recycler processing and consuming ferrous scrap and non- ferrous aluminum, copper and other metals. The team continues to effectively lever the strength of our circular manufacturing model, benefiting both our steel and metals recycling operations and shortly also our aluminum flat rolled operations. Our steel fabrication team achieved strong operating income of $181 million in the second quarter, slightly higher than first quarter sequential results. Earnings were supported with an 11% increase in shipments more than compensating for a 5% reduction in realized pricing. Our joists and deck backlog extends to the fourth quarter of 2024. Infrastructure Inflation Reduction Act, DOE, decarbonization support and manufacturing onshoring are expected to increase domestic fixed asset investment and in turn related flat and long product steel consumption and joists and deck in consumption later this year and in the coming years. A reminder, as we construct the aluminum facilities, non-capitalizable expenses are required to flow through SG&A until startup, so you'll see increased costs in this line item until we start operations mid-2025. This amount was $19 million in the second quarter. Our supplemental schedule provides visibility as a separate aluminum segment. We estimate that average similar costs of approximately $25 million per quarter will occur through the first half of 2025. We have expectations to be EBITDA positive in the second half of 2025 for our aluminum investments with plans to initially ramp with industrial type products, as we qualify our can sheet and automotive products. We expect to be operating the rolling mill at approximately 75% of its capability for the full year 2026 and full thereafter. Mark is going to provide more details related to our ramp and product mix expectations for aluminum investments later on the call, as well as our differentiated cost expectations. The construction of the aluminum rolling mill and the San Luis Potosi recycled slab center is going extremely well. We want to reaffirm the total project costs at $2.7 billion of which $1.5 billion has already been invested through June of 2024. For the remainder of 2024, we expect to invest another $900 million in the aluminum investments. And finally, in 2025, the remaining $250 million. Our cash generation continues to be strong based on our differentiated circular business model and highly variable cost structure. During the second quarter of 2024, we generated cash flow from operations of $383 million. Inventories were moderately higher in the quarter as we increased product ahead of our new value-added flat roll coding lines. Additionally, estimated tax payments were $273 million in the quarter, representing a 23% cash tax rate for the first half of the year. We ended the quarter with strong liquidity of $2.7 billion, comprised of cash and short-term investments of $1.5 billion and our fully available unsecured revolver of $1.2 billion for 2024. We believe total capital investments will be in the range of $2 billion of which we have already funded $793 million this year. In February, we increased our quarterly cash dividend 8% to $0.46 per common share, continuing our positive dividend profile as through cycle cash flow grows. We also repurchased $607 million of our common stock in 2024, representing 3% of our outstanding shares. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes high return strategic growth with shareholder distributions, comprised of a base positive dividend profile that's complimented with a variable share repurchase program. While we remain dedicated to preserving our investment grade credit designation. Our free cash flow profile has fundamentally changed over the last five years from an annual average of $540 million to currently $2.9 billion, excluding our large strategic sentence in aluminum investments. In July, we successfully issued $600 million of 5.375% investment grade notes with 10-year tenure. The proceeds will be used for general purposes and anticipation of repaying our $400 million notes due December, 2024. We are very pleased with the transaction. We thank those who invested. Lastly, sustainability is a significant part of our long-term value creation strategy. In that regard, we remain excited about our joint venture with Aymium, a leading producer of renewable biocarbon products. We believe our first joint venture facility, which we plan to start commissioning late in the fourth quarter to decrease our steel Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 35%. We uniquely have an actionable path towards carbon neutrality that is more manageable and we believe is considerably less expensive than may lay ahead for many of our industry peers. Our sustainability and carbon reduction strategy is an ongoing journey and we're moving forward with the intention to make a positive difference. Finally, for those of you on the call that track categories of our flat rolled steel shipments, in the second quarter, we shipped hot-rolled and P&O of 1,004,000 tons, cold rolled products of 124,000 tons and coated products of 1,245,000 tons. Barry?\nBarry Schneider : Thank you, Theresa. Our steel fabrication operations performed well in the second quarter, achieving strong earnings and steady volume aligned with first quarter results. The market segments that we participate in influence the mix of joist deck that we engineer for each job. Our team's ability to engineer and manufacture the best solution for each segment remains a core strength. Our steel fabrication order backlog remains at a healthy level, not extending through the end of the year. We continue to have high expectations for the business, continued onshoring and manufacturing, continue with infrastructure spending and fixed asset investment related to the IRA programs should provide momentum for additional construction spending later this year and through 2025. Our steel fabrication platform provides meaningful volume support for our steel operations, critical and softer demand environments allowing for higher through-cycle utilization compared to our peers, but also helps to mitigate the financial risk of lower steel prices. Our metals recycling operations improved earnings in the second quarter, as increased demand for North American steel producers supported higher ferrous scrap volume, more than compensating for the challenging price environment. We believe ferrous scrap prices have stabilized and should remain relatively stable through the rest of the year subject to seasonal moves. The North American geographic footprint of our metals recycling platform provides a strategic competitive advantage for our steel mills and for our scrap generating customers. In particular, our Mexican recycling locations competitively advantaged our Columbus and Sinton raw material positions. They also strategically support increased procurement of aluminum scrap for our future flat rolled aluminum operations. Our metals recycling team is partnering even more closely with both our steel and aluminum teams to expand scrap separation capabilities through both process and technology solutions. This will help mitigate potential prime ferrous scrap supply issues in the future. It will also provide us with a significant advantage to materially increase the recycled content in our aluminum flat rolled products and increase our earnings potentials. Field team had a solid quarter, achieving shipments of 3.2 million tons. During the second quarter of 2024, the domestic steel industry operated at an estimated production utilization rate of 78%, while our steel mills operated at a rate of 81%. We consistently operate at higher utilization rates due to our value added steel product diversification, our differentiated customer supply chain solutions in the support of our internal manufacturing businesses. The higher through cycle utilization of our steel mills is a key competitive advantage, supporting our strong and growing cash generation capability and best-in-class financial metrics. Our realized steel pricing declined across product portfolios as prices weakened throughout second quarter. However, value-added flat rolled steel pricing spreads remained very resilient during the same time frame, supporting our earnings as we already are the largest producer of these products in North America. And we are growing with the new addition of four coating lines with 1.1 million tons of additional capacity. Underlying demand remains steady, but customers remain hesitant to place orders due to the continuing decline of scrap prices throughout the quarter. Additionally, a surge in steel imports put pressure on the supply dynamics. However, order activity has increased over the last month, especially within the last several weeks, stabilizing our lead times, we believe this is the bottom ranch for pricing with positive moves in the future. The Sinton steel team continues to make improvements in operating efficiency and consistency. We are planning for setting to see additional improvements in production and profitability as the team took two different four day outages during the second quarter to, among other things, resolved the transform limitations we have previously discussed. The outages were necessary to install the necessary additional safety circuits and restore our electrical capacity, which will now allow us to access 100% of our the melting capacity versus the previous 80%. Also, the additional two new value line -- coating lines that's in were successfully commissioned and have commenced operations with great success, improving the mill's value added product mix and improving the operating efficiency of the facility. The additional alliance will support increased volume and margins as we head through this year. Regarding the steel market environment, North America automotive production estimates for 2024 recently revised was strong 16 million units, with continued growth expected in '25 and 2026. This forecast is based on demand resilience of stronger production results as supply chain constraints continue to dissipate. Automotive dealer inventories also continue to remain below historical norms despite the recent cyber disruptions. Non-residential construction remained stable with slowdowns across some building types due to hesitancy around higher interest rates. Additionally, onshoring and infrastructure spending should provide further meaningful support to fixed asset investment and related construction oriented projects in the coming years. As for the energy market, the sole industry continues to grow and keep oil and gas activity steady. However, increasing OTCG and line pipe imports created a challenging second quarter environment for the domestic producers. Looking forward, we are optimistic regarding steel demand and pricing dynamics for 2024. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mark.\nMark Millett: Well, thank you, Theresa. Thank you, Barry. I appreciate that. But looking toward continued growth, our consistently strong through cycle operating and financial performance continues to support our cash generation and growth investment strategies. The four value added flat rolled steel coating lines are increasing volume and have performed extremely well. These types of high return investments are key to our value added product and supply chain differentiation strategies. Regarding Sinton's progress, Barry will provide some more information but the team completed a key task this week. And as we look forward to the rest of the year, we have confidence in increased volume and profitability from them. Aluminum growth strategy, I believe, is especially compelling. We're achieving fast paced progress on the construction of our aluminum flat rolled investments. There continues to be strong commercial support for a new and innovative supply chain solution from Steel Dynamics for the aluminum industry has become to consider a well-known and highly regarded metals producer today. Responses from existing and new customers across the markets still remain incredible. As a quick overview of the project is a 650,000 metric ton aluminum flat rolled facility in Columbus, Mississippi. So the state-of-the-art plant and with an optimized target mix of 300,000 ton of can stock, as in tons of industrial and construction products. On-site melting and casting slab capacity to 600,000 metric tons and be supported by two satellite recycled aluminum slab casting centers located in UBC scrap ridge regions. We expanded the product scope to include additional scrap processing and segregation technologies to maximize our aluminum recycled content. Start-up plans right now for the rolling mill to start up in mid-‘25, the Mexico slab center in the first quarter '25 with the U.S. slab center coming in online in the second half of '25. From an investment premise perspective, I think the market environment today in aluminum is similar to the domestic steel industry when we started SDI 30 years ago. It has older assets that has heavy legacy costs, the mills are somewhat inefficient and high-cost operations. As an industry that has difficulty -- or has had difficulty in earning cost of capital and hence, has little investment in facilities and new technologies over time. Different though than the steel environment 30 years ago is that there's an absolute supply deficit which exists in the market in North America, and that deficit is likely to grow. It's aligned with our business, we can leverage our core competencies of our construction and operational know-how and we can drive performance through our culture, which in turn will drive high efficiency and low-cost operation. It also levers our Omni recycling footprint. Today, Omni is the largest North American aluminum scrap recycler and has developed some very unique and innovative separation technologies that can segregate the different aluminum supply streams coming to them. So very, very cost effective and a high-return growth opportunity for us. The team plans to begin production of slabs in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, as I said in the first quarter '25 followed by the commission on the Roanoke mill mid-‘25, and those are both on schedule for those days. In '25, we plan to begin production with a mix heavier weighted to industrial and construction product sectors, as we qualify our can sheet and automotive products. We believe volumes for the second half of 25% will be at 50% of capacity, growing to 75% in 2026. Through the first 24 months, we will continue to transition the product mix to more can sheet in automotive targeting the 45% can sheet, 30%-35% automotive in probably 2027. We have some key can and auto customers that are keen in helping us achieve the highest quality in a shorter time as possible. And I know our team is up to it. The total project cost, including the recycled slab centers is $2.7 billion, and we are confident in the budget. Virtually all equipment and construction contracts are complete. And we also expect to add about $650 million to $700 million of through-cycle annual EBITDA plus an additional $40 million to $50 million for the Omni recycling platform, and we are confident in our operating cost assumptions. And some of you have asked us to try and quantify these areas of savings as we've outlined them in the past and help you differentiate our project to the rest of the industry. The most significant savings are in four key areas: labor, recycled content, yield and logistics. The labor, which makes up, in our mind, about 35% of the differential, we will have a reduced workforce. We would anticipate somewhere around 750 people versus over 1,200 or more for a competitive plan today. That comes from an optimized plant layout and material flow. And we also have a central automated storage system. So when there will be no sort of human touch to the product from slab to truck, eliminating a massive amount of material handling and a huge number of folks, we drive productivity through our culture and our performance-based incentives. We obviously will not have the high legacy costs that some, again, existing competitors have today. And I would suggest that there should be no data that we can achieve these sorts of things, the productivity levels, et cetera, as we have done in steel over the years. The second differential would be recycled content and that's probably 25% of the differential. I believe can do that through levering the OmniSource platform. Again, the largest non-ferrous recycler in North America today. We already have a secondary aluminum operation that we can also lean on. The satellite facilities will also help being close to UBC rich areas. Again, I think the innovative segregation technologies that we've developed actually in-house will also allow us to increase the recycled content compared to our competitors. The third area would be yield. And I think we're being a little conservative here, but that would be about 20% of the differential. Firstly, obviously, we're going to have just a brand-new state-of-the-art facility, which will help for sure. The sculpting technology is an innovative state-of-the-art, it doesn't just rely on just shaving off a half an inch or three quarters of an inch whatever of the slab. It measures the profile of the slab, measures the quality of the slab and we will only take off what is absolutely needed. We will also be utilizing through the mill sort of supersized coils. So the less front-end tails, et cetera, yield loss there. So I think we're comfortable with the substantial improvement in yield. And then logistics are probably 10% of that. And again, locating the slab satellite lab centers next to or within UBC rich areas, allowing us to melt and cast that material and ship big, heavy, solid slab versus less dense UBC bales and then taking the yield loss there is a considerable freight advantage to that. We're excited, and I think that excitement is palpable within our company as our younger generations want to emulate our steel history and revolutionize the North American aluminum market. More generally, we're impassioned by our current and future growth plans as they will continue to drive the high return growth momentum we've consistently demonstrated over the years. A disciplined, intentional organic and acquisition strategy focused on differentiated value added supply chain solutions is providing sustainable cash generation. Near-term, the continued symptom ramp-up of four new coating lines, closely followed by our aluminum strategy will significantly increase that through cycle cash flow generation. And I'm excited looking forward. I believe that the market dynamics are in place to support long-term demand growth across all our operating platforms. As Theresa mentioned, North America will benefit from continued onshoring of manufacturing businesses and the U.S. will benefit from the allocation of public monies from the infrastructure program, Inflation Act and other public programs. Geodynamics is levered to benefit from those programs through increased steel joist and deck demand flat and long product steel demand and the associated higher demand for recycled scrap and aluminum. Furthermore, and I don't believe it should be understated, we were blessed with the best-in-class carbon footprint. Our integrated peers, both domestic and global will be spending substantial CapEx to bring their carbon footprint down. Those that are including hydrogen-based DRI, but also incur additional operating expense of some $200 per ton. This will materially steepen the global cost curve and will support higher product pricing in the future. And we, SDI being at the bottom of the cost curve will effectively expand our long-term metal spread through the cycle. In closing, our teams, as I've always said in our foundation, I thank each of them for their passion and their dedication, we are committed to them and remind them to listening today that safety for yourselves, your families and each other is the highest priority. Our culture and our business model continue to positively differentiate our performance leading to best-in-class financial metrics. And we are no longer a pure steel company, but an integrated metals business providing enhanced supply chain solutions to the industry. In turn, mitigating volatility and cash flow generation through all market cycles. We are competitively positioned and continue to focus on providing superior value for our company, our customers, team members and shareholders alike. We look forward to creating new opportunities for all of us today and in the years ahead. That being said, Matt, would love to listen or here the questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Carlos De Alba from Morgan Stanley.\nCarlos De Alba : Just wanted to ask you, Mark, can you remind us what is the recycled content that you expect to have in the aluminum project and how that may evolve over time?\nMark Millett : Well, as it depends, to be honest, on the product from an over time, it will improve, obviously. Our target for the UBC is around about 90% to 95%. UBC raw material. But for the can sheet will be 90%, 95% with a certain aim of 95%. And I think that to some degree is reliant -- is achievable because of the segregation technologies that we've developed to get differentiate the 5,000 series from other products. The automotive would be lower than that. And I think our aim would be around about 70%.\nCarlos De Alba : So overall, it's probably going to be something closer to 80%, 85%?\nMark Millett : I've not done the math, but it had intuitively, that sounds right.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Martin Englert from Seaport Research Partners.\nMartin Englert : For low copper shredded scrap, can you provide an update on the processing capacity within the internal network and any ongoing growth initiatives there and where you think that capability might be entering next year?\nMark Millett : I think the question was the low copper [shrimp]. Yes, we're continuing to expand that to all our shredding operations. As far as the absolute volume I would just say we -- in addition to the technologies to segregate the scrap, the fare scrap, get the copper residuals out requires quite a bit of know-how in the melt shop to fully utilize that. So we've been expanding that growth down to our Mississippi mill and also into Sinton. So right now, we have a very healthy mix at our Columbus flat roll or Butler flat roll mill, where we have the requirements we need. So the investments that Omni's making takes that product even further down into the South where we can get better utilization at the other flat rolled mills. So we're very excited about the opportunity and also how to deploy it once it gets to the mills. That's -- as -- probably half of the problem is how to get it usefully into your mix in the mills. And we're making great progress on that as well.\nMartin Englert : Are you putting the technology in at the shredding facilities or are you co-locating it at the mills?\nMark Millett : To this point, it's at the shredding facilities. And it is a series of equipment to pull the value streams out along the way. So not only does it reduce the copper in the actual scrap shred for setting to the mills, but it also allows us to obtain better recoveries in the other elements coming out of the scrap stream, the Zorba the Twitch and so forth. So at the facility is the best place to put those. And right now, that's where our focus -- our efforts have been focused.\nMartin Englert : And no current estimates as to how much of your capability is for processing that today?\nMark Millett: I can't give you the actual number, but we're confident that we will be able to create a volume that matches our productivity of our sheet mills.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Tristan Gresser from BNP Paribas Exane.\nTristan Gresser : The first one is on Sinton. I think back in April, you mentioned that you had that maintenance and that the transformer issue kind of -- was about to be solved. But now it seems this issue lasted for longer, as you only mentioned that you only got full capability back last week. So if you can explain a little bit of what happened and why it took longer essentially? And also was Sinton EBITDA positive in Q2? And do you expect a significant step-up in profitability into Q3? Or is that going to be a much more gradual process given the market conditions?\nBarry Schneider : On the outage front out in Sinton, the work we had to do take place in the high-voltage switchyard. So we bring in transmission voltage in Texas. We're the only facility in the state of Texas that actually brings in 345,000 volts. So in the early April outages, we put the concrete down it's necessary to support the equipment and made bus modifications. And as the equipment arrived, there's a protocol of both testing the equipment, pressurizing it, safely bringing it to a position where we're ready to turn it on. And during that process required us to they have the high voltage also shut off. So as we actually got the equipment fully on-site, fully installed and now turned on the equipment, there's a series of outage that comes along with that. And we kind of identified the kind of the key steps in the process. So we did have a slight delay with the hurricane situation in South Texas. And just out of prudence, we decided to make sure we weren't in the process of messing with our high-voltage system when we add hurricane winds. So we're in a much better place now. We're very comfortable that we've addressed the root cause. We put in some new safety gear that works in the electrical world, and that's as deep as I can go into it myself, I'm mechanical guy. But we're confident that we're positioned now to really fully utilize the power in the furnace. And the teams are practice-wise are up to speed. So we do see this as a big key step in getting even more productivity out of the plant.\nMark Millett : And if I could add and perhaps expand a whole further. And we took a little bit of a little below in an hour's report last night with our performance there at Sinton. But I think there needs to be a recognition that we're developing the next-generation technology down there. It is an absolutely phenomenal technology and it's what the world is going to be using going forward. And the important things such as the product qualities that we wanted to achieve, the improved surface quality, the tougher higher-strength qualities produced through the moment mechanical rolling. But the productivity, the design capability from a productivity standpoint is totally proven. We can produce over 5,000 tons a shift down there. So the technology is absolutely there. All we have to do is simply increase the utilization of that facility.\nTristan Gresser : So I guess Sinton was not EBITDA positive in Q2. And that means there could be a significant step-up in profitability into Q3?\nTheresa Wagler : Tristan, you're correct. So for the second quarter, we were basically breakeven from an EBITDA perspective. And so there's very high expectations for the second half of the year as it relates to Sinton.\nTristan Gresser : And maybe a quick follow-up on that -- on the supply outlook as you bring more volume from Sinton. I mean if we look at U.S. HRC prices is down 40% from peak and margin on a spot basis. They haven't been that low for a long period of time. So I guess, why do you think that the market can absorb a higher volume from Sinton? And have you contemplated it instead reducing production more capacity at this time. And lastly, in that type of environment where some of your peers are probably much more difficult conditions, have you been able to gain market share?\nBarry Schneider : We're very confident that the products that we offer out of site, as Mark spoke, we had to get new technology to be able to respond to the customer base in that region. We're selling quite a bit of tons into Mexico. And a lot of these tons are heavier, higher strength steels where we find more value, and there are also products that the market needs in that region. So we've been welcomed across the different market segments with the abilities that we brought to the table there. So we do see the market being receptive to having a regional supplier. As you know, the import action in that area is particularly different. It's heightened versus the rest of the country. And so to have a local supply chain of high-value products is welcome right now for the customer base. And when I say regional, that's Mexico, we're a few short hours truck right in the Monterrey. So we continue to see good response, good results down there. And we're being very judicious with our time. We know we will develop new products in the future. But right now, we have a very good offering. And with the new value lines, both painted and galvanized capability, we're able to really penetrate further into the markets where there wasn't local providers before. So we remain really bullish on what the capability in the market is to absorb high-value tons from a regional source.\nMark Millett : And to be honest, today, we can sell every time we can produce in Sinton, it's not a market restricted shipment number. And I think you also have to look at the incredible growth that will take place in demand growth that will take place in Mexico over the next few years. If you look at we -- and others talk about onshoring, reshoring, transhoring, however you want to look at it, the growth then in Mexico, you've got to be there to witness and experience is absolutely phenomenal. So the market is going to continue to grow as we anticipated back in, I think, '18 -- 2018, 2019, when we came up with the project in the first place.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Timna Tanners from Wolfe Research.\nTimna Tanners : Wanted to just one quick follow-up on different take on Sinton. Trying to understand why it's still at 75% guided in your release into second half and not full out? And then also, is there an opportunity to boost exports given that Lazarus Carnis has been down for, I think, almost 1 month, 1.5 months? Or is there any issue with the trade protections against Mexico, does that change the dynamic any?\nBarry Schneider : We don't see the trade dynamics changing with Mexico in the short-term. There is an effort, of course, to stop the surge, and there's been recent activity in the 232. We anticipate that the products that we're currently moving into Mexico will continue to move that way. There is a shortage in the Mexican market because of other outages that are in Mexico. So we'll continue to take advantage of opportunities where it makes sense. And as we look at the total capacity, we -- like most things, as a steel plant, it's not a light switch, we just turn on. So as we look towards growing through the second half of the year, we believe as we look at the second half, we're going to achieve those utilization rates.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Katja Jancic from BMO.\nKatja Jancic : Maybe going back to the aluminum rolling mill for a bit. I think you mentioned that initially, the mix is going to be more tilted to industrial products. Can you talk a little bit -- is there a margin difference between industrial products, the can sheet and auto markets products?\nMarkMillett : Yes. I guess the thinner margins tend to be in can sheet, if you were to stack them, again, because of the just the volume of that product. The industrial products, particularly if we were to put them through our paint lines are going to be as valuable as any of the outputs.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Andrew Keches from Barclays.\nAndrew Keches : A question for Theresa. Look, you've refinanced the 2024 notes or maybe even some of the '25. You generally just seem to be in a pretty favorable balance sheet position right now that you've been upgraded by two of the agencies in the past year. You got another positive, you through a lot of the aluminum spending, leverage is still pretty low and you'll get the cash flow benefit from that probably by the end of '25 or '26, it sounds like. So I guess just taking a step back, can you just give us an update in terms of what the direction of the balance sheet is from here? Do you see the capacity to carry more leverage knowing how leverage has been relatively conservative at low pricing points? Or do you want to preserve some optionality for future opportunities? I guess that's a hidden second question on what the pipeline might look like for you.\nTheresa Wagler : So yes, the balance sheet does have extra capacity for leverage. As you know, ahead of large projects, organic projects, specifically like Sinton at just under $2 billion and now the aluminum investments at $2.7 billion. We like to be a little more conservative with the balance sheet and build cash in advance of those investments so that we can make sure that we still have optionality for growth if there would be a downturn, because we like to have that optionality, you tend to get better value and better valuations and return in a weaker demand environment. So there is room on the balance sheet. And that's why we've been able to actually stay consistent and grow the shareholder distributions during these high-growth period, which is very important to us and we think is very beneficial to the shareholders as well. So we -- you will likely see us continue -- well, you will see us continue with our strong shareholder distributions. There are other opportunities for growth. There are some organic opportunities that the teams are talking about, they're not nearly at the size or scope of aluminum at Sinton, but they are absolutely beneficial differentiating high return, et cetera. In addition to that, we do believe that there could be some optionality in transactions. We're very particular. We're very disciplined as it relates to acquisitions, ensuring that there is an appropriate valuation and return for Steel Dynamics. So you do see us being more disciplined than some others in the industry. But that being said, we think that there will be some opportunities along those lines as well. So I would just say more of the same, yet at the same time, we understand that the balance sheet is there to use.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Bill Peterson from JPMorgan.\nBill Peterson : I guess the question is, when do you expect to lock in long-term contracts for the rolling mill maybe across the markets as well as can you update us on your latest thoughts in terms of the qualification time line for packaging and automotive, those markets? How long it will take to kind of just qualify in those markets?\nMark Millett : As we say, I said earlier, the initial material for qualification of the can sheet and auto will start in '25. As you can recognize, the consumer base is not necessarily going to dedicate long, long, long contracts at that moment in time. But come to the end of '26 would expect the longer-term contracts, which in those markets are three, four years duration would be in '26.\nTheresa Wagler : I would just add to that, that we have -- there's a very extensive both demand draw and plan in place for 2025 and 2026 purposely with a numerous number of customers that have already indicated volumes that they would have available to us, for all of the industrial for the automotive and for the can sheet. So it's a very robust commercial dialogue that we're having, and we feel very confident in having the ability to market those materials in the interim.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Alex Hacking from Citi Investment Research.\nAlex Hacking : Just a clarification on the aluminum mill. When you talk about 50% utilization in '25 and 75% in '26, is that the average or that's the exit rate?\nTheresa Wagler : No. For the 2026, Alex, that's not the exit rate. That's for the full year. The exit rate would be close to full capacity in 2026.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from John Tumazos from Very Independent Research.\nJohn Tumazos : Concerning the total steel market, last year, indirect steel imports rose another 3 million tons. And in April and May, total steel imports, including slabs were 30% share. I didn't get it right. I thought with all the new beautiful, new electric furnace steel capacity coming online, domestic shipments would rise and imports would fall. Do you think there's a customer preference for blast furnace metal? Or do you think domestic pricing in hindsight was just too aggressive, too high. It amazes me when the customers want the foreign steel because the delivery window isn't precise, and they have to carry much more inventory and have much more steel price risk, et cetera.\nMark Millett : Well, I think, John, as we see the imports, I think generally for the year, year-to-date are up like 10% or thereabouts and that the licenses are mitigating a little. The propensity is in coated products. They were up minus 60% year-to-date. And obviously, the spread, the hot band, the coated spread is still above $200 or thereabouts and our dear foreign friends have taken advantage of that to some degree.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Carlos De Alba from Morgan Stanley.\nCarlos De Alba : I just want to see if you can comment on the pricing for the backlog in the fabrication business. If I heard correctly, the backlog extends into the fourth quarter. Any color that you can offer on the pricing for that material?\nTheresa Wagler : Carlos, we can't be specific about that. I would tell you that from a historical basis, it's very strong on a go-forward basis, and there has been stabilization in pricing and specifically around the joist products and the decking products as well. So that's all the color we can give you. I apologize.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Chris LaFemina from Jefferies.\nChrist LaFemina : Most of my questions have been asked, but I just had one on the cash flow in the second quarter and in particular, on the working capital build, how should we think about the reversal of that through the second half of the year? And what portion of that working capital build is a function of the aluminum mill and still ramping up? Is some of that going to kind of linger into 2025 and 2026?\nTheresa Wagler : None of it related to really the aluminum mill at this point in time because we're still constructing and as it relates to the San Luis Potosi slab center they're just getting ready to kind of start maybe building some scrap reserves in anticipation of slab production in the first quarter of 2025. As it relates to the build, there has -- there was a structural increase in inventories related to the four value added lines as we were putting substrate in front of those lines in anticipation of ramping them up during this period of time. And so there will still be some increase as Sinton ramps up the second half of the year structurally, but there is also availability of inventory reduction at the long product steel mills and some of the other areas. So I would expect to see working capital not be a significant draw in the second half of the year, but rather potentially be either not neutral or a funding source. The biggest part of the moving cash flow was really our estimated tax payments in the quarter.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Timna Tanners from Wolfe Research.\nTimna Tanners : I was also asking about cash flow. If we think about the $1.2 billion remaining CapEx in the second half, the $400 million debt pay down, I'm just trying to think about if you want to keep the buyback steady as you have over the last several quarters? Or if there's any shifts that you might make to your capital allocation policy given those big uses of cash?\nTheresa Wagler : We're very comfortable with our cash flow generation capability at this point in time, given what we can see, there's no expectation of changing our capital allocation policy for the remainder of the year.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Alex Hacking from Citi Investment Research.\nAlex Hacking : I'm just curious in your perspective or are you concerned about some of the rhetoric around Mexico and the steel trade with Mexico. The U.S. is a net export for flat steel to Mexico, right? Sinton is targeting Mexico for off take. Are you concerned that some of the rhetoric that's sprung up recently could lead to more tariffs, retaliatory tariffs. And is that a potential risk that you're considering? Or how do you think about that?\nMark Millett : Well, I guess from my perspective, there's certainly some noise and perhaps short-term aggravations going back and forth. But longer term, as I said earlier, the growth -- the steel demand growth within Mexico is going to continue to be considerable. They're going to continue to be still short. They're going to need our products. In particular, they're going to need our coated and downstream products, perhaps more -- a little more so than hot band. But they're going to be still short and in the big picture, I don't see a material problem now.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Millett for any closing remarks.\nMark Millett : Well, again, thank you, everyone. I just want to close and saying, I think SDI, it's an incredible company doing incredible things. We couldn't do it without our inspirational teams and their families. We can't do it without the support of our loyal customers. We will continue to work with you to create innovative value creating opportunities for you, both of things you need today and what you may not even know you need tomorrow. And again, we need the support of our service providers that you folks are integral with everything we do. And for those that are shareholders, thank you for your faith in us. We treat your investment as our own, and we will continue to grow our company wisely. Thank you. Have a great day. Be safe.\nOperator: Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation and have a great and safe day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mark Millett",
            "content": "Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Appreciate you being with us on our second quarter ‘24 earnings call. As you likely read, our teams achieved a solid second quarter financial and operational performance. I think most gratifying was achieving another great quarter for safety. Teams have been commissioning and ramping up four new value-added flat rolled steel coating lines at a record rapid pace, which is adding 1.1 million tons of higher margin product diversification. We're experiencing some challenges in the second quarter. The Sinton team continues to make progress, gaining full access to their melting capacity this past week. Steel shipments for the quarter with 3.2 million tons, revenues were $4.6 billion, adjusted EBITDA $686 million. Cash flow from operations was $383 million. I remain incredibly proud of the Steel Dynamics' team. They are family. It's an honor and pleasure to be honest to be part of the team that looks out for one another and that strives for excellence each and every day. And that's why we're so focused on providing the very best for their health, their safety and their welfare. We're actively engaged in safety at all times and at every level, keeping it top of mind and an active conversation each and every day. That's significant impact the team continues to be deeply focused on our take controller safety program that is yielding an even better safety culture. But as I always say, there's more to do and we will not rest until we consistently achieve our goal of zero injuries. So with that said, Theresa, would you like to add some color to the quarter? Well, thank you, Theresa. Thank you, Barry. I appreciate that. But looking toward continued growth, our consistently strong through cycle operating and financial performance continues to support our cash generation and growth investment strategies. The four value added flat rolled steel coating lines are increasing volume and have performed extremely well. These types of high return investments are key to our value added product and supply chain differentiation strategies. Regarding Sinton's progress, Barry will provide some more information but the team completed a key task this week. And as we look forward to the rest of the year, we have confidence in increased volume and profitability from them. Aluminum growth strategy, I believe, is especially compelling. We're achieving fast paced progress on the construction of our aluminum flat rolled investments. There continues to be strong commercial support for a new and innovative supply chain solution from Steel Dynamics for the aluminum industry has become to consider a well-known and highly regarded metals producer today. Responses from existing and new customers across the markets still remain incredible. As a quick overview of the project is a 650,000 metric ton aluminum flat rolled facility in Columbus, Mississippi. So the state-of-the-art plant and with an optimized target mix of 300,000 ton of can stock, as in tons of industrial and construction products. On-site melting and casting slab capacity to 600,000 metric tons and be supported by two satellite recycled aluminum slab casting centers located in UBC scrap ridge regions. We expanded the product scope to include additional scrap processing and segregation technologies to maximize our aluminum recycled content. Start-up plans right now for the rolling mill to start up in mid-‘25, the Mexico slab center in the first quarter '25 with the U.S. slab center coming in online in the second half of '25. From an investment premise perspective, I think the market environment today in aluminum is similar to the domestic steel industry when we started SDI 30 years ago. It has older assets that has heavy legacy costs, the mills are somewhat inefficient and high-cost operations. As an industry that has difficulty -- or has had difficulty in earning cost of capital and hence, has little investment in facilities and new technologies over time. Different though than the steel environment 30 years ago is that there's an absolute supply deficit which exists in the market in North America, and that deficit is likely to grow. It's aligned with our business, we can leverage our core competencies of our construction and operational know-how and we can drive performance through our culture, which in turn will drive high efficiency and low-cost operation. It also levers our Omni recycling footprint. Today, Omni is the largest North American aluminum scrap recycler and has developed some very unique and innovative separation technologies that can segregate the different aluminum supply streams coming to them. So very, very cost effective and a high-return growth opportunity for us. The team plans to begin production of slabs in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, as I said in the first quarter '25 followed by the commission on the Roanoke mill mid-‘25, and those are both on schedule for those days. In '25, we plan to begin production with a mix heavier weighted to industrial and construction product sectors, as we qualify our can sheet and automotive products. We believe volumes for the second half of 25% will be at 50% of capacity, growing to 75% in 2026. Through the first 24 months, we will continue to transition the product mix to more can sheet in automotive targeting the 45% can sheet, 30%-35% automotive in probably 2027. We have some key can and auto customers that are keen in helping us achieve the highest quality in a shorter time as possible. And I know our team is up to it. The total project cost, including the recycled slab centers is $2.7 billion, and we are confident in the budget. Virtually all equipment and construction contracts are complete. And we also expect to add about $650 million to $700 million of through-cycle annual EBITDA plus an additional $40 million to $50 million for the Omni recycling platform, and we are confident in our operating cost assumptions. And some of you have asked us to try and quantify these areas of savings as we've outlined them in the past and help you differentiate our project to the rest of the industry. The most significant savings are in four key areas: labor, recycled content, yield and logistics. The labor, which makes up, in our mind, about 35% of the differential, we will have a reduced workforce. We would anticipate somewhere around 750 people versus over 1,200 or more for a competitive plan today. That comes from an optimized plant layout and material flow. And we also have a central automated storage system. So when there will be no sort of human touch to the product from slab to truck, eliminating a massive amount of material handling and a huge number of folks, we drive productivity through our culture and our performance-based incentives. We obviously will not have the high legacy costs that some, again, existing competitors have today. And I would suggest that there should be no data that we can achieve these sorts of things, the productivity levels, et cetera, as we have done in steel over the years. The second differential would be recycled content and that's probably 25% of the differential. I believe can do that through levering the OmniSource platform. Again, the largest non-ferrous recycler in North America today. We already have a secondary aluminum operation that we can also lean on. The satellite facilities will also help being close to UBC rich areas. Again, I think the innovative segregation technologies that we've developed actually in-house will also allow us to increase the recycled content compared to our competitors. The third area would be yield. And I think we're being a little conservative here, but that would be about 20% of the differential. Firstly, obviously, we're going to have just a brand-new state-of-the-art facility, which will help for sure. The sculpting technology is an innovative state-of-the-art, it doesn't just rely on just shaving off a half an inch or three quarters of an inch whatever of the slab. It measures the profile of the slab, measures the quality of the slab and we will only take off what is absolutely needed. We will also be utilizing through the mill sort of supersized coils. So the less front-end tails, et cetera, yield loss there. So I think we're comfortable with the substantial improvement in yield. And then logistics are probably 10% of that. And again, locating the slab satellite lab centers next to or within UBC rich areas, allowing us to melt and cast that material and ship big, heavy, solid slab versus less dense UBC bales and then taking the yield loss there is a considerable freight advantage to that. We're excited, and I think that excitement is palpable within our company as our younger generations want to emulate our steel history and revolutionize the North American aluminum market. More generally, we're impassioned by our current and future growth plans as they will continue to drive the high return growth momentum we've consistently demonstrated over the years. A disciplined, intentional organic and acquisition strategy focused on differentiated value added supply chain solutions is providing sustainable cash generation. Near-term, the continued symptom ramp-up of four new coating lines, closely followed by our aluminum strategy will significantly increase that through cycle cash flow generation. And I'm excited looking forward. I believe that the market dynamics are in place to support long-term demand growth across all our operating platforms. As Theresa mentioned, North America will benefit from continued onshoring of manufacturing businesses and the U.S. will benefit from the allocation of public monies from the infrastructure program, Inflation Act and other public programs. Geodynamics is levered to benefit from those programs through increased steel joist and deck demand flat and long product steel demand and the associated higher demand for recycled scrap and aluminum. Furthermore, and I don't believe it should be understated, we were blessed with the best-in-class carbon footprint. Our integrated peers, both domestic and global will be spending substantial CapEx to bring their carbon footprint down. Those that are including hydrogen-based DRI, but also incur additional operating expense of some $200 per ton. This will materially steepen the global cost curve and will support higher product pricing in the future. And we, SDI being at the bottom of the cost curve will effectively expand our long-term metal spread through the cycle. In closing, our teams, as I've always said in our foundation, I thank each of them for their passion and their dedication, we are committed to them and remind them to listening today that safety for yourselves, your families and each other is the highest priority. Our culture and our business model continue to positively differentiate our performance leading to best-in-class financial metrics. And we are no longer a pure steel company, but an integrated metals business providing enhanced supply chain solutions to the industry. In turn, mitigating volatility and cash flow generation through all market cycles. We are competitively positioned and continue to focus on providing superior value for our company, our customers, team members and shareholders alike. We look forward to creating new opportunities for all of us today and in the years ahead. That being said, Matt, would love to listen or here the questions. Well, as it depends, to be honest, on the product from an over time, it will improve, obviously. Our target for the UBC is around about 90% to 95%. UBC raw material. But for the can sheet will be 90%, 95% with a certain aim of 95%. And I think that to some degree is reliant -- is achievable because of the segregation technologies that we've developed to get differentiate the 5,000 series from other products. The automotive would be lower than that. And I think our aim would be around about 70%. I've not done the math, but it had intuitively, that sounds right. I think the question was the low copper [shrimp]. Yes, we're continuing to expand that to all our shredding operations. As far as the absolute volume I would just say we -- in addition to the technologies to segregate the scrap, the fare scrap, get the copper residuals out requires quite a bit of know-how in the melt shop to fully utilize that. So we've been expanding that growth down to our Mississippi mill and also into Sinton. So right now, we have a very healthy mix at our Columbus flat roll or Butler flat roll mill, where we have the requirements we need. So the investments that Omni's making takes that product even further down into the South where we can get better utilization at the other flat rolled mills. So we're very excited about the opportunity and also how to deploy it once it gets to the mills. That's -- as -- probably half of the problem is how to get it usefully into your mix in the mills. And we're making great progress on that as well. To this point, it's at the shredding facilities. And it is a series of equipment to pull the value streams out along the way. So not only does it reduce the copper in the actual scrap shred for setting to the mills, but it also allows us to obtain better recoveries in the other elements coming out of the scrap stream, the Zorba the Twitch and so forth. So at the facility is the best place to put those. And right now, that's where our focus -- our efforts have been focused. I can't give you the actual number, but we're confident that we will be able to create a volume that matches our productivity of our sheet mills. And if I could add and perhaps expand a whole further. And we took a little bit of a little below in an hour's report last night with our performance there at Sinton. But I think there needs to be a recognition that we're developing the next-generation technology down there. It is an absolutely phenomenal technology and it's what the world is going to be using going forward. And the important things such as the product qualities that we wanted to achieve, the improved surface quality, the tougher higher-strength qualities produced through the moment mechanical rolling. But the productivity, the design capability from a productivity standpoint is totally proven. We can produce over 5,000 tons a shift down there. So the technology is absolutely there. All we have to do is simply increase the utilization of that facility. And to be honest, today, we can sell every time we can produce in Sinton, it's not a market restricted shipment number. And I think you also have to look at the incredible growth that will take place in demand growth that will take place in Mexico over the next few years. If you look at we -- and others talk about onshoring, reshoring, transhoring, however you want to look at it, the growth then in Mexico, you've got to be there to witness and experience is absolutely phenomenal. So the market is going to continue to grow as we anticipated back in, I think, '18 -- 2018, 2019, when we came up with the project in the first place. As we say, I said earlier, the initial material for qualification of the can sheet and auto will start in '25. As you can recognize, the consumer base is not necessarily going to dedicate long, long, long contracts at that moment in time. But come to the end of '26 would expect the longer-term contracts, which in those markets are three, four years duration would be in '26. Well, I think, John, as we see the imports, I think generally for the year, year-to-date are up like 10% or thereabouts and that the licenses are mitigating a little. The propensity is in coated products. They were up minus 60% year-to-date. And obviously, the spread, the hot band, the coated spread is still above $200 or thereabouts and our dear foreign friends have taken advantage of that to some degree. Well, I guess from my perspective, there's certainly some noise and perhaps short-term aggravations going back and forth. But longer term, as I said earlier, the growth -- the steel demand growth within Mexico is going to continue to be considerable. They're going to continue to be still short. They're going to need our products. In particular, they're going to need our coated and downstream products, perhaps more -- a little more so than hot band. But they're going to be still short and in the big picture, I don't see a material problem now. Well, again, thank you, everyone.

Our second quarter 2024 net income was $428 million or $2.72 per diluted share with adjusted EBITDA of $686 million. Second quarter 2004 revenue of $4.6 billion was slightly below sequential first quarter results due to lower realized steel pricing. Our second quarter operating income of $559 million was 26% lower than first quarter results driven by steel metal spread contraction as pricing declined more than scrap raw material costs. Our steel operations generated operating income of $442 million, 34% lower sequentially due to average realized pricing declining $63 to $1,138 per ton, while total shipments were generally steady. Uniquely, all of our steel mills, except for Roanoke had planned maintenance outages in the second quarter, which impacted utilization and related conversion costs for the quarter. Additionally, our Sinton, Texas flat rolled steel division operated close to 60% of capacity for the quarter compared to almost 70% in the first quarter due to required outages to implement needed changes, which Barry will describe in a moment. Operating income from our mills recycling operations was $32 million, significantly higher than sequential first quarter results despite lower realized pricing as volumes increase and the team continues to gain operating efficiencies. As many of you already know, we're the largest North American metals recycler processing and consuming ferrous scrap and non- ferrous aluminum, copper and other metals. The team continues to effectively lever the strength of our circular manufacturing model, benefiting both our steel and metals recycling operations and shortly also our aluminum flat rolled operations. Our steel fabrication team achieved strong operating income of $181 million in the second quarter, slightly higher than first quarter sequential results. Earnings were supported with an 11% increase in shipments more than compensating for a 5% reduction in realized pricing. Our joists and deck backlog extends to the fourth quarter of 2024. Infrastructure Inflation Reduction Act, DOE, decarbonization support and manufacturing onshoring are expected to increase domestic fixed asset investment and in turn related flat and long product steel consumption and joists and deck in consumption later this year and in the coming years. A reminder, as we construct the aluminum facilities, non-capitalizable expenses are required to flow through SG&A until startup, so you'll see increased costs in this line item until we start operations mid-2025. This amount was $19 million in the second quarter. Our supplemental schedule provides visibility as a separate aluminum segment. We estimate that average similar costs of approximately $25 million per quarter will occur through the first half of 2025. We have expectations to be EBITDA positive in the second half of 2025 for our aluminum investments with plans to initially ramp with industrial type products, as we qualify our can sheet and automotive products. We expect to be operating the rolling mill at approximately 75% of its capability for the full year 2026 and full thereafter. Mark is going to provide more details related to our ramp and product mix expectations for aluminum investments later on the call, as well as our differentiated cost expectations. The construction of the aluminum rolling mill and the San Luis Potosi recycled slab center is going extremely well. We want to reaffirm the total project costs at $2.7 billion of which $1.5 billion has already been invested through June of 2024. For the remainder of 2024, we expect to invest another $900 million in the aluminum investments. And finally, in 2025, the remaining $250 million. Our cash generation continues to be strong based on our differentiated circular business model and highly variable cost structure. During the second quarter of 2024, we generated cash flow from operations of $383 million. Inventories were moderately higher in the quarter as we increased product ahead of our new value-added flat roll coding lines. Additionally, estimated tax payments were $273 million in the quarter, representing a 23% cash tax rate for the first half of the year. We ended the quarter with strong liquidity of $2.7 billion, comprised of cash and short-term investments of $1.5 billion and our fully available unsecured revolver of $1.2 billion for 2024. We believe total capital investments will be in the range of $2 billion of which we have already funded $793 million this year. In February, we increased our quarterly cash dividend 8% to $0.46 per common share, continuing our positive dividend profile as through cycle cash flow grows. We also repurchased $607 million of our common stock in 2024, representing 3% of our outstanding shares. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes high return strategic growth with shareholder distributions, comprised of a base positive dividend profile that's complimented with a variable share repurchase program. While we remain dedicated to preserving our investment grade credit designation. Our free cash flow profile has fundamentally changed over the last five years from an annual average of $540 million to currently $2.9 billion, excluding our large strategic sentence in aluminum investments. In July, we successfully issued $600 million of 5.375% investment grade notes with 10-year tenure. The proceeds will be used for general purposes and anticipation of repaying our $400 million notes due December, 2024. We are very pleased with the transaction. We thank those who invested. Lastly, sustainability is a significant part of our long-term value creation strategy. In that regard, we remain excited about our joint venture with Aymium, a leading producer of renewable biocarbon products. We believe our first joint venture facility, which we plan to start commissioning late in the fourth quarter to decrease our steel Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 35%. We uniquely have an actionable path towards carbon neutrality that is more manageable and we believe is considerably less expensive than may lay ahead for many of our industry peers. Our sustainability and carbon reduction strategy is an ongoing journey and we're moving forward with the intention to make a positive difference. Finally, for those of you on the call that track categories of our flat rolled steel shipments, in the second quarter, we shipped hot-rolled and P&O of 1,004,000 tons, cold rolled products of 124,000 tons and coated products of 1,245,000 tons. Barry? Tristan, you're correct. So for the second quarter, we were basically breakeven from an EBITDA perspective. And so there's very high expectations for the second half of the year as it relates to Sinton. So yes, the balance sheet does have extra capacity for leverage. As you know, ahead of large projects, organic projects, specifically like Sinton at just under $2 billion and now the aluminum investments at $2.7 billion. We like to be a little more conservative with the balance sheet and build cash in advance of those investments so that we can make sure that we still have optionality for growth if there would be a downturn, because we like to have that optionality, you tend to get better value and better valuations and return in a weaker demand environment. So there is room on the balance sheet. And that's why we've been able to actually stay consistent and grow the shareholder distributions during these high-growth period, which is very important to us and we think is very beneficial to the shareholders as well. So we -- you will likely see us continue -- well, you will see us continue with our strong shareholder distributions. There are other opportunities for growth. There are some organic opportunities that the teams are talking about, they're not nearly at the size or scope of aluminum at Sinton, but they are absolutely beneficial differentiating high return, et cetera. In addition to that, we do believe that there could be some optionality in transactions. We're very particular. We're very disciplined as it relates to acquisitions, ensuring that there is an appropriate valuation and return for Steel Dynamics. So you do see us being more disciplined than some others in the industry. But that being said, we think that there will be some opportunities along those lines as well. So I would just say more of the same, yet at the same time, we understand that the balance sheet is there to use. I would just add to that, that we have -- there's a very extensive both demand draw and plan in place for 2025 and 2026 purposely with a numerous number of customers that have already indicated volumes that they would have available to us, for all of the industrial for the automotive and for the can sheet. So it's a very robust commercial dialogue that we're having, and we feel very confident in having the ability to market those materials in the interim. No. For the 2026, Alex, that's not the exit rate. That's for the full year. The exit rate would be close to full capacity in 2026. Carlos, we can't be specific about that. I would tell you that from a historical basis, it's very strong on a go-forward basis, and there has been stabilization in pricing and specifically around the joist products and the decking products as well. So that's all the color we can give you. I apologize. None of it related to really the aluminum mill at this point in time because we're still constructing and as it relates to the San Luis Potosi slab center they're just getting ready to kind of start maybe building some scrap reserves in anticipation of slab production in the first quarter of 2025. As it relates to the build, there has -- there was a structural increase in inventories related to the four value added lines as we were putting substrate in front of those lines in anticipation of ramping them up during this period of time. And so there will still be some increase as Sinton ramps up the second half of the year structurally, but there is also availability of inventory reduction at the long product steel mills and some of the other areas. So I would expect to see working capital not be a significant draw in the second half of the year, but rather potentially be either not neutral or a funding source. The biggest part of the moving cash flow was really our estimated tax payments in the quarter. We're very comfortable with our cash flow generation capability at this point in time, given what we can see, there's no expectation of changing our capital allocation policy for the remainder of the year."

            "content": "Thank you, Theresa. Our steel fabrication operations performed well in the second quarter, achieving strong earnings and steady volume aligned with first quarter results. The market segments that we participate in influence the mix of joist deck that we engineer for each job. Our team's ability to engineer and manufacture the best solution for each segment remains a core strength. Our steel fabrication order backlog remains at a healthy level, not extending through the end of the year. We continue to have high expectations for the business, continued onshoring and manufacturing, continue with infrastructure spending and fixed asset investment related to the IRA programs should provide momentum for additional construction spending later this year and through 2025. Our steel fabrication platform provides meaningful volume support for our steel operations, critical and softer demand environments allowing for higher through-cycle utilization compared to our peers, but also helps to mitigate the financial risk of lower steel prices. Our metals recycling operations improved earnings in the second quarter, as increased demand for North American steel producers supported higher ferrous scrap volume, more than compensating for the challenging price environment. We believe ferrous scrap prices have stabilized and should remain relatively stable through the rest of the year subject to seasonal moves. The North American geographic footprint of our metals recycling platform provides a strategic competitive advantage for our steel mills and for our scrap generating customers. In particular, our Mexican recycling locations competitively advantaged our Columbus and Sinton raw material positions. They also strategically support increased procurement of aluminum scrap for our future flat rolled aluminum operations. Our metals recycling team is partnering even more closely with both our steel and aluminum teams to expand scrap separation capabilities through both process and technology solutions. This will help mitigate potential prime ferrous scrap supply issues in the future. It will also provide us with a significant advantage to materially increase the recycled content in our aluminum flat rolled products and increase our earnings potentials. Field team had a solid quarter, achieving shipments of 3.2 million tons. During the second quarter of 2024, the domestic steel industry operated at an estimated production utilization rate of 78%, while our steel mills operated at a rate of 81%. We consistently operate at higher utilization rates due to our value added steel product diversification, our differentiated customer supply chain solutions in the support of our internal manufacturing businesses. The higher through cycle utilization of our steel mills is a key competitive advantage, supporting our strong and growing cash generation capability and best-in-class financial metrics. Our realized steel pricing declined across product portfolios as prices weakened throughout second quarter. However, value-added flat rolled steel pricing spreads remained very resilient during the same time frame, supporting our earnings as we already are the largest producer of these products in North America. And we are growing with the new addition of four coating lines with 1.1 million tons of additional capacity. Underlying demand remains steady, but customers remain hesitant to place orders due to the continuing decline of scrap prices throughout the quarter. Additionally, a surge in steel imports put pressure on the supply dynamics. However, order activity has increased over the last month, especially within the last several weeks, stabilizing our lead times, we believe this is the bottom ranch for pricing with positive moves in the future. The Sinton steel team continues to make improvements in operating efficiency and consistency. We are planning for setting to see additional improvements in production and profitability as the team took two different four day outages during the second quarter to, among other things, resolved the transform limitations we have previously discussed. The outages were necessary to install the necessary additional safety circuits and restore our electrical capacity, which will now allow us to access 100% of our the melting capacity versus the previous 80%. Also, the additional two new value line -- coating lines that's in were successfully commissioned and have commenced operations with great success, improving the mill's value added product mix and improving the operating efficiency of the facility. The additional alliance will support increased volume and margins as we head through this year. Regarding the steel market environment, North America automotive production estimates for 2024 recently revised was strong 16 million units, with continued growth expected in '25 and 2026. This forecast is based on demand resilience of stronger production results as supply chain constraints continue to dissipate. Automotive dealer inventories also continue to remain below historical norms despite the recent cyber disruptions. Non-residential construction remained stable with slowdowns across some building types due to hesitancy around higher interest rates. Additionally, onshoring and infrastructure spending should provide further meaningful support to fixed asset investment and related construction oriented projects in the coming years. As for the energy market, the sole industry continues to grow and keep oil and gas activity steady. However, increasing OTCG and line pipe imports created a challenging second quarter environment for the domestic producers. Looking forward, we are optimistic regarding steel demand and pricing dynamics for 2024. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mark. On the outage front out in Sinton, the work we had to do take place in the high-voltage switchyard. So we bring in transmission voltage in Texas. We're the only facility in the state of Texas that actually brings in 345,000 volts. So in the early April outages, we put the concrete down it's necessary to support the equipment and made bus modifications. And as the equipment arrived, there's a protocol of both testing the equipment, pressurizing it, safely bringing it to a position where we're ready to turn it on. And during that process required us to they have the high voltage also shut off. So as we actually got the equipment fully on-site, fully installed and now turned on the equipment, there's a series of outage that comes along with that. And we kind of identified the kind of the key steps in the process. So we did have a slight delay with the hurricane situation in South Texas. And just out of prudence, we decided to make sure we weren't in the process of messing with our high-voltage system when we add hurricane winds. So we're in a much better place now. We're very comfortable that we've addressed the root cause. We put in some new safety gear that works in the electrical world, and that's as deep as I can go into it myself, I'm mechanical guy. But we're confident that we're positioned now to really fully utilize the power in the furnace. And the teams are practice-wise are up to speed. So we do see this as a big key step in getting even more productivity out of the plant. We're very confident that the products that we offer out of site, as Mark spoke, we had to get new technology to be able to respond to the customer base in that region. We're selling quite a bit of tons into Mexico. And a lot of these tons are heavier, higher strength steels where we find more value, and there are also products that the market needs in that region. So we've been welcomed across the different market segments with the abilities that we brought to the table there. So we do see the market being receptive to having a regional supplier. As you know, the import action in that area is particularly different. It's heightened versus the rest of the country. And so to have a local supply chain of high-value products is welcome right now for the customer base. And when I say regional, that's Mexico, we're a few short hours truck right in the Monterrey. So we continue to see good response, good results down there. And we're being very judicious with our time. We know we will develop new products in the future. But right now, we have a very good offering. And with the new value lines, both painted and galvanized capability, we're able to really penetrate further into the markets where there wasn't local providers before. So we remain really bullish on what the capability in the market is to absorb high-value tons from a regional source. We don't see the trade dynamics changing with Mexico in the short-term. There is an effort, of course, to stop the surge, and there's been recent activity in the 232. We anticipate that the products that we're currently moving into Mexico will continue to move that way. There is a shortage in the Mexican market because of other outages that are in Mexico. So we'll continue to take advantage of opportunities where it makes sense. And as we look at the total capacity, we -- like most things, as a steel plant, it's not a light switch, we just turn on. So as we look towards growing through the second half of the year, we believe as we look at the second half, we're going to achieve those utilization rates."

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised this call is being recorded today, April 24, 2024, and your participation implies consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree to these terms, please disconnect.\n At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to David Lipschitz, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nDavid Lipschitz: Thank you, Matthew. Good morning, and welcome to Steel Dynamics First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded and will be available on our website for replay later today. Leading today's call are Mark Millett, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Steel Dynamics; Theresa Wagler, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Barry Schneider, President and Chief Operating Officer. The other members of our senior leadership team are joining us on the call individually.\n Some of today's statements, which speak only as of this date, may be forward-looking and predictive, typically preceded by believe, expect, anticipate or words of similar meaning. They are intended to be protected by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 should actual results turn out differently.

You will also find any referenced non-GAAP financial measures reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the press release issued yesterday entitled Steel Dynamics Reports First Quarter 2024 Results.\n Now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mark. \nMark Millett: Super. Thanks, David, and good morning, everybody. It's good to be with you for our first quarter '24 earnings call today. Once again, our teams achieved a strong first quarter financial and operational performance. \n Quarterly steel shipments was a near-record 3.3 million tons. The team successfully began operating our 4 new value-added flat rolled steel coating lines, which adds about 1.1 million tons of higher-margin product diversification to our portfolio. The Sinton team continues to make significant headway hitting record milestones and achieving positive EBITDA for the quarter, with significant improvements on the way. And we're also making fast progress on our aluminum flat rolled investments. There continues to be strong commercial support for a new and innovative supply chain solution provided by Steel Dynamics, as we are a well-known and highly regarded metals producer. \n And financially, the team continues to excel. They consistently achieve superior financial metrics and best-in-class return on invested capital. It's a product of the passionate can-do performance-driven culture and our high-margin value-added growth strategy. A stark and persuasive indicator of the effectiveness of our business model is our relative EBITDA per employee generation, which is substantially higher than any of our competition.\n I'm incredibly proud of the Steel Dynamics team. They are the foundation of our company, and they drive our success, and I'm proud to stand among them. They are special and we're focused on providing the very best for their health, safety and welfare. We're actively engaged in safety at all times and at every level of our company, keeping safety top of mind and an active conversation each and every day. Despite excellent safety performance compared to industry peers, there's more to do. We will not rest until we consistently achieve our goal of 0 injuries.\n With that, Theresa, would you like to give us some color on the quarter? \nTheresa Wagler: Thanks, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I add my sincere thanks to our teams for another strong performance. Our first quarter 2024 net income was $584 million or $3.67 per diluted share, with adjusted EBITDA of $879 million.\n First quarter 2024 revenue of $4.7 billion was 11% higher than sequential fourth quarter results, supported by strong volume and higher realized selling values across the steel platform. Our first quarter operating income of $751 million was 45% higher than fourth quarter results, driven by steel metal spread expansion, especially within our flat-rolled operations.\n A quick note, as we construct the aluminum facilities, noncapitalizable expenses are required to flow through SG&A until startup. So you will see increased costs in that line item as we start operations mid-2025. In the first quarter, that additional amount was about $14 million.\n As we discuss our business this morning, we see positive industry fundamentals for 2024 and beyond, and we're focused toward our continued transformational growth initiatives. Our Sinton, Texas flat-rolled steel division operated close to 70% of capacity for the quarter, and, as Mark said, generated positive earnings. Our steel operations generated strong operating income of $675 million in the first quarter, supported by near-record shipments and increased realized product pricing.\n For those of you who track flat-rolled products by type, in the first quarter, hot-rolled shipments were 1.62 million tons, cold-rolled shipments were 130,000 tons and coated shipments were 1.220 million tons. Operating income from our metals recycling operations was $23 million, significantly higher than sequential fourth quarter results as increased domestic steel demand supported higher volumes.\n As many of you already know, we're the largest North American metals recycler, processing and consuming ferrous scrap and nonferrous aluminum, copper and other metals. The team continues to effectively lever the strength of our circular manufacturing model, benefiting both our steel and metals recycling operations as well as shortly, our aluminum flat-rolled operations.\n Our steel fabrication segment achieved strong operating income of $178 million in the first quarter, lower than sequential fourth quarter results due to weather impacted and seasonally lower shipments and metal spread compression as realized pricing declined and steel raw material input cost increased.\n Our joist and deck backlog extends through the third quarter 2024 with strong forward pricing, and pricing has stabilized at historically strong levels during the quarter. Infrastructure Inflation Reduction Act and DOE decarbonization support and manufacturing onshoring are expected to increase domestic fixed asset investments later this year and into next year, which will support our steel operations and our fabrication business.\n Our cash generation continues to be strong based on our differentiated circular business model and highly variable cost structure. During the first quarter of 2024, we generated cash flow from operations of $355 million, which was reduced by an annual company-wide profit sharing contribution of $265 million.\n We ended the quarter with strong liquidity of $3.1 billion. For 2024, we believe full year capital investments will be in the range of $2 billion, of which approximately $1.4 billion relates to our aluminum flat-rolled investments and $175 million toward our biocarbon facility.\n In February, we increased our cash dividend 8% to $0.46 per common share, continuing our increasing dividend profile as through-cycle cash flow grows. We also repurchased $298 million of our common stock, representing 1.5% of our outstanding shares.\n At March 31, $1.1 billion remained available for our share repurchases under our new $1.5 billion plan. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes high-return strategic growth with shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that's complemented with a variable share repurchase program.\n While we remain dedicated to preserving our investment-grade credit designation, our free cash flow profile has fundamentally changed over the last 5 years from an annual average of $540 million from 2011 to 2015 to currently $2.9 billion. We've strategically placed ourselves in a position of strength to have a sustainable capital foundation that provides the opportunity for meaningful strategic growth and strong shareholder returns, while maintaining investment-grade metrics. \n We believe our track record proves itself with an average 3-year after-tax return on invested capital of 32%, clearly a best-in-class performance across industries. We're squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable optimized long-term value creation. Sustainability is also a significant part of our long-term value creation strategy, and we're dedicated to our people, our communities and our environment. We're committed to operating our business with the highest integrity.\n In that regard, we remain excited about our joint venture with Aymium, a leading producer of renewable biocarbon products. We believe our first joint venture facility, which we plan to start operating late in the fourth quarter, could decrease our steel Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 35%. We have an actionable path toward carbon neutrality that is more manageable and, we believe, considerably less expensive than they lay ahead for many of our industry peers.\n Our sustainability and carbon reduction strategy is an ongoing journey, and we're moving forward with the intention to make a positive difference. We plan to continue to address these matters and continue our leadership role moving forward. Barry? \nBarry Schneider: Thanks, Theresa. Our steel fabrication operations performed well in the first quarter, achieving strong earnings. At the end of the first quarter, our steel joist and deck order backlog was solid, extending through the third quarter of 2024. Additionally, current pricing has stabilized at historically high levels during the first quarter. We continue to have high expectations for the business. Continued onshoring of manufacturing, coupled with infrastructure spending and fixed asset investment related to the IRA programs, should provide momentum for additional construction spending later this year and through 2025.\n Our fabrication platform provides meaningful volume support for our steel mills, critical and softer demand environments, allowing for higher through-cycle steel utilization compared to our peers. It also helps mitigate the financial risk of lower steel prices.\n Our metals recycling operations improved earnings in the first quarter as increased demand from North American steel producers supported higher ferrous scrap volume and the team continues to grow our volume and recycled aluminum in advance of starting our new aluminum flat-rolled operations. The North American geographic footprint of our metals recycling platform provides a strategic competitive advantage for our steel mills and for our scrap-generating customers.\n In particular, our Mexican recycling operations competitively advantaged our Columbus and Sinton raw material positions. They also strategically support increased procurement of aluminum scrap for our future flat-rolled aluminum operations. \n Our metals recycling team is partnering even more closely with both our steel and aluminum teams to expand scrap separation capabilities through process and technology solutions. This will help mitigate potential prime ferrous scrap supply issues in the future. It will also provide us with a significant advantage to materially increase the recycled content in our aluminum flat rolled products and increase our earnings opportunities. \n The steel team had a strong quarter, achieving near-record shipments of 3.3 million tons. During the first quarter of 2024, the domestic steel industry operated at an estimated production utilization rate of 77%, while our steel mills operated at 87%. We consistently operated higher utilization rates due to our value-added steel product diversification, our differentiated customer supply chain solutions and the support of our internal manufacturing businesses.\n The higher through-cycle utilization of our steel mills is a key competitive advantage, supporting our strong and growing cash generation capability and best-in-class financial metrics. Our realized steel pricing improved across our product portfolios.\n However, flat rolled prices weakened early in the first quarter before recovering in March and April. Value-add flat-rolled steel pricing spreads were incredibly resilient, actually expanding during the same time frame. Underlying demand remains steady, but customers are managing to a lower inventory level, which can cause some volatility in spot prices.\n As order activity increased quarter-over-quarter, our steel backlogs also improved nicely from December to March across the platform. As for Sinton, the team continues to make significant improvements in operating efficiency and consistency. They averaged around 70% of capability for the quarter, breaking monthly utilization records across the lines in March. We are planning for Sinton to see additional improvements in production as the team took several maintenance days in April.\n Among other things, in the outage, we resolved certain transformer limitations, which will allow us to access 100% of our melting capacity versus the previous 80%. Also, the additional 2 new value-added coating lines were successfully commissioned and have commenced operations with excellent results. These additional lines will support increased volume and margins as we head through this year.\n Regarding the steel market environment, North American automotive production estimates for 2024 were recently revised higher to just over 16 million units with continued growth expected in 2025 and 2026. This improved forecast is based on demand resilience and stronger production results as supply chain constraints continue to dissipate across the automotive supply chain.\n Automotive dealer inventories are also continuing to remain below historical norms. Nonresidential construction remained solid as supported by the increased sequentially quarterly order activity and shipments at our Structural and Rail division. Additionally, onshoring and infrastructure spending should provide further meaningful support to fixed asset investment and related construction-oriented projects in the coming years.\n As for the energy markets, the solar industry continues to grow and oil and gas activity is steady. However, increasing OCTG and line pipe imports created a challenging first quarter environment for the domestic producer. Looking forward, we are optimistic regarding steel demand and pricing demand for 2024. \nMark Millett: Thanks, Barry. Thanks, Theresa. Well, consistently strong through-cycle operating and financial performance continues to support our cash generation and growth investment strategies. As mentioned, the 4 value-add flat-rolled steel coating lines are now online and in various modes of startup. And certainly, the line in Sinton was an absolute unqualified success. The team has done a phenomenal job there. And Sinton should see a step function improvement in operations and profitability as those 2 new lines ramp up after the April maintenance, which occurred actually 2 weeks ago, and that's -- they're up and running again. \n The aluminum strategy, our growth is especially compelling. Responses from existing and new customers across all markets remains incredible and only strengthening as we move forward. We are currently in discussions with numerous customers who wish to locate on site with us and this co-location strategy provides a sustainably competitive model for all of us, conserving time, money and reducing emissions across the supply chain. And this model has already proven itself tremendously successful in Sinton. \n And to just sort of review the project itself, 650,000 metric tons of aluminum flat roll capability in Columbus, Mississippi, the state-of-the-art plant, it has served the sustainable beverage and packaging sector, automotive and industrial markets as well. The roughly 300,000 metric tons a year of can stock, about 200,000 tons of auto and 150,000 tons of industrial and construction. \n Actually at the site in Columbus, we'll have a metal cast slab capacity of around 600,000 metric tons and that will be supported by 2 satellite facilities, one out west around Gila Bend and one in Central Mexico, which are located in scrap-rich regions. We can capture the scrap, turn it into the cast slab and transport it very, very effectively and cost efficiently to the mill itself. Expanded the project scope to include additional scrap processing and treatment to maximize aluminum recycled content. The metals recycling team has also developed a commercially viable sorting solution at volume for 5000 and 6000 series aluminum scrap, which represents an incredible competitive advantage for us.\n Our startup plans have not changed. The rolling mill should be operating mid-2025, the Mexico Slab Center at the end of '24 and then Arizona mid-'25. The total project cost, including the recycled slab centers remains at $2.7 billion. And with virtually all equipment and construction contracts complete, we feel confident in the expected amount of investment. \n We also are confident that it will add around about $650 million to $700 million of through-cycle annual EBITDA plus an initial $40 million to $50 million from the Omni platform as well. The investment premise, if you think about it, the market environment is similar to the domestic steel industry when we started SDI 30 years ago.\n They have older assets, they've had difficulty earning their cost of capital. So there's been a little reinvestment, heavy legacy costs, inefficient and operations are typically high cost. And also a significant aluminum flat-rolled supply deficit exists in North America, which is expected to grow. And this will be the first time we've ever entered a market where there's a supply/demand gap, pretty positive for us, for sure. \n We have business alignment and we can leverage our core competencies of construction and operational know-how. We can lever Omni's recycling footprint. As many of you know, we're the largest aluminum scrap recycler in North America. And again, we are developing some pretty exciting new separation technologies. So it's going to be cost effective. It's a very, very high-return growth for us. \n Moving on, learn passion, I think, by our future growth plans, as they will continue to drive the high-return growth momentum we have consistently demonstrated over the years. We have the highest, most recent 5-year average after-tax return on invested capital within the S&P 500 materials companies. And in the most recent 3 years, we have had an average of after-tax return on invested capital of 32%, which I think is a stunning number and an affirmation of the ability of all our team.\n Our disciplined and intentional growth strategy, focused on differentiated value-added supply chain solutions, has provided sustainable and growing cash generation. And we'll continue to do so in the future. So I'm incredibly optimistic moving forward. \n I believe the market dynamics are in place to support increased demand across our operating platforms in '24. North America will benefit from continued onshoring of manufacturing businesses. And the U.S. will benefit from the allocation of public monies from the infrastructure program, the Inflation Reduction Act and other public programs. Steel Dynamics is levered to benefit from those programs through increased steel joist and deck demand, flat and long product steel demand and the associated higher demand for recycled scrap and aluminum.\n As I said earlier, our teams are our foundation. I thank each and every one of them for their passion and their dedication. We are committed to them, and I remind those listening today, the safety for yourselves, your families and each other is our highest priority. Our culture and business model continue to positively differentiate our performance, leading to best-in-class operating and financial metrics.\n We're no longer a simple steel company. We're an industrial metals business providing enhanced supply chain solutions to numerous industries that are essential to global economies. This differentiation and diversification mitigates cash generation volatility in all market cycles, as we've just seen in this past quarter. We are competitively positioned and continue to focus on providing superior value for our companies, for our customers, team members and shareholders alike, and we look forward to creating new opportunities for all of us today in the many years ahead.\n With that said, Matthew, could you open the line up for questions, please? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Martin Englert from Seaport Research Partners. \nMartin Englert: Within steel, conversion costs appear to have declined a bit quarter-on-quarter. Taking into account Sinton's continued to ramp up and substrate costs going into 2Q, would you anticipate a comparable reduction in the current quarter? \nTheresa Wagler: Martin, the way that you and others are able to actually calculate what you call conversion costs is a little bit difficult. But yes, with the increasing production at Sinton, which we expect to continue to improve into the second quarter and the second half of the year, you will see that the additional volume will help compress costs across the spectrum, but product mix is also something that you need to take into consideration when you think about flat versus long. But we would expect to see that the conversion rate, as you calculate it, would continue to reduce. I can't speak to the exact magnitude thereof. \nOperator: Your next question is coming from Curt Woodworth from UBS. . \nCurtis Woodworth: A couple of questions on the greenfield aluminum project. Can you kind of give us a time line on where -- when you think you could get to more of an EBITDA breakeven level on the facility and what type of utilization rate you think you would need to achieve that?\n And then can you speak to what level of commercial commitments or arrangements that you've been able to achieve at this point? And then just lastly, I saw you kept the CapEx guidance flat at $2.7 billion, but obviously, there's been some concern just around general inflationary pressures. But do you feel -- are you seeing any upward pressure on the CapEx number? And are you pretty confident on keeping that number at $2.7 billion going forward? \nMark Millett: I'll go backwards. That's the easier way. From a CapEx standpoint, as I mentioned in my sort of preliminary thoughts, virtually everything is now contracted out. We did, and you saw here some months ago, we did bump it up to that $2.7 billion with the knowledge of some inflationary pressures. Those are all baked in to that $2.7 billion, and we see no expansion on that number going forward. \n From a commercial arrangement perspective, we've been working, obviously, with the major sort of beer can or the beverage can consumers. We've been working with automotive as well. And we're pretty confident that we have the ability to match our customer demand with the ramp-up curve.\n And as we also mentioned, operations should start mid-'25. There will be some qualifications early on. But we're confident that we can match the demand from those customers with that start-up ramp. From a standpoint of EBITDA breakeven, I would imagine that from the end of the year, I would hope we are in that position. \nCurtis Woodworth: Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on fabrication. Last quarter, you talked about order entry improving and pricing continues to be stable. But obviously, there's still downward pressure in the business. Can you just give us a sense for maybe volumetrically, how you see things performing into 2Q?\n I know 1Q is always seasonally weak, and there was some weather-related disruption, but do you think you can get close to getting back to positive growth in fabrication? And then just in joist and deck in general, can you give us a sense for maybe how those products fit into some of these federal programs in terms of the CHIPS Act, IRA battery plants? Do you see any new sources of growth that could mitigate what's been somewhat of an air pocket on the warehouse side? \nMark Millett: Yes. I guess the -- from our perspective, and I will let Theresa and Barry chip in here in a little bit, but from a shipment standpoint in Q4 and early Q1, shipments kind of leveled off at pre-COVID levels. We've seen some general seasonality and there's some regional weather impacts here and there.\n But booking rates increased in March and are up again meaningfully in April. Backlogs are around about 6 months. So we personally consider that to be kind of a volume trough, and we think things are going to move up volume-wise in the second quarter into the rest of the year. And I think the thing to emphasize there's only been slight quarter-over-quarter price erosion.\n And so for that to -- or that market strength to be there, I think it confirms our thesis that there's been a paradigm shift in through-cycle spreads. And I think we've got a very, very, very constructive view of the long-term prospects for fabrication. \nTheresa Wagler: I think something that I would point out in addition to what Mark said. If you look at -- and take into consideration that volumes are, to Mark's point, at a pre-COVID level, but earnings were still, from an operating income perspective, about over $1,200 per ton.\n If you looked historically in a very strong market, that number might have been $150 to $200 per ton. So structurally, there has been a significant difference, and it is proving out the theory that we had that there's a structural shift. \n Barry, maybe you want to talk a little bit about how the programs actually go into the public dollars. \nBarry Schneider: A lot of these public the CHIPS Act and the IRA Act, there's a lot of work that has to happen upfront. And once those projects are -- owners are identified and engineering companies are identified, that's when this starts flowing into all the steel products, but specifically, when we look at the joist and deck, once it's a concrete kind of a plan on what's going to be built, the time line is actually pretty quick.\n So when those orders start to be in place, it's typically in a kind of a 3- to 6-month window, when they start shipping. So we're encouraged by what we hear, what we communicate through the general contractors, the fabricators out in the marketplace. \n So again, we have a good reason to believe the second half of the year fills up nicely with these projects, as they start moving from conceptual phase to actually enter in construction phases. \nOperator: Your next question is coming from Carlos De Alba from Morgan Stanley. \nCarlos de Alba: Just maybe continuing with the discussion. The long steel volumes declined quite sharply or meaningfully year-on-year. Can you maybe provide more color as to the different end markets within construction and infrastructure, that may be leading to this decline? Clearly the backdrop for the coming years, for sure, is quite solid. But at least in the first quarter, the numbers just weren't there. So any color on the different construction markets would be great. \nMark Millett: Carlos, I would say, as you look at the mix across line products, as we make sections that are lighter sections, that's more responsive to what the marketplace is right now. So we've had a pretty robust level of order input. And Structural and Rail has performed pretty well.\n We tend to balance between our rail production and our structural production. And I think in general, I would say the market space has changed from one of where a lot of more fabricators were directly going to mills to more of a service center type relationship. And that's, again, a more historical way to go into the market, after the busy years for the last several years with construction spending. So we see a good response from our customer base, and we have healthy backlogs in our long products right now. \nCarlos de Alba: And if I may ask another one on the aluminum project. Have you been able to already secure contracts with some of your customers, or that's still undergoing in terms of discussions with them? \nMark Millett: Carlos, that's still under discussion. Obviously, it's a -- we're a new mill. And so there's a balance between them making sure that they feel confident that the volume is going to be there. But as I said earlier, we have commitments in place that will support -- in large part, support the first 12 to 18 months of our ramp-up. \nOperator: Your next question is coming from Timna Tanners from Wolfe Research. \nTimna Tanners: I'm going to ask Carlos' question a different way, if you don't mind, on the long product side. The volumes, as I see them, were sharply down from last year and the year-ago period in the first quarter. So I guess, it sounds like from the answer, you're still seeing quite strong demand. So I guess should we expect that this was a blip and that maybe there were some weather-related reasons and the rest of the year could be more consistent with past years? Or is there something that's changed in your outlook for the long products across structures, bars, those -- all those divisions would be really helpful. \nMark Millett: Well, I think it's, in large part, some of the seasonality and just the weather-related issues, Timna. The -- and you saw some price adjustment here in the marketplace, whatever that was, 2 months ago? 6 weeks, 8 weeks ago. And again, that wasn't necessarily market pressure that was just absorbing sort of some discounting that leaked into the marketplace over the prior month, 2 months. We feel confident moving forward for the rest of the year in that space. \nTimna Tanners: Okay. So maybe particularly challenging first quarter and rest of the year looks solid, it sounds like. All right. And then my other question, if I could, was just if you could remind us about the cadence of contribution from the 4 new lines, the paint lines and the galv lines, and how to think about increasing volume and profitability would be great. \nBarry Schneider: Yes, Timna, the -- all 4 of the process lines at this point have actually run product. We staged the start-up to best utilize our teams and also to really focus on improving the start-up process for the other lines. So a paint line in Terre Haute is up and running well, shipping prime product. We expect that, that ramps up through second quarter, third quarter, getting up closer and closer to what the final production will be.\n On the converse, the new galvanizing line down in Sinton actually started up very well. It started up in January and is solidly contributing at a very high rate already, which, as Mark said, the team has done a fabulous job getting that line making quality like that so quickly. We have an all hands on deck approach. So all the other mills are supporting the team.\n And we're continually moving people through to keep the energy high. So I see the second galvanizing line in Terre Haute coming up Q2 into more operational status and progressing to the end of the year, the paint line through Q2 through Q3 at Terre Haute. And then the new paint line in Sinton, Texas will actually be maturing to the end of the year. So all 4 units will be contributing soundly in second quarter, and progressing through the third, fourth quarter. \nOperator: Your next question is coming from Katja Jancic from BMO Capital Markets. \nKatja Jancic: On Sinton, can you provide a bit more color how we should think about the utilization rates in the rest of the year? \nBarry Schneider: As we had talked, we're about 70% through first quarter. We did take some time for a significant outage in April that was planned to, among other things, address the power problem we had with the primary side voltage at the plant. So we see a really good path to 80% progressing through operational by the end of the year, getting up in the capacity.\n In front of us, we see better and better performance, routine performance every day. So as the team encounters challenges, they work through them quicker. And through all this, they remain a very safe operation, which is so important during start-up. So the team is in place, the new assets will allow us to provide the best mix possible upstream so that the efficiency of the plant can really be explored further. So we continue to be very robust on where we're going and the success of the team. \nKatja Jancic: Maybe I missed this, but was there a power issue during the first quarter? \nBarry Schneider: We had talked about the primary side power last year and having some transformers that needed to be replaced. And that equipment has very long lead times. Our team was able to secure some shorter-term solutions that we've engineered into place and done the construction. So now that the outage is over, we could put that equipment in with the power off. We look to bring the new transformer support, so that the plant has full operational capacity. \n We've been internally limited at about 80% of the power capability on the melting furnaces. So at this point now, this will help us remove that restriction. When it's finally utilized, it will be somewhere between now and the end of May. But this April outage was key to give us the opportunity to get the construction done to work on the high-voltage bus. It requires the whole plant to be -- have the power off. So again, great work happening. It's unfortunate. These are long-lead-time items. And we've remedied the situation that we believe contributed to it. So we're very excited this problem will be behind us here shortly. \nOperator: Your next question is coming from Lawson Winder from Bank of America. \nLawson Winder: Mark, Theresa, Barry, thank you for today's update. Could you share with us your views on the CRC, HRC spreads that have been quite robust recently? What are your thoughts on what's driving that? And I know you don't like to guide to pricing, but what are your -- I'll try this one and ask what your thoughts are on what that might look like going forward? \nMark Millett: I will start. I would just reiterate what I've always said in past calls. Coated products are gaining more and more market share just generally. And there are some pretty dynamic changes within the marketplace that is even added to that. If you think about the solar market, which is absolutely huge, huge today. You're consuming around about 25 tons of coated product per megawatt. \n And again, we're selling Nextracker and a whole bunch of folks. I think we're something like 300,000 tons a year or thereabouts or even higher into that marketplace. And that's coated flat roll, people turn that into tubes for the support structure of solar. So there are more and more applications being served by coated products today. It's a tight market, and it's supporting the higher spread. \nBarry Schneider: I'd like to add to that, Mark, too, that the teams have been diversifying our coated profile. So we have many different kinds of coatings that we offer. And those various product lines provide a very good supply solution to our customers. So the whole supply chain has been maturing for these products, and it allows us to move our tons to balance our production needs as well as where the markets are interesting.\n So, we continue to believe that the spreads between coated and hot roll are -- will be attractive. And it's an area where we've really invested quite a bit of money over the last several years to make sure we have the right capabilities at our disposal and the right supply chain solutions for what the customers are asking for. \nLawson Winder: Maybe if I could just ask a follow-up on your -- you've provided some commentary on fabrication order backlog and then the pricing on that and indicated it was above pre-COVID levels. Maybe if I could just try to get a little bit more color on that. Would it be fair to say that pricing in your new bookings and backlog, at least, are converging to some level, and perhaps ask how that might compare to 2023 levels? \nTheresa Wagler: Lawson, I don't think that we're talking about comparing to 2023 levels. I don't know if you were speaking specifically about pricing, if you are speaking about volume. But the pricing that's in the backlog and the current spot pricing that we have, they are converging, to your point, which would be expected as pricing stabilizes. \nOperator: Your next question is coming from Tristan Gresser from BNP Paribas. \nTristan Gresser: Yes. Maybe a quick follow-up just on the fab business. It was my understanding we should have seen some further moderation in ASP in Q2. You talk about the backlog stability and forward pricing, et cetera. So is this still the base case that we should see another leg down in Q2, before we stabilize? \nTheresa Wagler: Tristan, this is Theresa. We're not specifically giving guidance on any of our segments from an earnings perspective. We don't do that, but I'll talk to you about certain levers. So, we do expect, as Mark said earlier, and you would see this normally, but we will have higher volumes, both across fabrication steel and mills recycling, as we move through the year, which is generally the case in the second, third quarter environment as you move out of the seasonality into stronger demand periods.\n So we absolutely expect to see that. There's also the potential for additional support that we believe will be there as it relates to the public funding, probably more specifically in the second half of the year and then even more impactful, at least in my opinion, in 2025, which will help provide demand -- fixed asset demand-driven increases in volumes. As it relates to the pricing and fabrication, we said that the change or the differential in pricing should start to diminish as it's been stabilized, really it starts stabilizing in middle of the fourth quarter and certainly remains so in kind of January, March, February -- sorry, January, February, March time frame. \n So you need to take a view on that price differential that we've kind of just helped explain. And then on the steel input costs. So they keep about 8 weeks -- probably about 8 weeks of inventory, principally flat rolled on the ground. So as that pricing has changed in the first quarter, those input costs will move into the second quarter as well. \nTristan Gresser: Okay, that's really helpful. And maybe another question on the situation in Mexico. You kind of have a unique perspective there, you sell quite some volumes in the country, you're building in the country, but you're also a U.S. steel producer first.\n So I mean, the situation, the U.S., Mexico situation kind of worsened a bit on the trade front, talks of tariffs, retaliation. So what's your view on the latest development? Do you believe that the situation could worsen? And what are kind of your options if it does happen? \nMark Millett: Well, today, we haven't seen any, I don't believe, Barry, any direct impact to our business. We grew substantial market share in Mexico last year. We shipped, I think, 600,000 tons or so down there. I think it's more of a wait-and-see situation. It's sort of a tit for tat going back and forth. But I think again, just as you saw with the U.S. MCA some years ago, the U.S. and Mexico are huge trading partners, and these things get worked out. \nTristan Gresser: All right. That's clear. And maybe just the last one. You mentioned in your outlook in your prepared remarks that you expect lower imports. Can you discuss that a little bit? And there have been some discussion at the high level between the U.S. and Europe of potential carbon-based tariffs. Do you believe that's still on the table and that could potentially materialize depending on who is the next president in the United States? \nBarry Schneider: Well, I think our position on the carbon border adjustment mechanisms, we don't see any meaningful change in American policy. There definitely is a lot of interest in Europe and the EU will continue to go forward with their plans. After the election, we would expect that there will be some kind of a united front to find out how to keep trading with Europe. We do believe that's a good thing for us as these develop, particularly with our incredibly low sustainability position. So we have a great position to lead into these kind of tariffs.\n We do see certain coated products moving into the country that are concerning. And as we address those through our downstream distribution and our customer base, we are aware of where certain products are moving in the country. And we do see certain areas where it's elevated. And we're doing our best to respond to that competitive challenge, as other economies kind of flush towards us when they get soft where they are. So, we're always monitoring it. There are solutions we'll look at, but we take that on a day-by-day basis. \nOperator: Your next question is coming from Will Peterson from JPMorgan. \nWilliam Peterson: Nice job on the quarterly execution. I wanted to talk about some of the reshoring trends but -- and also the data center buildout. You've obviously seen a big uptick in data center. But on the same side, we've seen, obviously, warehouses continue to kind of remain negative. So I guess the question is, what is the typical steel intensity you see of data centers? And how does that opportunity compare to a warehouse opportunity, again, since that's kind of normalized here recently? \nBarry Schneider: Bill, this is Barry. I think each project is so different. There's a lot of variables. And we provide materials to all these different types of projects. So depending on what the owner is looking for, where the data center might be located, that will affect the steel intensity. \n But generally, the packages aren't wildly different than warehousing. And it really depends on where they're going to go and who's designing it. So that flexibility in providing the way we look at lots of different general contractors and lots of different engineering firms, we have solutions for each of them. \n So as they go, they might be -- maybe think of it maybe it's a less steel-intensive job, but it might have more design work involved. And the opposite may be true where it's a straightforward design work in bigger tons. So it's really a broad spectrum across these different projects. So depending on each one, it's really hard to say. \n But it is definitely an area where there continues to be interest because of the artificial intelligence, all the thoughts about what's going to be needed for that cloud computing. And so we remain very interested in there, trying to provide good solutions to the various stakeholders who are building those facilities. \nWilliam Peterson: Okay. So I guess it just really depends on the project. If I could ask a second question maybe to Theresa. So CapEx came in a bit lower than expected. But I guess, how should we think about the cadence of CapEx through the remainder of the year, presumably to reach the $2 billion number you've provided in the past? \nTheresa Wagler: Yes. The biggest chunk of capital will relate to, obviously, the aluminum investment. And we would expect to see those tick up in the second and third quarter, as equipment continues to arrive and they hit certain milestones. So you should see the bulk of that additional CapEx or remaining CapEx being in the second and the third quarter, probably about equal and then probably go down to about the same level you saw in the first quarter and the fourth quarter. \nOperator: Your next question is coming from John Tumazos from John Tumazos Very Independent Research. \nJohn Tumazos: I see that you're not staggering the 3 aluminum slab melt shops, with 1 or 2 of them to follow. Does that mean that you have a lot of customers pent up already for the aluminum rolling mill and that you're concerned that you need the raw material because it might sell out fast?\n Or is Mexico slab mill getting sequenced first because your scrap collection is very advanced in Mexico? And is there a concern that it might take a little longer to develop the scrap flow in Arizona and Mississippi? \nMark Millett: Well, I wish it was all absolute strategic, but some of it is just luck or bad luck, John. But firstly, the satellite mills will -- or slab plants will be pretty well focused on UBC. And so the Columbus mill itself will have to produce the 5000, 6000 automotive stuff and some of the industrial stuff.\n So the Columbus mill shop, at least 1 or 2 of the furnaces will come up reasonably early. We're focused on SLP or the Mexican facility, to be honest, because that one, the property was purchased first. Everything went incredibly well. The permitting went incredibly well. And it just is in line. Our property in Arizona, to be honest, had some initial permitting, I would say, slowdown. I mean it's just a bureaucracy delay that delayed that facility by several months. \nJohn Tumazos: So it's fair to be lucky than smart. \nMark Millett: I've been -- I won't tell you the language my dad used some time ago, but he called me a lucky critter, let's just put it that way. And I've been lucky all my life, and you need luck in life. So -- and the biggest luck I have is being surrounded by a phenomenal team, to be honest. So... \nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for any closing remarks. \nMark Millett: Super. Thank you, Matthew, and thank you for those that remain on the call and even greater thanks for those that support us, our shareholders. For us, hopefully, we've articulated that we have a very, very constructive near term on the markets, the start-up at Sinton and other sort of growth opportunities, the 4 lines. \n I think what makes us even more excited, to be honest, is just a long-term competitive position. We are the -- one of the most efficient lowest-cost producers in the world. We have a very balanced, I think, product portfolio and a very balanced kind of circular manufacturing profile. So we've got a lot of pull-through volume from our downstream from fabrication and from our conversion plants.\n So -- and that amounts to about 2 million tons a year today. So the pull-through volume is very, very strong. It allows us for that -- the higher and more uniform cash generation through-cycle. I think Barry said we were at 87% utilization when the industry was at 77%. And that's been a historical norm for us. And I believe the -- our position in -- from a sustainability carbon footprint perspective is a huge, huge advantage. \n And I don't believe everyone understands it. Our flat roll mills are reportedly and not us reporting it, but our automotive -- European automotive manufacturers are suggesting that our 2 current mills, Butler and Columbus, are likely the lowest carbon footprint of any sheet producers in the world, and Texas is going to be somewhat similar. So that's allowing us to gain huge market traction, certainly in automotive. We actually have more interest than we can support today in that arena. And if you look at the fact that we're already here and the rest of the world is spending billions and billions of dollars to get to where we are. \n And recent discussions with a couple of different European companies suggested to us that just their conversion from blast furnace to sort of electric arc furnace and the DRI facilities. It's likely going to increase the conversion cost by $200, $250 a ton. And if you think about where that puts us on the global cost curve, we will be absolutely at the very bottom, and it's a very envious position to be.\n But most importantly, long term, we would suggest that it supports much higher through-cycle spreads. We've seen it in recent years, that's going to continue. Our earnings are going to be positively impacted by it. So incredibly excited for SDI going forward.\n  for those, again, employees on the call, thank you, each and every one of you for everything you do each and every day. We can't be here doing what we do without you. And you all put in a tremendous quarter and truly sort of punctuated the positive combination of culture and technology in creating the best financial metrics of any steel company, I think, in the world.\n Thanks to our customers. Again, we can't do it without you and our service providers and everyone else, just thank you for your support. Have a great day. \nOperator: Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation, and have a great and safe day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mark Millett",
            "content": "Super. Thanks, David, and good morning, everybody. It's good to be with you for our first quarter '24 earnings call today. Once again, our teams achieved a strong first quarter financial and operational performance. \n Quarterly steel shipments was a near-record 3.3 million tons. The team successfully began operating our 4 new value-added flat rolled steel coating lines, which adds about 1.1 million tons of higher-margin product diversification to our portfolio. The Sinton team continues to make significant headway hitting record milestones and achieving positive EBITDA for the quarter, with significant improvements on the way. And we're also making fast progress on our aluminum flat rolled investments. There continues to be strong commercial support for a new and innovative supply chain solution provided by Steel Dynamics, as we are a well-known and highly regarded metals producer. \n And financially, the team continues to excel. They consistently achieve superior financial metrics and best-in-class return on invested capital. It's a product of the passionate can-do performance-driven culture and our high-margin value-added growth strategy. A stark and persuasive indicator of the effectiveness of our business model is our relative EBITDA per employee generation, which is substantially higher than any of our competition.\n I'm incredibly proud of the Steel Dynamics team. They are the foundation of our company, and they drive our success, and I'm proud to stand among them. They are special and we're focused on providing the very best for their health, safety and welfare. We're actively engaged in safety at all times and at every level of our company, keeping safety top of mind and an active conversation each and every day. Despite excellent safety performance compared to industry peers, there's more to do. We will not rest until we consistently achieve our goal of 0 injuries.\n With that, Theresa, would you like to give us some color on the quarter? Thanks, Barry. Thanks, Theresa. Well, consistently strong through-cycle operating and financial performance continues to support our cash generation and growth investment strategies. As mentioned, the 4 value-add flat-rolled steel coating lines are now online and in various modes of startup. And certainly, the line in Sinton was an absolute unqualified success. The team has done a phenomenal job there. And Sinton should see a step function improvement in operations and profitability as those 2 new lines ramp up after the April maintenance, which occurred actually 2 weeks ago, and that's -- they're up and running again. \n The aluminum strategy, our growth is especially compelling. Responses from existing and new customers across all markets remains incredible and only strengthening as we move forward. We are currently in discussions with numerous customers who wish to locate on site with us and this co-location strategy provides a sustainably competitive model for all of us, conserving time, money and reducing emissions across the supply chain. And this model has already proven itself tremendously successful in Sinton. \n And to just sort of review the project itself, 650,000 metric tons of aluminum flat roll capability in Columbus, Mississippi, the state-of-the-art plant, it has served the sustainable beverage and packaging sector, automotive and industrial markets as well. The roughly 300,000 metric tons a year of can stock, about 200,000 tons of auto and 150,000 tons of industrial and construction. \n Actually at the site in Columbus, we'll have a metal cast slab capacity of around 600,000 metric tons and that will be supported by 2 satellite facilities, one out west around Gila Bend and one in Central Mexico, which are located in scrap-rich regions. We can capture the scrap, turn it into the cast slab and transport it very, very effectively and cost efficiently to the mill itself. Expanded the project scope to include additional scrap processing and treatment to maximize aluminum recycled content. The metals recycling team has also developed a commercially viable sorting solution at volume for 5000 and 6000 series aluminum scrap, which represents an incredible competitive advantage for us.\n Our startup plans have not changed. The rolling mill should be operating mid-2025, the Mexico Slab Center at the end of '24 and then Arizona mid-'25. The total project cost, including the recycled slab centers remains at $2.7 billion. And with virtually all equipment and construction contracts complete, we feel confident in the expected amount of investment. \n We also are confident that it will add around about $650 million to $700 million of through-cycle annual EBITDA plus an initial $40 million to $50 million from the Omni platform as well. The investment premise, if you think about it, the market environment is similar to the domestic steel industry when we started SDI 30 years ago.\n They have older assets, they've had difficulty earning their cost of capital. So there's been a little reinvestment, heavy legacy costs, inefficient and operations are typically high cost. And also a significant aluminum flat-rolled supply deficit exists in North America, which is expected to grow. And this will be the first time we've ever entered a market where there's a supply/demand gap, pretty positive for us, for sure. \n We have business alignment and we can leverage our core competencies of construction and operational know-how. We can lever Omni's recycling footprint. As many of you know, we're the largest aluminum scrap recycler in North America. And again, we are developing some pretty exciting new separation technologies. So it's going to be cost effective. It's a very, very high-return growth for us. \n Moving on, learn passion, I think, by our future growth plans, as they will continue to drive the high-return growth momentum we have consistently demonstrated over the years. We have the highest, most recent 5-year average after-tax return on invested capital within the S&P 500 materials companies. And in the most recent 3 years, we have had an average of after-tax return on invested capital of 32%, which I think is a stunning number and an affirmation of the ability of all our team.\n Our disciplined and intentional growth strategy, focused on differentiated value-added supply chain solutions, has provided sustainable and growing cash generation. And we'll continue to do so in the future. So I'm incredibly optimistic moving forward. \n I believe the market dynamics are in place to support increased demand across our operating platforms in '24. North America will benefit from continued onshoring of manufacturing businesses. And the U.S. will benefit from the allocation of public monies from the infrastructure program, the Inflation Reduction Act and other public programs. Steel Dynamics is levered to benefit from those programs through increased steel joist and deck demand, flat and long product steel demand and the associated higher demand for recycled scrap and aluminum.\n As I said earlier, our teams are our foundation. I thank each and every one of them for their passion and their dedication. We are committed to them, and I remind those listening today, the safety for yourselves, your families and each other is our highest priority. Our culture and business model continue to positively differentiate our performance, leading to best-in-class operating and financial metrics.\n We're no longer a simple steel company. We're an industrial metals business providing enhanced supply chain solutions to numerous industries that are essential to global economies. This differentiation and diversification mitigates cash generation volatility in all market cycles, as we've just seen in this past quarter. We are competitively positioned and continue to focus on providing superior value for our companies, for our customers, team members and shareholders alike, and we look forward to creating new opportunities for all of us today in the many years ahead.\n With that said, Matthew, could you open the line up for questions, please? I'll go backwards. That's the easier way. From a CapEx standpoint, as I mentioned in my sort of preliminary thoughts, virtually everything is now contracted out. We did, and you saw here some months ago, we did bump it up to that $2.7 billion with the knowledge of some inflationary pressures. Those are all baked in to that $2.7 billion, and we see no expansion on that number going forward. \n From a commercial arrangement perspective, we've been working, obviously, with the major sort of beer can or the beverage can consumers. We've been working with automotive as well. And we're pretty confident that we have the ability to match our customer demand with the ramp-up curve.\n And as we also mentioned, operations should start mid-'25. There will be some qualifications early on. But we're confident that we can match the demand from those customers with that start-up ramp. From a standpoint of EBITDA breakeven, I would imagine that from the end of the year, I would hope we are in that position. Yes. I guess the -- from our perspective, and I will let Theresa and Barry chip in here in a little bit, but from a shipment standpoint in Q4 and early Q1, shipments kind of leveled off at pre-COVID levels. We've seen some general seasonality and there's some regional weather impacts here and there.\n But booking rates increased in March and are up again meaningfully in April. Backlogs are around about 6 months. So we personally consider that to be kind of a volume trough, and we think things are going to move up volume-wise in the second quarter into the rest of the year. And I think the thing to emphasize there's only been slight quarter-over-quarter price erosion.\n And so for that to -- or that market strength to be there, I think it confirms our thesis that there's been a paradigm shift in through-cycle spreads. And I think we've got a very, very, very constructive view of the long-term prospects for fabrication. Carlos, I would say, as you look at the mix across line products, as we make sections that are lighter sections, that's more responsive to what the marketplace is right now. So we've had a pretty robust level of order input. And Structural and Rail has performed pretty well.\n We tend to balance between our rail production and our structural production. And I think in general, I would say the market space has changed from one of where a lot of more fabricators were directly going to mills to more of a service center type relationship. And that's, again, a more historical way to go into the market, after the busy years for the last several years with construction spending. So we see a good response from our customer base, and we have healthy backlogs in our long products right now. Carlos, that's still under discussion. Obviously, it's a -- we're a new mill. And so there's a balance between them making sure that they feel confident that the volume is going to be there. But as I said earlier, we have commitments in place that will support -- in large part, support the first 12 to 18 months of our ramp-up. Well, I think it's, in large part, some of the seasonality and just the weather-related issues, Timna. The -- and you saw some price adjustment here in the marketplace, whatever that was, 2 months ago? 6 weeks, 8 weeks ago. And again, that wasn't necessarily market pressure that was just absorbing sort of some discounting that leaked into the marketplace over the prior month, 2 months. We feel confident moving forward for the rest of the year in that space. I will start. I would just reiterate what I've always said in past calls. Coated products are gaining more and more market share just generally. And there are some pretty dynamic changes within the marketplace that is even added to that. If you think about the solar market, which is absolutely huge, huge today. You're consuming around about 25 tons of coated product per megawatt. \n And again, we're selling Nextracker and a whole bunch of folks. I think we're something like 300,000 tons a year or thereabouts or even higher into that marketplace. And that's coated flat roll, people turn that into tubes for the support structure of solar. So there are more and more applications being served by coated products today. It's a tight market, and it's supporting the higher spread. Well, today, we haven't seen any, I don't believe, Barry, any direct impact to our business. We grew substantial market share in Mexico last year. We shipped, I think, 600,000 tons or so down there. I think it's more of a wait-and-see situation. It's sort of a tit for tat going back and forth. But I think again, just as you saw with the U.S. MCA some years ago, the U.S. and Mexico are huge trading partners, and these things get worked out. Well, I wish it was all absolute strategic, but some of it is just luck or bad luck, John. But firstly, the satellite mills will -- or slab plants will be pretty well focused on UBC. And so the Columbus mill itself will have to produce the 5000, 6000 automotive stuff and some of the industrial stuff.\n So the Columbus mill shop, at least 1 or 2 of the furnaces will come up reasonably early. We're focused on SLP or the Mexican facility, to be honest, because that one, the property was purchased first. Everything went incredibly well. The permitting went incredibly well. And it just is in line. Our property in Arizona, to be honest, had some initial permitting, I would say, slowdown. I mean it's just a bureaucracy delay that delayed that facility by several months. I've been -- I won't tell you the language my dad used some time ago, but he called me a lucky critter, let's just put it that way. And I've been lucky all my life, and you need luck in life. So -- and the biggest luck I have is being surrounded by a phenomenal team, to be honest. So... Super. Thank you, Matthew, and thank you for those that remain on the call and even greater thanks for those that support us, our shareholders. For us, hopefully, we've articulated that we have a very, very constructive near term on the markets, the start-up at Sinton and other sort of growth opportunities, the 4 lines. \n I think what makes us even more excited, to be honest, is just a long-term competitive position. We are the -- one of the most efficient lowest-cost producers in the world. We have a very balanced, I think, product portfolio and a very balanced kind of circular manufacturing profile. So we've got a lot of pull-through volume from our downstream from fabrication and from our conversion plants.\n So -- and that amounts to about 2 million tons a year today. So the pull-through volume is very, very strong. It allows us for that -- the higher and more uniform cash generation through-cycle. I think Barry said we were at 87% utilization when the industry was at 77%. And that's been a historical norm for us. And I believe the -- our position in -- from a sustainability carbon footprint perspective is a huge, huge advantage. \n And I don't believe everyone understands it. Our flat roll mills are reportedly and not us reporting it, but our automotive -- European automotive manufacturers are suggesting that our 2 current mills, Butler and Columbus, are likely the lowest carbon footprint of any sheet producers in the world, and Texas is going to be somewhat similar. So that's allowing us to gain huge market traction, certainly in automotive. We actually have more interest than we can support today in that arena. And if you look at the fact that we're already here and the rest of the world is spending billions and billions of dollars to get to where we are. \n And recent discussions with a couple of different European companies suggested to us that just their conversion from blast furnace to sort of electric arc furnace and the DRI facilities. It's likely going to increase the conversion cost by $200, $250 a ton. And if you think about where that puts us on the global cost curve, we will be absolutely at the very bottom, and it's a very envious position to be.\n But most importantly, long term, we would suggest that it supports much higher through-cycle spreads. We've seen it in recent years, that's going to continue. Our earnings are going to be positively impacted by it. So incredibly excited for SDI going forward.\n  for those, again, employees on the call, thank you, each and every one of you for everything you do each and every day. We can't be here doing what we do without you. And you all put in a tremendous quarter and truly sort of punctuated the positive combination of culture and technology in creating the best financial metrics of any steel company, I think, in the world.\n Thanks to our customers. Again, we can't do it without you and our service providers and everyone else, just thank you for your support. Have a great day."

            "name": "Theresa Wagler",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I add my sincere thanks to our teams for another strong performance. Our first quarter 2024 net income was $584 million or $3.67 per diluted share, with adjusted EBITDA of $879 million.\n First quarter 2024 revenue of $4.7 billion was 11% higher than sequential fourth quarter results, supported by strong volume and higher realized selling values across the steel platform. Our first quarter operating income of $751 million was 45% higher than fourth quarter results, driven by steel metal spread expansion, especially within our flat-rolled operations.\n A quick note, as we construct the aluminum facilities, noncapitalizable expenses are required to flow through SG&A until startup. So you will see increased costs in that line item as we start operations mid-2025. In the first quarter, that additional amount was about $14 million.\n As we discuss our business this morning, we see positive industry fundamentals for 2024 and beyond, and we're focused toward our continued transformational growth initiatives. Our Sinton, Texas flat-rolled steel division operated close to 70% of capacity for the quarter, and, as Mark said, generated positive earnings. Our steel operations generated strong operating income of $675 million in the first quarter, supported by near-record shipments and increased realized product pricing.\n For those of you who track flat-rolled products by type, in the first quarter, hot-rolled shipments were 1.62 million tons, cold-rolled shipments were 130,000 tons and coated shipments were 1.220 million tons. Operating income from our metals recycling operations was $23 million, significantly higher than sequential fourth quarter results as increased domestic steel demand supported higher volumes.\n As many of you already know, we're the largest North American metals recycler, processing and consuming ferrous scrap and nonferrous aluminum, copper and other metals. The team continues to effectively lever the strength of our circular manufacturing model, benefiting both our steel and metals recycling operations as well as shortly, our aluminum flat-rolled operations.\n Our steel fabrication segment achieved strong operating income of $178 million in the first quarter, lower than sequential fourth quarter results due to weather impacted and seasonally lower shipments and metal spread compression as realized pricing declined and steel raw material input cost increased.\n Our joist and deck backlog extends through the third quarter 2024 with strong forward pricing, and pricing has stabilized at historically strong levels during the quarter. Infrastructure Inflation Reduction Act and DOE decarbonization support and manufacturing onshoring are expected to increase domestic fixed asset investments later this year and into next year, which will support our steel operations and our fabrication business.\n Our cash generation continues to be strong based on our differentiated circular business model and highly variable cost structure. During the first quarter of 2024, we generated cash flow from operations of $355 million, which was reduced by an annual company-wide profit sharing contribution of $265 million.\n We ended the quarter with strong liquidity of $3.1 billion. For 2024, we believe full year capital investments will be in the range of $2 billion, of which approximately $1.4 billion relates to our aluminum flat-rolled investments and $175 million toward our biocarbon facility.\n In February, we increased our cash dividend 8% to $0.46 per common share, continuing our increasing dividend profile as through-cycle cash flow grows. We also repurchased $298 million of our common stock, representing 1.5% of our outstanding shares.\n At March 31, $1.1 billion remained available for our share repurchases under our new $1.5 billion plan. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes high-return strategic growth with shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that's complemented with a variable share repurchase program.\n While we remain dedicated to preserving our investment-grade credit designation, our free cash flow profile has fundamentally changed over the last 5 years from an annual average of $540 million from 2011 to 2015 to currently $2.9 billion. We've strategically placed ourselves in a position of strength to have a sustainable capital foundation that provides the opportunity for meaningful strategic growth and strong shareholder returns, while maintaining investment-grade metrics. \n We believe our track record proves itself with an average 3-year after-tax return on invested capital of 32%, clearly a best-in-class performance across industries. We're squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable optimized long-term value creation. Sustainability is also a significant part of our long-term value creation strategy, and we're dedicated to our people, our communities and our environment. We're committed to operating our business with the highest integrity.\n In that regard, we remain excited about our joint venture with Aymium, a leading producer of renewable biocarbon products. We believe our first joint venture facility, which we plan to start operating late in the fourth quarter, could decrease our steel Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 35%. We have an actionable path toward carbon neutrality that is more manageable and, we believe, considerably less expensive than they lay ahead for many of our industry peers.\n Our sustainability and carbon reduction strategy is an ongoing journey, and we're moving forward with the intention to make a positive difference. We plan to continue to address these matters and continue our leadership role moving forward. Barry? Martin, the way that you and others are able to actually calculate what you call conversion costs is a little bit difficult. But yes, with the increasing production at Sinton, which we expect to continue to improve into the second quarter and the second half of the year, you will see that the additional volume will help compress costs across the spectrum, but product mix is also something that you need to take into consideration when you think about flat versus long. But we would expect to see that the conversion rate, as you calculate it, would continue to reduce. I can't speak to the exact magnitude thereof. I think something that I would point out in addition to what Mark said. If you look at -- and take into consideration that volumes are, to Mark's point, at a pre-COVID level, but earnings were still, from an operating income perspective, about over $1,200 per ton.\n If you looked historically in a very strong market, that number might have been $150 to $200 per ton. So structurally, there has been a significant difference, and it is proving out the theory that we had that there's a structural shift. \n Barry, maybe you want to talk a little bit about how the programs actually go into the public dollars. Lawson, I don't think that we're talking about comparing to 2023 levels. I don't know if you were speaking specifically about pricing, if you are speaking about volume. But the pricing that's in the backlog and the current spot pricing that we have, they are converging, to your point, which would be expected as pricing stabilizes. Tristan, this is Theresa. We're not specifically giving guidance on any of our segments from an earnings perspective. We don't do that, but I'll talk to you about certain levers. So, we do expect, as Mark said earlier, and you would see this normally, but we will have higher volumes, both across fabrication steel and mills recycling, as we move through the year, which is generally the case in the second, third quarter environment as you move out of the seasonality into stronger demand periods.\n So we absolutely expect to see that. There's also the potential for additional support that we believe will be there as it relates to the public funding, probably more specifically in the second half of the year and then even more impactful, at least in my opinion, in 2025, which will help provide demand -- fixed asset demand-driven increases in volumes. As it relates to the pricing and fabrication, we said that the change or the differential in pricing should start to diminish as it's been stabilized, really it starts stabilizing in middle of the fourth quarter and certainly remains so in kind of January, March, February -- sorry, January, February, March time frame. \n So you need to take a view on that price differential that we've kind of just helped explain. And then on the steel input costs. So they keep about 8 weeks -- probably about 8 weeks of inventory, principally flat rolled on the ground. So as that pricing has changed in the first quarter, those input costs will move into the second quarter as well. Yes. The biggest chunk of capital will relate to, obviously, the aluminum investment. And we would expect to see those tick up in the second and third quarter, as equipment continues to arrive and they hit certain milestones. So you should see the bulk of that additional CapEx or remaining CapEx being in the second and the third quarter, probably about equal and then probably go down to about the same level you saw in the first quarter and the fourth quarter."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Barry Schneider",
            "content": "Thanks, Theresa. Our steel fabrication operations performed well in the first quarter, achieving strong earnings. At the end of the first quarter, our steel joist and deck order backlog was solid, extending through the third quarter of 2024. Additionally, current pricing has stabilized at historically high levels during the first quarter. We continue to have high expectations for the business. Continued onshoring of manufacturing, coupled with infrastructure spending and fixed asset investment related to the IRA programs, should provide momentum for additional construction spending later this year and through 2025.\n Our fabrication platform provides meaningful volume support for our steel mills, critical and softer demand environments, allowing for higher through-cycle steel utilization compared to our peers. It also helps mitigate the financial risk of lower steel prices.\n Our metals recycling operations improved earnings in the first quarter as increased demand from North American steel producers supported higher ferrous scrap volume and the team continues to grow our volume and recycled aluminum in advance of starting our new aluminum flat-rolled operations. The North American geographic footprint of our metals recycling platform provides a strategic competitive advantage for our steel mills and for our scrap-generating customers.\n In particular, our Mexican recycling operations competitively advantaged our Columbus and Sinton raw material positions. They also strategically support increased procurement of aluminum scrap for our future flat-rolled aluminum operations. \n Our metals recycling team is partnering even more closely with both our steel and aluminum teams to expand scrap separation capabilities through process and technology solutions. This will help mitigate potential prime ferrous scrap supply issues in the future. It will also provide us with a significant advantage to materially increase the recycled content in our aluminum flat rolled products and increase our earnings opportunities. \n The steel team had a strong quarter, achieving near-record shipments of 3.3 million tons. During the first quarter of 2024, the domestic steel industry operated at an estimated production utilization rate of 77%, while our steel mills operated at 87%. We consistently operated higher utilization rates due to our value-added steel product diversification, our differentiated customer supply chain solutions and the support of our internal manufacturing businesses.\n The higher through-cycle utilization of our steel mills is a key competitive advantage, supporting our strong and growing cash generation capability and best-in-class financial metrics. Our realized steel pricing improved across our product portfolios.\n However, flat rolled prices weakened early in the first quarter before recovering in March and April. Value-add flat-rolled steel pricing spreads were incredibly resilient, actually expanding during the same time frame. Underlying demand remains steady, but customers are managing to a lower inventory level, which can cause some volatility in spot prices.\n As order activity increased quarter-over-quarter, our steel backlogs also improved nicely from December to March across the platform. As for Sinton, the team continues to make significant improvements in operating efficiency and consistency. They averaged around 70% of capability for the quarter, breaking monthly utilization records across the lines in March. We are planning for Sinton to see additional improvements in production as the team took several maintenance days in April.\n Among other things, in the outage, we resolved certain transformer limitations, which will allow us to access 100% of our melting capacity versus the previous 80%. Also, the additional 2 new value-added coating lines were successfully commissioned and have commenced operations with excellent results. These additional lines will support increased volume and margins as we head through this year.\n Regarding the steel market environment, North American automotive production estimates for 2024 were recently revised higher to just over 16 million units with continued growth expected in 2025 and 2026. This improved forecast is based on demand resilience and stronger production results as supply chain constraints continue to dissipate across the automotive supply chain.\n Automotive dealer inventories are also continuing to remain below historical norms. Nonresidential construction remained solid as supported by the increased sequentially quarterly order activity and shipments at our Structural and Rail division. Additionally, onshoring and infrastructure spending should provide further meaningful support to fixed asset investment and related construction-oriented projects in the coming years.\n As for the energy markets, the solar industry continues to grow and oil and gas activity is steady. However, increasing OCTG and line pipe imports created a challenging first quarter environment for the domestic producer. Looking forward, we are optimistic regarding steel demand and pricing demand for 2024. A lot of these public the CHIPS Act and the IRA Act, there's a lot of work that has to happen upfront. And once those projects are -- owners are identified and engineering companies are identified, that's when this starts flowing into all the steel products, but specifically, when we look at the joist and deck, once it's a concrete kind of a plan on what's going to be built, the time line is actually pretty quick.\n So when those orders start to be in place, it's typically in a kind of a 3- to 6-month window, when they start shipping. So we're encouraged by what we hear, what we communicate through the general contractors, the fabricators out in the marketplace. \n So again, we have a good reason to believe the second half of the year fills up nicely with these projects, as they start moving from conceptual phase to actually enter in construction phases. Yes, Timna, the -- all 4 of the process lines at this point have actually run product. We staged the start-up to best utilize our teams and also to really focus on improving the start-up process for the other lines. So a paint line in Terre Haute is up and running well, shipping prime product. We expect that, that ramps up through second quarter, third quarter, getting up closer and closer to what the final production will be.\n On the converse, the new galvanizing line down in Sinton actually started up very well. It started up in January and is solidly contributing at a very high rate already, which, as Mark said, the team has done a fabulous job getting that line making quality like that so quickly. We have an all hands on deck approach. So all the other mills are supporting the team.\n And we're continually moving people through to keep the energy high. So I see the second galvanizing line in Terre Haute coming up Q2 into more operational status and progressing to the end of the year, the paint line through Q2 through Q3 at Terre Haute. And then the new paint line in Sinton, Texas will actually be maturing to the end of the year. So all 4 units will be contributing soundly in second quarter, and progressing through the third, fourth quarter. As we had talked, we're about 70% through first quarter. We did take some time for a significant outage in April that was planned to, among other things, address the power problem we had with the primary side voltage at the plant. So we see a really good path to 80% progressing through operational by the end of the year, getting up in the capacity.\n In front of us, we see better and better performance, routine performance every day. So as the team encounters challenges, they work through them quicker. And through all this, they remain a very safe operation, which is so important during start-up. So the team is in place, the new assets will allow us to provide the best mix possible upstream so that the efficiency of the plant can really be explored further. So we continue to be very robust on where we're going and the success of the team. We had talked about the primary side power last year and having some transformers that needed to be replaced. And that equipment has very long lead times. Our team was able to secure some shorter-term solutions that we've engineered into place and done the construction. So now that the outage is over, we could put that equipment in with the power off. We look to bring the new transformer support, so that the plant has full operational capacity. \n We've been internally limited at about 80% of the power capability on the melting furnaces. So at this point now, this will help us remove that restriction. When it's finally utilized, it will be somewhere between now and the end of May. But this April outage was key to give us the opportunity to get the construction done to work on the high-voltage bus. It requires the whole plant to be -- have the power off. So again, great work happening. It's unfortunate. These are long-lead-time items. And we've remedied the situation that we believe contributed to it. So we're very excited this problem will be behind us here shortly. I'd like to add to that, Mark, too, that the teams have been diversifying our coated profile. So we have many different kinds of coatings that we offer. And those various product lines provide a very good supply solution to our customers. So the whole supply chain has been maturing for these products, and it allows us to move our tons to balance our production needs as well as where the markets are interesting.\n So, we continue to believe that the spreads between coated and hot roll are -- will be attractive. And it's an area where we've really invested quite a bit of money over the last several years to make sure we have the right capabilities at our disposal and the right supply chain solutions for what the customers are asking for. Well, I think our position on the carbon border adjustment mechanisms, we don't see any meaningful change in American policy. There definitely is a lot of interest in Europe and the EU will continue to go forward with their plans. After the election, we would expect that there will be some kind of a united front to find out how to keep trading with Europe. We do believe that's a good thing for us as these develop, particularly with our incredibly low sustainability position. So we have a great position to lead into these kind of tariffs.\n We do see certain coated products moving into the country that are concerning. And as we address those through our downstream distribution and our customer base, we are aware of where certain products are moving in the country. And we do see certain areas where it's elevated. And we're doing our best to respond to that competitive challenge, as other economies kind of flush towards us when they get soft where they are. So, we're always monitoring it. There are solutions we'll look at, but we take that on a day-by-day basis. Bill, this is Barry. I think each project is so different. There's a lot of variables. And we provide materials to all these different types of projects. So depending on what the owner is looking for, where the data center might be located, that will affect the steel intensity. \n But generally, the packages aren't wildly different than warehousing. And it really depends on where they're going to go and who's designing it. So that flexibility in providing the way we look at lots of different general contractors and lots of different engineering firms, we have solutions for each of them. \n So as they go, they might be -- maybe think of it maybe it's a less steel-intensive job, but it might have more design work involved. And the opposite may be true where it's a straightforward design work in bigger tons. So it's really a broad spectrum across these different projects. So depending on each one, it's really hard to say. \n But it is definitely an area where there continues to be interest because of the artificial intelligence, all the thoughts about what's going to be needed for that cloud computing. And so we remain very interested in there, trying to provide good solutions to the various stakeholders who are building those facilities."
